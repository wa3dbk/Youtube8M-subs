00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 greet you dear friends of me 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.700
 name is Alexander remind you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.720
 see the channel questions with kondachka and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.820
 today we are doing a little lat's play 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 review micro and krayzis 3 want to remind 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.300
 game 3 Nastusha crisis is not 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.610
 most demanding terms of graphics 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.489
 most probably beautiful let's say so 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 graphics plan 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.480
 Here on my gland she goes on full fu 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.420
 years performed the gum settings 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.420
 the moment that I write down on fraps now 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.039
 so there are some 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.469
 subsidence due to the fact that fraps 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.629
 works came to my 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.670
 be she and will not be sure of it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.820
 because football 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.190
 is there such a moment 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.980
 hear it won't hurt us with you for 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.339
 plunge into the game get involved in it 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.070
 fine the scope is very cool done 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.970
 above I liked everything now we 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 go through the game itself 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.070
 let's see throw away the graphics right away 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 So 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 smoothing as much as possible 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:29.550
 all the maximum click apply here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.240
 come back I have already passed a little 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.390
 the game is absolutely just a little bit here 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.610
 in order to understand how interesting it is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.040
 how well is it done in terms of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.880
 charts to do things properly 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.740
 this review and review 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.360
 inspection that's exactly crisis 3 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 I want to say that one is basically a sleigh and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.560
 gr itself is linear as 1 2 3 crisis 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 that is, you have no principle there 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.110
 possibility of some kind of running around 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.230
 do it yourself . 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.230
 on its currency but it does not interfere 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.750
 yes means in my gland still reminded 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:30.160
 those who do not know or . channel first time u 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:33.160
 my throat is 5 35-70 as sensible to 4 2 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.220
 gigahertz 8 gigabytes of RAM 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.049
 ddr3 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:44.680
 in this case ssd disk is installed 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:48.080
 it means the video card is 680 gtx from 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.360
 gifors companies reference us design 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.190
 allowing my system to spin 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.970
 This game will be which is similar to 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.240
 maximally hide so let's 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:05.480
 a little look at the very coffin 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:07.720
 well the edges of the graffiti can be seen right now 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.720
 by his 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.340
 to shoot 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.240
 I was given and the number of contributions 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.940
 money 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.940
 reward him today 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.200
 we will 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.630
 wallpaper 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.720
 let's see the whole schedule 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:06.100
 significant in this game thing on 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.190
 of course, once thought of a crisis, how 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.800
 genre is not a principle put some honest 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.470
 folder graphics plan computer games and 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.690
 which certainly cannot please and that 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.330
 he certainly gives hope that the way out 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:24.280
 3 crisis is exactly the same again 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.730
 certain 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.010
 okay little player graphics for 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:37.020
 future sith here nigan manufacturers 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.490
 Well, of course we are still at stake 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:45.300
 sound name is not afraid of the word 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:50.700
 consoles this is sony playstation 4 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.700
 720 too, of course 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.680
 I am sure the quality will be affected 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:01.690
 graphic component of computer 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.120
 games again i will say so my friends if 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.340
 evaluate logically with me a group with 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.330
 Perspective graphs complain u and hail 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:14.980
 the game is chic 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:17.980
 teach you polygons took a bitch 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.920
 the strongest are all but I probably donâ€™t 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.900
 fans of this genre of games that is, I 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.940
 love more in freedom of action right there 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.390
 only rai 3 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.500
 same gta 4 but my point of view 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.690
 can't be she 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.140
 some kind of objectively this is just fate 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.860
 my opinion I do not pretend to 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.240
 one hundred percent approval 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.210
 you my dear subscribers 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.099
 simple again you will replace why you 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.289
 top played why are you sky player 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.270
 I won here just because 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:52.380
 see how well done 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.990
 the graphics are awesome here but no more 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.180
 of you from the missions themselves so that they are 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.199
 I'm probably interested in husbands already 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:08.910
 old for you 1 Well here's the first business 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:10.470
 I of course in one breath passed like 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.289
 I have a game here I am talking here only 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:17.120
 started playing and maybe show what 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.120
 there are still cool on the street 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.990
 in the following mini 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.990
 gameplay stuff 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.290
 Yes, I want to see 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.610
 so you on the frame under my system 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.460
 you asked that both can be some 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.960
 system to play in mosul 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.060
 maximum settings without catching the crisis 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.820
 my friends shook about that system 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.680
 which you can remove and become even can 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.980
 put more video card 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:02.620
 n back 675 same force or 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.620
 7950 kind of can already ride comfortably 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.439
 will it be normal to pull without sagging 

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:09.349
 below 30 fps 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:13.099
 what am I seeing now 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:16.860
 lower threshold at 32 all top there 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:18.739
 depending on the stand when it comes to 100 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.689
 see from power 

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:24.869
 sags again, 32 is the minimum 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:29.489
 I have seen there is still course and 

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:30.659
 the fraps program itself she is definitely 

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:35.989
 eats 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:37.949
 resource and and gives full probably 

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:39.330
 display the number of frames that 

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:43.210
 laid down 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.650
 can display this video like this but 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:48.160
 long I will not focus my attention 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:51.940
 because a bunch of reviews are thicker than the gameplay and 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.819
 to wish an alloy like this 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.160
 opinion came out the game crisis 3 friends we 

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:59.440
 you were alexander rose from cards 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.000
