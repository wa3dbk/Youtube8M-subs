water<00:02:26.840> that's<00:02:27.830> again<00:02:28.160> where<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.519> TDS<00:02:28.970> meter

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
water that's again where the TDS meter

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.190 
water that's again where the TDS meter
will<00:02:29.480> come<00:02:29.660> in

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
will come in

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.910 
will come in
the<00:02:30.500> more<00:02:30.800> stages<00:02:31.330> really<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.630> about<00:02:33.020> how<00:02:33.470> poor

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the more stages really is about how poor

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.370 
the more stages really is about how poor
your<00:02:34.730> water<00:02:35.030> quality<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.660> coming<00:02:36.020> out<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.260> your

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
your water quality is coming out of your

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.910 
your water quality is coming out of your
tap

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
tap

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.180 
tap
some<00:02:37.310> people<00:02:37.640> need<00:02:37.940> extra<00:02:38.630> stages<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.739> get

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
some people need extra stages to get

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.240 
some people need extra stages to get
their<00:02:40.880> lower<00:02:41.120> water<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:42.080> zero<00:02:42.560> that's<00:02:43.099> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
their lower water to zero that's the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.150 
their lower water to zero that's the
ultimate<00:02:43.400> goal<00:02:43.700> here<00:02:44.060> your<00:02:44.930> tap<00:02:45.319> water<00:02:45.349> has<00:02:46.130> a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
ultimate goal here your tap water has a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.570 
ultimate goal here your tap water has a
certainty<00:02:46.819> vf3<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:48.140> higher<00:02:48.440> higher<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.459> is

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
certainty vf3 the higher higher it is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.780 
certainty vf3 the higher higher it is
the<00:02:50.270> higher<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:51.020> total<00:02:51.380> dissolve<00:02:51.709> salt<00:02:51.950> so

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
the higher the total dissolve salt so

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.470 
the higher the total dissolve salt so
you<00:02:53.360> could<00:02:53.690> need<00:02:53.989> extra<00:02:54.800> stages<00:02:55.100> okay<00:02:55.819> so<00:02:56.060> show

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
you could need extra stages okay so show

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.120 
you could need extra stages okay so show
me<00:02:56.510> what<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.750> stage<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.260> all<00:02:57.500> right<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.800> state

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
me what a stage is all right so a state

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.400 
me what a stage is all right so a state
or<00:02:58.340> an<00:02:58.459> RA<00:02:58.610> unit<00:02:58.760> yeah<00:02:59.390> let's<00:02:59.660> take<00:02:59.810> this<00:02:59.989> unit

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
or an RA unit yeah let's take this unit

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.880 
or an RA unit yeah let's take this unit
for<00:03:00.590> instance<00:03:00.980> yeah<00:03:02.260> move<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.500> out<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.709> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
for instance yeah move this out of the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.140 
for instance yeah move this out of the
way<00:03:05.830> here's<00:03:06.830> your<00:03:07.040> stage<00:03:07.630> one<00:03:08.630> two<00:03:09.410> three<00:03:10.370> four

way here's your stage one two three four
five<00:03:11.780> six<00:03:12.470> each<00:03:13.430> container<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.900> stage<00:03:16.810> it's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
five six each container is a stage it's

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.160 
five six each container is a stage it's
a<00:03:17.900> sixth<00:03:18.380> stage<00:03:18.620> hundred<00:03:19.459> gallon<00:03:19.760> per<00:03:19.910> day

a sixth stage hundred gallon per day

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.259 
a sixth stage hundred gallon per day
okay<00:03:21.170> now<00:03:21.560> let's<00:03:22.400> take<00:03:22.610> each<00:03:22.880> stage

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
okay now let's take each stage

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.690 
okay now let's take each stage
individually<00:03:24.170> our<00:03:24.200> first<00:03:24.680> stage<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.549> your

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
individually our first stage is your

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.870 
individually our first stage is your
pre-filter<00:03:26.390> that's<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.650> sediment<00:03:28.280> there<00:03:28.640> the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
pre-filter that's the sediment there the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.289 
pre-filter that's the sediment there the
polypropylene<00:03:29.810> cartridge<00:03:30.739> those<00:03:31.340> traps<00:03:31.730> your

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
polypropylene cartridge those traps your

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.440 
polypropylene cartridge those traps your
vault<00:03:33.019> debris<00:03:33.590> coming<00:03:34.010> through<00:03:34.519> your<00:03:35.209> pack

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
vault debris coming through your pack

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.210 
vault debris coming through your pack
okay<00:03:36.019> okay<00:03:36.200> that's<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.530> first<00:03:36.560> stage<00:03:36.980> it's

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
okay okay that's the first stage it's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.430 
okay okay that's the first stage it's
gonna<00:03:37.310> hit<00:03:37.609> that<00:03:37.850> one<00:03:38.420> was<00:03:38.630> very<00:03:38.660> close<00:03:39.170> our

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
gonna hit that one was very close our

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.910 
gonna hit that one was very close our
quality<00:03:39.920> will<00:03:40.370> usually<00:03:40.579> turn<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.359> tan<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.440> a

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
quality will usually turn a tan to a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.670 
quality will usually turn a tan to a
to<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.400> dark-brown<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.330> apply<00:03:44.690> depending<00:03:45.290> how

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
to a dark-brown to apply depending how

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.050 
to a dark-brown to apply depending how
long<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:46.010> leave<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.430> there<00:03:46.580> we've<00:03:46.910> got<00:03:47.030> a

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
long you leave it in there we've got a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.780 
long you leave it in there we've got a
very<00:03:47.390> important<00:03:47.900> stage<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.530> change<00:03:48.860> regularly

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
very important stage to change regularly

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.940 
very important stage to change regularly
and<00:03:50.150> those<00:03:50.420> cartridges<00:03:50.810> are<00:03:51.349> relatively

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
and those cartridges are relatively

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.610 
and those cartridges are relatively
pretty<00:03:52.280> cheap<00:03:52.580> water<00:03:53.180> general<00:03:53.780> awesome<00:03:54.290> you

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
pretty often trade sure your second

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.070 
pretty often trade sure your second
stage<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.640> third<00:04:01.730> stage<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.690> your<00:04:02.840> carbon

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
stage and third stage is your carbon

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.410 
stage and third stage is your carbon
block<00:04:03.380> that's<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:04.340> stage<00:04:04.610> that's<00:04:05.120> going<00:04:05.360> to

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
block that's this stage that's going to

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.110 
block that's this stage that's going to
remove<00:04:05.690> chlorines<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.980> other<00:04:07.370> heavy<00:04:07.670> metals

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
remove chlorines and other heavy metals

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.140 
remove chlorines and other heavy metals
before<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.900> gets<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.380> your<00:04:09.950> next<00:04:10.340> stage<00:04:10.550> which

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
before it gets to your next stage which

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.630 
before it gets to your next stage which
is<00:04:11.330> your<00:04:11.569> membrane<00:04:12.260> your<00:04:12.769> membrane<00:04:13.340> is

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
is your membrane your membrane is

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.970 
is your membrane your membrane is
actually<00:04:14.000> which<00:04:14.390> separates<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.260> water<00:04:15.470> it's

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
actually which separates the water it's

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.909 
actually which separates the water it's
nothing<00:04:16.459> more<00:04:16.639> than<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:17.299> combination<00:04:17.780> of<00:04:18.470> very

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
nothing more than a combination of very

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.210 
nothing more than a combination of very
tightly<00:04:19.669> wound<00:04:20.180> rubber<00:04:20.900> like<00:04:21.560> rubber<00:04:21.859> bands

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
tightly wound rubber like rubber bands

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.659 
tightly wound rubber like rubber bands
that<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.540> designed<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.310> split<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.460> heavy

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
that is designed to split the heavy

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.690 
that is designed to split the heavy
water<00:04:26.169> from<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.290> RO<00:04:27.470> water<00:04:27.919> of<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.400> pure

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
water from the RO water of the pure

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.510 
water from the RO water of the pure
water<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.330> your<00:04:30.139> wastewater<00:04:30.590> goes<00:04:31.010> out<00:04:31.250> one

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
water so your wastewater goes out one

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.730 
water so your wastewater goes out one
side<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.180> then<00:04:32.540> your<00:04:32.690> clean<00:04:32.990> water<00:04:33.020> actually

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
side and then your clean water actually

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.390 
side and then your clean water actually
gets<00:04:34.419> filtered<00:04:35.419> again<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.620> your<00:04:36.770> D<00:04:36.919> ionizer

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
gets filtered again in your D ionizer

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.090 
gets filtered again in your D ionizer
chamber<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.389> the<00:04:38.570> ionizer<00:04:39.050> chambers<00:04:39.650> are<00:04:39.919> your

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
chamber so the ionizer chambers are your

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.129 
chamber so the ionizer chambers are your
chambers<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.580> finish<00:04:41.210> off<00:04:41.419> your<00:04:41.900> water

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
chambers that finish off your water

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.010 
chambers that finish off your water
that's<00:04:42.770> what<00:04:43.190> should<00:04:43.520> bring<00:04:44.060> your<00:04:44.690> tap<00:04:44.990> water

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
that's what should bring your tap water

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.590 
that's what should bring your tap water
ultimately<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.250> zero<00:04:46.669> when<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.300> goes<00:04:47.570> through

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
ultimately to zero when it goes through

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.800 
ultimately to zero when it goes through
the<00:04:48.260> first<00:04:48.650> four<00:04:48.979> stages<00:04:49.310> yep<00:04:50.000> it's<00:04:50.330> probably

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
the first four stages yep it's probably

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.469 
the first four stages yep it's probably
not<00:04:51.050> zero<00:04:51.470> want<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.370> go<00:04:52.520> through<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.030> the

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
not zero want to go through to the

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.300 
not zero want to go through to the
ionizer<00:04:53.930> chambers<00:04:54.530> then<00:04:54.919> it's<00:04:55.100> going<00:04:55.220> to

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
ionizer chambers then it's going to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.650 
ionizer chambers then it's going to
become<00:04:55.430> zero<00:04:56.360> tes<00:04:56.840> okay
