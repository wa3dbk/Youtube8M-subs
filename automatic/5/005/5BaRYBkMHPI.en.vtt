Xbox one platform one of the things that

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.610 
Xbox one platform one of the things that
we've<00:03:55.620> done<00:03:55.650> around<00:03:56.400> our<00:03:56.640> architecture<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.660> to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
we've done around our architecture is to

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.550 
we've done around our architecture is to
have<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.160> game<00:03:59.340> environment<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:01.050> system

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
have the game environment and the system

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.080 
have the game environment and the system
environment<00:04:02.190> be<00:04:02.310> separate<00:04:02.700> from<00:04:02.730> each<00:04:02.940> other

environment be separate from each other

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.940 
environment be separate from each other
and<00:04:03.360> we<00:04:03.780> wanted<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.140> build<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.470> system<00:04:04.650> that

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
and we wanted to build a system that

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.340 
and we wanted to build a system that
preserve<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.730> best<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.150> console<00:04:06.569> gaming<00:04:06.780> so

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
preserve the best of console gaming so

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.020 
preserve the best of console gaming so
that<00:04:07.530> developers<00:04:07.709> can<00:04:08.190> write<00:04:08.520> to<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.819> metal

that developers can write to the metal

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.059 
that developers can write to the metal
they<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:09.690> continue<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.230> optimize<00:04:10.739> they<00:04:10.920> can

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
they can continue to optimize they can

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.160 
they can continue to optimize they can
continue<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.550> build<00:04:11.700> better<00:04:12.030> looking<00:04:12.900> games

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
continue to build better looking games
