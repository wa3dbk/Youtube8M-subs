00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.989
 one is extracted with 2 0 brussels and after skill 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.579
 as a single product 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.869
 there are the monthly catch cedatos the evolution of the entities of interest 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.769
 the relationship between them 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.460
 the entities are so many bearable subjects india say they 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.960
 as also entities to be more 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.099
 in the figure 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.400
 you see the team cav the normal and sedition 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.349
 open with its entities 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.199
 of genexus own room of the model objects domain was asked but 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.430
 In addition, there are other metal structures and structures 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.060
 regarding the database 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.890
 yes they are versiona both the structure of each table and their respective indexes 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 as the navigation of each action of each object jesus 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.070
 of the conception of exist 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.980
 the knowledge be not as alone or online in the documentation the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.680
 programs and configuration are equally important at the moment of 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.950
 handle versions 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.079
 because all these elements are related and I continue to be injured 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.520
 the version is performed after a process batua demand that captures 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.510
 knowledge of the source given high and insist 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.250
 These processes can be generated by having a minimal impact on the minsation 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.140
 give the flexibility required by the organization 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 the rationing leave it with the operation results 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.400
 additionally a graphical interface serves monitor that shows the completeness 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 the process through the different streets 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.610
 having different versions entities 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.510
 chester offers different possibilities 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.590
 at the level of project management is the metric 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.800
 The figure showed a graph showing the number of versions per 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.430
 which passed the objects and highlighting the most modified 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.240
 at the developer level you can compare different versions of it 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.410
 entity 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.730
 either in the same one it fits again of different head they are or not of the same 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.730
 product 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.440
 if it is who allows that a photo was taken because we of the versions 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.920
 present at a given moment generating the concept of revision 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.639
 to a review you can see information that eta is the meaning 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.579
 that photo 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.599
 for the company for example a version for being an official public version 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.829
 of a product 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.409
 this photo even in both the entities and the relationships that exist between 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.569
 they 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.510
 The forecasts can be used for search selection and comparison 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.979
 in particular, a comparison between two versions was shown 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.179
 once selected different days were shown between both revisions 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:47.439
 In terms of traceability, if they are, it is possible to record the reason for the 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.769
 obtaining an element 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.999
 I go want other information that you want to associate the change 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.370
 an example then in the management of the incidence that derived in honor of sion 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.459
 of an entity 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.479
 in the figure this represents the evolution of the object either by a 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.879
 new requirement there was correction side introducing in incidence 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.279
 information is only once a day 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.449
 can be used to build the metric interest of the company 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.079
 both the metric and the senate and traceability are aspects required by 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.259
 the process of quality certification 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.549
 regarding the implementation of traceability if this burial approach 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.999
 practical registration 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.449
 I know that I have productive and reactive methods 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.419
 in the productive methods the promo makes a change and then proceeds to 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.349
 record motive said level change was a challenge 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.539
 whereas coercive methods through scheduled processes do 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:43.219
 are detected the developer made a change and through a 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.799
 email 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.290
 sends an average pacheta ml with the modified objects and the possibility of 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.499
 enter traceability information 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.739
 of the graphical interface you can access traceability information 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.660
 for example 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.409
 for objects through kisses 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.519
 we can define a century pcpi type entry so that each pocket of the 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.519
 object we can count on the following information 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.549
 between version in and version n-1
