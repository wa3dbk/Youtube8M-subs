00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.170
 Ajax was dethroned this weekend as 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.759
 champion of the Netherlands and so it was 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.440
 a strange sensation of the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.240
 farmer for the first time in t 104 weeks 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.590
 enter the training field without 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.049
 to be able to call itself a champion 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.880
 feeling that you are not because 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.180
 you supply for nice feel it is like 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.560
 you have become a champion 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.859
 this time we have to do that without it 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.859
 found it 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.190
 milo 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.720
 ajax may, after a rule of 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.640
 1434 days so no more Dutch best 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.110
 and the Sunday lessons 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.520
 illustrating that 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.510
 the report mark that ajax them for 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.110
 earned five and a half I think we deserve 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.239
 more likely to want than the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.640
 together then the last two floors wd 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.500
 radio and excelsior 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.840
 that is a positive point to learn 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.430
 of makes you just wind it we 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.559
 we send it as a ball 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.040
 Classes are on their way to zero 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.450
 weerter a la sierra leone can sing 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.190
 then frighten you linking your team like 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.449
 you see that well we can all be whole 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.090
 difficult hassle but we all know 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.170
 that it is against a very compact team 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.050
 it just very hard 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.300
 football if you're fine too, then look around 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.550
 half past one against go ahead who is grouping 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.990
 plays and tried to mouse through one 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 another problem at a fast pace 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.930
 the one that is almost impossible and then 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.840
 You have to hope we have four individual ones 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.229
 action that such a match decides 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.729
 is going to be or in the beginning say one 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.610
 goal is made which you 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.289
 eventually get more spaces 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.119
 and that we want to miss that and that 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.069
 what the odds were missing this moment 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.780
 it does agree to it anyway 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.690
 satisfaction 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.460
 after one of the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.230
 we just have to 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.420
 in for tonight and 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.400
 of course again and again we have 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.110
 she doesn't want much more than 19 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.370
 had goal attempts well that is sometimes 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.720
 been less 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.120
 know so that is positive but against 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.860
 nac you just have to grab 3 points 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.080
 are you wondering what to get angry with 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.490
 relegation candidate 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.360
 you failed to hear that you 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.030
 That chance to be a sea ​​hero to be disappointed 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.030
 angry 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.880
 Of course you have a certain anger 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.040
 but more disappointed fact 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.480
 then anger in your view then 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.120
 you because you can't see that in principle 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.740
 after the game but leave 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.740
 the clothes and most familiar form and well 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.650
 Another thing you want is there too 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.350
 next week or tomorrow against players or 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.310
 in office opponents 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.930
 how we gave his players and 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.430
 a lot of hope on Monday morning 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.750
 back to in the last matches 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.060
 climb to the desired level 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.230
 is expected from ajax 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 of course we will work with that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.040
 and we want that 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.890
 achieve that things will go better anyway 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.750
 also be used to just go to it 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.720
 next season because we are already taking 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.010
 so then we will do everything you have to 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.980
 think it will succeed or because it 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.420
 looks no more I find you 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.180
 must remain positive 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.910
 it doesn't matter that we're going to think about it now 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.370
 it's going to income 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.310
 we just get started with the group 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.510
 and skim that step by step better 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.130
 going to use 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.290
 such a bright spot of yesterday that 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.520
 that second place to pray unofficially is that 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.800
 really can not go wrong with 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.900
 target balance added of course that is 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.959
 maybe a bright spot but you are 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.959
 there only need to have soaps with 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.980
 lose one eye they win with 5 and the 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.290
 and suddenly it is already finished so it is possible 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.320
 I can go fast in my course 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.180
 never give another 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.760
 we also assume medical will 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.260
 always have to work cold 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.820
 the best news came from it 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.680
 training field where I now I always 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.570
 the globe comes closer to return 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.540

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.209
 not long would michels me again this week 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.370

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.040

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.819
 I don't know at all could just be 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.920

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.019
