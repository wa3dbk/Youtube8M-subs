so I'm letting it hold for a couple of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.670 
so I'm letting it hold for a couple of
seconds<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:12.870> pulling<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> iron

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
seconds down I'm pulling down the iron

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
seconds down I'm pulling down the iron
again<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.310> rewrapping<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> next

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600

section<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> ayran<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.710> curl<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.250> now

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
section in the ayran can curl and now

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.180 
section in the ayran can curl and now
that<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> hair<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.200> heated<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:19.950> bit

for<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.909> couple<00:02:53.969> of<00:02:54.299> seconds<00:02:54.719> and<00:02:54.840> heat<00:02:55.109> up<00:02:55.290> and

around the iron let it sit for a couple

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.449 
around the iron let it sit for a couple
of<00:03:59.959> seconds<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.530> heat<00:04:00.680> up<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.010> then<00:04:01.100> pulling

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
of seconds to heat up and then pulling

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.670 
of seconds to heat up and then pulling
it<00:04:01.580> down<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.060> rocking<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.840> next<00:04:03.170> piece<00:04:03.380> and

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
it down and rocking the next piece and

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:19.170 
it down and rocking the next piece and
so<00:04:03.950> on<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.370> forth

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.460 

to<00:04:20.180> save<00:04:20.390> some<00:04:20.570> time<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.050> video<00:04:21.410> I

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
to save some time in this video I

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.110 
to save some time in this video I
decided<00:04:21.830> to<00:04:22.010> skip<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.460> part<00:04:22.670> where<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:22.850> curl

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
decided to skip the part where I curl

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.000 
decided to skip the part where I curl
all<00:04:23.240> those<00:04:23.420> pieces<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.500> just<00:04:24.710> curled<00:04:24.890> them

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
all those pieces and I just curled them

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.650 
all those pieces and I just curled them
the<00:04:25.130> same<00:04:25.370> exact<00:04:25.670> way<00:04:25.820> for<00:04:26.030> all<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.330> them<00:04:26.480> so

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
the same exact way for all of them so

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.480 
the same exact way for all of them so
it's<00:04:26.780> kind<00:04:26.810> of<00:04:26.990> pointless<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.650> show<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.310> me

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
it's kind of pointless to show you me

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.370 
it's kind of pointless to show you me
curling<00:04:28.940> each<00:04:29.150> piece<00:04:29.420> of<00:04:29.570> hair<00:04:29.720> over<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.170> over

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
curling each piece of hair over and over

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.750 
curling each piece of hair over and over
again<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.680> now<00:04:30.980> I'm<00:04:31.040> just<00:04:31.160> moving<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.640> next

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
again so now I'm just moving to the next

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.030 
again so now I'm just moving to the next
side<00:04:32.180> of<00:04:32.300> my<00:04:32.420> hair<00:04:32.660> again<00:04:33.080> doing<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.710> same

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
side of my hair again doing the same

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.680 
side of my hair again doing the same
exact<00:04:34.340> thing<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.550> did<00:04:34.820> for<00:04:35.150> those<00:04:35.360> bottom

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
exact thing you did for those bottom

00:04:35.690 --> 00:05:12.050 
exact thing you did for those bottom
pieces<00:04:35.900> before

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.250 

so<00:05:13.060> now<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.390> bottom<00:05:13.720> pieces<00:05:14.080> are<00:05:14.170> all

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
so now that the bottom pieces are all

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.140 
so now that the bottom pieces are all
curled<00:05:14.620> i'm<00:05:14.830> just<00:05:15.040> taking<00:05:15.220> down<00:05:15.520> my<00:05:15.580> hair<00:05:15.970> one

why I have so much hair to work with so
that's<00:05:48.730> why<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:48.970> keep<00:05:49.240> section<00:05:49.690> nothing<00:05:50.050> two

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
that's why I keep section nothing two

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.290 
that's why I keep section nothing two
different<00:05:51.370> sections<00:05:51.550> just<00:05:51.970> because<00:05:52.120> it's<00:05:52.240> a

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
different sections just because it's a

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.150 
different sections just because it's a
little<00:05:52.360> bit<00:05:52.510> easier<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:52.960> get<00:05:53.470> all<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.740> pieces

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
little bit easier to get all the pieces

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:11.709 
little bit easier to get all the pieces
when<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:55.030> other<00:05:55.210> parts<00:05:55.540> are<00:05:55.660> clipped<00:05:55.900> up

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.029 

so<00:06:12.719> as<00:06:12.839> you<00:06:13.019> can<00:06:13.169> see<00:06:13.379> the<00:06:13.499> hairs<00:06:13.709> already

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
so as you can see the hairs already

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.679 
so as you can see the hairs already
started<00:06:14.339> to<00:06:14.459> loosen<00:06:14.669> up<00:06:14.939> a<00:06:15.059> bit<00:06:15.089> and<00:06:15.419> we'll<00:06:15.569> be

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
started to loosen up a bit and we'll be

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.479 
started to loosen up a bit and we'll be
fluffing<00:06:16.199> it<00:06:16.259> out<00:06:16.409> and<00:06:16.619> loosening<00:06:16.949> up<00:06:17.129> even

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:17.489 
fluffing it out and loosening up even

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:19.609 
fluffing it out and loosening up even
more<00:06:17.759> but<00:06:18.599> now<00:06:18.719> I<00:06:18.779> want<00:06:18.929> to<00:06:18.959> take<00:06:19.110> that<00:06:19.289> top

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:19.619 
more but now I want to take that top

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:21.799 
more but now I want to take that top
half<00:06:19.860> down<00:06:20.189> the<00:06:20.369> last<00:06:20.610> section<00:06:21.209> section<00:06:21.689> off

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:21.809 
half down the last section section off

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.529 
half down the last section section off
into<00:06:22.110> two<00:06:22.349> sections<00:06:22.649> on<00:06:23.249> each<00:06:23.789> side<00:06:24.179> so<00:06:24.449> let

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
into two sections on each side so let

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.969 
into two sections on each side so let
your<00:06:24.659> bangs<00:06:24.929> are<00:06:25.110> kind<00:06:25.259> of<00:06:25.289> separate<00:06:25.769> and<00:06:25.919> the

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
your bangs are kind of separate and the

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.709 
your bangs are kind of separate and the
first<00:06:26.309> or<00:06:26.519> the<00:06:26.610> back<00:06:26.789> piece<00:06:27.089> you<00:06:27.239> want<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.449> curl

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
first or the back piece you want to curl

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.809 
first or the back piece you want to curl
exactly<00:06:28.649> as<00:06:28.769> you<00:06:28.889> did<00:06:29.039> with<00:06:29.129> the<00:06:29.189> other<00:06:29.429> pieces

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
exactly as you did with the other pieces

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.179 
exactly as you did with the other pieces
the<00:06:30.059> one<00:06:30.329> to<00:06:30.479> get<00:06:30.599> to<00:06:30.779> your<00:06:30.869> bang<00:06:31.169> um<00:06:31.439> you<00:06:32.039> want

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:32.189 
the one to get to your bang um you want

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:33.589 
the one to get to your bang um you want
to<00:06:32.249> kind<00:06:32.429> of<00:06:32.489> curl<00:06:32.729> it<00:06:32.879> away<00:06:33.179> from<00:06:33.389> your<00:06:33.539> face

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
to kind of curl it away from your face

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.779 
to kind of curl it away from your face
so<00:06:34.139> put<00:06:34.529> it<00:06:34.619> backwards<00:06:35.159> just<00:06:35.339> like<00:06:35.399> you<00:06:35.579> see<00:06:35.759> me

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789
