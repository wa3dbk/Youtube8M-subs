believe or not I've been decorating for
30<00:00:05.600> years<00:00:05.899> honestly<00:00:06.319> yeah<00:00:06.859> honestly<00:00:06.890> honestly

30 years honestly yeah honestly honestly

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.180 
30 years honestly yeah honestly honestly
yes<00:00:08.059> maybe<00:00:08.389> use<00:00:08.570> it<00:00:08.660> but<00:00:09.379> and<00:00:09.500> I've<00:00:09.799> seen<00:00:09.950> a<00:00:10.040> lot

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
yes maybe use it but and I've seen a lot

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.129 
yes maybe use it but and I've seen a lot
of<00:00:10.219> acrylic<00:00:10.639> losses<00:00:11.030> and<00:00:11.269> I'm<00:00:11.480> hand<00:00:11.869> on<00:00:12.020> heart

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
of acrylic losses and I'm hand on heart

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.769 
of acrylic losses and I'm hand on heart
again<00:00:12.440> I<00:00:12.650> think<00:00:13.190> this<00:00:13.549> one<00:00:13.730> is<00:00:13.760> the<00:00:14.119> best<00:00:14.480> not

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:14.779 
again I think this one is the best not

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.960 
again I think this one is the best not
only<00:00:14.959> for<00:00:15.109> the<00:00:15.170> gloss<00:00:15.410> level<00:00:15.619> because<00:00:16.250> that's

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
only for the gloss level because that's

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.550 
only for the gloss level because that's
actually<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.390> eCos<00:00:17.630> your<00:00:17.810> gloss<00:00:18.020> is<00:00:18.230> quite<00:00:18.529> a

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
actually the eCos your gloss is quite a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.930 
actually the eCos your gloss is quite a
nice<00:00:18.800> high<00:00:19.039> gloss<00:00:19.250> level<00:00:19.460> I<00:00:19.700> think<00:00:19.850> you

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
nice high gloss level I think you

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.880 
nice high gloss level I think you
probably<00:00:20.420> agree<00:00:20.630> if<00:00:21.110> your<00:00:21.320> client<00:00:21.650> wanted

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
probably agree if your client wanted

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.650 
probably agree if your client wanted
something<00:00:22.250> slightly<00:00:22.700> glossy<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.330> slightly

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
something slightly glossy a slightly

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.120 
something slightly glossy a slightly
heavier<00:00:23.900> gloss<00:00:24.320> then<00:00:24.560> you<00:00:24.650> can<00:00:24.800> put<00:00:24.950> two

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
heavier gloss then you can put two

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.890 
heavier gloss then you can put two
glasses<00:00:25.580> on<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:26.330> will<00:00:26.539> give<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:26.840> a

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
glasses on and that will give you a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.380 
glasses on and that will give you a
slightly<00:00:27.200> higher<00:00:27.440> gloss<00:00:27.740> again<00:00:28.100> you<00:00:28.310> know<00:00:28.460> so

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
slightly higher gloss again you know so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.499 
slightly higher gloss again you know so

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
tip that you'll get with applying

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.119 
tip that you'll get with applying
acrylics<00:00:44.659> if<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:45.229> use<00:00:45.379> your<00:00:45.589> good<00:00:45.739> quality

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
acrylics if you use your good quality

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.250 
acrylics if you use your good quality
synthetic<00:00:46.399> brush<00:00:46.879> it<00:00:47.239> will<00:00:47.420> tend<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:47.870> clog<00:00:48.079> up

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
synthetic brush it will tend to clog up

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.869 
synthetic brush it will tend to clog up
a<00:00:48.379> little<00:00:48.530> bit<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:48.829> it<00:00:48.949> will<00:00:49.159> promote<00:00:49.489> brush

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
a little bit and it will promote brush

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.069 
a little bit and it will promote brush
marks<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.479> that's<00:00:50.749> what<00:00:50.870> we're<00:00:50.989> obviously

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
marks and that's what we're obviously

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.660 
marks and that's what we're obviously
trying<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.469> get<00:00:51.589> rid<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:51.979> the<00:00:52.100> best<00:00:52.489> thing

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
trying to get rid of so the best thing

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.579 
trying to get rid of so the best thing
to<00:00:52.699> do<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.210> literally<00:00:53.510> just<00:00:53.780> dump<00:00:54.319> it<00:00:54.409> into

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
to do is to literally just dump it into

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.479 
to do is to literally just dump it into
a<00:00:54.879> salt<00:00:55.879> pot<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.149> water<00:00:56.299> and<00:00:56.659> just<00:00:57.440> dampen<00:00:58.069> just

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
a salt pot of water and just dampen just

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.819 
a salt pot of water and just dampen just
dampen<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.940> brush<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.210> start<00:00:59.449> with<00:00:59.600> okay<00:00:59.989> one

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
dampen the brush to start with okay one

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.559 
dampen the brush to start with okay one
thing<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:01.370> again<00:01:01.760> you'll<00:01:02.120> notice<00:01:02.510> the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
thing you again you'll notice the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.030 
thing you again you'll notice the
difference<00:01:02.690> between<00:01:02.989> acrylics<00:01:03.499> and<00:01:03.620> the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
difference between acrylics and the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.070 
difference between acrylics and the
solvent<00:01:04.339> bloom<00:01:04.460> product<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:04.879> with<00:01:05.840> with

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
solvent bloom product is with with

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.499 
solvent bloom product is with with
acrylics<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.040> can<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.610> can<00:01:07.759> apply<00:01:08.030> them<00:01:08.210> much

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
acrylics you can you can apply them much

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.510 
acrylics you can you can apply them much
heavier<00:01:08.899> than<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.110> were<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:10.009> normal<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.399> two

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
heavier than you were a normal on two

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.209 
heavier than you were a normal on two
coats<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:11.479> does<00:01:12.140> flow<00:01:12.380> out<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.799> does<00:01:13.070> actually

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
coats it does flow out it does actually

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.130 
coats it does flow out it does actually
go<00:01:13.460> on<00:01:13.549> much<00:01:13.729> heavier<00:01:14.060> if<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.750> get<00:01:14.899> it<00:01:15.020> on

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
go on much heavier if you get it on

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.660 
go on much heavier if you get it on
particularly<00:01:15.680> if<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:15.950> of<00:01:16.039> color<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.549> you

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
particularly if it's of color and you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.849 
particularly if it's of color and you
lay<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.060> off<00:01:17.270> ten<00:01:17.539> minutes<00:01:17.719> later<00:01:17.899> you'll<00:01:18.619> get

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
lay it off ten minutes later you'll get

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.620 
lay it off ten minutes later you'll get
like<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> flash<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.939> things<00:01:20.119> like<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.539> it

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
like a flash and things like that and it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.999 
like a flash and things like that and it
will<00:01:20.689> look<00:01:20.869> like<00:01:20.899> flotation<00:01:21.740> ia<00:01:21.859> two

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
will look like flotation ia two

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.200 
will look like flotation ia two
different<00:01:22.369> colors<00:01:22.609> because<00:01:22.759> you're<00:01:22.880> flipping

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
different colors because you're flipping

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.700 
different colors because you're flipping
the<00:01:23.299> pigments<00:01:23.689> things<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:24.289> that<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
the pigments things like that so the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.770 
the pigments things like that so the
idea<00:01:25.039> is<00:01:25.159> get<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.549> on<00:01:25.609> laid<00:01:25.909> off<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.329> leave<00:01:26.750> it

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
idea is get it on laid off and leave it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.510 
idea is get it on laid off and leave it
yeah<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.130> lots<00:01:28.369> on<00:01:28.520> your<00:01:28.670> brush<00:01:30.280> those<00:01:31.280> on

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
yeah so lots on your brush those on

degree it won't run and then again
exactly<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.859> same<00:01:43.039> as<00:01:43.219> your<00:01:43.340> pure<00:01:43.549> bristle

brush using the flags all the tips of

brush using the flags all the tips of
the<00:01:46.219> brush<00:01:46.429> just<00:01:46.939> nice<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:47.600> gently<00:01:48.039> let's<00:01:49.039> lay

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
the brush just nice and gently let's lay

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.149 
the brush just nice and gently let's lay
it<00:01:49.249> off<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.749> way<00:01:50.929> you'll<00:01:51.710> get<00:01:51.859> quite<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
it off and that way you'll get quite a

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.899 
it off and that way you'll get quite a
decent<00:01:52.840> surface<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.960> put<00:01:54.109> your<00:01:54.229> gloss<00:01:54.380> on<00:01:54.560> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
is it will actually again help the flow
