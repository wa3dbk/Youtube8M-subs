 There is a place called the timeline. The sound before the pro is two videos of Tsuinori .

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.930
 It was 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.800
 In there it is good, but it is connected by a cut if it is basic or not 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.779
 It is distinguished service 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.560
 When Hey Is not it going to not doing this here I thought Do not enter in the cut 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.900

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.239
 Kedomo is what you cry and angry keep delay Well Well Turn You know magic This is the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.510
 Usually is that in an accident of the machine 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.980
 Go trackpad trip was 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:49.960
 This is pretty I was doing something like that kiss as either doing this Well do I 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:54.640
 Can not not to be a turning magic hen I'm smelled This is not able to turn the ordinary 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:01:00.910
 Now I have this Now Now I did it Mashi now magic I do do is I said I think it 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 It feels like this This is the reason I bought it because I thought it was good for Niho 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.520
 The 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.960
 Yes I'm watching it right now It's a bit a bit freakish but it's something I'm talking about 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.710
 We just here'm easy to say or not doing to do if I am it out even to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 This I go moving timeline was a major deciding factor in the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.200
 Yes, this magic mouse has one weakness 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.850
 If it says something , the battery 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.869
 It means that the house is bad , but it depends on the individual difference of people when the battery is bad 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.780
 I think but 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:38.979
 Not have three months female baby in the usual battery when Nago heard in the bottom well's Apple 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.069
 I was told that because I was told that I was listening to a voice using another child 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.190
 Well, even though I went Maybe that more short 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.870
 Battery replacement 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.030
 It just maybe people it 's such a troublesome is the consumption of the battery That's a little nasty delivery 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.440
 You might think 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.160
 If I can endure it, I think that magic mouse will use it at all 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.520
 Directly below it is also from this I think that I want to do my best I negotiated with the Magic Mouse 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.930
 I will 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.210
 I forgot to say that , but it's so thin doing magic man this way 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.440
 Horse 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:12.840
 Looks like when compared to arbitrarily turn felt from the eyes fit pretty it is is here 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.470
 But I know the next feel I doing this this is float you also I like this feeling with 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.960
 From 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.220
 I can not be pita 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.660
 Why is it like this but I'm doing it this way 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.520
