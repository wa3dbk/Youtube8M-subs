00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.509
 hi to all of you guys today we are here with 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.029
 new video a video very different from the 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.120
 usually because I wanted to talk to you about one 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.710
 what has happened in these days a 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.390
 extraordinary event 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.870
 a historical event that occurred on the 14th 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.409
 October the evening of October 14th of 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.780
 obviously this year 2012 of course 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.120
 I think you heard about it or 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.199
 however you followed the live 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.649
 or on youtube on television well like 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.050
 you will know felix baumgartner has passed the 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.179
 sound barrier jumping from the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.429
 stratosphere therefore in free fall from 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:10.970
 a height of about 39,000 meters 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:13.160
 practically 2500 meters more than what 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.820
 planned at the beginning because it was planned 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.700
 about 36 thousand meters in a few tens of 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.210
 seconds passed as mentioned before 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.759
 speed of sound that is more or less on 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.220
 1,100 kilometers per hour and has also done 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.590
 a record on the speed of fall is 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.459
 more or less reached 1300 kilometers 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.099
 timetables 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.899
 then obviously after 4 minutes the 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:38.090
 parachute also because it is still the 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.440
 you have sent the visor and it has not 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.929
 then started seeing more then 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.390
 as a precaution he decided to open the 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.700
 parachute ahead of schedule for later 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.000
 land after about four more 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.459
 minutes arriving safe and sound by returning 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.349
 on the earth's soil 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.170
 well even in this test I'm not 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.629
 missed moments of tension because at a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.369
 some point I started spinning 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:04.310
 swirling on itself and therefore 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.340
 they all thought the worst however for 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.550
 luck went smoothly 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.520
 in this enterprise felix has also beaten 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.170
 three records that is the ball that is 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.620
 arrived higher than all the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.200
 tried experiments before was the most 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.360
 high jump never attempted 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.340
 and moreover he was the first man a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.760
 overcome the sound barrier 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.410
 throwing himself free 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.900
 I also remember that 65 years ago 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.910
 exactly 65 years ago another one 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.130
 astronaut beat 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.890
 the sound output then exceeded the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.660
 speed of sound though on board a 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.940
 plane well guys I have summarized you in 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.530
 few words what happened is 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.110
 happened yesterday 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.360
 but now after this video you are 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.160
 seeing under my voice 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.800
 I will leave you to the most beautiful moments of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.520
 this fantastic event and see you 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.450
 to the next 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.450
 Hi guys 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.230
 I know 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.360
 he 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.129
 in conclusion 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.390
 it lacks 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.240
 now 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.410
 Yup
