00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
gonna try and hide that before when you

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.880 
gonna try and hide that before when you
mix<00:03:09.190> my<00:03:10.200> downloadable<00:03:11.200> content<00:03:11.590> there<00:03:11.709> we<00:03:11.770> go

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
mix my downloadable content there we go

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.560 
mix my downloadable content there we go
and<00:03:12.550> that's<00:03:12.640> actually<00:03:12.970> engraved<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
and that's actually engraved in the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.590 
and that's actually engraved in the
bottom<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.900> cog<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.850> quite<00:03:16.390> cool

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
bottom of that cog so it's quite cool

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.039 
bottom of that cog so it's quite cool
how<00:03:16.780> they've<00:03:16.930> done<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:18.250> no<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.550> um

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
how they've done that but no this is um

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.210 
how they've done that but no this is um
apparently<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.260> one-to-one<00:03:20.560> ratio<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:21.130> an

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
apparently a one-to-one ratio of an

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.460 
apparently a one-to-one ratio of an
actual<00:03:21.400> cog<00:03:21.700> in<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.940> game<00:03:22.120> which<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.230> find

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
actual cog in the game which I find

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.750 
actual cog in the game which I find
quite<00:03:23.680> funny<00:03:24.010> considering<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.610> COG

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
quite funny considering the COG

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.610 
quite funny considering the COG
innoGames<00:03:25.120> actually<00:03:25.600> make<00:03:26.110> believe<00:03:26.380> as<00:03:26.500> well

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
innoGames actually make believe as well

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.320 
innoGames actually make believe as well
so<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:26.920> want<00:03:27.100> one<00:03:27.250> ratio<00:03:27.549> could<00:03:27.760> technically<00:03:28.180> be

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
so I want one ratio could technically be

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.199 
so I want one ratio could technically be
any<00:03:28.510> size<00:03:28.780> but<00:03:29.620> anyway<00:03:29.920> it's<00:03:30.519> got<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.670> very<00:03:30.940> very

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
any size but anyway it's got a very very

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.240 
any size but anyway it's got a very very
nice<00:03:31.390> weight<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.900> feels<00:03:32.260> very<00:03:32.380> very<00:03:33.010> heavy

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
nice weight to it feels very very heavy

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.789 
nice weight to it feels very very heavy
and<00:03:33.459> durable<00:03:34.080> solid<00:03:35.080> as<00:03:35.320> well<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.739> not

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
and durable solid as well so it's not

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.740 
and durable solid as well so it's not
hollow<00:03:36.070> or<00:03:36.250> plastics<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:36.970> actually<00:03:37.239> you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
hollow or plastics it's actually you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.789 
hollow or plastics it's actually you
know<00:03:37.780> real<00:03:38.140> metal<00:03:38.549> that's<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.640> very<00:03:39.910> nice

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
know real metal that's a very nice

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.039 
know real metal that's a very nice
collectible<00:03:41.799> there<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.340> think<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.540> price<00:03:43.840> of

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
collectible there I think the price of

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.250 
collectible there I think the price of
