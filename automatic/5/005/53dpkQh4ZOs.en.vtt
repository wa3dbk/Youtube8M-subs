00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.369

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.220
 here really those people who are miles and miles 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.629
 focus because I am a youtuber 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.530
 anyways i was yesterday being on later 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.050
 I play in as 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 it's just like a new one and and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.870
 delivery of a live came so was allowed 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.580
 you like it to be a new series 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.050
 to follow soon 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.730
 I can certainly recommend him of course 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.050
 really a high 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 so i do n't want you to either 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.150
 find out if you have that feeling 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.890
 it really revives yes 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.680
 opposite the name it made because 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.230
 it has made quite a name 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.250
 becomes your dox word stories 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.450
 that's what I called it , but I'm going my own 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.090
 god oh oh how we are good 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.280
 choose I have to wake up but 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.420
 fallen a little too far 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.220
 now we have to go on this for a long time 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.690
 stay a bit more reasonable 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.940
 score gain 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.560
 but yes it was really a laugh 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.730
 you will find yourself an open world 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.590
 and I have 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.830
 and never really can play gta because 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.600
 Of course the console was so 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.489
 I have a bit of that work all the time 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.560
 missed and then now with boards 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.269
 turkish tour car 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.549
 anything i have to say it has 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.100
 what I am very curious how it will later 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.150
 is going to expire 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.980
 or how the game is going to be 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.510
 because the more points you have, call 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.090
 can do fatter things I can now 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.709
 For example, I can hack into Bruges 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.470
 I think that I leave a train open 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.260
 stopping that kind of shit is really pretty 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.970
 well done if I say so myself 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.070
 though I am yes it really doesn't matter 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.390
 I tell you if I say so myself because I have you 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.049
 yet nothing do with the games 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.660
 they said no one had there 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:51.480
 five more games or 6 players left 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.829
 so watch a magic castle mix it with 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.000
 jacket 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.190
 mima magic and then I go sport socks 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.900
 he just upload every day and i want 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.790
 also go for that baking melle go play 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.489
 was that mexican game I played 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.470
 was also genius 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.160
 but in the other other sense of it 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.160
 word of course 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.729
 o no o no 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.530
 ok this is a lot of mistakes 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.239
 Guys that this doesn't belong to me 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.449
 the leaking 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.449
 I am swallowing and that is yes 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.340
 willy i really felt that i was there 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.340
 did not fall off and made up jokes 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.020
 a plumber 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.759
 bomber boys still thanks for it 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.620
 I hope to see how much at a lot 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.620
 I became fourth or fifth 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.110
 it can make it do not really participate 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.550
 I really have to go 3 way 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.380
 of thanks for watching is still 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.940
 like doing a thumb-up 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.520
 because as a moment you don't have to subscribe 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.360
 for more 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.629
 illness does not kill me 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.629
 know 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.050
 Yes
