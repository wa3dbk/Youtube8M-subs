think<00:06:00.760> it's<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:01.090> really<00:06:01.390> really<00:06:01.570> great<00:06:01.930> it

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
think it's a really really great it

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.780 
think it's a really really great it
really<00:06:02.800> does<00:06:03.010> have<00:06:03.130> great<00:06:03.280> production<00:06:03.760> value

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
really does have great production value

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.610 
really does have great production value
as<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.630> said<00:06:04.810> there's<00:06:05.020> some<00:06:05.200> things<00:06:05.380> that<00:06:05.500> they

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
as I said there's some things that they

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.260 
as I said there's some things that they
could<00:06:05.800> have<00:06:05.890> done<00:06:06.280> differently<00:06:06.760> I<00:06:07.060> guess

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
could have done differently I guess

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.090 
could have done differently I guess
there's<00:06:07.630> some<00:06:07.840> little<00:06:08.290> bit<00:06:08.380> things<00:06:08.710> more<00:06:08.979> that

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
there's some little bit things more that

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.230 
there's some little bit things more that
they<00:06:09.190> could<00:06:09.370> have<00:06:09.460> added<00:06:09.669> maybe<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.090> little

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
they could have added maybe a little

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.600 
they could have added maybe a little
more<00:06:10.450> different<00:06:11.080> scenarios<00:06:11.650> but<00:06:12.340> other<00:06:12.490> than

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
more different scenarios but other than

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.010 
more different scenarios but other than
that<00:06:12.700> I<00:06:13.000> think<00:06:13.060> it's<00:06:13.270> a<00:06:13.360> really<00:06:13.630> really<00:06:13.750> good

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
that I think it's a really really good

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.350 
that I think it's a really really good
