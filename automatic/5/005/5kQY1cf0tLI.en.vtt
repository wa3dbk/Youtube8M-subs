00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.260
 most comfortable symmetrical mouse 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.600
 that's what the developers say about their 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.300
 a miracle called razer ouroboros 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.880
 it's time to check it out hello 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.350
 this is an online photo store i max and this 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.350
 she razer u work 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.620
 let's start with design no matter how you turn 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.300
 for some reason looks very aggressive to me 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.140
 reminds cars from the movie deadly 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.050
 race 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.360
 especially here these radiators and hide 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.390
 looks very cool plus green 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.309
 lights amplifies wah uroboros 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.680
 symmetrical so it's no wonder that 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.899
 side buttons on all sides 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.790
 plus there are three standard 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.290
 buttons left right scroll and two buttons 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.989
 switch dipay 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.960
 scroll by the way did not really like it and here 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.409
 why in Windows he is great scroller he 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.570
 comfortable wide and rubberized well here 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.479
 if you put on him jump in ks16 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.000
 Taras can not get through but it is still 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.770
 not all buttons can be buttons if desired 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.740
 make side panels 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.990
 below there are two switches in one 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.909
 position they block the side panels and 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.799
 they don't move and if their 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.979
 unlock then the side panels 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.439
 turn into a mouse button you can 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.679
 fully customize and I now 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.829
 not about the buttons the length of the mouse is adjusted 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:40.069
 With the help of this one, here we pull the panel 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:47.780
 here is this button and pull out 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:50.569
 panel to the length that you need but 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.939
 it 's not all very important point you can 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.039
 adjust the height of the mouse is really cool 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.539
 because very often the mouse is 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.479
 uncomfortable and because either too 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.030
 low or too high here 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.189
 there is no problem twist this wheel and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.549
 raise the height of the mouse on the one that 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.950
 you need further side panels in 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.150
 two pairs one such 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.700
 and the other here is such they are mounted on 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.840
 magnets and pretty tight so 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.959
 do not worry 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.660
 I personally will not fly more like 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.120
 those that with rubber sides to the touch 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.940
 very nice and does not slip out 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.760
 fingers what else interesting wireless 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.849
 the bundled mode is such 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.510
 docking station take out the wire from the mouse 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.800
 paste it in here and all the mouse 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.600
 works without wires 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.600
 it feeds on 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:50.630
 battery type 2a which is 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.120
 here and work time without recharging 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.280
 pretty good at me lasted 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.620
 all day and spent about two 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.810
 a third of the charge, the manufacturer claims that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.330
 will work at least 12 hours at 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.090
 an intense game would be nice if 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.510
 so the mouse is charging from the docking station or 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.820
 just through the wire plus to the docking station 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.800
 There is another button to restart the mouse if 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.170
 all of a sudden that small problems arose 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.210
 when switching from wired mode to 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.090
 wireless without booting the computer 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.950
 Mouse does not work and a bit buggy in 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.490
 wireless when you switch 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.890
 dipiai 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.510
 although I think that it is not in all mice 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.880
 only in mine because I have a test 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.800
 sample that can crash and not 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.910
 worry about wireless in the game 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.520
 the mode will fail 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.110
 these times are long past 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.270
 The response is the same as in wired 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.010
 mode one millisecond rest 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.650
 mouse indicators are also raiser style 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.680
 dual sensor 4g with a resolution of 8200 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.470
 de five states is just 1000 hertz speed 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.110
 200 inches per second and acceleration to 50g 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.810
 It sits comfortably in my hand, although I first 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.670
 it seemed to be the opposite but not on 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.730
 surprise perfectly laid in hand 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.220
 the coating is rough and not dirty it 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.740
 cool that still slightly surprised so 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 the fact that without battery the mouse turned out 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.720
 easier than i thought it was a little 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.730
 unusual but also with the weight of the battery 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.110
 had to get used to him she was 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.420
 too heavy 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.030
 although half an hour later I did not feel the game 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.489
 discomfort as the whole new razer mouse 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.430
 ouroboros supports juice for customization 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.680
 synapse 20 here you can configure the mouse 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.300
 somehow remap the buttons change 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.150
 dipiai adjust the backlight brightness 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.250
 write a macro and and even calibrate 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.170
 its under a certain rug all your 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.910
 settings are saved in the cloud service 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.160
 so if you bring the mouse on 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.320
 championship then your profiles will be right away 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.540
 loaded and customize the mouse will not have to 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.850
 only you will need the Internet to 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.010
 download synapses login in game 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.440
 I liked the mouse though at first I 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.110
 I was unusually accustomed to about an hour 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.180
 after that, everything became normal sensor 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.670
 very high quality and very responsive 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.340
 exactly what 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.620
 expected to go out do a couple of minuses not 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.570
 really liked the question click he did not 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.160
 short such as in a dezadder 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.680
 long i love those 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.940
 with this, not only in my quest to the point and 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.800
 in the old man can be chopped what is the result 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.050
 symmetrical customizable mouse which 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.810
 equipped with an excellent sensor and two 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.550
 modes of their response to cyborg and 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.680
 I personally can not say that he does not 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.870
