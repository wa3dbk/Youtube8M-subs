00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.720
 the preparation of ajax has begun you also make team of jasper cillessen 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.530
 and debut are still active at the world cup in brazil and there are performing with 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.349
 the netherlands excellent that is nice to see that it goes really well that 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.769
 they also have a share in the south 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.659
 so the actor 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.470
 years of trouble then 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.069
 he states marc not so plays the silos and that brings have a big role 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.649
 the province had been doing a frame 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.370
 at sv the major stock exchanges 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.420
 for that must be against silver against spain 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.220
 of course it's very important 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.600
 in addition, a trickle just very much for the status, but that was good 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 baby 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.950
 i also think i'm just doing very well and looks too aggressive as the fitness 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.860
 and 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.230
 we have an important shareholder 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.710
 the Dutchman is now thinking but you can see the cap 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.540
 that is why we have already caught a team owner 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.360
 You can also see that from OVO reports 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.560
 it is really out 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.500
 yesterday morning two substitutes is making a difference than it is at 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 to us very often 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.430
 voting 7 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.640
 she was that you also how well they play it is therefore good result in any case 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.550
 to be 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.490
 yes it is certain that it will be very difficult to go through a first round 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.530
 come the flag and streamer reached 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.300
 only now it's about 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.960
 it or are they satisfied with that in the first thing I hear the noises 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.710
 that is worth something 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.090
 qwartje then also had east in the group 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.780
 also worked according to switzerland 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 the posters shed 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.600
 so play and win three fantastic matches 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.950
 glorious decline 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
 against Russia one 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.280
 mexico is just next to a good opponent 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.260
 although an interesting pot 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.180
 yes she works as an assistant four years ago 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.060
 do you have the feeling that this team seems to be self-confident like it was then 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.320
 reached 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.920
 but she also wants the qualities and winners to be a statement 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.140
 believe often 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.649
 I definitely think the options are available 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.499
 to overturn 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.080
 in shock when the indulgence system a fighting two 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.580
 The Netherlands has an opinion about what do you think of the new Dutchman 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.839
 plays 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.199
 it's a number of moments that you do that 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.469
 that you can play football and you have to do that and they have that 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.019
 yesterday, everse encountered against spain took the second half very well 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.609
 the reason that they are yes if they have the ball that they do 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.679
 the games always always to the right color but that was 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.679
 in fact almost groups 5 and 6 minutes was not 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:43.119
 not the case in terms of organization in that can of course be done 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.879
 a call comes together 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.859
 if you do not play well then you still give very little away and 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.259
 yes that is a size too large for countries with this system 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.619
 and in the end this just happened to the foreman following 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.819
 get more possession that you 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.989
 that you force the band against it then your opponent and then it is just 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.419
 actually a very offensive weighing sets up the actual and systems 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.879
 played away with five attackers but with three defenders 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.089
 it the high school of the competition back this time 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.409
 whether you are actually in the students or not 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.499
 do you still have contact with the players to 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.319
 it is still something to give 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.989
 then the only thing i medvedev other and the guys that you 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.979
 that you don't feel like you are me 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.019
 fc oss 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 German porter then what do people say you do 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.529
 qwise put his all for three is the first wk 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:46.039
 then you can also say yes the orca on the wk that I am pretty big but 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.319
 Yes that 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.519
 that you need that feeling you need everyone who really needs us i want some range here 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.429
 I now sit a bit more for myself but also with the team and 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:59.139
 and not afterwards yes I I that they actually I was already satisfied with the eye 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.849
 appear on the wk 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.279
 yes I actually give that 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.689
 Also said to do binds by which you go upstairs 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.149
 40 meters perfectly prepared 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.879
 no I didn't and twenty meters of which the color of a good one 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:13.929
 upstairs 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.749
 our feet have french links 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.939
 yes luckily it came out fantastic on the wall at that time 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.729
 with two pointed system 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:23.719
 meijers 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:24.800
 the emerging back 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.749
 you can probably use that more 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:29.479
 use it well 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.479
 you dare to venture a prediction job lies the Netherlands 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.990
 no that is the old-fashioned state on says the disease whatford passed through 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.920
 the mexicans 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.340
 we played yesterday 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.610
 and then it becomes a hell of a job 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.699
 I think I think it is super cool what they have achieved now, only the issue is 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.669
 trend break 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.070
 it's an alarm 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.690
 after an ally of the players
