tooth to adhere to there is a fine line

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.580 
tooth to adhere to there is a fine line
between<00:01:23.120> burnishing<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.900> surface<00:01:24.380> and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
between burnishing the surface and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.470 
between burnishing the surface and
melting<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.190> plastic<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:25.910> keep<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.240> flame

melting the plastic so keep the flame
moving<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.500> burnishing<00:01:27.890> will<00:01:28.160> also

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
moving the burnishing will also

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.020 
moving the burnishing will also
eliminate<00:01:28.820> any<00:01:29.270> stray<00:01:29.630> oils<00:01:30.080> on<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.380> plastic

the stock is going to take a few minutes
to<00:01:33.530> cool<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.070> let's<00:01:34.250> go<00:01:34.400> ahead<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.760> work<00:01:34.850> on

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
to cool so let's go ahead and work on

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.750 
to cool so let's go ahead and work on
the<00:01:35.090> barrel<00:01:35.450> action<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:36.620> prep<00:01:36.860> work<00:01:36.890> here<00:01:37.580> is

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
a lot more time-consuming and involved

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.070 
a lot more time-consuming and involved
but<00:01:40.430> remember<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.210> critical<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.960> the

success of the job spending a few
minutes<00:01:44.720> now<00:01:44.990> will<00:01:45.680> save<00:01:45.950> hours<00:01:46.610> if<00:01:46.940> we<00:01:47.030> get

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
minutes now will save hours if we get

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
to now I'm going to be mimicking the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.340 
to now I'm going to be mimicking the
pattern<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.490> scope<00:02:34.760> coat<00:02:35.090> cover<00:02:35.480> now<00:02:36.260> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
pattern in this scope coat cover now the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.460 
pattern in this scope coat cover now the
trick<00:02:36.709> with<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:38.060> select<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:39.110> lighter

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
trick with this is to select the lighter

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.680 
trick with this is to select the lighter
colors<00:02:39.950> first<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.610> I've<00:02:40.700> chosen<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.330> tan

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
colors first and I've chosen this tan

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.809 
colors first and I've chosen this tan
because<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.290> matches<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.130> color<00:02:43.520> pretty

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
because it matches that color pretty

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.970 
because it matches that color pretty
well<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.690> also<00:02:44.870> matches<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.680> ground

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
well and it also matches the ground

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.290 
well and it also matches the ground

colored splotch here well I'm gonna go

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.150

with<00:03:01.760> an<00:03:01.880> OD<00:03:02.269> green<00:03:02.590> instead<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.709> that<00:03:03.830> coffee

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.800 
with an OD green instead of that coffee
color<00:03:04.519> because<00:03:04.820> it's<00:03:04.970> more<00:03:05.180> like<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.600> woods

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810

that<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.050> hunt<00:03:06.550> I've<00:03:07.550> made<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> couple<00:03:08.000> of

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
that I hunt I've made a couple of

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.330 
that I hunt I've made a couple of
patterns<00:03:08.510> out<00:03:09.050> of<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.320> manila<00:03:09.620> folder<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.190> some

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
patterns out of a manila folder and some

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.979 
patterns out of a manila folder and some
of<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.489> painters<00:03:10.850> tape<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.300> like<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.660> manila

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
of the painters tape I like the manila

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.449 
of the painters tape I like the manila
folder<00:03:12.350> material<00:03:12.769> because<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:13.190> flexible

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
folder material because it's flexible

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.490 
folder material because it's flexible
but<00:03:14.360> cardboard<00:03:14.810> would<00:03:14.930> work<00:03:15.080> just<00:03:15.110> as<00:03:15.440> well

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
but cardboard would work just as well

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.699 
but cardboard would work just as well
and<00:03:16.430> I've<00:03:16.550> torn<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.570> painters<00:03:17.959> tape<00:03:17.989> in<00:03:18.410> long

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
and I've torn the painters tape in long

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.069 
and I've torn the painters tape in long
strips<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.850> make<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.120> edges<00:03:20.420> random<00:03:23.079> spray
