your offroad so real simplicity here the

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.510 
your offroad so real simplicity here the
second<00:01:53.450> reason<00:01:53.569> I<00:01:54.020> selected<00:01:54.619> this<00:01:55.310> particular

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
second reason I selected this particular

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.620 
second reason I selected this particular
bike<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.830> because<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.069> weight<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:59.450> bike

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
bike is because of the weight this bike

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.609 
bike is because of the weight this bike
is<00:01:59.660> 30<00:02:00.319> pounds<00:02:00.619> lighter<00:02:01.399> than<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:02.599> Honda<00:02:03.110> CRF

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
is 30 pounds lighter than the Honda CRF

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.270 
is 30 pounds lighter than the Honda CRF
250<00:02:04.459> L<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:05.599> comes<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.140> at<00:02:06.940> 291<00:02:07.940> pounds<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
250 L it comes in at 291 pounds and the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.750 
250 L it comes in at 291 pounds and the
Honda<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.209> closer<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:14.980> 325<00:02:15.980> pounds<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.730> believe

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
Honda is closer to 325 pounds I believe

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.960 
Honda is closer to 325 pounds I believe
I<00:02:17.420> don't

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
I don't

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.600 
I don't
correctly<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.630> may<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.870> off<00:02:19.200> there<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.770> pound<00:02:20.400> or

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
correctly I may be off there a pound or

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.560 
correctly I may be off there a pound or
two<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:22.260> differential<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.950> weight<00:02:23.190> I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
two and that differential in weight I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.030 
two and that differential in weight I
think<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:24.990> critical<00:02:25.170> when<00:02:25.710> you're<00:02:25.830> off

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
think is really critical when you're off

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.240 
think is really critical when you're off
road<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.930> personally<00:02:28.680> am<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.980> light

have 30 inch inseam which brings me to
the<00:02:37.320> third<00:02:37.530> reason<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:38.010> selected<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.550> bike<00:02:38.780> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the ground and as I find myself working

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.150 
the ground and as I find myself working
through<00:02:54.390> trails<00:02:56.330> planting<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:58.020> feet<00:02:58.350> is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
through trails planting the feet is

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.250 
through trails planting the feet is
going<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.640> be<00:02:59.790> really<00:03:00.510> important<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.990> me<00:03:01.140> and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
going to be really important to me and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.680 
going to be really important to me and
give<00:03:02.040> me<00:03:02.160> much<00:03:02.340> more<00:03:02.550> confidence<00:03:03.120> going<00:03:03.240> in

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
give me much more confidence going in

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.870 
give me much more confidence going in
and<00:03:03.870> out<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.340> gnarly<00:03:05.340> areas<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:07.790> let's<00:03:08.790> say

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
and out of gnarly areas and let's say

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.200 
and out of gnarly areas and let's say
the<00:03:09.000> final<00:03:09.420> well<00:03:10.080> one<00:03:11.040> additional<00:03:11.460> reason<00:03:12.000> is

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
the final well one additional reason is

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.360 
the final well one additional reason is
the<00:03:12.420> fuel<00:03:12.630> tank<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.890> fuel<00:03:14.220> tank<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:16.370> 2.6

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
the fuel tank this fuel tank is 2.6

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.460 
the fuel tank this fuel tank is 2.6
gallons

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
gallons

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.820 
gallons
it's<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:20.040> point<00:03:20.730> six<00:03:21.090> gallons<00:03:21.690> more<00:03:22.020> than<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
it's a point six gallons more than the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.430 
it's a point six gallons more than the
Honda<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.480> simply<00:03:24.480> put<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:24.840> giving<00:03:25.140> me<00:03:25.170> more

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
Honda and simply put it's giving me more

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.000 
Honda and simply put it's giving me more
range<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:26.610> actually<00:03:27.270> has<00:03:28.010> equivalent

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
range this actually has equivalent

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.250 
range this actually has equivalent
mileage<00:03:29.489> per<00:03:29.970> gallon<00:03:30.390> or<00:03:30.570> maybe<00:03:30.810> slightly

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
mileage per gallon or maybe slightly

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.870 
mileage per gallon or maybe slightly
higher<00:03:31.820> then<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.000> Honda<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.810> rated<00:03:34.410> at

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
higher then the Honda this is rated at

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.560 
higher then the Honda this is rated at
73<00:03:35.880> miles<00:03:36.750> per<00:03:37.200> gallon<00:03:37.910> alright<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.120> when<00:03:39.480> I'm

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
73 miles per gallon alright so when I'm

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
73 miles per gallon alright so when I'm
off<00:03:39.810> trail<00:03:40.850> I'm<00:03:41.850> going<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.540> be<00:03:42.660> worried<00:03:43.110> much

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
off trail I'm going to be worried much

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.479 
off trail I'm going to be worried much
less<00:03:44.840> about<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:46.739> out<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.640> fueling<00:03:48.330> up<00:03:49.489> all

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
less about going out and fueling up all

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.520 
less about going out and fueling up all
right<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.120> those<00:03:51.300> are<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.450> few<00:03:51.600> key<00:03:52.050> reasons

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
right so so those are a few key reasons

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.699 
right so so those are a few key reasons
and<00:03:52.940> maybe<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.269> more<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.750> think<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.140> steering

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
and maybe one more I think the steering

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.199 
and maybe one more I think the steering
angle<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:59.060> provides<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.390> much<00:04:00.780> more<00:04:01.380> agile

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
angle on this provides a much more agile

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.330 
angle on this provides a much more agile
like<00:04:03.209> when<00:04:03.810> you're<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.500> tight<00:04:04.860> gnarly

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
like when you're in the tight gnarly

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.949 
like when you're in the tight gnarly
areas<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.940> trails<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.570> need<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.810> make

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
areas of trails and you need to make

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.060 
areas of trails and you need to make
some<00:04:07.200> quick<00:04:07.410> maneuvers<00:04:09.230> all<00:04:10.230> right<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.709> think<00:04:10.830> I

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
some quick maneuvers all right I think I

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.009 
some quick maneuvers all right I think I
captured<00:04:12.680> pretty<00:04:13.680> much<00:04:13.860> all<00:04:14.100> of<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.430> reasons

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
captured pretty much all of the reasons

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.210 
captured pretty much all of the reasons
seat<00:04:16.019> height<00:04:16.290> weight<00:04:17.269> engine<00:04:18.269> reliability

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
assemble in Japan larger fuel tank and

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:32.700 
assemble in Japan larger fuel tank and
and<00:04:24.900> that's<00:04:25.140> it
