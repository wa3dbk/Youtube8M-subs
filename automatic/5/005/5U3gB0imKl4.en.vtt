you<00:05:34.860> can<00:05:35.009> go<00:05:35.129> through<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:36.389> could<00:05:36.569> type

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.480 

you<00:05:58.430> get<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:58.789> idea<00:05:58.819> you<00:05:59.449> can<00:05:59.599> type<00:05:59.840> directly

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.089 

on<00:06:04.490> the<00:06:05.030> unit<00:06:05.360> it<00:06:05.629> will<00:06:05.870> learn<00:06:06.110> your<00:06:06.530> type<00:06:06.889> as

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
on the unit it will learn your type as

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.999 
on the unit it will learn your type as
you<00:06:07.310> go<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:08.080> haven't<00:06:09.080> actually<00:06:09.199> configure<00:06:09.710> this

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
you go I haven't actually configure this

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.290 
you go I haven't actually configure this
so<00:06:10.250> this<00:06:10.370> is<00:06:10.520> straight<00:06:10.849> out<00:06:10.879> of<00:06:11.000> the<00:06:11.150> box

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
so this is straight out of the box

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.839
