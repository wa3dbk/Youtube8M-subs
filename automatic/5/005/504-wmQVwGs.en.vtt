the nursery rhyme goes it's four and
twenty<00:02:08.979> blackbirds<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:10.030> what<00:02:10.239> does<00:02:10.330> that

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
twenty blackbirds so what does that

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.839 
twenty blackbirds so what does that
really<00:02:10.720> add<00:02:10.869> up<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.260> four<00:02:12.040> four<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.400> twenty<00:02:12.790> is

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
really add up to four four and twenty is

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.600 
really add up to four four and twenty is
probably<00:02:13.450> eighty<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.190> some<00:02:15.430> way<00:02:15.580> to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
probably eighty so we have some way to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.570 
probably eighty so we have some way to
go<00:02:15.760> before<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.270> can<00:02:16.480> make<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.690> pie<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.580> think

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
go before we can make a pie I think

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.190 
go before we can make a pie I think
we're<00:02:18.670> gonna<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.880> not<00:02:19.600> even<00:02:19.840> enough<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.050> a

good as I hoped it was going to be we
picked<00:05:18.950> 76<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:20.190> thought<00:05:20.880> we'd<00:05:21.090> get<00:05:21.350> between<00:05:22.350> 120

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
picked 76 I thought we'd get between 120

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.370 
picked 76 I thought we'd get between 120
150<00:05:23.820> so<00:05:24.360> it's<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.510> bit<00:05:24.630> disappointing<00:05:24.780> on<00:05:25.260> that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
150 so it's a bit disappointing on that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.500 
150 so it's a bit disappointing on that
to<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:25.950> point<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.250> view<00:05:26.400> we<00:05:27.090> were<00:05:27.240> going<00:05:27.450> to

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
to the point of view we were going to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.210 
to the point of view we were going to
round<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.780> off<00:05:27.930> with<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.170> nice<00:05:28.380> BBQ<00:05:29.010> with<00:05:29.190> a

disposable BBQ which between us is a

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.310 
disposable BBQ which between us is a
pretty<00:05:39.150> poor<00:05:39.390> effort<00:05:39.780> for<00:05:40.050> sort<00:05:40.260> of

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
pretty poor effort for sort of

together<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:43.110> right<00:05:43.260> thing<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.680> two<00:05:43.830> can't

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
together the right thing and two can't

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.850 
together the right thing and two can't
make<00:05:44.280> fire<00:05:44.640> I<00:05:44.930> think<00:05:45.930> this<00:05:46.260> series<00:05:46.470> might<00:05:46.770> be

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
make fire I think this series might be

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.220 
make fire I think this series might be
doomed<00:05:47.070> there's<00:05:47.640> not<00:05:47.850> we<00:05:48.240> will<00:05:48.420> eat<00:05:48.630> branches

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
doomed there's not we will eat branches

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.800 
doomed there's not we will eat branches
next<00:05:49.650> year<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:50.130> even<00:05:50.460> crow<00:05:51.060> at<00:05:51.270> some<00:05:51.540> point

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
next year and even crow at some point

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.780 
next year and even crow at some point
maybe<00:05:52.560> some<00:05:52.890> of<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.130> can<00:05:53.310> tell<00:05:53.430> us<00:05:53.460> what<00:05:53.700> it

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
maybe some of you can tell us what it

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.890 
maybe some of you can tell us what it
tastes<00:05:54.060> like<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:54.720> best<00:05:55.020> way<00:05:55.260> to<00:05:55.290> cook<00:05:55.680> it
