00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.460 

and<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:49.040> basically<00:04:50.040> at<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.090> simple<00:04:51.930> man<00:04:52.140> now

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
and I so basically at a simple man now

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.320 
and I so basically at a simple man now
there's<00:04:52.920> a<00:04:53.070> simpler<00:04:53.550> way<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:53.730> do<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.120> if<00:04:54.240> you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
there's a simpler way to do it if you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.210 
there's a simpler way to do it if you
think<00:04:54.510> that's<00:04:54.690> too<00:04:54.930> hard<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.950> do<00:04:59.100> the

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
think that's too hard and you do the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.180 
think that's too hard and you do the
same<00:04:59.250> thing<00:04:59.700> as<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.850> walk<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.480> string<00:05:01.020> open<00:05:01.590> two

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
same thing as a walk a string open two

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:11.350 
same thing as a walk a string open two
three<00:05:03.500> and

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360
