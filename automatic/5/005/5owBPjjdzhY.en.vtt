think nowadays sprites won't you go for

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.200 
think nowadays sprites won't you go for
everything<00:03:56.770> something<00:03:57.310> unique<00:03:57.700> they<00:03:57.970> want<00:03:58.150> to

try<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:59.430> no<00:04:00.430> bride<00:04:00.730> will<00:04:01.000> actually<00:04:01.420> go

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
try and no bride will actually go

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.200

looking<00:04:02.230> like<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:02.590> for<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:03.070> wedding<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:04.090> they

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
looking like this for a wedding but they

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.050 
looking like this for a wedding but they
always<00:04:04.390> want<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.900> reveal<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.860> body<00:04:06.550> beauty

always want to reveal that body beauty

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.820 
always want to reveal that body beauty
to<00:04:07.330> their<00:04:07.630> husbands<00:04:08.110> on<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.500> wedding<00:04:08.650> night

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
and I think this is for that's why we

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.620 
and I think this is for that's why we
have<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.650> male<00:04:11.860> in<00:04:12.070> there<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.640> appreciate<00:04:13.330> the
