00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.050
 remember those times when you don't need 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 It was necessary to update the hardware to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.940
 play your favorite games or when to shoot 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.369
 It was necessary with a gun straight TV and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.039
 even better to start the game first you need 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.560
 it was to find a special channel 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.769
 in those childhood days we will be back for a couple 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.900
 minutes hi everyone drank with you and it's top 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:35.520
 5 games on the channel and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.950
 game went to start I would like to play 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.960
 which all skills most often reduced to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.140
 violently pressing all the gamepad buttons 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.420
 and so remember the mortal fightin childhood 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.090
 kombat I think many people remember these 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.969
 bloodthirsty fights chance of sung ladies show us 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.710
 broken joysticks shattered nerves 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.170
 and maybe a great victory over his 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 friends even remember how you went 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 walk with them on the street and started 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.170
 apply different abilities like 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.840
 heroes from the game but it is very impossible to deny 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.309
 the fact that she made a significant contribution to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.740
 our children's development 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 fighting fly dengan of course but about him 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.119
 you can't tell too much 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.369
 the plot there is no there therefore we will not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:21.119
 stay long and go straight to 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.979
 fourth and place and now I suggest 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.200
 remember you which one escaped from school 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.689
 hurry home to see the block 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.619
 favorite cartoons such as chip and dale and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.530
 black cloak 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.110
 and after viewing they took the console started 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.390
 play for the same characters and so it is 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.909
 will go about platforming where we find ourselves 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.870
 in urban locations pick up items 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.170
 and use them as weapons 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.480
 namely the chip idea I had such 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.030
 multiplayer opportunity to hurl 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.740
 another enemy or vice versa when 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.470
 play for example sister and she 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.100
 constantly then the pit will fall and and the dogs 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.710
 will eat 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.080
 take her and carry the whole level on yourself 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.870
 and at this moment from the side began 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.630
 wild squeals by type let me 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.910
 I'm not telling you right away will be bad 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.369
 In general, there is something to remember the plot of the game 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.740
 such is the famous villain fatfoot escaped 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.080
 from prison and plans to steal into an urn 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.060
 Pharaoh and to the great rescuer not 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.200
 were able to disrupt his plans he 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.330
 takes a number 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.570
 distractions with which 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.610
 have to face our hero for 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.950
 many hours hanging out and good 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:34.150
 plot with numerous dialogues game 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.160
 gets fourth place in our top well 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.340
 and without departing from the subject of video games 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.620
 Wash the show, remember, too, was still 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.080
 horror flying on the wings of the night who loved 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.060
 all parts of the movie people in black well and who 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.280
 frankly not really love 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.150
 procured white light clothes on 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.370
 sales 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.890
 Sarin time as you probably already 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.470
 guessed it will be a black cloak 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.360
 This is another 2D platformer which 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.209
 left us to sit for hours 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.880
 TVs and pass impassable 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.940
 level we play as a duck 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.100
 drake nicknamed the black cape plot 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.650
 straightforward and independent of any 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.590
 prehistory black cloak must save 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.140
 your favorite city is son connor 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.879
 7 villains and get to the leader of this 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.280
 steel beak 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.500
 I remember when I came to school and me 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.140
 started on the classics brag about what they 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.150
 passed this game and why is each 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.040
 friend had a different ending someone 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.610
 said it was a black crying casting on 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.980
 the moon 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.200
 someone swore that clicking on different 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.470
 keys they managed to jump over the barrier 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.840
 for which there was a bonus level but how 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.480
 just came home asking to go 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.840
 her and show all this secret final 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.390
 part all the time something went wrong then 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.630
 after all, mom or friend called home 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.480
 the game supposedly hung or just she did not 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.849
 managed to get through to the end in general black 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.940
 the cloak was a long time the cause of many 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.500
 discussions among the youth of those years for all 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.140
 these qualities and the black 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:15.280
 duck ranks third in 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:18.160
 our top you can argue about 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.530
 what games should be in which place 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.950
 After all, really cool projects are very 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.400
 many more can argue and Mowgli and more 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.979
 how can i can trust battle thai but 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.070
 they are clearly inferior in their fame 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.020
 the legendary and most famous game of ours 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.840
 childhood super mario bros 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.590
 everyone knows about famous plumbers 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.320
 May and his brother luigi by the way the name 2 i 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.020
 always forgot why these main characters 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.599
 for 30 years now we have not been with us 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.419
 quiet plumbers all over the world and all 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.490
 I don’t know if, after 10 years 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.449
 my child to the question what is mario 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.639
 or not but i will never forget this game 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.069
 by the way, as well as did not try to pass it 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.879
 I didn't have the patience to walk 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.309
 to end 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.999
 and maybe I didn’t remember I didn’t remember it 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.339
 has long been 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:10.830
 but I will say one thing for me personally 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:13.710
 go through the whole game without jumping to others 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.349
 the levels were just impossible i'm sure 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.020
 that every 20 year old man at least once 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.210
 his life playing mario maybe even 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.159
 the same world of tanks were not 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.740
 as popular as the two pro game 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.430
 plumbers and princess and although maybe i 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.069
 am wrong 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.439
 The goal of the game is to pass the mushroom 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.689
 kingdoms on their way to their princess 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:36.029
 you like the video meet a soldier 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.919
 King's cube and who try all sorts 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.949
 ways to prevent you from getting to 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.110
 dragon's lair well and along the way you collect 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.659
 gold coins hitting blocks with 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.539
 question mark to your stone head 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.939
 or do not know to call and seek out 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.740
 secret vaults of brick coins 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.080

 just the great-grandfather of all super heavy 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.879
 powerful iron and rattling scary 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.509
 and dangerous predecessor in the world of 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.419
 tanks 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.729
 arcade called battle city well or 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.080
 call the battle city whatever you want or 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.930
 just tanchiki 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.509
 Polygon action visible from above the player 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.639
 must control your tanks destroy 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:34.889
 all enemies at the level that gradually 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.099
 Vertu playing field appear 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.889
 win either 1 or with a friend and must 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:43.620
 haul beta 20 tanks here and 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:46.620
 justice 15 tanks 15 enemies in 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.169
 water can not destroy from the street in childhood 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.449
 I bent alone all 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.360
 on the way you will have to print empty 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.189
 brick and concrete walls but the most 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.249
 it was cool when you were going 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:07:00.590
 asterisks and pumped up your tank you are buried 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:03.499
 can you say was unbeatable for the time being 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:06.259
 I remember, I remember how it was possible 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:08.389
 key insoles go directly to 40 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.639
 level but then play was just not 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.349
 interest why this old man conquered 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.110
 hearts from everyone to love from something 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.879
 super heavy on wheels though still 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.189
 don't understand why we always wanted 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:22.310
 play yellow tanchik 

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:25.099
 least i countries our top 100 in 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.469
 90s tanks were ahead of the whole planet 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:30.020
 Now apparently this topic to save 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:31.939
 leading position for many years what 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.550
 I would like to say a conclusion like me 

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:36.849
 spoke earlier many more was real 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.770
 cool games that were spent 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:42.919
 quite a lot of baby time instead 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.860
 festivities but all of them fail together 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:48.860
 such a short choice I want to bring 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.360
 total don't forget what helped you 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.699

 pleasure and so sudden was 

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:57.529
