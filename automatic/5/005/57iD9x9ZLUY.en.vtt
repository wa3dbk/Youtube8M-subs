00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
and I just decided that was probably

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.689 
and I just decided that was probably
time<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.739> me<00:00:46.949> to<00:00:47.159> kind<00:00:47.339> of<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> step

time for me to kind of take a step
forward<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.769> I've<00:00:49.769> been<00:00:49.979> a<00:00:50.010> promoter<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
forward and I've been a promoter at that

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:51.920 
forward and I've been a promoter at that
point<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.239> making<00:00:51.540> some<00:00:51.659> good<00:00:51.809> money

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
point it was making some good money

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.169 
point it was making some good money
promoting<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:53.129> economy<00:00:53.640> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.940> fell

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
imagined it been like some kind of a

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.390 
imagined it been like some kind of a
springy<00:04:43.850> bed<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.540> know<00:04:44.660> but<00:04:45.110> I<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:46.070> remember

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
springy bed you know but I just remember

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.040

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
can't this can't be right like this

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.320 
can't this can't be right like this
someone<00:04:54.289> has<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.620> be<00:04:54.740> ribbing<00:04:55.280> us<00:04:55.370> here<00:04:55.610> or<00:04:55.789> you

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
someone has to be ribbing us here or you

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.659 
someone has to be ribbing us here or you
know<00:04:56.449> read<00:04:56.690> this<00:04:57.020> this<00:04:57.440> just<00:04:57.860> isn't<00:04:58.099> real<00:04:58.370> even

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669

hitting<00:04:58.909> the<00:04:59.030> ring<00:04:59.300> ropes

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
hitting the ring ropes

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.230 
hitting the ring ropes
I<00:04:59.840> mean<00:05:00.530> it's<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.190> tough<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.789> mean<00:05:01.819> the<00:05:02.000> ropes

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
I mean it's so tough I mean the ropes

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.790 
I mean it's so tough I mean the ropes
are<00:05:02.449> just<00:05:02.629> so<00:05:02.810> tough<00:05:03.139> on<00:05:03.319> your<00:05:03.440> back<00:05:03.620> but

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
are just so tough on your back but

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.260 
are just so tough on your back but
eventually<00:05:04.069> it<00:05:04.310> back<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.639> a<00:05:04.699> thumbs<00:05:04.909> up<00:05:05.090> and

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
eventually it back to a thumbs up and

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.480 
eventually it back to a thumbs up and
eventually<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.080> kind<00:05:06.289> of<00:05:06.440> learn<00:05:07.009> to<00:05:07.039> protect

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
eventually you kind of learn to protect

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.920 
eventually you kind of learn to protect
yourself<00:05:07.879> a<00:05:07.970> bit<00:05:08.090> better<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.509> then<00:05:08.599> once<00:05:08.840> you

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
yourself a bit better and then once you

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.330 
yourself a bit better and then once you
have<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:09.289> down<00:05:09.530> you<00:05:09.680> can<00:05:09.800> start<00:05:09.979> learning

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
have that down you can start learning

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.950 
have that down you can start learning
the<00:05:10.430> other<00:05:10.550> aspects<00:05:10.970> of<00:05:11.120> in<00:05:11.360> terms<00:05:11.539> of<00:05:11.750> what

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
the other aspects of in terms of what

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.899 
the other aspects of in terms of what
goes<00:05:12.500> into<00:05:12.919> putting<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.370> match<00:05:13.580> the

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
goes into putting the match the

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.240 
goes into putting the match the
psychology<00:05:14.509> of<00:05:14.599> a<00:05:14.629> match<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.710> know<00:05:15.830> kind<00:05:16.190> of

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
psychology of a match you know kind of

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.279 
psychology of a match you know kind of
how<00:05:16.849> you<00:05:16.909> work<00:05:17.240> different<00:05:17.659> opponents<00:05:18.199> and

you're busting your ass then we probably

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.040 
you're busting your ass then we probably
need<00:06:06.979> to<00:06:07.069> multiply<00:06:07.400> it<00:06:07.729> by<00:06:07.849> 10<00:06:08.300> you<00:06:08.840> don't<00:06:08.960> I

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
need to multiply it by 10 you don't I

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.430
