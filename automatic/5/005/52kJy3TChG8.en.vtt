00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.690
 I greet all with you damn 19th 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.580
 6 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.820
 and in 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.880
 there we will be a video 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.090
 comfortable fight it goes literally now it 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.539
 not a replay why i decided to actually 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.150
 make this video generally went into battle 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.130
 this is the second fight on the t-28 under the previous ones 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.699
 recently such that with tremendous results 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.730
 with tens quickly lost or in general 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.440
 I got here in this fight on the card at 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.160
 This wonderful Severogorsk on this 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 republic 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.720
 and I immediately remembered how I 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.720
 last time i was here with this 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.629
 parties on the spawn on the prototype then I am rude 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.610
 by saying 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.090
 drove to this stone here and then 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.260
 Stones I roughly speaking and died in general 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.940
 it prompted me 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.579
 while loading map updates 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.080
 cards include programs for recording 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.720
 general write down what comes out of it 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.500
 I will explain why I did not go here 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.080
 see for yourself oak stands 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.660
 out of 734 kV-4 t110 i 4 is worth it there 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.460
 I missed 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.580
 this is true because well 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.180
 really need to stand here and defit well this 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.270
 fact if you you sit down guys from a hill 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 will shoot you get into the board 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.770
 plus art will shoot you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.689
 actually there is enemy artillery 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.979
 batchat he level 10 later drum so 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.979
 Well, like 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.700
 seems to be playing cool already almost 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.700
 drive up the hills 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.350
 I wish I could speed this 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.350
 process because it is not a replay 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.710
 so 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.790
 replay can be squandered on prototype in 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.630
 randomized 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.630
 crawl 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.620
 I don't know how ours is this one 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:23.210
 fellow prototype there is already on 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.800
 the hill that went through the center to the word 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.460
 say i have top engine here 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.460
 worth 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.190
 the caterpillars carried 2 on the top so 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.720
 maybe because 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.720
 stock running and so slow ezhzhi 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.050
 although I think it's not true 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.540
 I feel I will never finish 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.040
 where to go pour or legs or go 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.460
 directly and incomprehensibly likely to go 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.460
 straight 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.920
 so see we see there is a machine 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.690
 thrown at random 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:23.920
 more precisely, so it all ended passant 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:23.920
 freebie freebie up to could so 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.790
 so could you all notice me 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.390
 habit of saying the word so as not to 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.390
 not to be silent 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.830
 here you need to choose or be silent or 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.830
 talk like that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.970
 and I came up with a new word instead of tank 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.360
 IS-3 stand stand stand stand is that the same 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.950
 such a 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.790
 and shells don't want people themselves so what 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.080
 we have everything there 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.080
 prototype is over 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.670
 ho john so let us down dad there are 3 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.950
 of 3 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.720
 behind the house here he comes out 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.540
 got out got naturally naturally down 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.380
 the projectile should also fly this game 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.790
 called the shell go down 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:31.040
 as many as 42 picked up at your feet and you're lucky 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.490
 or not as well as all tops and well we 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.490
 made 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:44.050
 as well as you could understand everything that is 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.050
 the very battle where the allies are dragging 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:56.430
 so 48 then I will reach you or not 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.530
 I do not even know maybe charge gold 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:09.910
 on the way I have stock gun 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:14.770
 break through 198 bebashkami although they say dad 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:21.280
 not booked find out how he 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:26.350
 cardboard harmony worth feels now 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:29.230
 the main thing zafilit with 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:33.030
 but something to have a conscience but does not shoot 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:35.680
 and I remember armored with sticks 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:40.830
 or not bears 54 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.830
 replace 1 part 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:06:00.240
 the selective shoot well here Ukhta 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:00.240
 bend and let me let me not give it 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:18.550
 Well, naturally we will not be given art but 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.550
 how does she finish the name 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:36.530
 2 and 7 you can IS-7 which could but 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:40.430
 Cheer up the results of the battle it will end in 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:45.240
 the final stage of our video 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:49.080
 victory here is such a equipage 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.750
 by the way on the prototype junk naguchy me 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.710
 somehow regretted his cat 49 shoot 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.710
 the crew here are suffering on the sly though all 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.430
 the sufferings on the prototype are not related to this 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.260
 crew and 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.270
 so that he goes very slowly 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.050
 maximum speed of 18 kilometers 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:09.120
 h's got such a such a 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.740
