00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.110
 Should we be sewoya basically strengthen your heart when you exercise 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:17.110
 It's possible 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:22.540
 I think the basic posture is very important in table tennis, 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:25.570
 I think that's the kind of attitude that makes our center strong. 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:29.259
 There are three central axes in our body. 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:35.559
 Lee crashed coming in his neck in neck 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:38.410
 Neck muscles connect the head and the upper body. 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.260
 Depending on the movement, 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.640
 It's the history of a chest that balances the body . 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:52.359
 And the other one, our center of gravity is on the side of the dagoon below 100 books. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:58.870
 From the overall center of gravity center of gravity center of gravity, but its rear side, the waist 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.679
 This waist vertebra plays a very important role in supporting the entire upper body 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.110
 I will 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:06.580
 And there is another part, the bones of the bone, the lower body and upper body 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.329
 Connect to giving 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.590
 There are three axes that balance my body. 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:18.270
 We have to make these three axes cool. 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:23.729
 In other words , 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:30.240
 Strengthen and reinforce the tyrants and back muscles that can lay the waist down 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:36.020
 And this tag , Mrs. Joint, will fire the thigh of this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:41.190
 It is very important to strengthen these three central axes by strengthening them . 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:46.830
 But we can do this through the sewojul I exercise daily, but 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:51.929
 There are also ways in which we can exercise in life, let me first 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.720
 When do we feed my neck forward mosquitoes attention to the great number of muscles in the neck 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:58.579
 And it gives me a commission. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.829
 Join the blessed Nas tower 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:06.710
 If you see a distant place and you can see far and comes carried in public 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.819
 When I go down to the part of the hand looks 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:15.349
 So , because I'm in a state of spitting eyes, 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.580
 The first time we match the balance that balances our body 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.209
 The snow. 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.400
 Basing the neck is tightened to secure the chin to the eye 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.110
 Let's go to the second , we shoulder the shoulders and cover the chest 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.120
 If so 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.200
 And we have 2 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.250
 It is so tightened the two arms and a Tighten your arms back to the inside 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 This will return the next location and 3 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.810
 And bowed slightly at the waist in this state, 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.489
 And the party in the state that gave strength is the kitchen where we should ever sleep May 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:56.959
 In a tight nose that had 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.959
 Spit it out. So when you drank , 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.880
 And the worst is when you spit the 200 family, including the family of Bucheon rest 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.880
 About 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:17.810
 And this is the last time we say movement as a system. 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:23.270
 This was the second pulley when tightening the river to drink a deep breath when you breathe 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:28.610
 When we exercise, our body center becomes quite solid. 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:33.950
 If you do not walk and walk with your shoulders and your jaws in this state 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:38.660
 We are very good and comfortable, the body itself is comfortable 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:44.150
 This effectively serves to build up the bones of this spine 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.310
 I use this posture and apply the basic posture of the application . 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:52.760
 I think this posture is developed material 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.080
 When yonom this state of taking the position e to give thus tightened to the side 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.260
 naturally 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.090
 Make forehand drive backswing 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:07.660
 So huge, so I made in the state in everyday life 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.660
 When we sit down, do not just sit down. 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:26.480
 And in the state of gathering to have legs, this side also tightens this state 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.120
 Car 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:36.170
 When you do your work, your body becomes very relaxed . 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.290
 If you do a double-breasted breathing exercise or a Kegel exercise , 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:46.100
 You will feel that getting Qingdao 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:51.440
 I want to become a table tennis or through our bodies healthy 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.300
 That's our Armed Forces have stood the central axis because the purpose of the best sport for 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.770
 When 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:02.060
 The top part is getting better and the health of our body is also good. 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.800
 This is not a state in the shower between the primary characters are just completely defendant shoulder 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.919
 Raise the chin and hold the state 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.919
 I think maintaining this state is the main place for table tennis.
