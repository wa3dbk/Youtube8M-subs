good<00:01:34.900> um<00:01:38.369> yeah<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:40.270> think<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.920> this<00:01:42.759> match<00:01:43.119> is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
good um yeah I think that this match is

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.789 
good um yeah I think that this match is
probably<00:01:43.810> one<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.080> best<00:01:44.229> matches<00:01:44.649> i've

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
probably one of the best matches i've

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.020 
probably one of the best matches i've
had<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.070> awhile<00:01:45.159> because<00:01:45.520> I've<00:01:45.759> just<00:01:45.909> been
