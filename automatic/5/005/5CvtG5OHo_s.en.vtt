00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
32 years or going down the road but I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
32 years or going down the road but I
think<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.329> has<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
think a lot of that has to do with the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.370 
think a lot of that has to do with the
frame<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> mind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> horse<00:01:05.100> too<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.659> but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
frame of mind of the horse too and but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
frame of mind of the horse too and but
that's<00:01:07.590> true<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.979> people<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:08.670> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that's true with people if they're if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.789 
that's true with people if they're if
they're<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.080> frame<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.350> mind<00:01:10.470> if

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
they're in a good frame of mind if

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.109 
they're in a good frame of mind if
they're<00:01:10.950> comfortable<00:01:11.369> within<00:01:11.700> themselves

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
they're comfortable within themselves

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.960 
they're comfortable within themselves
they<00:01:12.330> tend<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.080> healthier<00:01:13.970> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
they tend to be quite a bit healthier so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.320 
they tend to be quite a bit healthier so

when you're traveling biosecurity is
often<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.990> concern<00:01:19.680> when<00:01:19.920> our<00:01:20.009> horses<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.549> at

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
often a concern when our horses are at

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
horses for me I do the basic

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.550 
horses for me I do the basic
vaccinations<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.659> really<00:01:30.659> once<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> horse<00:01:31.380> has

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
vaccinations but really once a horse has

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
vaccinations but really once a horse has
been<00:01:31.740> hauled<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.460> bit<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.790> when

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
been hauled it's a little bit like when

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.999 
been hauled it's a little bit like when
you<00:01:33.060> send<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.450> kid<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> school<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.799> they've
