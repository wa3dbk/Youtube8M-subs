00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 this week we test the best 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.640
 onion rings with bacon on the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.640
 barbecue 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.310
 so here is the famous best 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.310
 onion rings to cook on the 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.020
 barbecue and gbagbo mixes me I 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.590
 still find it just like that I 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.610
 can not wait to listen 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.500
 so all you need 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.079
 to flaunt itunes and you cut a 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.390
 big onion rings like that and 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.710
 you will be enrobing your round people 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.329
 give of them because his mother two 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:46.539
 sabers to other big stakes c who 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:49.719
 is more nerdy put a mask done 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:55.269
 always hot more unfair practices 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:58.739
 and then resented that you 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.420
 pierce from edge to edge the puck 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.819
 and the lived experience so that they convey 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.210
 really stand around the death of 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.800
 two men 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.500
 we are trim for wood buyers 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.600
 we are wrong on the barbecue 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.189
 we monitor them with powders we do not have 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.229
 of time indication we just do 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.719
 monitored monitor because we want 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.969
 do not miss the bacon in the mountains 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.039
 have lived 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.200
 the time is at the dyke it is long we have 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.700
 cook the sliced ​​onion rings 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.920
 20 minutes on the barbecue 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.060
 we turned thighs years and I 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.840
 they eat the big hand lego on 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:47.670
 tasted and disgusted with a snack and 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:51.009
 to taste these pigs one can even 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.100
 push the audacity to baste the union 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.789
 of barbecue sauce actually a 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.789
 good idea
