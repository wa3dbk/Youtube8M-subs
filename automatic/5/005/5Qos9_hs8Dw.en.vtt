art going through it the process for

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.640 
art going through it the process for
creating<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.560> pieces<00:02:50.359> varies<00:02:51.359> from<00:02:52.319> piece<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
creating the pieces varies from piece to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.210 
creating the pieces varies from piece to
piece<00:02:53.600> overall<00:02:54.600> I'll<00:02:54.959> say<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.530> kind<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.130> a

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
piece overall I'll say it's kind of a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.550 
piece overall I'll say it's kind of a
collaborative<00:02:56.609> process<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.870> there's<00:02:58.139> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
collaborative process but there's a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.120 
collaborative process but there's a
vision<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.670> very<00:02:59.940> specific<00:03:00.950> there's<00:03:01.950> an

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
vision that's very specific there's an

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.819 
vision that's very specific there's an
idea<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.180> DEA's<00:03:03.590> thoughts<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.799> I

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
idea but there DEA's thoughts that I

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:05.479 
idea but there DEA's thoughts that I
come<00:03:05.069> up<00:03:05.220> with

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
come up with

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.000 
come up with
then<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.209> present<00:03:06.660> them<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.170> musicians<00:03:07.769> and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
then I present them to the musicians and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.740 
then I present them to the musicians and
dancers<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.850> figure<00:03:09.750> out<00:03:09.810> how<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.109> execute<00:03:10.530> I

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
dancers and figure out how to execute I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.990 
dancers and figure out how to execute I
think<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:12.900> also<00:03:13.109> fine<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.040> begin<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
think it's also fine to begin to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.150 
think it's also fine to begin to
improvise<00:03:15.389> without<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> defined<00:03:16.410> idea<00:03:16.859> but

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
improvise without a defined idea but

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.979 
improvise without a defined idea but
you've<00:03:17.310> got<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.819> an<00:03:17.910> even<00:03:18.209> better<00:03:18.329> listener

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
you've got to be an even better listener

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.280 
you've got to be an even better listener
to<00:03:19.650> hear<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:21.000> ideas<00:03:21.389> it<00:03:21.569> comes<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:22.049> fruition

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to hear the ideas it comes to fruition

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.250 
to hear the ideas it comes to fruition
and<00:03:22.680> then<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.579> also<00:03:23.819> becomes

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
and then and then it also becomes

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.920 
and then and then it also becomes
subjective<00:03:25.260> because<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:26.670> know<00:03:26.930> sometimes

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
subjective because you know sometimes

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.440 
subjective because you know sometimes
art<00:03:28.380> becomes<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.799> relative<00:03:29.250> question<00:03:29.459> but<00:03:30.299> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
art becomes a relative question but this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.520 
art becomes a relative question but this
is<00:03:30.660> where<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.049> find<00:03:31.639> those<00:03:32.639> who<00:03:33.000> move<00:03:33.530> alike

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
is where you find those who move alike
