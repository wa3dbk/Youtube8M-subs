00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.730
 then we are gentlemen in this video I would like 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:08.429
 show how it works with us or more precisely 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.070
 omyvayki not work in cold weather despite the fact 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.419
 that the car has heating nozzles 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.340
 nonetheless the sense of it is zero integer 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.720
 zero tenths with this problem in winter 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.170
 the real layer will collide very 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.210
 often 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 shoulder show trunk right here at me 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.499
 is omyvayka which is flooded on the street 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.019
 the night was minus 20 now -15 I will show 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's on the dashboard that's flooded smoothly 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.040
 the same Malay can be seen that she is calm 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.990
 splashing ie she is not frozen here 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.780
 this right bug lay all night in 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.770
 trunk temperature is equal to temperature 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 ambient with nevertheless calm 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.610
 it splashing great problem in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.870
 briskly in liquid form 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 closed the trunk show all 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.440
 works in fact and so -13 showed well 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 in fact on the street -15 gismeteo in general 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.520
 showed -18 at night was minus 20 if 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.450
 what can you then check the floor well there 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.680
 it's already a twin calendar today , January 6 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.640
 2013 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.390
 So 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.240
 your look online is quite a marriage but 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.060
 become their service by already turned off 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.130
 the heat button is turned off literally 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.320
 max a minute ago he that is she already 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.680
 worked one full cycle heating 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.510
 mirrors I understand that it should also 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:41.560
 nozzles must be heated 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.570
 warmed look how it works 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.259
 way so it was obvious that I am including 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.259
 switch 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:56.110
 so I press the top 0.0 note this 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.110
 fully worked 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 heating 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.300
 nozzles well actually all the glass and so 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.060
 Further, that is, sense 0 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.640
 I can see further here not 2 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.550
 in honor and I can say they have a 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.930
 a few minutes ago I tried 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.930
 before you record a video 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.599
 pour water on 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.390
 windshield at first slightly 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.860
 squirted out 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.700
 left but also show after two three minutes 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.319
 tried it silent was fingered a little bit 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.240
 of it but literally a little bit that is 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.730
 there janitors ate for business here so here 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 We work well, just a little show how u 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.380
 us running backside you can see here it is 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.040
 went heating 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.709
 but what is the meaning of 0.0 I don't know if it will be 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.840
 heard on video but 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.680
 a motor or what the pump is there they work 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.250
 that is, I hear the sound of a pump that 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.170
 the same with the rear like but at the same time 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.360
 sense from him zero point zero 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.350
 instead of rejoicing in such a cold 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.910
 especially 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.330
 there will be no dirt but when there is snow porridge 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.930
 special 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.409
 on the street very often you know by 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.010
 the camera in Moscow I am those who live some 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.629
 now chemistry is splashing on the dirt 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.629
 maybe even at minus 10 degrees 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.769
 I'm on the street now -15 though I walked 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:40.620
 there was water in my yard 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.290
 I do not know what they are pelvis and spot under your feet 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.720
 there was water because at night it was minus 20 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.730
 now where are you minus 15 degrees so 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.290
 on the track now face contaminated 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.640
 hair heat you can easily 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.250
 but wash this windshield you did 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.950
 can not by the way on the video but in principle 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.200
 I splashed it would be visible but not 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.209
 also work headlight washer well by 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.909
 at least never in that time 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.910
 any teachers worked 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.000
 quite characteristic 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.920
 about splashing scream run run out 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.540
 machines and at the same time I run 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.970
 I can this problem myself 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.359
 and as far as I understand this is the same problem 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.990
 there is also in 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.039
 new body chassis model 14 15 sock straight 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.439
 16 years pay attention to this these 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.669
 mind this when winter operation as 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:36.539
 I personally don't solve this problem 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.889
 maybe one of you will find a solution 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.750
 but here it is 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.969
 see you soon soon 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:50.870
 video about the real state of things at 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.870
 car operation volvo
