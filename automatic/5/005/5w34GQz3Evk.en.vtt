00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
control freaks and the scuf controller

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
control freaks and the scuf controller
in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> next<00:01:59.340> video<00:01:59.719> then<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.960> should<00:02:01.110> go

help you also make your decision so this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.459 
help you also make your decision so this
is<00:02:05.700> basically<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is basically what it is I'm going to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.160 
is basically what it is I'm going to
take<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.910> right<00:02:09.000> here

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
take it out of the this one right here

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.480 
take it out of the this one right here
so<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.410> all<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
so this is all it is

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.540 
so this is all it is
it's<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:12.770> that's<00:02:13.770> all<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
it's just that's all it is it's like a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.610 
it's just that's all it is it's like a
little<00:02:14.850> another<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> thumb<00:02:16.440> pad

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
little another one of the thumb pad

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.340 
little another one of the thumb pad
things<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:18.150> right<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.780> put<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.260> over

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
things this right here you put it over

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.440 
things this right here you put it over
top<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.890> controller<00:02:20.220> they're<00:02:21.120> really

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
top of your controller they're really

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.840 
top of your controller they're really
hard<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.780> get<00:02:21.960> off<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.950> know<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.610> this

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
hard to get off and on I know on this

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.960 
hard to get off and on I know on this
pretty<00:02:24.060> easy<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.230> off<00:02:25.970> they're

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
pretty easy but to get off they're

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.310 
pretty easy but to get off they're
really<00:02:27.120> hard<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.570> it's<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.050> slip<00:02:28.200> at

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
really hard so it's not going to slip at

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.960 
really hard so it's not going to slip at
all<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.890> won't<00:02:29.250> move<00:02:29.370> while<00:02:29.670> you're<00:02:29.820> playing

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
all it won't move while you're playing

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.030 
all it won't move while you're playing
and<00:02:30.810> that's<00:02:30.930> another<00:02:31.110> amazing<00:02:31.470> things<00:02:31.800> that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and that's another amazing things that

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.200 
and that's another amazing things that
was<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.430> was<00:02:32.580> also<00:02:32.910> worried

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
was the thing that was also worried

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.250 
was the thing that was also worried
about<00:02:33.300> when<00:02:34.520> buying<00:02:35.520> these<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.020> on

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
about when buying these so here it is on

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.530 
about when buying these so here it is on
my<00:02:37.380> scuf<00:02:37.650> controller<00:02:38.040> right<00:02:38.610> here<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.450> can

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
my scuf controller right here as you can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.590 
my scuf controller right here as you can
see<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> left<00:02:40.080> one<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.740> very<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:42.120> short

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
see the left one it's very like short

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.510 
see the left one it's very like short
which<00:02:43.170> means<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> only<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.890> move<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.100> right

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
which means it only can move to right

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.360 
which means it only can move to right
there<00:02:45.680> hold<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:46.770> i'm<00:02:46.860> going<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> try<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.160> do

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
there hold on i'm going to try to do

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.370 
there hold on i'm going to try to do
this<00:02:47.490> there<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.780> can't<00:02:48.960> really<00:02:49.080> see<00:02:49.200> this

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
this there you can't really see this

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.590 
this there you can't really see this
that<00:02:49.530> well<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.850> only<00:02:51.000> goes<00:02:51.120> over<00:02:51.570> a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
that well but it only goes over a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.870 
that well but it only goes over a
certain<00:02:51.960> distance<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.610> being

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
certain distance but with this being

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.230 
certain distance but with this being
longer<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.900> makes<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.710> so<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.090> have

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
longer it makes it so you that you have

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.770 
longer it makes it so you that you have
to<00:02:57.360> move<00:02:57.600> more<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.240> that

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
to move more that you have to have that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.480 
to move more that you have to have that
means<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.170> have<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.350> move<00:03:01.650> more<00:03:02.390> over<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:04.490> like

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
means you have to move more over to like

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.370 
means you have to move more over to like
proportional<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.540> move<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.170> thumb

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
proportional you have to move the thumb

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.480 
proportional you have to move the thumb
stick<00:03:07.740> more<00:03:08.660> because<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:09.840> taller<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.340> that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
stick more because it's taller so that

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.610 
stick more because it's taller so that
means<00:03:11.700> your<00:03:12.060> precision<00:03:12.390> aiming<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:13.380> going<00:03:13.560> to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
means your precision aiming is going to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.610 
means your precision aiming is going to
be<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.740> lot<00:03:14.070> better<00:03:14.210> because<00:03:15.560> instead<00:03:16.560> of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
be a lot better because instead of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.860 
be a lot better because instead of
having<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> do<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.910> thing<00:03:18.180> right<00:03:18.210> here<00:03:18.390> just

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
having to do this thing right here just

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.900 
having to do this thing right here just
like<00:03:19.020> try<00:03:19.710> to<00:03:19.770> move<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.190> over<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.700> gets<00:03:20.820> a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
like try to move it over and it gets a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.130 
like try to move it over and it gets a
little<00:03:21.000> really<00:03:21.390> jerky<00:03:21.780> when<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.960> have<00:03:22.050> to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
little really jerky when you have to

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.290 
little really jerky when you have to
make<00:03:22.290> small<00:03:23.010> adjustments<00:03:23.160> across<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.120> map

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
make small adjustments across the map

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.260 
make small adjustments across the map
this<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.650> can<00:03:25.830> move<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.070> more<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.670> it's

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
this you can move it more and it's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.110 
this you can move it more and it's
easier<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.750> break<00:03:27.960> away<00:03:28.140> from<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.620> little

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
easier to break away from the little

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.610 
easier to break away from the little
Center<00:03:30.120> if<00:03:30.870> you're<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.290> controller

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
Center if you're going to a controller

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.920 
Center if you're going to a controller
you<00:03:31.740> can<00:03:31.770> go<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.630> really<00:03:33.630> lightly

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
you can go like this like really lightly

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.430 
you can go like this like really lightly
and<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:35.130> won't<00:03:35.370> break<00:03:35.640> away<00:03:35.850> from<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.440> dead

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.900 
spot of the thumbstick and this breaks
away<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:40.080> easy<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.550> move<00:03:41.730> it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
away really easy and you have to move it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.760 
away really easy and you have to move it
a<00:03:41.940> less<00:03:42.690> distance<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.620> be<00:03:43.740> more

long range gunfights and that's

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840 
long range gunfights and that's
basically<00:04:10.080> what<00:04:10.350> it's<00:04:10.470> used<00:04:10.590> for<00:04:10.850> personally

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
basically what it's used for personally

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.699 
basically what it's used for personally
my<00:04:12.060> opinion<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.600> think<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:13.290> improves<00:04:13.680> your

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
my opinion I think that improves your

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.930 
my opinion I think that improves your
accuracy<00:04:14.330> enough<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.640> definitely<00:04:17.640> worth

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
accuracy enough that is definitely worth

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.580 
accuracy enough that is definitely worth
it<00:04:18.120> considering<00:04:18.480> it's<00:04:18.720> only<00:04:18.900> ten<00:04:19.109> bucks<00:04:19.320> and

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
it considering it's only ten bucks and

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.060 
it considering it's only ten bucks and
as<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.160> can<00:04:20.280> see<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:20.609> look<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.900> it's<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.890> lot

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
as you can see like look the it's a lot

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.360 
as you can see like look the it's a lot
taller

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
taller

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.770 
taller
that<00:04:24.490> means<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.760> can<00:04:24.940> move<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.150> over<00:04:25.330> farther

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
that means I can move it over farther

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.879 
that means I can move it over farther
than<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.590> one<00:04:26.949> so<00:04:27.460> as<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:28.000> can<00:04:28.150> see<00:04:28.449> you<00:04:28.690> know

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
than that one so as you can see you know

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.620 
than that one so as you can see you know
they<00:04:29.889> also<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> video<00:04:30.610> where<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.300> says

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
they also have a video where it says

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.780 
they also have a video where it says
that<00:04:31.870> like<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.620> science<00:04:33.040> behind<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.520> or<00:04:33.639> ever

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
that like the science behind it or ever

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.000 
that like the science behind it or ever
on<00:04:33.970> their<00:04:34.090> website<00:04:34.479> in<00:04:34.870> a<00:04:34.960> sense<00:04:35.199> that<00:04:35.530> the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
on their website in a sense that the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.310 
on their website in a sense that the
controller<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:36.970> right<00:04:37.240> here<00:04:37.570> can<00:04:37.990> only<00:04:38.110> move

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
controller this right here can only move

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.129 
controller this right here can only move
eighty<00:04:38.650> percent<00:04:38.800> over<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:40.419> then<00:04:40.870> this<00:04:41.080> one

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
eighty percent over and then this one

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.530 
eighty percent over and then this one
can<00:04:41.410> move<00:04:41.560> one<00:04:42.070> hundred<00:04:42.400> twenty<00:04:42.430> percent<00:04:42.970> so

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
can move one hundred twenty percent so

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.850 
can move one hundred twenty percent so
it's<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:44.080> about<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.830> half<00:04:45.639> more<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:47.350> like<00:04:47.470> it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
it's just about a half more so like it

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.960 
it's just about a half more so like it
makes<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:48.820> enough<00:04:49.180> taller<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.900> it's

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
makes it just enough taller that it's

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.830 
makes it just enough taller that it's
doesn't<00:04:51.970> mess<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.300> hang<00:04:52.449> up<00:04:52.510> too<00:04:52.720> much

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
doesn't mess you hang up too much

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.860 
doesn't mess you hang up too much
clothes<00:04:53.199> and<00:04:54.000> that's<00:04:55.000> my<00:04:55.240> opinion<00:04:55.479> of<00:04:55.720> it

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
clothes and that's my opinion of it

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.050 
clothes and that's my opinion of it
right<00:04:56.050> now<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:56.860> I'm<00:04:57.190> just<00:04:57.370> going<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.550> leave

it<00:06:05.740> from<00:06:05.979> level<00:06:06.340> six<00:06:06.669> to<00:06:07.060> seven<00:06:07.479> that<00:06:07.690> means<00:06:07.870> he

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
it from level six to seven that means he

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.140 
it from level six to seven that means he
can<00:06:08.199> turn<00:06:08.830> quicker<00:06:09.190> but<00:06:09.699> he<00:06:09.789> says<00:06:10.000> he<00:06:10.090> still

can turn quicker but he says he still

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.420 
can turn quicker but he says he still
has<00:06:10.479> the<00:06:10.599> same<00:06:10.840> amount<00:06:11.020> of<00:06:11.289> accuracy<00:06:11.620> so<00:06:12.340> he

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
has the same amount of accuracy so he

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.420 
has the same amount of accuracy so he
can<00:06:12.550> turn<00:06:12.789> faster<00:06:13.330> get<00:06:13.599> on<00:06:13.979> get<00:06:14.979> on<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.190> mark

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.219 
can turn faster get on get on the mark
faster<00:06:15.910> but<00:06:16.300> he<00:06:16.360> stays<00:06:16.599> just<00:06:16.870> as<00:06:17.050> accurate

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
faster but he stays just as accurate
