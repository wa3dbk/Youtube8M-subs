00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
think I can look at everything from a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
think I can look at everything from a
different<00:00:56.850> light<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.510> retrospect<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
different light in retrospect and I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
different light in retrospect and I
actually<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.820> both<00:01:00.059> sides<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.480> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
actually can see both sides of this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.080 
actually can see both sides of this
believe<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.469> or<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.680> now<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> stay<00:01:02.969> off

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.020 
why I wanted to wait a little bit see if
maybe<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.649> week<00:01:44.130> after<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.700> had<00:01:44.820> announced

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
maybe a week after they had announced

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.100 
maybe a week after they had announced
this<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> would<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> still<00:01:46.049> been

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
this that this would have still been

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.230 
this that this would have still been
going<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.130> believe<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.850> been<00:01:47.970> less<00:01:48.210> than

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
going but I believe it's been less than

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.609 
going but I believe it's been less than
a<00:01:48.450> week<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> they've<00:01:49.259> already<00:01:49.439> announced

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
a week and they've already announced

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.219 
a week and they've already announced
both<00:01:50.040> valve<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> Bethesda<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.960> will

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
both valve and Bethesda that they will

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.660 
both valve and Bethesda that they will
be<00:01:52.320> no<00:01:52.470> longer<00:01:52.770> supporting<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.399> let<00:01:53.579> me

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
be no longer supporting this so let me

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
be no longer supporting this so let me
sum<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.270> happened<00:01:54.659> essentially<00:01:55.229> if

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290

industry so it's a win win either way
now<00:03:45.420> leading<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.989> thing<00:03:46.170> where<00:03:46.350> it's<00:03:46.440> like

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
now leading to the thing where it's like

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.259 
now leading to the thing where it's like
whoa<00:03:46.769> should<00:03:47.310> they<00:03:47.430> get<00:03:47.610> paid<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.970> their<00:03:48.120> not

whoa should they get paid to their not
well<00:03:48.510> with<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.780> original<00:03:49.019> valve<00:03:49.470> paid<00:03:49.769> mods

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
well with the original valve paid mods

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.670 
well with the original valve paid mods
my<00:03:51.239> creators<00:03:51.660> were<00:03:51.750> only<00:03:51.959> getting<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.410> think

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
my creators were only getting I think

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.650 
my creators were only getting I think
around<00:03:52.860> twenty<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.610> twenty-five<00:03:54.060> percent<00:03:54.269> of

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
around twenty to twenty-five percent of

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.020 
around twenty to twenty-five percent of
the<00:03:54.870> total<00:03:55.049> revenue<00:03:55.380> while<00:03:56.160> valve<00:03:56.610> pulled<00:03:56.940> in

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the total revenue while valve pulled in

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.090 
the total revenue while valve pulled in
I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.180> 30<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.780> Bethesda<00:03:58.290> pool<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.739> forty

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
I think 30 and Bethesda pool and forty

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.770 
I think 30 and Bethesda pool and forty
or<00:03:59.220> something<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.700> again<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.600> mod

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
or something like that again the mod

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.970 
or something like that again the mod
creator<00:04:01.110> really<00:04:01.380> didn't<00:04:01.560> get<00:04:01.620> lot<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
creator really didn't get lot but I

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.470 
creator really didn't get lot but I
guess<00:04:02.160> something<00:04:02.579> is<00:04:02.730> better<00:04:02.970> than<00:04:03.090> none<00:04:03.360> at

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
guess something is better than none at

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.360 
guess something is better than none at
all<00:04:03.570> that's<00:04:04.110> why<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.320> feel<00:04:04.709> like<00:04:04.769> there's<00:04:04.980> two

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
all that's why I feel like there's two

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.610 
all that's why I feel like there's two
ideas<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.239> have<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.410> want<00:04:07.590> to

content the second and I think the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.290 
content the second and I think the
biggest<00:04:53.340> one<00:04:53.610> which<00:04:53.730> I'm<00:04:53.880> pretty<00:04:54.000> sure<00:04:54.120> all

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
biggest one which I'm pretty sure all

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300 
biggest one which I'm pretty sure all
gamers<00:04:54.720> are<00:04:54.990> more<00:04:55.380> than<00:04:55.500> happy<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.860> agree<00:04:56.100> with

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.690 
their game if valve is a part of it I
personally<00:05:52.860> vouched<00:05:53.190> you<00:05:53.250> get<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.490> lowest

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
personally vouched you get the lowest

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.920 
personally vouched you get the lowest
cut<00:05:54.060> since<00:05:54.270> they're<00:05:54.450> really<00:05:54.660> just<00:05:54.690> the

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
cut since they're really just the

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.560 
cut since they're really just the
middleman<00:05:55.200> out<00:05:55.590> of<00:05:55.980> all<00:05:56.250> three<00:05:56.550> but<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.419> is

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
middleman out of all three but it is

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.210 
middleman out of all three but it is
they're<00:05:57.750> distributing<00:05:58.260> platform<00:05:58.770> and<00:05:59.040> they

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
they're distributing platform and they

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.380 
they're distributing platform and they
are<00:05:59.340> gonna<00:05:59.490> be<00:05:59.669> using<00:05:59.760> a<00:06:00.000> host<00:06:00.240> of<00:06:00.300> the

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
are gonna be using a host of the

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.760 
are gonna be using a host of the
services<00:06:00.690> but<00:06:00.840> i<00:06:00.900> still<00:06:01.080> believe<00:06:01.169> Bethesda's

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
services but i still believe Bethesda's

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.620 
services but i still believe Bethesda's
the<00:06:01.890> main<00:06:02.040> creator<00:06:02.340> of<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.580> game<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:03.270> modders

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
the main creator of the game the modders

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.550 
the main creator of the game the modders
the<00:06:03.720> one<00:06:03.870> who's<00:06:03.990> actually<00:06:04.140> putting<00:06:04.470> that

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
the one who's actually putting that

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.870 
the one who's actually putting that
content<00:06:04.980> out<00:06:05.100> there<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:05.370> then<00:06:05.460> valve<00:06:05.669> should

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
content out there and then valve should

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.190 
content out there and then valve should
get<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.150> lowest<00:06:06.300> cut<00:06:06.660> so<00:06:06.930> yeah<00:06:07.050> that's

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
get the lowest cut so yeah that's

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.350 
get the lowest cut so yeah that's
