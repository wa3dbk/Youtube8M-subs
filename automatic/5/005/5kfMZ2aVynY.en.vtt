that's why I his hand speed is better

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.369 
that's why I his hand speed is better
than<00:01:01.879> he<00:01:02.629> used<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.929> heavy<00:01:03.079> weight<00:01:03.260> he

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.620 
than he used the heavy weight he
wouldn't<00:01:03.409> beat<00:01:03.709> affect<00:01:04.299> every<00:01:05.299> ways<00:01:05.449> are

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
wouldn't beat affect every ways are
