we're<00:00:14.530> at<00:00:14.650> pedalo<00:00:15.190> station<00:00:15.639> and<00:00:15.820> in<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:17.050> near

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
we're at pedalo station and in the near

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.779 
we're at pedalo station and in the near
Elliott<00:00:17.710> and<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.920> middle<00:00:18.280> of<00:00:18.370> the<00:00:18.430> territory

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
Elliott and the middle of the territory

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.650 
Elliott and the middle of the territory
and<00:00:21.360> we<00:00:22.360> brought<00:00:22.630> this<00:00:22.870> country<00:00:23.230> in<00:00:23.590> about

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and we brought this country in about

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.840 
and we brought this country in about
2002<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:26.020> build<00:00:26.200> over<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.530> million<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:26.980> 50,000

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
2002 to build over a million and 50,000

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.110 
2002 to build over a million and 50,000
hectares<00:00:28.150> and<00:00:29.040> it<00:00:30.040> was<00:00:30.220> running<00:00:30.460> around<00:00:30.700> about

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120 
hectares and it was running around about

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.000 
hectares and it was running around about
20,000<00:00:32.079> cattle<00:00:32.349> when<00:00:32.500> we<00:00:32.619> bought<00:00:32.860> it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
20,000 cattle when we bought it

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.870 
20,000 cattle when we bought it
and<00:00:34.200> had<00:00:35.200> about<00:00:35.410> 40<00:00:35.860> waters<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.490> we

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
and had about 40 waters and we

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.640 
and had about 40 waters and we
considered<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.630> those<00:00:37.930> wardens<00:00:38.320> were<00:00:38.410> under

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
considered that those wardens were under

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.170 
considered that those wardens were under
a<00:00:38.710> fair<00:00:38.920> bit<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.100> stress<00:00:39.370> actually<00:00:39.700> because

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
a fair bit of stress actually because

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.720 
a fair bit of stress actually because
they<00:00:40.270> probably<00:00:40.450> had<00:00:40.690> an<00:00:40.780> average<00:00:41.280> barber<00:00:42.280> 600

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
they probably had an average barber 600

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.950 
they probably had an average barber 600
head<00:00:42.880> on<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.450> water<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.410> we<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.870> know

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
head on the water and and so we you know

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.540 
head on the water and and so we you know
a<00:00:50.170> part<00:00:50.410> of<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.620> reason<00:00:50.800> for<00:00:51.100> buying<00:00:51.280> this

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
a part of the reason for buying this

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.640 
a part of the reason for buying this
country<00:00:51.910> was<00:00:52.090> we<00:00:52.270> had<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.450> lot<00:00:52.510> of<00:00:52.660> potential

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
country was we had a lot of potential

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.830 
country was we had a lot of potential
outside<00:00:54.250> of<00:00:54.400> in<00:00:54.520> such<00:00:54.850> big<00:00:55.030> areas<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.660> it<00:00:55.750> and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
outside of in such big areas of it and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.069 
outside of in such big areas of it and
weren't<00:00:55.960> watered<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.440> door<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:58.690> on<00:00:58.870> our

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
weren't watered the door and an on our

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.290 
weren't watered the door and an on our
scale<00:00:59.380> of<00:00:59.590> operation<00:01:00.100> we<00:01:00.250> we<00:01:00.610> believe<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.970> water

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
scale of operation we we believe a water

scale of operation we we believe a water
effects<00:01:01.720> around<00:01:01.899> about<00:01:02.140> 4,000<00:01:02.739> acres<00:01:02.980> of

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
effects around about 4,000 acres of

effects around about 4,000 acres of
country<00:01:03.430> at<00:01:03.550> 1,600<00:01:04.269> hectares<00:01:05.399> so<00:01:06.399> we<00:01:06.640> had

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
country at 1,600 hectares so we had

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.370 
country at 1,600 hectares so we had
really<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.329> potential<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.929> run<00:01:08.079> another

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
really the potential to run another

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.989 
really the potential to run another
80,000<00:01:09.039> cattle<00:01:09.310> on<00:01:09.509> mathematically<00:01:10.509> and<00:01:11.999> so

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:12.999 
80,000 cattle on mathematically and so

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.529 
80,000 cattle on mathematically and so
we<00:01:13.299> got<00:01:13.479> in<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.780> started<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:14.380> put<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:16.509> the

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
we got in and started to put the put the

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.860 
we got in and started to put the put the
additional<00:01:16.780> waters<00:01:17.350> on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.030 

well<00:01:23.870> at<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> moment<00:01:24.230> we've<00:01:24.590> put<00:01:24.800> in<00:01:24.920> about

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
well at the moment we've put in about

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.080 
well at the moment we've put in about
560<00:01:26.140> tanks<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.320> we've<00:01:28.130> got<00:01:28.310> about<00:01:28.490> another<00:01:28.640> 40

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
560 tanks and we've got about another 40

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.580 
560 tanks and we've got about another 40
to<00:01:29.210> go<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.420> complete<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:30.050> whole<00:01:30.530> project<00:01:30.800> and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
to go to complete the whole project and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.590 
to go to complete the whole project and
there's<00:01:33.590> roughly<00:01:34.130> about<00:01:34.250> five<00:01:34.730> kilometers<00:01:35.450> of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
there's roughly about five kilometers of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.219 
there's roughly about five kilometers of
poly<00:01:35.810> per<00:01:36.170> tank<00:01:36.880> be<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:38.240> they're<00:01:39.020> only

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
poly per tank be it that they're only

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.110 
poly per tank be it that they're only
for<00:01:39.410> kz<00:01:39.650> part<00:01:40.010> but<00:01:40.220> there's<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.460> bit<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.640> joining

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
for kz part but there's a bit of joining

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.110 
for kz part but there's a bit of joining
up<00:01:41.240> kali<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.750> various<00:01:42.110> things<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:43.610> we've<00:01:43.910> used

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
up kali and various things so we've used

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.910 
up kali and various things so we've used
at<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.930> end<00:01:45.080> of<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.290> we<00:01:45.410> will<00:01:45.560> have<00:01:45.710> used

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
at the end of it we will have used

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.040 
at the end of it we will have used
pretty<00:01:46.310> close<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.700> 3000<00:01:47.330> kilometers<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.840> poly

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
pretty close to 3000 kilometers of poly

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.410 
pretty close to 3000 kilometers of poly
and<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:50.830> probably<00:01:51.830> our<00:01:52.130> fencing<00:01:52.580> will<00:01:52.940> exceed

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
and and probably our fencing will exceed

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.609 
and and probably our fencing will exceed
that<00:01:53.770> because<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:55.009> really<00:01:55.369> run<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.580> fence<00:01:55.850> line

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
that because we really run a fence line

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.590 
that because we really run a fence line
along<00:01:57.619> each<00:01:58.100> line<00:01:58.400> of<00:01:58.430> poly<00:01:58.790> which<00:01:59.060> assists<00:01:59.479> in

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
along each line of poly which assists in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.170 
along each line of poly which assists in
mustering<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.759> controlling<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:01.850> count<00:02:02.060> if

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
mustering and controlling we count if

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.910 
mustering and controlling we count if
the<00:02:02.300> cattle<00:02:02.600> on<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.750> country

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.260 

well<00:02:10.920> we're<00:02:11.220> trying<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.610> build<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> numbers

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
well we're trying to build the numbers

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.640 
well we're trying to build the numbers
up<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:14.090> using<00:02:15.090> having<00:02:15.990> five<00:02:16.170> hundred<00:02:16.530> odd

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
up to using having five hundred odd

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.600 
up to using having five hundred odd
waters<00:02:17.010> with<00:02:17.160> about<00:02:18.740> two<00:02:19.740> hundred<00:02:19.890> cattle<00:02:20.430> on

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
waters with about two hundred cattle on

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.280 
waters with about two hundred cattle on
them<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.940> we'll<00:02:21.120> we'll<00:02:21.630> get<00:02:21.780> up<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.050> about<00:02:22.230> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
them so we'll we'll get up to about a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.520 
them so we'll we'll get up to about a
hundred<00:02:22.470> thousand<00:02:23.010> cattle<00:02:23.190> we're<00:02:24.530> running

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
hundred thousand cattle we're running

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.470 
hundred thousand cattle we're running
right<00:02:25.710> at<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.100> moment<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.880> time<00:02:26.910> probably

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
right at this moment in time probably

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.410 
right at this moment in time probably
close<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.720> eighty<00:02:27.960> thousand<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.180> we've<00:02:30.180> come

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
close to eighty thousand and we've come

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.450 
close to eighty thousand and we've come
from<00:02:30.540> twenty<00:02:30.900> thousand<00:02:31.380> some<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.310> those

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
from twenty thousand some of those

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.730 
from twenty thousand some of those
infected<00:02:33.060> our<00:02:33.210> adjustment<00:02:33.780> cattle<00:02:34.080> which<00:02:34.530> we

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
infected our adjustment cattle which we
