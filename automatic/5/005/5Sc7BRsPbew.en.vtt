00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
this here is what we call a Titan child

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.200 
this here is what we call a Titan child
and<00:05:07.870> this<00:05:08.020> is<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.199> titanium<00:05:08.800> now<00:05:09.580> if<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:09.880> notice

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and this is a titanium now if you notice

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.570 
and this is a titanium now if you notice
it's<00:05:10.389> totally<00:05:11.169> patternless<00:05:11.620> it's<00:05:12.430> a

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
it's totally patternless it's a

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.920 
it's totally patternless it's a
completely<00:05:13.000> different<00:05:13.270> snake<00:05:13.659> than<00:05:13.840> the

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
completely different snake than the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.450 
completely different snake than the
recipe<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:14.289> don't<00:05:14.500> really<00:05:14.740> see<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.099> until<00:05:15.340> you

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
recipe you don't really see it until you

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.810 
recipe you don't really see it until you
really<00:05:15.490> think<00:05:15.940> about<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.830> this<00:05:17.830> these<00:05:18.340> the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
really think about it and this these the

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.999 
really think about it and this these the
funny<00:05:19.060> part<00:05:19.360> is<00:05:19.449> with<00:05:19.659> Tiger<00:05:20.080> in<00:05:20.199> it<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.470> seems

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
funny part is with Tiger in it it seems

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.100 
funny part is with Tiger in it it seems
to<00:05:21.130> turn<00:05:21.280> them<00:05:21.430> black<00:05:21.789> and<00:05:22.150> this<00:05:22.570> one<00:05:22.840> should

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
to turn them black and this one should

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.810 
to turn them black and this one should
be<00:05:23.320> kind<00:05:23.620> of<00:05:23.680> an<00:05:23.830> orange<00:05:24.070> one<00:05:24.400> but<00:05:24.580> then<00:05:24.699> again

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
be kind of an orange one but then again

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.629 
be kind of an orange one but then again
we've<00:05:25.419> only<00:05:25.599> ever<00:05:25.810> seen<00:05:26.139> like<00:05:26.349> forever<00:05:26.949> so

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
we've only ever seen like forever so

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.149 
we've only ever seen like forever so
it's<00:05:28.000> hard<00:05:28.240> telling<00:05:28.449> so<00:05:29.139> this<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.380> titanium

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
it's hard telling so this is titanium

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.580 
it's hard telling so this is titanium
and<00:05:30.449> golden<00:05:31.449> child<00:05:31.690> all<00:05:31.990> wrapped<00:05:32.259> into<00:05:32.470> one

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
and golden child all wrapped into one

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.969 
and golden child all wrapped into one
snake<00:05:33.070> another<00:05:33.759> long<00:05:34.090> project<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.800> cool

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
snake another long project and the cool

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.159 
snake another long project and the cool
part<00:05:36.009> is<00:05:36.430> we<00:05:36.970> have<00:05:37.180> some<00:05:37.419> of<00:05:37.479> these<00:05:37.570> also<00:05:37.870> that

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
part is we have some of these also that

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.450 
part is we have some of these also that
might<00:05:38.349> be<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.590> difference<00:05:38.710> is<00:05:39.070> we<00:05:39.220> have<00:05:39.250> them

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
might be the difference is we have them

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.279 
might be the difference is we have them
had<00:05:39.610> orange<00:05:39.849> go<00:05:40.030> strengths<00:05:40.360> so<00:05:40.870> it<00:05:40.990> might<00:05:41.229> be

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
had orange go strengths so it might be

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.159 
had orange go strengths so it might be
as<00:05:41.560> simple<00:05:41.860> as<00:05:42.130> that<00:05:42.370> head--oh<00:05:42.639> G<00:05:43.389> is<00:05:43.630> actually

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
as simple as that head--oh G is actually

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.890 
as simple as that head--oh G is actually
making<00:05:44.530> them<00:05:44.740> make<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.250> bronze<00:05:45.520> ones<00:05:45.849> but<00:05:46.750> it

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
making them make the bronze ones but it

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.990 
making them make the bronze ones but it
