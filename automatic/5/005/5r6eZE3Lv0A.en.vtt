00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 green all the Bruges people are in the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.400
 Rectangle to almost and all Ghent 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.160
 near the big rectangle head to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.639
 second and later lala lacquer 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.049
 pushes that alpha head down again 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.609
 once it's the central defenders 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.130
 that they came to carry the danger there 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.320
 on this stopped phase we start from 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.600
 Ghent side 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 we raise correctly in the feet 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.660
 of el ghanassy again it's very 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 well done on the part of el ghanassy 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.830
 joergensen he has one of the field to hit 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 the ball pushed back by putting them in 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 coulibaly's feet and the pole that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 comes to the rescue of the people of Bruges 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.850
 is not finished us well kitsch at 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.520
 vorbis second pole again and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.379
 new coulibaly post this action 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.539
 is it going to end and well yes stop 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.670
 a strike next to yassine el ghanassy 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.250
 and well a completely crazy action 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.199
 in this game after 18 minutes of play 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.829
 two poles in the same action and the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 brugge can thank the luck on 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 this fan we see the striking of 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.449
 johansen at first post 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.979
 of elimane coulibaly and then it goes again 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.140
 to be a bit of the pinball here with a 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.310
 ball repulsed by verbist coulibaly 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.689
 who really misses luck on this 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.090
 action but which should have concluded a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.770
 so close then the first goal 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.970
 will he fall on phases stopped first 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 corner for the circle of bruges 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.409
 second post and dominique deviation 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.850
 madness that is magnifying and that is especially 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.170
 went to hit the pole on this action 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.509
 invariably it's still el ghanassy 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.909
 who gives this coulibaly corner kick the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.430
 head the miraculous rescue of verbist 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.710
 a second time and we release on the side 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 of clean and well there the Brugesmen can 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.619
 thank their guard who did it again 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.070
 miracles on this action 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.229
 we see the first head of coulibaly 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.670
 and then it's a little lucky that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.430
 bram verbist takes out this second balloon 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 it's always 0 0 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.369
 and it's not the opportunities that are missing 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.720
 one on the Ghent side but we can not 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.720
 not to materialize for now 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 new corner shot el ghanassy in the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.530
 balloon package repelled by artwork a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.260
 walker pardon the goal we went 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.920
 saved from the head by year on the 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.450
 line and quite decidedly this balloon does not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.770
 will probably not go back to Ghent 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.140
 in any case not in this first 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.640
 period if it goes on like this we're going 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.670
 review this action again 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.390
 with the miss hit by arzo and that's 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.820
 alpha bat who had hit on the skull 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.640
 finally from dennis vianne a priori the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.630
 balloon did not return 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.670
 the counters who take back possession 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.230
 of low reach balloon with smolders which 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.880
 is a few spaces in front of him he goes 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.810
 try to find el ghanassy that's who 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.490
 is made el ghanassy at full speed 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.140
 with rudi coming back on his back 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.420
 center outside foot of galaxies and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.320
 vianne that they are and that's 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.390
 once again 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.720

 marcos or their return with the devil 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.410
 red 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.489
 intentions and the ghana if the strikes that 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.200

 truly thundering championship 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.290
 it's not over for Ghent 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.969
 with soul hours at the entrance of the rectangle 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.340

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.349

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.540
 can erect a statue on the side of 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.980
 bruges of the first seven days of 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.599
 championship because the guardian of the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.280
 circle is really in the process of 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.350
 make the match of his life today 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.199
 look at this stop with your fingertips or 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.210
 kick again marco 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.100
 raises who loses the ball to the benefit of 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.139
 rudi who is gone again in his dribbles 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.020
 so will he stand right on 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.580
 his legs this time way for said he 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.840
 has spent the magnificent and kristof 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.349
 haene for the first goal he's 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.270
 hooked 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.840
 and says Mr. effective it is 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.840
 penalty 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.740
 penalty for the circle of bruges and well 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.910
 we will have to review this action because 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.710
 that I still feel that 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.190
 kristof of haene fell mishap 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.860
 in this yellow card action by the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.250
 same opportunity for kernel that is going to be 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.479
 excluded here is the first red card of 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.039
 this season it's for 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.740
 nahayo who had received a yellow card 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.819
 after 17 minutes of play 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.090
 and no doubt one in the look of 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.789
 Mr. their bikes we will review it 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.479
 with kristof haene that slides 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:13.809
 truly alone yes and this 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:19.249
 stumbles in his own foot 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:21.139
 kristof haene then oleg iatchouk to 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:25.339
 ten minutes from the end of this meeting 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.079
 for the to 0 via the amount 01 plus 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:30.289
 precisely the circle of brugge passes 

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:32.509
 ahead thanks to this penalty really 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.179
 generously granted by Monsieur HervÃ© 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.519
 q'on but now the numbers are there 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:43.099
 it's 0-1 scoring for the 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:45.469
 circle of bruges by oleg iatchouk and 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.619
 it is the end of what you yourself that you 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.629
 burns circle 0 victory on the side 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.949
 of Bruges, we will obviously be satisfied with 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.769
 these three points torn off 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.959
 thanks in particular to an exceptional bram 

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:58.639
 verbist in the goals of the side of the 

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:00.589
 Ghent we will surely pester on this 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.149
 penalty that will still sink 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.149
 a lot of ink in the days to come
