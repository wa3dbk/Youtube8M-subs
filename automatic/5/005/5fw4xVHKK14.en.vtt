going across the dry lakebeds we were

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.090 
going across the dry lakebeds we were
doing<00:00:48.970> 110<00:00:49.510> earlier<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.080> now<00:00:50.560> going<00:00:50.800> up<00:00:50.950> some

supercharger package alright after

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.540 
supercharger package alright after
looking<00:01:25.900> at<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.140> supercharger<00:01:26.830> some<00:01:27.400> of<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
looking at the supercharger some of the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.010 
looking at the supercharger some of the
things<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:27.909> did<00:01:28.090> for<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:28.420> because<00:01:28.720> we're

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
things we did for this because we're

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.020 
things we did for this because we're
racing<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:30.159> desert<00:01:30.520> we're<00:01:30.700> going<00:01:30.880> hot

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
racing in the desert we're going hot

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.310 
racing in the desert we're going hot
high<00:01:31.180> speeds<00:01:31.540> we<00:01:32.140> put<00:01:32.380> four<00:01:32.620> kc<00:01:33.299> pod<00:01:34.299> lights<00:01:34.659> to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
high speeds we put four kc pod lights to

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.370 
high speeds we put four kc pod lights to
reach<00:01:35.670> 70<00:01:36.670> watt<00:01:36.909> HID<00:01:37.570> lights<00:01:37.990> these<00:01:38.170> are<00:01:38.229> the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
reach 70 watt HID lights these are the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.020 
reach 70 watt HID lights these are the
most<00:01:38.500> powerful<00:01:38.950> lights<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.370> industry<00:01:39.850> and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
most powerful lights in the industry and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.690 
most powerful lights in the industry and
they<00:01:40.630> project<00:01:40.810> at<00:01:41.229> least<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.860> half<00:01:42.130> mile<00:01:42.400> out

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
they project at least a half mile out

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.180 
they project at least a half mile out
so<00:01:43.479> again<00:01:43.780> traveling<00:01:44.409> at<00:01:44.500> high<00:01:44.620> speeds<00:01:45.010> we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
so again traveling at high speeds we

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.670 
so again traveling at high speeds we
want<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.490> four<00:01:45.729> KC<00:01:46.420> pod<00:01:46.810> lights<00:01:47.049> as<00:01:47.260> well<00:01:47.290> less

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
want the four KC pod lights as well less

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.980 
want the four KC pod lights as well less
underneath<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.670> can<00:01:48.790> see<00:01:48.970> we've<00:01:49.150> added<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.659> lot

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
underneath you can see we've added a lot

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.080 
underneath you can see we've added a lot
of<00:01:50.020> LED<00:01:50.530> lighting<00:01:50.920> which<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.070> for<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.729> lot

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
of LED lighting which is for a lot

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.300 
of LED lighting which is for a lot
closer<00:01:52.390> in<00:01:52.780> that's<00:01:53.260> more<00:01:53.500> for<00:01:53.680> doing<00:01:54.130> high

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
closer in that's more for doing high

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
grades with very rugged terrain so let's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.259 
grades with very rugged terrain so let's
go<00:02:41.769> in<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.160> hit<00:02:42.280> on<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.519> gravel<00:02:42.850> road<00:02:43.030> here

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
go in and hit on the gravel road here

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.110 
go in and hit on the gravel road here
and<00:02:43.450> see<00:02:43.720> what<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:43.989> baby<00:02:44.200> does<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.790> trail

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
and see what this baby does this trail

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.960 
and see what this baby does this trail
can<00:02:46.420> probably<00:02:46.690> be<00:02:46.930> hit<00:02:47.170> at<00:02:47.350> 80<00:02:48.310> miles<00:02:48.610> an<00:02:48.819> hour

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
can probably be hit at 80 miles an hour

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.340 
can probably be hit at 80 miles an hour
of<00:02:49.299> course<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.630> little<00:02:49.810> beyond<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.080> speed

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
of course a little beyond the speed

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.949 
of course a little beyond the speed
limit<00:02:50.680> but<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.700> truck<00:02:52.060> handles<00:02:52.299> great<00:02:52.720> on

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
limit but this truck handles great on

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.839

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.539 
the high speed gravel roads
quite<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> few<00:02:56.629> things<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.019> like<00:02:57.230> inside<00:02:58.159> at<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
quite a few things I like inside at the

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.979 
quite a few things I like inside at the
camp<00:02:58.819> here<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.260> you<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.500> thumb<00:03:01.099> control

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
camp here is you have the thumb control

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.470 
camp here is you have the thumb control
switch<00:03:02.989> on<00:03:03.469> the<00:03:03.890> stick<00:03:04.189> shift<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.150> when<00:03:05.390> you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
switch on the stick shift so when you

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.240 
switch on the stick shift so when you
want<00:03:05.659> to<00:03:05.719> downshift<00:03:05.930> or<00:03:06.409> up<00:03:06.560> shift<00:03:06.859> it's<00:03:07.069> just

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
want to downshift or up shift it's just

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.750 
want to downshift or up shift it's just
the<00:03:07.340> push<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.790> button<00:03:08.109> +<00:03:09.109> -<00:03:09.709> down<00:03:10.219> up<00:03:10.549> and
