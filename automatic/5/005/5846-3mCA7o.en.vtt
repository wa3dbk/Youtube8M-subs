 too fast for them are too tall 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.439
 and this is for real for me 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.180

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.259
 and these questions about holding who 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.960
 king rooms are very interesting to 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:46.829
 I brought some of those 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.680
 after the debate we will have is more skins 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.909
 for our ghosts and they talk 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 that in this spring they will not have come 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.979
 504 lgbt king the ghost but 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.869
 will gain a study not only that thing 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.090
 white or red that purchased the edition 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.270
 from collector before 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.660
 This game is very interesting but will 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.470
 a radio bigger and better tekken 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.190
 king 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.200
 they respond short and thick 5 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.129
 interesting to be interesting because 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.290
 they did not bring raid of being the case 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.080
 of the game nor claiming that the ryder something 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.120
 too elaborate to do and we 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.780
 we find in this merit when we see 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.120
 that the Croatian network is much lower 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.540
 compared to the atheist's radio in it 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.150
 simpler but less elaborate 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.700
 Let's say so it's all bridge bridge with 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.140
 bridge type bridge bridge and people year 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.200
 boys and kills and not in the crystal chamber is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.310
 much more elaborate thought maze 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 of corneas 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.440
 the templar the so far this is something 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.530
 interesting and I really believe that 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.860
 will come the biggest and best raid on de tekken 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.680
 Gaucho team is going to start selling 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.230
 garroni again or rain sell grabbed 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.930
 on again and he replies that no one 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.120
 really knows, ie do not deny nor 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.269
 confirm you think he can come to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.280
 sell the galaxy horn again 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:23.540
 I find it difficult, I find it very difficult to have the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.139
 some gigantic history with great 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.769
 with the great turnaround is in history 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.630
 from destiny this is interesting to people 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.389
 hold and press forward is to have 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.889
 grandfather destiny and the 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:44.900
 history will be greater with this turnaround 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:48.019
 they do not know they speak, it's to keep 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.359
 the techbiz campaign will be so big 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.120
 How many people do they expect to speak? 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:56.269
 that yes they believe that in 5 will be 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.569
 feasible or you can play tekken 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:06.770
 in the pc do not regret the equipment 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.530
 of light, that he make himself a 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.080
 the light level for the pa and they speak 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.300
 that they say the word repentance nor 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.020
 going back is not something they like 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.970
 to speak 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.760
 They like to talk about improvement. 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.830
 a chance to improve what he has already 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.030
 ie did they see that they 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.880
 they did wrong they are wanting 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.920
 improve business logic one thousand and one more 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.280
 they want to improve this is already the 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.730
 first step for the better really is 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.540
 having someone who will have a greater variety of 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.450
 missions 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:42.650
 they think so, right while content 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.650
 will come in dt king four new assaults 3 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.190
 if you are from xbox one 8 maps from 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.860
 OLED crucible pvp and more emissions 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.940
 History will have contagion but who 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.550
 ghosts will have the option to 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:03.560
 grades science very interesting it 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:06.080
 it is true within the battleship no 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.200
 it's not time to stop inside 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.480
 battleship luti will be easier to 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.970
 if you find how many weapons will go 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.530
 to be more varied than 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.440
 You do not have that zone. 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.610
 this is because these areas you do not have 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.920
 it will be easier to find sim 11 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.830
 will stay alive but will get more 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.730
 Yes, a lot of music and the latter is very 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.210
 interesting 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:39.470
 the traveler is secretly ill to them 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:42.470
 the reflexive pause in time 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.210
 everything will be revealed because it's like 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.300
 Here I love you, he had mentioned it. 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.370
 have some one gigantic history one 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.970
 turns back into this story and then 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.270
 Last 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.910
 they send as soon as the traveler is 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.680
 evil he is the master type of magicians who 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.530
 people think it is good and evil and 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.419
 bad and good, who knows the end of summer 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.640
 who attended the sale of the 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.250
 dragon who all old enough there 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.540
 to watch the dragon's hair but 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.610
 I always believed that master of the magicians 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.320
 it is evil and an alderman of good 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.940
 wanting to fight master of the magician's 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.289
 children were on the way, he said. 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.789
 end up being used glory 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:22.799
 but did traveler is evil he is 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:24.489
 sucking the lives of humans secretly 

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:27.069
 biaggi nÃ© 

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:28.149
 because it is but made me think will the 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.439
 last will improve 

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:32.169
