00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
didn't need hood scoops fraid so

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.110 
didn't need hood scoops fraid so
yeah<00:02:26.170> yeah<00:02:26.680> did<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.070> need<00:02:27.250> dual<00:02:27.730> exhaust

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
yeah yeah did it need dual exhaust

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.450 
yeah yeah did it need dual exhaust
coming<00:02:28.390> out<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.660> both<00:02:28.810> sides<00:02:29.110> yeah<00:02:29.800> sure<00:02:30.070> did<00:02:30.250> I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
coming out of both sides yeah sure did I

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.610 
coming out of both sides yeah sure did I
think<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.180> needed<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:31.750> some

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
think that you needed to have some

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.490 
think that you needed to have some
elements<00:02:33.190> some<00:02:33.580> vestiges<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.480> past<00:02:34.840> into

elements some vestiges of the past into
that<00:02:35.680> car<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.190> was<00:02:36.460> an<00:02:36.690> opportunity<00:02:37.690> to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that car this was an opportunity to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.910 
that car this was an opportunity to
