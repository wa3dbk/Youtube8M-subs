00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.370
 [music] 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.870

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.010
 soft cheese 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.549
 for dough we take one big glass of flour 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.050
 150 grams 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.740
 flour sift 1 teaspoon dry 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.759

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 a pinch of salt 90 milliliters of warm water

 a towel and leave for thirty minutes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.460
 the dough approached the warmth and it became 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.460
 very soft 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.580
 roll out the pizza dough 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.100
 form an even circle and shift 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.290
 its on the form if you have a baking sheet 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.910
