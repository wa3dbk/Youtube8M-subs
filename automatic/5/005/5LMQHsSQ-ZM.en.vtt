00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
this is something that was done in film

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.870 
this is something that was done in film
times<00:03:15.630> when<00:03:15.900> obviously<00:03:16.170> there<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.680> no

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
times when obviously there is no

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.430 
times when obviously there is no
recorder<00:03:17.880> built<00:03:18.030> into<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.570> camera<00:03:18.960> so<00:03:19.320> it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
recorder built into the camera so it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.540 
recorder built into the camera so it's
something<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.800> people<00:03:19.920> are<00:03:20.070> familiar<00:03:20.280> with

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
something that people are familiar with

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.790 
something that people are familiar with
but<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.420> people<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.690> are<00:03:21.960> trying<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:22.770> a

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
but for people that are trying to do a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.620 
but for people that are trying to do a
basic<00:03:23.100> setup<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.730> can<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> little<00:03:24.300> bit<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.540> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
basic setup it can be a little bit of a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.120 
basic setup it can be a little bit of a
headache<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.470> there<00:03:25.680> are<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.830> lot<00:03:26.100> of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
headache so there are a lot of

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.160 
headache so there are a lot of
advantages<00:03:26.640> with<00:03:26.850> DSLRs<00:03:27.570> lot<00:03:28.080> of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
advantages with DSLRs lot of

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.070 
advantages with DSLRs lot of
disadvantages<00:03:28.440> as<00:03:28.950> well<00:03:29.540> another<00:03:30.540> thing<00:03:30.930> I've

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
disadvantages as well another thing I've

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.870 
disadvantages as well another thing I've
been<00:03:31.740> coming<00:03:32.130> out<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.370> recent<00:03:32.730> years

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
been coming out in recent years

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.060 
been coming out in recent years
alongside<00:03:33.180> DSLRs<00:03:33.900> our<00:03:34.200> Merril<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.680> cameras

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
alongside DSLRs our Merril is cameras

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.880 
alongside DSLRs our Merril is cameras
now<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.940> SLR<00:03:36.450> has<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> built-in<00:03:37.170> mirror<00:03:37.470> that

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
now the SLR has a built-in mirror that

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.470 
now the SLR has a built-in mirror that
basically<00:03:38.490> has<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> light<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.030> comes<00:03:39.300> through

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
basically has a light that comes through

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.390 
basically has a light that comes through
the<00:03:39.600> lens<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.080> then<00:03:40.500> shoots<00:03:40.860> out<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
the lens and then shoots out the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400 
the lens and then shoots out the
viewfinder<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.480> allows<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.080> see<00:03:43.260> what

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
viewfinder and allows you to see what

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.600 
viewfinder and allows you to see what
the<00:03:43.530> lens<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:43.860> seeing<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:44.190> as<00:03:44.310> soon<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.520> you

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
the lens is seeing but as soon as you

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.640 
the lens is seeing but as soon as you
take<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.820> picture<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.330> lens<00:03:45.510> pops<00:03:45.810> up<00:03:46.050> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
take a picture that lens pops up the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.080 
take a picture that lens pops up the
light<00:03:46.800> goes<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.310> sensor<00:03:47.640> takes<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
light goes to the sensor takes the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.640 
light goes to the sensor takes the
picture<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.810> mirror<00:03:49.020> pops<00:03:49.200> back<00:03:49.440> down

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
picture and the mirror pops back down

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.860 
picture and the mirror pops back down
now<00:03:50.220> with<00:03:50.340> mirrorless<00:03:50.670> cameras<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.660> light

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
now with mirrorless cameras the light

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.870 
now with mirrorless cameras the light
goes<00:03:52.050> directly<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.770> sensor<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.550> doesn't

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
goes directly to the sensor it doesn't

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.720 
goes directly to the sensor it doesn't
have<00:03:54.090> an<00:03:54.270> optical<00:03:54.450> viewfinder<00:03:55.130> versus<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.520> may

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
have an optical viewfinder versus it may

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.520 
have an optical viewfinder versus it may
have<00:03:56.940> either<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.570> screen<00:03:57.810> on<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.050> back<00:03:58.170> or

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
have either just a screen on the back or

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.890 
have either just a screen on the back or
it<00:03:58.740> may<00:03:58.860> have<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.070> no<00:03:59.310> LED<00:03:59.900> viewfinder

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
it may have a no LED viewfinder

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.510 
it may have a no LED viewfinder
electronic<00:04:01.470> viewfinder<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.160> one<00:04:02.340> does

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
electronic viewfinder like this one does

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.340 
electronic viewfinder like this one does
these<00:04:03.030> can<00:04:03.240> be<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.360> lot<00:04:03.540> smaller<00:04:03.870> because<00:04:04.140> they

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
these can be a lot smaller because they

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.140 
these can be a lot smaller because they
don't<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.740> mir<00:04:05.040> package<00:04:05.460> so<00:04:05.940> again

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
don't have that mir package so again

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.180 
don't have that mir package so again
you're<00:04:06.600> making<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.200> much<00:04:07.380> much<00:04:07.590> smaller<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
you're making it much much smaller and

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.880 
you're making it much much smaller and
and<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.120> prices<00:04:09.510> are<00:04:09.540> very<00:04:10.110> comparable<00:04:10.440> some

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
and the prices are very comparable some

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.010 
and the prices are very comparable some
a<00:04:10.920> little<00:04:11.250> bit<00:04:11.370> cheaper<00:04:11.550> than<00:04:11.850> DSLRs<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:12.900> these

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
a little bit cheaper than DSLRs so these

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.870 
a little bit cheaper than DSLRs so these
are<00:04:13.170> these<00:04:13.500> are<00:04:13.650> two<00:04:13.800> similar<00:04:14.370> cameras<00:04:14.730> but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
are these are two similar cameras but

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.160 
are these are two similar cameras but
they're<00:04:15.000> still<00:04:15.180> first<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.750> foremost<00:04:16.080> the
