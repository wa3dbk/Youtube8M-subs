00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
to your shadow details you get 800

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.350 
to your shadow details you get 800
different<00:01:45.560> tonalities<00:01:45.860> on<00:01:46.280> your<00:01:46.460> screen<00:01:46.790> then

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
different tonalities on your screen then
