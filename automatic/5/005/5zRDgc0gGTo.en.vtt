and<00:00:33.460> we<00:00:33.520> turn<00:00:33.700> our<00:00:33.820> ranges<00:00:34.150> on<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:35.530> begin<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.890> do

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
and we turn our ranges on we begin to do

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.950 
and we turn our ranges on we begin to do
laundry<00:00:36.220> we<00:00:36.940> turn<00:00:37.120> our<00:00:37.210> washers<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:37.750> dryers

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
laundry we turn our washers and dryers

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.990 
laundry we turn our washers and dryers
on<00:00:38.260> we'll<00:00:39.100> start<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.370> take<00:00:39.520> food<00:00:39.760> out<00:00:39.880> of<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
on we'll start to take food out of the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.820 
on we'll start to take food out of the
refrigerator<00:00:40.230> causing<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.290> refrigerator<00:00:41.770> to

refrigerator causing the refrigerator to

refrigerator causing the refrigerator to
begin<00:00:42.160> to<00:00:42.280> run<00:00:42.490> and<00:00:43.270> we<00:00:43.360> might<00:00:43.510> even<00:00:43.630> cycle<00:00:44.110> the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
begin to run and we might even cycle the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.570 
begin to run and we might even cycle the
kids<00:00:44.470> through<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.770> shower<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.250> clean<00:00:45.460> up

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
kids through the shower to clean up

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.790 
kids through the shower to clean up
after<00:00:45.700> soccer<00:00:46.030> practice<00:00:46.540> when<00:00:47.410> everybody

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
after soccer practice when everybody

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.890 
after soccer practice when everybody
comes<00:00:47.860> home<00:00:48.280> at<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.520> same<00:00:48.760> time<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:49.390> does<00:00:49.750> the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
comes home at the same time and does the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.800 
comes home at the same time and does the
same<00:00:50.140> thing<00:00:50.470> it<00:00:51.190> creates<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.670> massive<00:00:51.910> load<00:00:52.450> on

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
same thing it creates a massive load on

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.130 
same thing it creates a massive load on
the<00:00:52.870> grid<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:53.470> creates<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.460> peak<00:00:54.730> situation<00:00:55.450> in

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
the grid and creates a peak situation in

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.320 
the grid and creates a peak situation in
this<00:00:56.410> peak<00:00:56.620> situation<00:00:57.310> it's<00:00:57.880> very<00:00:58.060> very

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
this peak situation it's very very

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.570 
this peak situation it's very very
difficult<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.840> provide<00:00:59.410> power<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.980> consumers

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
difficult to provide power to consumers

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.300 
difficult to provide power to consumers
at<00:01:00.730> that<00:01:01.630> peak<00:01:01.900> period<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.650> power<00:01:02.920> companies

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
at that peak period the power companies

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.710 
at that peak period the power companies
do<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.460> pretty<00:01:03.700> good<00:01:03.790> job<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.059> providing<00:01:04.390> power

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
do a pretty good job of providing power

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.599 
do a pretty good job of providing power
but<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.289> power<00:01:05.320> here<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:06.039> very<00:01:06.340> very

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
but the power here is very very

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.580 
but the power here is very very
expensive<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:07.420> order<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.869> pay<00:01:08.229> for<00:01:08.500> this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
expensive in order to pay for this

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.349 
expensive in order to pay for this
expensive<00:01:09.100> power<00:01:09.280> what<00:01:09.759> we're<00:01:09.909> going<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.240> see

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
expensive power what we're going to see

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.300 
expensive power what we're going to see
is<00:01:10.479> consumers<00:01:11.020> is<00:01:11.439> we're<00:01:11.619> going<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.920> see<00:01:12.159> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
is consumers is we're going to see the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.340 
is consumers is we're going to see the
advent<00:01:12.789> of<00:01:12.909> variable<00:01:13.450> pricing<00:01:13.659> if<00:01:14.020> you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
advent of variable pricing if you

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.980 
advent of variable pricing if you
remember<00:01:14.740> years<00:01:15.039> ago<00:01:15.130> on<00:01:15.579> phones<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.749> paid

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
remember years ago on phones you paid

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.660 
remember years ago on phones you paid
more<00:01:17.229> during<00:01:17.619> certain<00:01:17.829> times<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.280> day<00:01:18.429> unless

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
more during certain times a day unless

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.789 
more during certain times a day unless
during<00:01:19.210> other<00:01:19.359> times<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.810> day<00:01:19.990> you'll<00:01:20.499> see<00:01:20.679> the

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
during other times a day you'll see the

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.410 
during other times a day you'll see the
same<00:01:21.009> thing<00:01:21.280> with<00:01:21.429> in<00:01:21.549> terms<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:21.939> electricity

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
same thing with in terms of electricity

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.749 
same thing with in terms of electricity
as<00:01:22.659> well<00:01:22.899> you'll<00:01:23.679> pay<00:01:23.920> more<00:01:24.159> during<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.549> peak

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
as well you'll pay more during the peak

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.090 
as well you'll pay more during the peak
period<00:01:25.119> you'll<00:01:25.600> pay<00:01:25.869> less<00:01:25.899> off-peak<00:01:26.829> the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
period you'll pay less off-peak the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.099 
period you'll pay less off-peak the
trick<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.520> use<00:01:27.729> electricity<00:01:28.179> during<00:01:28.929> this

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
trick is to use electricity during this

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.929 
trick is to use electricity during this
off<00:01:29.350> peak<00:01:29.649> when<00:01:30.069> the<00:01:30.159> rates<00:01:30.340> are<00:01:30.490> cheaper<00:01:30.850> and

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
off peak when the rates are cheaper and

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.419 
off peak when the rates are cheaper and
that's<00:01:31.420> where<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:31.749> come<00:01:31.929> in<00:01:31.990> as<00:01:32.229> an<00:01:33.100> example

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
that's where we come in as an example

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.819 
that's where we come in as an example
take<00:01:33.700> your<00:01:33.850> refrigerator<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:35.560> every<00:01:35.799> other

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
take your refrigerator about every other

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.529 
take your refrigerator about every other
day<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.159> refrigerate<00:01:36.549> it<00:01:36.759> goes<00:01:36.939> to<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.119> defrost

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
day you refrigerate it goes to a defrost

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.020 
day you refrigerate it goes to a defrost
cycle<00:01:37.719> in<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.829> defrost<00:01:39.159> cycle<00:01:39.340> refrigerator

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
cycle in the defrost cycle refrigerator
