00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.340
 hello to you with the word yandex today 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.789
 I would like to show and tell you 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.699
 why when for example you beat 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.890
 antimagom on BKB is not applied 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.630
 additional damage from the first smile 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.489
 it says here that this type of damage 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.160
 physically let's get you today 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.739
 tell you why not applied 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.010
 additional damage but first you 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.940
 can see that when diffusa is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 ordinary burning telman and and he doesn't 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.899
 acts on the enemy when it is not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.340
 susceptible target to magic so how 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 burn man this magic then it turns out 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.059
 us 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.370
 mana is set on fire now you see 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.619
 similar 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.740
 antimag and burns mana at the enemy but 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.030
 while he burns it this mana 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.390
 redoes damage to the enemy ie 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.009
 it turns out when manat is burned and 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.490
 deals damage to an additional opponent 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.350
 from the black mana you went to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.549
 how difficult it is for the enemy 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 but if you really think it is very 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.619
 just that is, if you corner the enemy 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.509
 man will not be this either and 1 will be ripe 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.610
 useless physical plane 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.540
 Well, of course there will accumulate on 2 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 3 mana if this one tea happened then 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.920
 this food will really be useless but if 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.600
 on some big dragging out there 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.890
 quick 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.290
 accumulates mana you come on give 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.680
 two hits and there already go nick goes 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.340
 home general see now applied 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.390
 extra damage flops go for pasta 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.829
 it turns out even to 100 and now when we 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.679
 then already see 80 yes that is applied 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.640
 20 more additional physical damage 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.860
 damage 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.860
 and that is, if the enemy has more armor 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.540
 that from the first sang protune will 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.670
 take less damage 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.740
 I think it was all windex myself 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.480

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.990
