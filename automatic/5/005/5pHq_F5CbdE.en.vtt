the<00:00:29.369> first<00:00:29.609> thing<00:00:29.789> I'd<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:29.939> thinking<00:00:30.359> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the first thing I'd be thinking is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.780 
the first thing I'd be thinking is
Santa's<00:00:30.900> real<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> he's<00:00:31.500> under<00:00:31.769> attack<00:00:31.890> why

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
Santa's real and he's under attack why

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
Santa's real and he's under attack why
else<00:00:33.000> would<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> dead<00:00:33.540> deer<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.960> flying<00:00:34.290> through

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
else would a dead deer be flying through

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.290 
else would a dead deer be flying through
the<00:00:34.800> air<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> fuck<00:00:35.820> does<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.149> even

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the air how the fuck does that even

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090 
the air how the fuck does that even
happen<00:00:36.450> though<00:00:37.050> how<00:00:37.260> does<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.469> truck<00:00:37.800> driver

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
happen though how does a truck driver

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.880

into<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> human<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.950> don't<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
into a human I don't even think you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.700 
into a human I don't even think you
could<00:00:44.579> plan<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> wanted<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.500> man

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
could plan that if you wanted to the man

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.229 
could plan that if you wanted to the man
walking<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> street<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> truck

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
walking down the street and the truck

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
walking down the street and the truck
driver<00:00:48.539> they're<00:00:48.840> both<00:00:48.960> perfectly<00:00:49.620> fine<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
driver they're both perfectly fine the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
driver they're both perfectly fine the
deer<00:00:50.489> didn't<00:00:50.850> quite<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.329> though<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.170> you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
deer didn't quite make it though but you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.689 
deer didn't quite make it though but you
know<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.100> deer<00:00:53.340> might<00:00:53.550> have

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
know what I think the deer might have

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.189 
know what I think the deer might have
meant<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.390> yeah<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.079> was

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
meant to do this yeah what if it was

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.900 
meant to do this yeah what if it was
some<00:00:55.410> sort<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.800> terrorist<00:00:56.100> deer<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
some sort of terrorist deer on the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
some sort of terrorist deer on the
attack<00:00:57.210> against<00:00:57.570> humans<00:00:58.109> yeah<00:00:58.440> maybe<00:00:58.649> that's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
attack against humans yeah maybe that's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.139 
attack against humans yeah maybe that's
why<00:00:59.129> they're<00:00:59.309> always<00:00:59.430> launching<00:01:00.000> themselves

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
why they're always launching themselves

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.660 
why they're always launching themselves
