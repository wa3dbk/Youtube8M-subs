00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.780 
dramatic makeup look I tend to do that a
lot<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.819> have

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
lot and then I have

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.000 
lot and then I have
just<00:02:12.659> a<00:02:13.579> salmon-colored<00:02:15.170> crayon<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.799> white

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
just a salmon-colored crayon and a white

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
just a salmon-colored crayon and a white
crayon<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.609> use<00:02:17.879> these<00:02:18.239> these<00:02:18.870> are

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
crayon and I use these these are

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
crayon and I use these these are
probably<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.439> two<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:19.859> replace<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.459> most

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
probably the two that I replace the most

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
probably the two that I replace the most
the<00:02:20.909> rest<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.299> I<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:21.930> take<00:02:22.079> forever

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the rest that I don't they take forever

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.069 
the rest that I don't they take forever
i<00:02:22.500> don't<00:02:22.709> hardly<00:02:22.829> ever<00:02:23.099> run<00:02:23.549> out<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.819> those<00:02:24.120> but

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
i don't hardly ever run out of those but

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.750 
i don't hardly ever run out of those but
anyway<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:25.379> what<00:02:25.650> i've<00:02:25.769> done<00:02:25.799> so<00:02:25.950> far<00:02:26.159> is<00:02:26.579> i've

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
anyway so what i've done so far is i've

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.809 
anyway so what i've done so far is i've
used<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.810> colored<00:02:28.109> pencil<00:02:28.620> around<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.640> edge

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
used the colored pencil around the edge

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.770 
used the colored pencil around the edge
of<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.709> face<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.700> areas<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.120> are<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
of the face in the areas that are that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.990 
of the face in the areas that are that
need<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.170> most<00:02:34.349> shading<00:02:34.829> with<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> pencil

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
need the most shading with the pencil

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.399 
need the most shading with the pencil
first<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.450> do<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.989> want<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.319> be

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
first I do that because I want it to be

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.020 
first I do that because I want it to be
kind<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.769> opaque<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.250> those<00:02:38.400> areas<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.879> gives

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
kind of opaque in those areas it gives

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.780 
kind of opaque in those areas it gives
me<00:02:39.209> more<00:02:39.359> depth<00:02:39.659> in<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.349> final<00:02:40.650> piece<00:02:40.889> then<00:02:41.700> I

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
me more depth in the final piece then I

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.039 
me more depth in the final piece then I
went<00:02:41.939> over<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.359> again<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:43.139> the<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.840> light

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
went over it again with the the light

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.259 
went over it again with the the light
blue<00:02:46.319> crayon<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.370> simply<00:02:47.609> just<00:02:47.790> kind<00:02:48.209> of

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
blue crayon and you simply just kind of

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.270 
blue crayon and you simply just kind of
scrub<00:02:48.689> it<00:02:48.840> roughly<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.859> then<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.129> just

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
scrub it roughly in and then you just

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.460 
scrub it roughly in and then you just
use<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.609> use<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:51.060> middle<00:02:51.239> finger<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.319> just

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
use I use my middle finger and you just

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.399 
use I use my middle finger and you just
kind<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:53.389> smear<00:02:54.389> it<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.959> can<00:02:55.079> hear<00:02:55.349> how

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
hard i'm rubbing just to kind of smear

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.170 
hard i'm rubbing just to kind of smear
it<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:58.500> i<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.909> of<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> areas

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
it and i do that in all of the areas

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.050 
it and i do that in all of the areas
where<00:03:00.810> there<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> lot<00:03:01.859> of<00:03:02.099> shading<00:03:02.909> on<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
where there is a lot of shading on a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.580 
where there is a lot of shading on a
face<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.599> if<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.840> don't<00:03:03.989> know<00:03:04.200> where<00:03:04.439> those

face and if you don't know where those
places<00:03:04.799> are<00:03:05.159> i<00:03:05.220> would<00:03:05.430> suggest<00:03:05.579> studying<00:03:06.680> some

one<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.379> my<00:03:13.439> favorites<00:03:13.829> because<00:03:13.950> they<00:03:14.159> have<00:03:14.340> a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
one of my favorites because they have a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.800 
one of my favorites because they have a
really<00:03:15.419> good<00:03:15.720> diversity<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:17.299> women<00:03:18.299> in<00:03:18.569> terms

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
really good diversity of women in terms

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.569 
really good diversity of women in terms
of<00:03:19.019> shapes<00:03:19.349> and<00:03:19.650> sizes<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.280> colors

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
of shapes and sizes and colors

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.569 
of shapes and sizes and colors
ethnicities<00:03:21.299> backgrounds<00:03:21.569> face<00:03:22.409> shapes<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
ethnicities backgrounds face shapes and

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.159 
ethnicities backgrounds face shapes and
so<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.479> learn<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.659> lot<00:03:24.750> about<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
so you can learn a lot about the

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.469 
so you can learn a lot about the
different<00:03:25.470> shapes<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.889> noses<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.459> things<00:03:26.669> so

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:27.479 
different shapes of noses and things so

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.469 
different shapes of noses and things so
I<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.690> that's<00:03:27.959> worth<00:03:28.199> exploring<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:30.090> then

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
I think that's worth exploring I then

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.349 
I think that's worth exploring I then
also<00:03:30.840> did<00:03:31.260> take<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.519> white<00:03:32.699> crayon<00:03:33.000> and

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
also did take the white crayon and

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.719 
also did take the white crayon and
started<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> highlight<00:03:34.459> where<00:03:35.459> all<00:03:35.639> those

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
started to highlight where all those

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.399 
started to highlight where all those
areas<00:03:36.209> are<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.629> i'll<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.810> point<00:03:37.019> those<00:03:37.260> out

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
areas are and i'll just point those out

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.379 
areas are and i'll just point those out
to<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.669> i<00:03:39.139> tend<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.229> do<00:03:40.379> kind<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.769> big

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
to you i tend to do kind of a big

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.569 
to you i tend to do kind of a big
triangle<00:03:42.389> under<00:03:42.659> each<00:03:42.870> eye<00:03:43.129> which<00:03:44.129> will<00:03:44.370> be

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
triangle under each eye which will be

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.250 
triangle under each eye which will be
kind<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.120> smooth<00:03:45.449> doubt<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.930> won't<00:03:46.109> even

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
kind of smooth doubt you won't even

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.899 
kind of smooth doubt you won't even
really<00:03:46.590> notice<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:47.340> there<00:03:47.609> in<00:03:47.819> the

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
really notice that it's there in the

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.809 
really notice that it's there in the
final<00:03:48.239> piece<00:03:48.479> there's<00:03:49.349> also<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:50.099> kind<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.699> an

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
final piece there's also a kind of an

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.729 
final piece there's also a kind of an
arrow<00:03:51.060> shape<00:03:51.510> down<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.989> center<00:03:52.349> of<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.590> nose

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
arrow shape down the center of the nose

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.039 
arrow shape down the center of the nose
and<00:03:56.060> i'm<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.299> doing<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.599> quickly<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:57.989> you

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
straight on I I found I had a hard time

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.440

with<00:06:11.260> noses<00:06:12.180> especially<00:06:13.180> at<00:06:13.960> first<00:06:15.270> but<00:06:16.270> once

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
with noses especially at first but once

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.500 
with noses especially at first but once
I<00:06:16.660> started<00:06:16.930> working<00:06:17.710> with<00:06:18.480> like<00:06:19.480> a

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
I started working with like a

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.450 
I started working with like a
three-quarter<00:06:20.170> face<00:06:20.410> or<00:06:20.770> even<00:06:20.980> a<00:06:21.040> face<00:06:21.250> in

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
profile the noses weren't as

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.190 
profile the noses weren't as
intimidating<00:06:23.290> and<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:23.920> figured<00:06:24.310> out<00:06:24.460> that<00:06:25.200> less

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
intimidating and I figured out that less

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.540 
intimidating and I figured out that less
is<00:06:26.230> more<00:06:26.650> when<00:06:26.680> you're<00:06:26.950> working<00:06:27.100> with<00:06:27.370> the

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
is more when you're working with the

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.090 
is more when you're working with the
nose<00:06:28.200> and<00:06:29.200> so<00:06:29.530> I'm<00:06:29.800> going<00:06:29.950> to<00:06:29.980> go<00:06:30.190> ahead

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
nose and so I'm going to go ahead

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.680 
nose and so I'm going to go ahead
