00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 pacheco loose face of the model cresto 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.770
 yuyos well our sir that they for 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.080
 be the master of minecraft electricity 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.750
 of minecraft someone has something that 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.960
 Say I have something to say 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.830
 I do not care what lara's opinion 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.560
 first thing I have to do is look 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.560
 a mine my god what is this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.689
 and you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.689
 with this 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.200
 medicine book 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.320
 The next step is to eliminate all 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.790
 area and this thing that I tell you is not only 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.860
 tips the first step you should do 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.260
 to serve a mine cross now touch what 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.399
 better to look for the rest first thing 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 we have to do is look back on 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.329
 a mine that there are a lot now 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.980
 we give cane after going through a 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.780
 vicious circle of sight that lead us to 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.089
 no side that we have beside the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.250
 rest let's explain how unfortunate 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.250
 we take the crestón and we aspire 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.070
 and before I forget what we throw 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.900
 that we do not need clear, I'm left over 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.460
 but there are also more ways to 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.680
 get this that michaels see the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.920
 because the trick of the bee or like me 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.810
 I call the puncture raw and the trick of 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.120
 dry tree or as I call it go to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.980
 take by act also point already takes 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.750
 take the trick of throwing diamonds at 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.330
 lava or as I call it being very smart in 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.520
 minecraft 'open sesame' porca misèria 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.940
 the trick of the bone people like I do 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.550
 I call Pandora's box 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.979
 now we store the rest in one place 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.210
 secret under water is to say that 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.570
 nobody is going to see it 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.610
 to break the routine we dedicate ourselves to 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.710
 Achuchar books is important to do this 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.869
 step because that way we will eliminate the vision 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.040
 abstract of caves that are books but 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.810
 green in play so we do not 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.260
 we will never mistake 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.910
 for all the mushrooms of minecraft 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.910
 it's so big that it has a life of its own 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.790
 pussy if you have spoken the next step is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.740
 travel to the island of the sheep to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:18.420
 get wool once there we will have 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:20.010
 that caress the 23.55 84 thousand sheep or 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.900
 what is the same 2 million block 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.030
 of wool so for the right now the most 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.310
 complicated to look for slims but in some 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.080
 swamp without any cave like it's going to be 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.670
 very complicated, there is only one 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.670
 very funny alternative 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.460
 we are about to steal the balls of 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.460
 sling hunters likes and 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.460
 follow me 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.810
 it has escaped me 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.010
 around here there has to be something let's see 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.830
 this chest oh my god perfect more 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.140
 perfect now the best is who we the 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.739
 aspire before they come kill and 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.420
 nicole so I open now only remains 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.330
 organize everything in horizontal and 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.819
 vertically the wool you repeat and 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.940
 torches beach balls spider webs 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.430
 musical boxes green points ribbons and 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.799
 buttons and levers now we only have left 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.030
 get to program the system we will use 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:28.090
 all this the table is huge the sweet 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.459
 changes them better and the coils of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.680
 quantum percussion five minutes later 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.019
 Well, here we have our system of 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.060
 rest this time is a screen where 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.440
 we can draw with colors have 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.910
 memory included that means that 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.620
 we can keep our works of art 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.260
 with what we want and so we will not forget 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.640
 with the passage of time from minecraft yes and 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.510
 the system was always built 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.730
 the rest 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.450
 what he wants is that I can but because 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.069
 we have warned him a lot with this what 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.599
 you want me to tell you how I like it 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.400
 work alone and with metal music 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.939
 background but for the next I notice 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.939
 worth co 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.349
 why 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.879
 two days later 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.680
 updated michael file does not work 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.680
 none of this because my series
