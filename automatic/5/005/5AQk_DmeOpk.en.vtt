fighting<00:01:51.310> over<00:01:51.789> it's<00:01:52.149> still<00:01:52.360> able<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.750> provide

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
fighting over it's still able to provide

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.080 
fighting over it's still able to provide
power<00:01:53.409> for<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.979> part<00:01:54.219> of<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> region<00:01:54.820> which<00:01:54.969> is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
power for a part of the region which is

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.270 
power for a part of the region which is
its<00:01:55.210> big<00:01:55.420> draw<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:55.960> course<00:01:56.500> mr.<00:01:56.680> house<00:01:57.039> is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
its big draw of course mr. house is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.770 
its big draw of course mr. house is
playing<00:01:57.520> into<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.820> as<00:01:57.909> well<00:01:58.090> because<00:01:58.539> mr.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
playing into it as well because mr.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.899 
playing into it as well because mr.
house<00:01:58.960> doesn't<00:01:59.229> want<00:01:59.409> NCR<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.859> win<00:02:00.070> ultimately

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
house doesn't want NCR to win ultimately

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.190 
house doesn't want NCR to win ultimately
because<00:02:01.240> he<00:02:01.329> doesn't<00:02:01.509> want<00:02:01.659> them<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:02.049> take

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
because he doesn't want them to take

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.840 
because he doesn't want them to take
control<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.710> strip<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.189> that's<00:02:03.369> not<00:02:03.520> going

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
control the strip but that's not going

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.969 
control the strip but that's not going
to<00:02:04.060> happen<00:02:04.240> because<00:02:04.990> you're<00:02:05.380> going<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.770> work

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
to happen because you're going to work

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.800 
to happen because you're going to work
for<00:02:06.310> me<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.850> general<00:02:07.180> idea<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.539> we<00:02:07.689> have

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
for me the general idea is that we have

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.749 
for me the general idea is that we have
the<00:02:07.899> three<00:02:08.080> major<00:02:08.229> factions<00:02:08.560> mr.<00:02:08.979> house<00:02:09.130> NCR

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
the three major factions mr. house NCR

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.850 
the three major factions mr. house NCR
and<00:02:10.030> caesar's<00:02:10.750> legion<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:11.650> they're<00:02:11.769> all

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
and caesar's legion but then they're all

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.259 
and caesar's legion but then they're all
these<00:02:12.040> sub<00:02:12.220> factions<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.849> Great<00:02:13.000> Khans

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
these sub factions like the Great Khans

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.860 
these sub factions like the Great Khans
the<00:02:13.690> powder<00:02:13.900> gangs<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.830> Kings<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.550> boom

the followers the apocalypse and the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.670 
the followers the apocalypse and the
player<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> go<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.299> those<00:02:18.450> groups<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.110> try<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
player can go to those groups and try to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
to experience this faction we want them

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.649 
to experience this faction we want them
