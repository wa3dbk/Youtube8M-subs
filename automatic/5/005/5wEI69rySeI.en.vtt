00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.919
 and as I say in the title of the video is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.980
 a drunk practice like that because of 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:32.460
 that today was the draw for the semifinals 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 of the champions league and well not all 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.120
 when he likes soccer but hey 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 had invented football just to dedicate 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.260
 a special time to the semifinals 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.780
 corpse of the league of champions 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 barcelona several million real madrid 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 by designers two Spanish teams 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 of the dale team, I think it 's 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.930
 milestones what is best demonstrated 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.690
 they were at full all the little doubt 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.870
 that the match will be closed to Malaga 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.300
 almost happens to al borussia dortmund 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.670
 but good old story and you have to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.850
 move the pages and move on 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.390
 when without a hat and it's all veins 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390
 who are watching me 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.979
 the series more bitches the one that was more 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 shit that I think they are 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.610
 loading the pants right now are the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.500
 from Barcelona they play, I think against 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.229
 one of the most complicated types with a 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.400
 bunch of stars that is not of the two 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.400
 from Spain the bayern Munich then 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.830
 I think you did not like them much if 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.510
 right now if we do not like it we love it but 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.420
 This is how the little ball of the 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.730
 but that 's part of the draw 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.670
 I do not think it much draw what already 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.350
 I was done that it was going to be like that 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.290
 barcelona-bayern Munich if it happens to the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.790
 barcelona I give you more chances of 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.520
 come out champion because the bayern saw them 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.260
 I think it is one of the most complicated 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.350
 barcelona the problem that I see race 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.900
 is that whore has no puyol defense ever 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.540
 he recovered from that burst of 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.850
 cartilages let it made di Maria and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.400
 the classic is outside 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.780
 It does not know how to play alone all the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.539
 barcelonista will agree that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.720
 pique without puyol does not it is more 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.290
 lost that a fart in a forest 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 Adriano is injured then foundered 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.850
 It's your turn to play with youth players 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.200
 reason why when 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.349
 they do this 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.849
 the reason that when you sign up 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.250
 teams to the champions only give you 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.110
 a list of 25 players were injured 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.519
 the transfer is test you lost them 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.069
 you sold whatever they exist no longer 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.610
 you can add more people then what 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.060
 only this technician has left 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.500
 tito state and the new one is to put the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.959
 that I already had written in this case will be 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.330
 a canterano that is going to premiere or 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.560
 is going to play one of the most games 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.099
 powerful of your life playing the part 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.140
 piquÃ© that is always carrying the in 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.720
 defense but that itch 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.510
 we are for the show that for good 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.710
 but then the fart runs from this 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.710
 way 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.710
 defense something made shit of 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.269
 of barcelona against the powerful 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.690
 front of the bayern I'm going to see them 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.390
 what fart 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.260
 we walk here throwing ourselves and the trees 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.260
 they are also good 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.530
 delicious quality we are in the 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.360
 I work in a text break and here it is 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.650
 this new text which means 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.650
 who wins Barcelona 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.120
 although he says the question offends ok 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.010
 second good key and I say it if the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.689
 barcelona when you get to the bar you come with 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.459
 twice as likely to win the 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.430
 champions because you tell me about the most 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.109
 powerful hopefully messi is well not 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.930
 I will burst it because it is peeling 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:53.200
 Messi was 10 and he got how many days 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.849
 15 20 minutes and solved them a match 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.810
 They did not know how to get it out 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.639
 ahead 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.400
 That's why we're going to get fed up and keep them 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.260
 healthy so they can move to the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.970
 final 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.709
 realmadrid borussia dormunt pronounced 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.299
 He put together the same team in the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.159
 Group stage with Real Madrid and 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.359
 dominated madrid I think the local 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.359
 won 3 to 1 2 to 1 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.229
 not in vain already of pronounced marussia 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.299
 some and in Madrid they were one to one 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.330
 Only Cesc won the bronzer because 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.820
 first of that group was the difference 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.639
 this gentleman is that already in the semifinals 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.590
 they have nothing to do with the phase 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.570
 of groups then let's see what wave 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.789
 is another thing the malaga put against the 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.860
 strings to borussia dormunt and it is not 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.600
 take away merit from mÃ¡laga but the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.430
 Malaga does not have the potential that with the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.710
 that will be found right now in the phase of 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.150
 semifinals I say what happens in Madrid 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.820
 I want Madrid to pass, I'll go to 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.040
 madrid but let's see what waves this 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.700
 the final 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.530
 madrid bayern a madrid-barcelona ya and 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.410
 the crazy one who loses board has to 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.720
 to hit him was happiness all 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.710
 the Madridistas waiting for the tenth but 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.050
 whoever loses has to take for granted 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.060
 satisfied because all four have been 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.730
 best of the champions 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.110
 leave in the comments box what 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.969
 think 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.719
 I do not want fatalism Satanism 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:19.239
 I do not want fanaticism propose a 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:23.509
 criticism to see with let's talk football 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:27.559
 this one who believes that theft happens to 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.929
 Malaga the last blow was the place that 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:31.669
 they are the keys of the bayern of barcelona 

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:33.979
 Real Madrid or Borussia Dortmund 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.179
