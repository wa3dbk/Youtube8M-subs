Sena<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.300> Kostas<00:00:33.840> well<00:00:34.140> evenly<00:00:35.010> distributed

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
Sena for Kostas well evenly distributed

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.180 
Sena for Kostas well evenly distributed
flaps<00:00:37.700> distribute<00:00:38.700> again<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.450> Navy

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
flaps distribute again so it's not Navy

we<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.489> brand<00:00:42.090> new<00:00:42.149> Pullman<00:00:42.660> campus

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.200 

the<00:00:50.890> thing<00:00:51.100> without<00:00:51.250> Sinestro<00:00:51.790> synchro<00:00:52.120> is

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
the thing without Sinestro synchro is

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.840 
the thing without Sinestro synchro is
that<00:00:52.360> has<00:00:52.450> a<00:00:52.480> pre-infusion<00:00:52.960> system<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.670> sort

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
that has a pre-infusion system it's sort

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.850 
that has a pre-infusion system it's sort
of<00:00:54.880> like<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.090> low-pressure<00:00:55.809> wetting<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.770> the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
of like a low-pressure wetting of the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.500 
of like a low-pressure wetting of the
cake<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.059> can<00:00:58.180> get<00:00:58.329> that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
cake so that you can get that

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:07.680 
cake so that you can get that
construction<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.910> so<00:01:07.060> we<00:01:07.180> want<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.570> be

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
construction and so we want it to be

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.870 
construction and so we want it to be
dripping<00:01:07.990> just<00:01:08.320> about<00:01:08.530> half<00:01:08.800> way<00:01:09.070> that's<00:01:09.820> a

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
dripping just about half way that's a

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
dripping just about half way that's a
good<00:01:10.030> indication<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.600> we're<00:01:10.810> getting

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
good indication that we're getting

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
good indication that we're getting
perfect<00:01:11.410> extraction

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.419 

there<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.420> rather<00:01:28.659> large<00:01:28.869> cups<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:30.159> can<00:01:30.310> say

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
there is a rather large cups you can say

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.639 
there is a rather large cups you can say
like<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:31.079> difference<00:01:32.079> between<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.530> colors

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
like the difference between the colors

00:01:32.649 --> 00:02:00.529 
like the difference between the colors
as<00:01:33.490> oils<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.570> sugars

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.170
