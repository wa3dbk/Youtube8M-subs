trap there's a lot of great features on
it<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.879> first<00:01:00.120> thing<00:01:00.330> that<00:01:00.629> I'd<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> show

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it the first thing that I'd like to show

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.410 
it the first thing that I'd like to show
you<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.400> that<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.479> trap<00:01:04.040> basically<00:01:05.040> has<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
you is that the trap basically has a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.930 
you is that the trap basically has a
door<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> front<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.790> be

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
door on the front here and this can be

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.230 
door on the front here and this can be
latched<00:01:09.180> shut<00:01:09.500> like<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
latched shut like this and this is to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.630 
latched shut like this and this is to
transport<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> catch<00:01:13.380> after<00:01:14.220> you've<00:01:14.369> made<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
transport the catch after you've made a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.810 
transport the catch after you've made a
catch<00:01:14.960> there's<00:01:15.960> no<00:01:16.140> chance<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.829> ramp<00:01:17.549> door

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
catch there's no chance of the ramp door

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.170 
catch there's no chance of the ramp door
opening<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.079> squirrels<00:01:19.680> getting<00:01:20.009> out

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
opening up and the squirrels getting out

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.380 
opening up and the squirrels getting out
this<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:21.600> function<00:01:22.109> as<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> wing<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:24.000> help

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this can also function as a wing to help

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
this can also function as a wing to help
guide<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> squirrels<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> trap<00:01:25.799> so

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
guide the squirrels into the trap so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
guide the squirrels into the trap so
that<00:01:26.369> when<00:01:26.609> you<00:01:26.700> set<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.969> you<00:01:27.750> would<00:01:27.899> open<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that when you set it you would open it

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.459 
that when you set it you would open it
up<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.429> and<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.170> put<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> little

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
up like so and you could put a little

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.959 
up like so and you could put a little
stake<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.979> there<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> hold<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.460> open<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.850> this

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
stake in there to hold it open and this

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.209 
stake in there to hold it open and this
serves<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.539> wing<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.990> funnel<00:01:34.229> them<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.619> now

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
serves as a wing to funnel them in now

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.099 
serves as a wing to funnel them in now
the<00:01:35.340> way<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> trap<00:01:35.789> works<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.869> fairly

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
the way the trap works it's fairly

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.639 
the way the trap works it's fairly
simple

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
simple

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.270 
simple
the<00:01:38.280> squirrels<00:01:38.729> enter<00:01:39.359> through<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.719> tunnel

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the squirrels enter through the tunnel

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.120 
the squirrels enter through the tunnel
this<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> spring-loaded<00:01:42.409> gate<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.890> goes

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
this is a spring-loaded gate that goes

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.149 
this is a spring-loaded gate that goes
up<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> squirrel<00:01:45.060> gets<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.890> once<00:01:46.890> he<00:01:46.979> gets

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
up so the squirrel gets in once he gets

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.929 
up so the squirrel gets in once he gets
in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.210> ramp<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.749> the<00:01:49.079> door<00:01:49.759> springs<00:01:50.759> back

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
in the ramp or the door springs back

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.349 
in the ramp or the door springs back
down<00:01:51.179> and<00:01:51.450> he<00:01:51.899> can't<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:53.270> couple<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
down and he can't get out a couple of

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.969 
down and he can't get out a couple of
the<00:01:54.479> things<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.899> note<00:01:55.049> about<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.409> trap<00:01:55.679> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the things to note about this trap is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.700 
the things to note about this trap is
the<00:01:56.520> side<00:01:56.789> walls<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:58.020> are<00:01:58.140> along<00:01:58.319> both<00:01:58.649> sides

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the side walls that are along both sides

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.389 
the side walls that are along both sides
of<00:01:59.249> the<00:01:59.819> gate<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.890> what<00:02:01.890> happens<00:02:02.219> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
of the gate right here what happens is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.730 
of the gate right here what happens is
when<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.700> squirrel<00:02:03.030> tries<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.569> get<00:02:04.109> out<00:02:04.259> he

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
when the squirrel tries to get out he

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.649 
when the squirrel tries to get out he
doesn't<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:06.030> back<00:02:06.329> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
doesn't really think about going back to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.960 
doesn't really think about going back to
the<00:02:07.200> center<00:02:07.499> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> trap<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.130> then<00:02:08.670> trying

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the center of the trap and then trying

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.559 
the center of the trap and then trying
to<00:02:09.060> come<00:02:09.240> back<00:02:09.420> out<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> same<00:02:09.990> way<00:02:10.200> when<00:02:10.500> in

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
to come back out the same way when in

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.750 
to come back out the same way when in
even<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.690> he<00:02:12.780> does<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.410> don't<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.460> if<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.640> can

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
even if he does I don't know if you can

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.340 
even if he does I don't know if you can
see<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.270> video<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:15.780> hard<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.080> see

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
see this on the video it's hard to see

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.730 
see this on the video it's hard to see
but<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> bottom<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.430> door<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:18.410> angled<00:02:19.410> to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
but the bottom of this door is angled to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.250 
but the bottom of this door is angled to
lay<00:02:19.890> flat<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.209> bottom<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.629> cage<00:02:21.840> so

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
lay flat on the bottom of the cage so

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.410 
lay flat on the bottom of the cage so
that<00:02:22.290> when<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> squirrel<00:02:23.040> comes<00:02:23.310> up<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:24.239> try

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
that when the squirrel comes up to try

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.240 
that when the squirrel comes up to try
and<00:02:24.450> push<00:02:24.780> against<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.290> he's<00:02:25.500> actually<00:02:25.680> stay

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
and push against it he's actually stay

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
and push against it he's actually stay
ending<00:02:26.520> on<00:02:26.700> top<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.810> bottom<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> gate

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
ending on top of the bottom of the gate

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.590 
ending on top of the bottom of the gate
and<00:02:29.100> there's<00:02:30.030> no<00:02:30.210> way<00:02:30.360> he's<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.690> get<00:02:30.840> out

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
and there's no way he's going to get out

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.590 
and there's no way he's going to get out
the<00:02:33.600> next<00:02:33.870> thing<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.080> you'll<00:02:34.440> notice<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:35.600> to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
the next thing that you'll notice is to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.910 
the next thing that you'll notice is to
open<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:38.160> cage<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> catch<00:02:39.660> out<00:02:39.960> this

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
open the cage and get the catch out this

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.890 
open the cage and get the catch out this
has<00:02:41.070> got<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> couple<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.730> catches<00:02:42.270> right<00:02:42.690> here

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
has got a couple of catches right here

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.130 
has got a couple of catches right here
and<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.560> has<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> spring<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.490> it

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and you can see this has a spring on it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.370 
and you can see this has a spring on it
and<00:02:46.140> there's<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.340> each<00:02:47.550> side<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:49.170> gate

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
and there's one on each side of the gate

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.130 
and there's one on each side of the gate
and<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:51.150> simply<00:02:52.520> push<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.730> back<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.870> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
and you simply push that back like that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.080 
and you simply push that back like that
and<00:02:58.940> now<00:02:59.940> you<00:02:59.970> can<00:03:00.150> open<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:01.380> cage<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
and now you can open the cage and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.300 
and now you can open the cage and
retrieve<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.270> catch

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
retrieve the catch

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.370 
retrieve the catch
normally<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.880> method<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.330> this<00:03:06.450> pageant<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
normally the method of this pageant in a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.290 
normally the method of this pageant in a
trap<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.520> simply<00:03:08.730> drown<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
trap like this is to simply drown the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.949 
trap like this is to simply drown the
animal<00:03:09.660> drop<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.380> tub<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.890> water<00:03:11.959> until

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
animal drop it in a tub of water until

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.530 
animal drop it in a tub of water until
they<00:03:13.230> expire<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.890> then<00:03:14.430> open<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.790> up<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.030> get

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
they expire and then open it up and get

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.740 
they expire and then open it up and get
them<00:03:15.690> out<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.790> would<00:03:18.239> close<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
them out and so you would close that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.550 
them out and so you would close that
back<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:21.050> once<00:03:22.050> you'll<00:03:22.200> notice

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
back up like so and once you'll notice

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.030 
back up like so and once you'll notice
when<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.739> start<00:03:23.040> handling<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.640> trap<00:03:23.910> is

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
when you start handling this trap is

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.240 
when you start handling this trap is
everything<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.450> well-made<00:03:27.450> heavy-gauge

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
everything is well-made heavy-gauge

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.900 
everything is well-made heavy-gauge
there's<00:03:29.250> nothing<00:03:29.640> cheap<00:03:29.670> or<00:03:30.090> flimsy<00:03:30.660> about<00:03:31.410> it

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
there's nothing cheap or flimsy about it

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.310 
there's nothing cheap or flimsy about it
you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.060> tell<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.330> trap<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.810> going<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.080> last

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
you can tell this trap is going to last

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.979 
you can tell this trap is going to last
a<00:03:34.709> while<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:37.220> there's<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.280> gate<00:03:38.549> on<00:03:38.820> each<00:03:39.660> side

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
a while and there's a gate on each side

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.500 
a while and there's a gate on each side
there's<00:03:40.290> one<00:03:40.500> here<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:40.950> one<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
there's one here and one here so the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.009 
there's one here and one here so the
squirrels<00:03:42.750> can<00:03:43.049> come<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.410> from<00:03:43.620> either<00:03:43.769> way

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
squirrels can come in from either way

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.199 
squirrels can come in from either way
for<00:03:46.019> carrying<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> trap<00:03:46.920> there<00:03:47.610> are<00:03:47.790> two

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
for carrying the trap there are two

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.160 
for carrying the trap there are two
chains<00:03:48.570> right<00:03:48.870> here<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.260> form<00:03:49.500> handles<00:03:49.910> and

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
chains right here that form handles and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.030 
chains right here that form handles and
so<00:03:52.170> that's<00:03:52.350> very<00:03:52.560> nice

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
so that's very nice

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.759 
so that's very nice
touch<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:54.360> then<00:03:54.480> finally<00:03:54.810> there's<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.049> tag<00:03:55.350> a

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
touch and then finally there's a tag a

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.740 
touch and then finally there's a tag a
brass<00:03:56.400> tag<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.030> top<00:03:57.239> right<00:03:57.510> here<00:03:57.810> and

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
brass tag on the top right here and

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.180 
brass tag on the top right here and
basically<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:01.049> guess<00:04:01.410> for<00:04:01.650> people<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.010> aren't

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
basically I guess for people that aren't

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.800 
basically I guess for people that aren't
that<00:04:02.280> familiar<00:04:02.519> with<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.030> cage<00:04:03.239> trapping

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that familiar with the cage trapping

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.800 
that familiar with the cage trapping
they've<00:04:04.650> asked<00:04:05.040> they've<00:04:05.820> asked<00:04:06.030> him<00:04:06.269> how<00:04:06.690> do<00:04:06.750> I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
they've asked they've asked him how do I

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.759 
they've asked they've asked him how do I
know<00:04:06.989> which<00:04:07.140> way<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.530> up

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
know which way is up

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.940 
know which way is up
he<00:04:08.400> puts<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.820> tag<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.329> with<00:04:09.989> his<00:04:10.470> name<00:04:10.709> and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
he puts the tag on it with his name and

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.860 
he puts the tag on it with his name and
website<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.940> basically<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
website and basically in the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.360 
website and basically in the
instructions<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.560> says<00:04:13.590> if<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:13.950> can<00:04:14.100> read<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
instructions it says if you can read the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.190 
instructions it says if you can read the
tag<00:04:14.610> then<00:04:15.060> you've<00:04:15.239> got<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> trap<00:04:15.720> right<00:04:15.930> side

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
tag then you've got the trap right side

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.050 
tag then you've got the trap right side
up<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.100> guess<00:04:17.250> they're<00:04:17.400> people<00:04:17.729> that<00:04:17.760> needed

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
up so I guess they're people that needed

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.349 
up so I guess they're people that needed
help<00:04:18.180> with<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:19.489> but<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.609> employ<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.090> trap

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
help with that but to employ the trap

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.659 
help with that but to employ the trap
basically<00:04:22.140> what<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.440> would<00:04:22.500> do<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:23.160> put<00:04:23.580> it

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
basically what you would do is put it

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.670 
basically what you would do is put it
out<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.880> woods<00:04:24.090> or<00:04:24.600> wherever<00:04:25.229> you're

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
out in the woods or wherever you're

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.950 
out in the woods or wherever you're
going<00:04:25.979> to<00:04:26.040> be<00:04:26.100> trapping<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.840> sprinkle<00:04:27.840> your

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
going to be trapping and sprinkle your

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.070 
going to be trapping and sprinkle your
bait<00:04:28.169> on<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.710> inside<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.220> trap<00:04:30.080> sprinkle

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
bait on the inside of the trap sprinkle

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.890 
bait on the inside of the trap sprinkle
some<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.610> gate<00:04:32.820> leading<00:04:33.060> into<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.750> and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
some and the gate leading into it and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.529 
some and the gate leading into it and
maybe<00:04:34.260> right<00:04:34.560> out<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:34.890> front<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.610> can

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
maybe right out in front of it you can

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.040 
maybe right out in front of it you can
use<00:04:36.660> whole<00:04:36.900> corn<00:04:37.490> sunflower<00:04:38.490> seeds<00:04:38.849> peanuts

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
use whole corn sunflower seeds peanuts

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.810 
use whole corn sunflower seeds peanuts
whatever<00:04:40.530> you'd<00:04:40.710> normally<00:04:40.890> bait<00:04:41.310> your

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
whatever you'd normally bait your

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.800 
whatever you'd normally bait your
squirrels<00:04:42.180> with<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> anyway<00:04:45.300> that's<00:04:45.480> so

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
squirrels with so anyway that's so

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.230 
squirrels with so anyway that's so
that's<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:46.320> basic<00:04:46.710> usage<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.340> trap<00:04:47.580> one

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
that's the basic usage of the trap one

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.750 
that's the basic usage of the trap one
of<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.450> tips<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:49.710> he<00:04:49.890> does<00:04:50.130> include<00:04:50.490> in<00:04:50.640> the

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
of the tips that he does include in the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.420 
of the tips that he does include in the
instructions<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.510> that's<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.590> good<00:04:52.980> idea<00:04:53.130> with

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
instructions and that's a good idea with

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.360 
instructions and that's a good idea with
any<00:04:53.610> cage<00:04:53.880> trap<00:04:54.240> is<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:55.380> cover<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.160> bottom

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
any cage trap is to cover the bottom

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
any cage trap is to cover the bottom
with<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:57.030> layer<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.570> dirt<00:04:58.340> that<00:04:59.340> way<00:04:59.520> the<00:05:00.030> animal

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
with a layer of dirt that way the animal

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.650 
with a layer of dirt that way the animal
is<00:05:00.480> not<00:05:00.630> walking<00:05:00.960> on<00:05:01.380> welded<00:05:02.250> wire<00:05:02.660> the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
is not walking on welded wire the

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.960 
is not walking on welded wire the
animals<00:05:04.050> walking<00:05:04.290> on<00:05:04.590> dirt<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.130> leaves<00:05:05.340> so

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
animals walking on dirt and leaves so

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.400 
animals walking on dirt and leaves so
that's<00:05:06.150> always<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.540> good<00:05:06.660> idea

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
that's always a good idea

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.690 
that's always a good idea
whether<00:05:08.220> your<00:05:08.490> cage<00:05:08.940> trap<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.450> Bobcats<00:05:09.930> Coons

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
whether your cage trap and Bobcats Coons

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.750 
whether your cage trap and Bobcats Coons
squirrels<00:05:11.700> or<00:05:12.180> anything<00:05:12.420> else<00:05:13.670> sitting<00:05:14.670> on

squirrels or anything else sitting on
the<00:05:14.850> ground<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.390> then<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:15.900> can<00:05:16.050> simply<00:05:16.410> sift

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
the ground and then you can simply sift

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.750 
the ground and then you can simply sift
the<00:05:17.370> dirt<00:05:17.580> over<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.300> top<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.770> the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
the dirt over the top so that the the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.340 
the dirt over the top so that the the
animals<00:05:21.060> walking<00:05:21.300> on<00:05:21.510> dirt<00:05:21.720> sprinkle<00:05:22.260> your

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
animals walking on dirt sprinkle your

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.130 
animals walking on dirt sprinkle your
bait<00:05:22.530> on<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> inside<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:24.840> should<00:05:25.020> be

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
bait on the inside and you should be

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.590 
bait on the inside and you should be
good<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.380> go<00:05:25.670> the<00:05:26.670> other<00:05:26.760> thing<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.120> he<00:05:27.420> does

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
good to go the other thing that he does

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.440 
good to go the other thing that he does
mention<00:05:27.990> is<00:05:28.400> pre<00:05:29.400> baiting<00:05:29.760> your<00:05:29.850> spots<00:05:30.180> and

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
mention is pre baiting your spots and

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.850 
mention is pre baiting your spots and
getting<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.050> squirrels<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.470> come<00:05:31.620> into<00:05:31.770> your
