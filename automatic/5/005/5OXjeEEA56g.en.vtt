00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
on the crazy bridge let me get rid of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.759 
on the crazy bridge let me get rid of
this<00:00:11.580> pillar<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> reason<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.559> I'm<00:00:13.740> doing

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
this pillar the reason that I'm doing

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.400 
this pillar the reason that I'm doing
this<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.639> because<00:00:14.730> no<00:00:15.599> matter<00:00:15.750> how<00:00:16.049> hard<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
this is because no matter how hard I

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.380 
this is because no matter how hard I
tried<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:16.980> impossible<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> proper

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
tried it was impossible to get a proper

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.179 
tried it was impossible to get a proper
video<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:19.220> picture<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.730> craziness<00:00:21.689> here

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
video or picture of this craziness here

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.550 
video or picture of this craziness here
the<00:00:23.189> main<00:00:23.369> problem<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.449> high<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the main problem is it's so high that it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.700 
the main problem is it's so high that it
can't<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:25.949> fit<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.279> screen<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
can't all fit on one screen and the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.109 
can't all fit on one screen and the
bridge<00:00:28.949> disappears<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> certain<00:00:30.000> height

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
bridge disappears at a certain height

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999 
bridge disappears at a certain height
because<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.539> too<00:00:30.750> far<00:00:30.990> away<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.320> render<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
because it's too far away to render and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889 
because it's too far away to render and
that's<00:00:32.640> actually<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.000> big<00:00:33.480> chunk<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
that's actually a big chunk of the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.780 
that's actually a big chunk of the
bridge<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> can't<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.670> actually

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
bridge that you can't see it's actually

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.490 
bridge that you can't see it's actually
the<00:00:36.420> majority<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> bridge<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the majority of the bridge that you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
the majority of the bridge that you
can't<00:00:37.710> see<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.910> could<00:00:39.030> see<00:00:39.239> here

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
can't see because as you could see here

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
can't see because as you could see here
it's<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.899> barely<00:00:40.350> rendered<00:00:40.920> near<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it's just barely rendered near the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
it's just barely rendered near the
bottom<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.480> were<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> do

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
bottom but what we were going to do

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
bottom but what we were going to do
today<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.040> gonna<00:00:44.129> take<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> drive<00:00:44.789> all

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
today is we are gonna take a drive all

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.590 
today is we are gonna take a drive all
the<00:00:45.450> way<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> around<00:00:46.190> I<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.969> tried<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> do

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the way up and around I have tried to do

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
the way up and around I have tried to do
this<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.170> in-game<00:00:49.350> recorder<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.100> way

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
this with the in-game recorder that way

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.520 
this with the in-game recorder that way
I<00:00:50.309> could<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.550> rid<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.300> UI<00:00:52.079> interface

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
I could get rid of all the UI interface

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
I could get rid of all the UI interface
but<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.910> doesn't<00:00:54.360> work<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.930> some

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
but it doesn't work because for some

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.680 
but it doesn't work because for some
crazy-ass<00:00:56.129> reason<00:00:56.699> SimCity<00:00:57.149> decided<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> make

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
crazy-ass reason SimCity decided to make

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.229 
crazy-ass reason SimCity decided to make
it<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> videos<00:00:58.469> only<00:00:59.190> run<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it so the videos only run for like a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.849 
it so the videos only run for like a
minute<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.809> two<00:01:00.960> minutes<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.440> sure<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> did

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
minute or two minutes I'm not sure I did

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
minute or two minutes I'm not sure I did
I<00:01:01.920> didn't<00:01:02.129> keep<00:01:02.430> track<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.359> try<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> do

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I didn't keep track but I did try to do

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
I didn't keep track but I did try to do
it<00:01:03.899> without<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.260> UI<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.949> didn't

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it without the UI and it just didn't

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
it without the UI and it just didn't
work<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.030> would've<00:01:06.240> took<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.630> five

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
work because it would've took like five

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.500 
work because it would've took like five
or<00:01:07.229> six<00:01:07.260> video<00:01:07.770> clips<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.700> the

what he's going to be doing is driving
up<00:01:27.390> around<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> bridge<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.259> coming<00:01:28.560> out

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
here that's just one big loop around so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.710 
here that's just one big loop around so
we<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.250> gonna<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.329> gonna<00:01:33.509> stop
