the blue paint

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.410 
the blue paint
I<00:02:47.590> was<00:02:47.920> pretty<00:02:48.220> generous<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.270> there

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
I was pretty generous with it so there

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.480 
I was pretty generous with it so there
were<00:02:49.510> two<00:02:49.720> thick<00:02:50.050> coats<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.620> then<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.310> just

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
were two thick coats and then we just

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.880 
were two thick coats and then we just
did<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.670> little<00:02:51.880> bit<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.390> border<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.590> last

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
did a little bit of a border so the last

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.640 
did a little bit of a border so the last
thing<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.310> do<00:02:54.490> is<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.420> cover<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.960> entire<00:02:56.080> talk

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
thing to do is to cover the entire talk

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.960 
thing to do is to cover the entire talk
board<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.220> chalk<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:58.960> condition<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:02.970> okay

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
board in chalk to condition it so okay

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.700 
board in chalk to condition it so okay
I'm<00:03:04.240> gonna<00:03:04.390> turn<00:03:04.630> with<00:03:04.870> another<00:03:05.140> piece<00:03:05.440> but

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
I'm gonna turn with another piece but

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.380 
I'm gonna turn with another piece but
basically<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.370> discover<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.210> whole

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
basically so you discover the whole

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.730 
basically so you discover the whole
thing<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.840> then<00:03:07.960> wipe<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.170> off<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.590> then

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
thing and then wipe that off and then

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.480 
thing and then wipe that off and then

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.670 

okay<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.330> here<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.900> all<00:03:16.930> covered<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.710> chalk

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
okay so here it is all covered in chalk

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.200 
okay so here it is all covered in chalk
it's<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.740> very<00:03:20.920> last<00:03:21.130> step<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.640> we<00:03:21.820> installed

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
it's a very last step is we installed

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.420 
it's a very last step is we installed
these<00:03:22.420> drawer<00:03:22.870> pulls<00:03:23.140> they're<00:03:23.740> actually<00:03:24.190> like

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
these drawer pulls they're actually like

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.700 
these drawer pulls they're actually like
the<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:24.970> would<00:03:25.060> install<00:03:25.630> um<00:03:25.960> from

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
the kind you would install um from

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.910 
the kind you would install um from
dresser<00:03:27.070> drawers<00:03:27.310> or<00:03:27.550> something<00:03:27.880> reversed<00:03:28.920> so

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
dresser drawers or something reversed so

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.460 
dresser drawers or something reversed so
we<00:03:30.040> flip<00:03:30.280> them<00:03:30.400> up<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.910> could<00:03:31.030> put<00:03:31.210> talk

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
we flip them up so you could put talk

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.740 
we flip them up so you could put talk
inside<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.940> was<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> little<00:03:34.330> bit<00:03:34.450> tricky

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
inside and I was a little bit tricky

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.860 
inside and I was a little bit tricky
because<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:35.050> wanted<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.530> find<00:03:35.710> ones<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.250> just

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
because I wanted to find ones that just

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.690 
because I wanted to find ones that just
screwed<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.380> on<00:03:38.590> either<00:03:38.740> side<00:03:39.070> since<00:03:39.460> we're

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
screwed in on either side since we're

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.580 
screwed in on either side since we're
you<00:03:40.510> know<00:03:40.600> we<00:03:40.720> can't<00:03:40.960> get<00:03:41.110> behind<00:03:41.260> this

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
you know we can't get behind this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.310 
you know we can't get behind this
woodwork<00:03:41.830> but<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.610> mean<00:03:43.510> up<00:03:43.630> having<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.110> use

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
woodwork but I mean up having to use

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.860 
woodwork but I mean up having to use
adhesive<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.100> glue<00:03:45.520> this<00:03:46.030> one<00:03:46.270> on<00:03:46.450> because<00:03:46.660> I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
adhesive and glue this one on because I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.950 
adhesive and glue this one on because I
couldn't<00:03:47.110> find<00:03:47.260> any<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:48.310> had<00:03:48.520> front<00:03:48.970> screw

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
couldn't find any that had front screw

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.590 
couldn't find any that had front screw
access<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:51.100> when<00:03:51.850> Alice<00:03:52.090> gets<00:03:52.270> a<00:03:52.300> little<00:03:52.480> bit

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
access so when Alice gets a little bit

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.570 
access so when Alice gets a little bit
older<00:03:52.810> we're<00:03:52.900> gonna<00:03:53.020> put<00:03:53.260> another<00:03:53.470> cup<00:03:53.830> lower

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
older we're gonna put another cup lower

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.880 
older we're gonna put another cup lower
down<00:03:54.850> here<00:03:55.180> for<00:03:55.420> her<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:56.410> know<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.710> she<00:03:56.860> can

reach but for right now don't really

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.640 
reach but for right now don't really
need<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.250> but<00:04:01.180> here<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:01.570> go<00:04:01.750> there's<00:04:02.440> our

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
need it but here we go there's our

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.600 
need it but here we go there's our
finished<00:04:03.040> project<00:04:04.710> and<00:04:05.710> as<00:04:06.190> you<00:04:06.340> can<00:04:06.460> tell

finished project and as you can tell

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.060 
finished project and as you can tell
we've<00:04:06.790> been<00:04:06.910> using<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.500> two<00:04:08.590> final

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
we've been using it so two final

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.890 
we've been using it so two final
thoughts<00:04:09.280> about<00:04:09.520> this<00:04:09.910> project<00:04:10.150> first<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.780> all

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
thoughts about this project first of all

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.280 
thoughts about this project first of all
if<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:12.010> can<00:04:12.160> tell<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:12.520> our<00:04:12.700> chalkboard<00:04:13.180> if<00:04:14.080> the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
if you can tell on our chalkboard if the

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.200 
if you can tell on our chalkboard if the
surface<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.710> still<00:04:14.830> really<00:04:15.220> rough<00:04:15.400> because<00:04:15.970> we

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
surface is still really rough because we

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.720 
surface is still really rough because we
have<00:04:16.330> stucco<00:04:16.810> walls<00:04:17.109> on<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:18.010> inside<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.580> we

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
have stucco walls on the inside and we

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.900 
have stucco walls on the inside and we
don't<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:19.030> drywall<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:20.370> chances<00:04:21.370> are<00:04:21.520> your

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
don't have drywall so chances are your

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.000 
don't have drywall so chances are your
wall<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.300> going<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.510> be

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
wall is going to be

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.650 
wall is going to be
smoother<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.640> writing<00:04:24.030> is<00:04:24.120> going<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.330> be<00:04:24.450> much

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
smoother and writing is going to be much

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.170 
smoother and writing is going to be much
smoother<00:04:25.280> because<00:04:26.280> we<00:04:26.550> want<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.880> be<00:04:26.970> able<00:04:27.060> to

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
smoother because we want to be able to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.730 
smoother because we want to be able to
repaint<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:27.630> at<00:04:27.930> some<00:04:28.170> point<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.440> have<00:04:28.590> it

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
repaint that at some point and have it

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.140 
repaint that at some point and have it
the<00:04:28.890> same<00:04:28.920> as<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.340> rest<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.670> house<00:04:29.850> I

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
the same as the rest of the house I

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.810 
the same as the rest of the house I
tried<00:04:30.720> not<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.960> fill<00:04:31.320> in<00:04:31.500> all<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
tried not to fill in all of the the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.380 
tried not to fill in all of the the
roughness<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.950> more<00:04:35.220> uneven<00:04:35.670> than<00:04:36.000> than

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
roughness so it is more uneven than than

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.980 
roughness so it is more uneven than than
yours<00:04:36.600> would<00:04:36.810> probably<00:04:37.260> be<00:04:38.030> second<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.660> had

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
yours would probably be second is I had

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.540 
yours would probably be second is I had
thoughts<00:04:40.260> about<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.710> grout<00:04:40.920> since<00:04:41.370> that's

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
thoughts about the grout since that's

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.190 
thoughts about the grout since that's
the<00:04:41.640> big<00:04:41.850> expense<00:04:42.240> in<00:04:42.420> this<00:04:42.540> project<00:04:42.990> if<00:04:43.110> you

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200
