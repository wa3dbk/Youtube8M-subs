00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
from viruses and malware so this is a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.700 
from viruses and malware so this is a
computer<00:00:19.810> with<00:00:20.110> the<00:00:20.380> sandbox<00:00:21.039> and<00:00:21.430> a<00:00:22.060> fiber

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
computer with the sandbox and a fiber

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.769 
computer with the sandbox and a fiber
virus<00:00:23.710> can't<00:00:24.449> hurt<00:00:25.449> the<00:00:26.160> computer<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:28.150> this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
virus can't hurt the computer and this

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.330 
virus can't hurt the computer and this
one<00:00:29.199> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:31.240> computer<00:00:31.930> will<00:00:32.169> focus<00:00:32.769> on<00:00:33.039> pop

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
one is the computer will focus on pop

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.549 
one is the computer will focus on pop
and<00:00:33.670> it<00:00:34.570> could<00:00:35.340> infect<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.640> computer<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.530> I

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
and it could infect the computer so I

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.720 
and it could infect the computer so I
found<00:00:39.309> this<00:00:39.520> diagram<00:00:40.390> on<00:00:40.750> Sam<00:00:41.290> boxy<00:00:41.950> calm<00:00:43.020> and
