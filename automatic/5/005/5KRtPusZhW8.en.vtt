the iphone here so you can't change this
but<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.519> say<00:03:26.669> yeah<00:03:26.880> there's<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.540> guy

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
but like to say yeah there's a guy

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.150 
but like to say yeah there's a guy
called<00:03:27.840> local<00:03:28.230> Thompson<00:03:28.650> he<00:03:28.769> goes<00:03:28.980> into

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
called local Thompson he goes into

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.020 
called local Thompson he goes into
Wallace<00:03:29.959> so<00:03:31.130> obviously<00:03:32.130> your<00:03:32.459> frame<00:03:32.760> rates

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
Wallace so obviously your frame rates

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.370 
Wallace so obviously your frame rates
now<00:03:33.269> gonna<00:03:33.480> increase<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.200> lowered

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
now gonna increase because you lowered

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.289 
now gonna increase because you lowered
you<00:03:34.590> resolution<00:03:35.130> or<00:03:35.879> whatever

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
you resolution or whatever

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.800 
you resolution or whatever

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.849 
the area that I'm wanting to cover is
kind<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.819> like<00:03:56.819> this<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:58.099> want<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.160> cover<00:04:00.859> the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
kind of like this I want to cover the

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.270 
kind of like this I want to cover the
pathway<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.790> car<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.959> doorway<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.980> I've<00:04:05.250> just

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
pathway the car the doorway so I've just

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.470 
pathway the car the doorway so I've just
marked<00:04:05.790> out<00:04:05.910> here<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.840> bracket<00:04:07.230> works<00:04:07.440> where

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
marked out here the bracket works where

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.670 
marked out here the bracket works where
and<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:10.079> swivels<00:04:10.620> around<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> foscam<00:04:13.470> can

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
and it swivels around and the foscam can

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.080 
and it swivels around and the foscam can
either<00:04:13.829> sit<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:15.030> different<00:04:16.039> positions<00:04:17.039> on<00:04:17.370> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
either sit in different positions on the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.759 
either sit in different positions on the
clump<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:19.079> it's<00:04:19.349> pretty<00:04:19.500> good

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
clump so it's pretty good
