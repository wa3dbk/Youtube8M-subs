00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.940
 environment right 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.180
 This takes years for the servant. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.560

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.040

 As I said, it helps the environment. 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:13.110
 to call anyone because it is to wash with 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.860
