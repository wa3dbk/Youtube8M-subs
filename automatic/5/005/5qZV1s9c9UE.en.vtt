00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
Christian Michael and Cyrus gray I think

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.950 
Christian Michael and Cyrus gray I think
with<00:00:48.910> Christian<00:00:49.270> I<00:00:49.329> think<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.630> biggest<00:00:49.809> thing

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
with Christian I think the biggest thing

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.410 
with Christian I think the biggest thing
is<00:00:50.290> slowing<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.920> game<00:00:51.100> down<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.790> know<00:00:51.910> he's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
is slowing the game down you know he's

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.060 
is slowing the game down you know he's
like<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.750> Energizer<00:00:53.170> Bunny<00:00:53.559> he<00:00:53.739> gets<00:00:53.950> the

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
like the Energizer Bunny he gets the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.400 
like the Energizer Bunny he gets the
ball<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.280> he<00:00:54.610> wants<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.510> go<00:00:55.719> right<00:00:55.930> now

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
ball and he wants to go right now

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.139 
ball and he wants to go right now
he<00:00:56.980> just<00:00:57.130> gotta<00:00:57.340> bear<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.610> slow<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:57.850> game<00:00:58.090> down

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
he just gotta bear to slow the game down

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.780 
he just gotta bear to slow the game down
and<00:00:58.870> let<00:00:59.079> things<00:00:59.320> happen<00:00:59.590> and<00:01:00.010> he's<00:01:00.760> a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
and let things happen and he's a

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.940 
and let things happen and he's a
tremendous<00:01:01.090> talent<00:01:01.719> but<00:01:02.110> sometimes<00:01:02.559> he<00:01:02.770> can

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
tremendous talent but sometimes he can

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.789 
tremendous talent but sometimes he can
outrun<00:01:03.460> people<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.479> in<00:01:04.689> terms<00:01:04.960> of<00:01:05.199> his<00:01:05.500> blocks

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
outrun people and in terms of his blocks

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.620 
outrun people and in terms of his blocks
and<00:01:06.219> he's<00:01:06.490> got<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.729> be<00:01:06.790> able<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:07.030> set<00:01:07.299> him<00:01:07.450> I

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
and he's got to be able to set him I

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.719 
and he's got to be able to set him I
think<00:01:08.530> Cyrus<00:01:08.740> squared<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.219> having<00:01:09.459> one<00:01:09.579> is

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
think Cyrus squared is having one is

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.819 
think Cyrus squared is having one is
better<00:01:09.939> camps<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.600> know<00:01:10.899> he's<00:01:11.259> a<00:01:11.289> guy<00:01:11.499> we<00:01:11.709> can

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
better camps you know he's a guy we can

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.840 
better camps you know he's a guy we can
depend<00:01:12.429> on<00:01:12.609> I<00:01:12.909> think<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.569> thing<00:01:13.749> with<00:01:13.869> him<00:01:14.139> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
depend on I think the thing with him is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.209 
depend on I think the thing with him is
it's<00:01:15.850> being<00:01:16.090> able<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:16.560> decieded<00:01:17.560> overall

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
it's being able to decieded overall

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.129 
it's being able to decieded overall
scheme<00:01:18.819> in<00:01:19.090> terms<00:01:19.359> of<00:01:19.600> picking<00:01:19.869> up<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:20.139 
scheme in terms of picking up the

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:22.169 
scheme in terms of picking up the
blitzes<00:01:20.590> when<00:01:21.340> they<00:01:21.459> come<00:01:21.729> which<00:01:21.999> he's

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
blitzes when they come which he's

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.279 
blitzes when they come which he's
improving<00:01:22.630> on<00:01:23.130> he's<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.159> tremendous<00:01:24.429> runner<00:01:24.939> so

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
improving on he's a tremendous runner so

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.809 
improving on he's a tremendous runner so
those<00:01:26.289> two<00:01:26.529> two<00:01:26.859> guys<00:01:27.069> they<00:01:27.399> work<00:01:27.609> well

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
those two two guys they work well

those two two guys they work well
together<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:28.539> I<00:01:28.630> think<00:01:28.899> they<00:01:28.990> have<00:01:29.139> a<00:01:29.170> good

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
together and I think they have a good

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.789 
together and I think they have a good
year<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:31.479> those<00:01:31.749> two<00:01:32.020> both<00:01:32.289> being<00:01:32.590> very

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
year with those two both being very

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.649 
year with those two both being very
experienced<00:01:33.429> this<00:01:33.549> past<00:01:33.849> year<00:01:34.179> what

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
experienced this past year what

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.849 
experienced this past year what
strengths<00:01:35.049> do<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.200> think<00:01:35.499> that<00:01:35.590> they<00:01:35.709> both

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
strengths do you think that they both

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.559 
strengths do you think that they both

think<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.029> biggest<00:01:40.209> thing<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.599> both<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:41.139> them

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
think the biggest thing is both of them

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.449 
think the biggest thing is both of them
are<00:01:41.380> very<00:01:41.649> very<00:01:41.889> competitive

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
are very very competitive

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:43.999 
are very very competitive
I<00:01:42.520> mean<00:01:42.700> they<00:01:42.880> they<00:01:42.909> cheer<00:01:43.329> for<00:01:43.359> each<00:01:43.599> other

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I mean they they cheer for each other

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.120 
I mean they they cheer for each other
they<00:01:45.569> feed<00:01:46.569> off<00:01:46.599> each<00:01:46.810> other<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.889> think<00:01:47.919> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
they feed off each other and I think the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.800 
they feed off each other and I think the
biggest<00:01:48.310> thing<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:48.609> will<00:01:48.939> separate<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.599> two

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
biggest thing that will separate the two

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.469 
biggest thing that will separate the two
is<00:01:50.139> its<00:01:50.770> consistency<00:01:51.549> you<00:01:51.969> know<00:01:52.090> being<00:01:52.389> able

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
is its consistency you know being able

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.199 
is its consistency you know being able
to<00:01:52.630> come<00:01:52.840> out<00:01:52.869> here<00:01:53.049> day<00:01:53.439> in<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.829> day<00:01:53.859> out<00:01:54.209> and

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
to come out here day in and day out and

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.839 
to come out here day in and day out and
put<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.599> a<00:01:55.689> good<00:01:55.840> day's<00:01:56.079> work<00:01:56.369> will<00:01:57.369> always

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
put in a good day's work will always

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:59.519 
put in a good day's work will always
tell<00:01:58.029> Beck's<00:01:58.329> but<00:01:58.599> bringing<00:01:58.959> lunch-pail

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.529 
tell Beck's but bringing lunch-pail

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:01.469 
tell Beck's but bringing lunch-pail
every<00:02:00.009> week<00:02:00.249> and<00:02:00.520> every<00:02:00.909> day<00:02:01.090> when<00:02:01.389> you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
every week and every day when you

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.059 
every week and every day when you
practice<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:01.929> you'll<00:02:02.049> get<00:02:02.169> better<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.739> I

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
practice and you'll get better and I

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.229 
practice and you'll get better and I
think<00:02:03.130> that's<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.669> thing<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:03.939> will

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
think that's the thing that will

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.499 
think that's the thing that will
eventually<00:02:04.929> separate<00:02:05.770> either<00:02:06.459> one<00:02:06.819> from<00:02:07.149> each

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
eventually separate either one from each

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.510 
eventually separate either one from each
other<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:07.989> terms<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.349> playing<00:02:08.590> time<00:02:08.800> with

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
other in terms of playing time with

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.859 
other in terms of playing time with
Christian<00:02:09.880> putting<00:02:10.149> up<00:02:10.239> such<00:02:10.450> high<00:02:10.660> numbers

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
Christian putting up such high numbers

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.020 
Christian putting up such high numbers
last<00:02:11.290> year<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.800> true<00:02:11.950> freshman<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.880> add

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
last year as a true freshman is that add

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.570 
last year as a true freshman is that add
extra<00:02:13.600> pressure<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.950> him<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.280> come

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
extra pressure to you for him to come

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.750 
extra pressure to you for him to come
out

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
next year and do the same thing if not

next year and do the same thing if not
even<00:02:17.379> more<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.980> apply<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.939> all<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.209> rest

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
even more and apply that to all the rest

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.569 
even more and apply that to all the rest
of<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.689> running<00:02:19.900> backs<00:02:19.930> as<00:02:20.170> well<00:02:20.319> no<00:02:20.620> no<00:02:20.890> no

there's<00:02:21.970> no<00:02:22.030> pressure<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.510> me<00:02:22.629> I<00:02:22.829> train<00:02:23.829> them

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
there's no pressure on me I train them

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.100 
there's no pressure on me I train them
as<00:02:24.129> hard<00:02:24.730> as<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:24.970> can<00:02:25.030> throughout<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.659> week<00:02:25.870> and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
as hard as I can throughout the week and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.899 
as hard as I can throughout the week and
I<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.739> say<00:02:26.860> hey<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.189> is<00:02:27.370> when<00:02:27.549> you<00:02:27.640> come<00:02:27.790> out

I just say hey this is when you come out
here<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.090> Saturdays<00:02:28.659> this<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.709> like<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> concert

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
here on Saturdays this is like a concert

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.830 
here on Saturdays this is like a concert
this<00:02:30.579> is<00:02:30.760> your<00:02:30.939> day<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> don't<00:02:31.329> coach<00:02:31.629> on

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840

Saturdays<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.530> they<00:02:33.340> know<00:02:33.519> that<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.329> think

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
Saturdays and they know that and I think

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.270 
Saturdays and they know that and I think
the<00:02:34.659> biggest<00:02:34.840> thing<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.319> for<00:02:35.860> both<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.190> those

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the biggest thing is for both of those

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940 
the biggest thing is for both of those
guys<00:02:36.519> it's<00:02:37.329> Christian<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.019> spoke<00:02:38.290> up<00:02:38.560> he
