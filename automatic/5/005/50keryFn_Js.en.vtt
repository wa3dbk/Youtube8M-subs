to show you it today many have probably
seen<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.360> already<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.079> plot<00:00:52.309> but<00:00:53.309> yeah

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
seen it already in this plot but yeah

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
seen it already in this plot but yeah
it's<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> red<00:00:54.750> stoner<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> anyways<00:00:56.910> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it's on the red stoner so anyways this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.330 
it's on the red stoner so anyways this
tree<00:00:57.480> farm<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.800> plant<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.579> forget<00:01:00.030> reform

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
tree farm is a plant and forget reform

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
tree farm is a plant and forget reform
you<00:01:02.340> need<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> loaded<00:01:03.000> i<00:01:03.300> guess<00:01:03.660> because

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you need it loaded i guess because

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.539 
you need it loaded i guess because
otherwise<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> won't<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.100> grow<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
otherwise the it won't really grow and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.570 
otherwise the it won't really grow and
activate<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> system<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:07.409> anyways<00:01:07.740> there's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
activate the system but anyways there's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.560 
activate the system but anyways there's
a<00:01:08.640> huge<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> gate<00:01:09.860> controlling<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.570> torch

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
a huge and gate controlling this torch

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
a huge and gate controlling this torch
in<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.869> piston<00:01:13.260> controlling<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> entire

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
in this piston controlling the entire

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.780 
in this piston controlling the entire
thing<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.780> trees<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.200> grown<00:01:16.790> it's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
thing and when all trees have grown it's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.660 
thing and when all trees have grown it's
going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> activate<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.460> sound<00:01:20.460> system

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
going to activate and the sound system

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.600 
going to activate and the sound system
pushing<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.509> trees<00:01:21.720> into<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
pushing down the trees into this

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.270 
pushing down the trees into this
gigantic<00:01:23.610> wood<00:01:24.360> storage<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> i'm<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
gigantic wood storage so i'm going to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.530 
gigantic wood storage so i'm going to
show<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> clip<00:01:26.820> how<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> looks<00:01:27.360> from<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
show you a clip how it looks from the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:46.760 
show you a clip how it looks from the
side

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.260 

some<00:01:47.770> things<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.220> didn't<00:01:48.700> mention<00:01:48.909> is<00:01:49.240> that

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
some things I didn't mention is that

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.190 
some things I didn't mention is that
there's<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.439> floor<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.549> hoppers<00:01:52.000> they<00:01:52.810> collect

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
there's a floor of hoppers they collect

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.420 
there's a floor of hoppers they collect
the<00:01:54.100> saplings<00:01:54.610> 180k<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:56.680> here<00:01:56.979> here<00:01:57.189> and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
the saplings 180k here here here and

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.679 
the saplings 180k here here here and
here<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:59.350> flow<00:01:59.619> into<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.899> central<00:02:01.899> chest<00:02:02.350> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
here they flow into a central chest and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.889 
here they flow into a central chest and
yeah<00:02:04.689> that<00:02:05.140> makes<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.649> so<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:05.950> don't<00:02:06.689> lose<00:02:07.689> any

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
yeah that makes it so you don't lose any

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.680 
yeah that makes it so you don't lose any
saplings<00:02:08.380> while<00:02:08.860> using<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.459> farm<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:09.970> haven't

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
saplings while using this farm I haven't

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.870 
saplings while using this farm I haven't
really<00:02:10.810> checked<00:02:11.110> if<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:11.739> goes<00:02:12.130> plus<00:02:12.640> or

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
really checked if this goes plus or

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.479 
really checked if this goes plus or
minus<00:02:13.269> in<00:02:13.510> saplings<00:02:14.170> because<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:15.280> server

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
minus in saplings because this server

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.800 
minus in saplings because this server
doesn't<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:16.780> item<00:02:17.590> drop<00:02:17.769> all<00:02:18.569> anyways<00:02:19.569> and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
doesn't have item drop all anyways and

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.900 
doesn't have item drop all anyways and
that's<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.799> and<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:22.330> logs<00:02:23.250> gets<00:02:24.250> pushed<00:02:24.760> up

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
that's that and the logs gets pushed up

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.780 
that's that and the logs gets pushed up
along<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.330> thing<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.980> they<00:02:26.980> don't<00:02:27.580> always

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
along this thing and they don't always

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.199 
along this thing and they don't always
look<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.540> perfect<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.560> that's<00:02:30.519> why<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.910> have

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
look this perfect so that's why I have

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.320 
look this perfect so that's why I have
an<00:02:31.360> entire<00:02:31.660> row<00:02:32.049> of<00:02:32.080> buds<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.830> here<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.940> any<00:02:34.209> one

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
an entire row of buds up here if any one

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.830 
an entire row of buds up here if any one
of<00:02:34.480> these<00:02:34.720> activate<00:02:35.260> all<00:02:35.560> activate

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
of these activate all activate

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.220 
of these activate all activate
activating<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.959> control<00:02:38.350> bud<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:40.230> this

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
activating the control bud and this

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.680 
activating the control bud and this
little<00:02:41.410> control<00:02:41.830> circuit<00:02:42.450> pushing<00:02:43.450> down<00:02:43.569> the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
little control circuit pushing down the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.190 
little control circuit pushing down the
redstone<00:02:44.049> blocks<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:45.430> they<00:02:45.750> power<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
redstone blocks and they power the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.550 
redstone blocks and they power the
Pistons<00:02:47.980> pushing<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.430> side<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.660> then<00:02:50.440> it

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
Pistons pushing to the side and then it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.979 
Pistons pushing to the side and then it
pushes<00:02:50.739> up<00:02:51.010> again<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.400> thing<00:02:51.609> here<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.989> think

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
pushes up again this thing here I think

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.710 
pushes up again this thing here I think
there's<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.820> yeah<00:02:54.820> there's<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.150> piston<00:02:55.480> here<00:02:55.600> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
there's a yeah there's a piston here and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.849 
there's a yeah there's a piston here and
it<00:02:55.810> updates<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:57.359> and<00:02:58.560> yeah<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.739> pretty

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
it updates it and yeah it's pretty

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.130 
it updates it and yeah it's pretty
simple<00:03:00.100> let's<00:03:00.670> see<00:03:00.820> if<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.000> works<00:03:01.030> still<00:03:01.660> it's

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
simple let's see if it works still it's

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.370 
simple let's see if it works still it's
a<00:03:02.170> long<00:03:02.200> time<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.560> go<00:03:02.739> tested<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:04.200> yep<00:03:05.970> works<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
a long time I go tested it yep works and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.229 
a long time I go tested it yep works and
yeah<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.500> control<00:03:11.799> circuit<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.250> quite

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
yeah so the control circuit is quite

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.170 
yeah so the control circuit is quite
easy<00:03:13.269> it's<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.989> UH<00:03:14.290> proper<00:03:14.980> timer<00:03:15.910> that

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
easy it's a UH proper timer that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.550 
easy it's a UH proper timer that
controls<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.579> two<00:03:18.579> clocks<00:03:19.799> one<00:03:20.799> is

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
controls and two clocks one is

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.729 
controls and two clocks one is
here<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.819> clock<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.540> other<00:03:25.110> one

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.380 

here<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.520> all<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.730> clock<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.090> makes

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
here this is all the clock that makes

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.900 
here this is all the clock that makes
the<00:03:30.599> other<00:03:30.810> part<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.440> push<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.520> hand<00:03:32.700> back

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
the other part and push this hand back

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.220 
the other part and push this hand back
into<00:03:33.540> place<00:03:34.250> it's<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.910> some<00:03:36.030> repeaters<00:03:36.450> if

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
into place it's just some repeaters if

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.720 
into place it's just some repeaters if
you<00:03:37.410> want<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.620> check<00:03:37.770> this<00:03:37.950> out<00:03:38.160> it's<00:03:38.550> on<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
you want to check this out it's on the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.360 
you want to check this out it's on the
red<00:03:39.000> standard<00:03:39.420> comm<00:03:39.780> serv<00:03:40.110> err<00:03:41.209> yeah<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:43.370> won't

red standard comm serv err yeah I won't

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.830 
red standard comm serv err yeah I won't
be<00:03:44.580> making<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.910> tutorial<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.630> pretty<00:03:45.900> big<00:03:46.080> but

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
be making a tutorial it's pretty big but

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.780 
be making a tutorial it's pretty big but
i'm<00:03:48.840> going<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.110> show<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.620> side<00:03:50.420> once<00:03:51.420> more

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
i'm going to show you the side once more

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.960 
i'm going to show you the side once more
these<00:03:53.790> are<00:03:54.170> normal<00:03:55.170> distance<00:03:57.140> sticky<00:03:58.140> and

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
these are normal distance sticky and

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.600 
these are normal distance sticky and
normal<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.569> up<00:04:01.440> sit<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.739> here<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.040> here<00:04:02.400> to

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
normal and up sit in here and here to

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.710 
normal and up sit in here and here to
avoid<00:04:03.530> server<00:04:04.530> lag<00:04:04.769> failures<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.400> here<00:04:06.380> and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
avoid server lag failures and here and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.620 
avoid server lag failures and here and
yeah<00:04:09.720> i<00:04:09.989> guess<00:04:10.920> that's<00:04:11.250> most<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.060> here's

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
yeah i guess that's most of it here's

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.759 
yeah i guess that's most of it here's
well<00:04:12.870> see<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:14.390> otherwise<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.870> logs<00:04:16.440> are<00:04:16.590> going

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
well see it otherwise the logs are going

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.879 
well see it otherwise the logs are going
