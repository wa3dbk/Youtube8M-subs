00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:14.340
 This time, let's take a look at the name of the calligrapher. 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm losing strokes methods, depending on the tempo during the go-go rhythm is divided into three 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.470
 Now I'm dealing with Bogorodo rhythm , and so on. 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:28.560
 It is a 9-beat 8-bit rhythm that is primarily slow in tempo 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 I 'll try to put faith in the accent by Dr. 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 u2 and downstroke 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.410
 I 'll try playing it. I 'll try it slowly. 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.040
 Down coming down to explore Taupo Downtown 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.540
 Let's try playing with c code this time. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.630
 Au down wa 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.750
 Oo 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.590
 Let's play it a bit faster . 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.590
 Next down 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:07.360
 Let's play with the ca -d- g7 code as a circular code 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.360
 I'll try it slowly. 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.310
 U 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.080
 U 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.740
 Oh yes 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.500
 Ah 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.190
 Ah 222 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.180
 Oh, oh. 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.180
 Ah 222 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.180
 Yeah When's coming soon hageteupnida 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 5 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.439
 222 222 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 give 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 Examples include relatively simple code that is often repeated 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.800
 Bob Dylan's Na King On Heaven's Door and Kim Kwang Suk's so sick love is love 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:05.140
 Let's take a look at the code progress. 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:08.350
 The code in Locking Leon's code is to a 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.110
 2 - 2 p 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.140
 I repeat it with the code. 4 Let's play the pattern. 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.140
 Ah 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.630
 U 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.310
 be 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.069
 U 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.069
 222 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 U 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.819
 222 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.819
 U 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.319
 This time, Kim Sang-suk's sick love was not love 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.319
 Batch coding 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.510
 I'm forehead been subject to the code of the World 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.510
 Let's play a pattern of four bars. 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.420
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.850
 Ah lead 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.660
 top 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.880
 Ah 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.880
 Thank you. 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.340
 U 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340
