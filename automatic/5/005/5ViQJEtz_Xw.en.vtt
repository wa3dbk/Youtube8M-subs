00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
to talk about is my heating germinating

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.070 
to talk about is my heating germinating
mats<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.580> these<00:02:28.970> are<00:02:29.180> made<00:02:29.390> out<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.870> rubber

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
mats and these are made out of a rubber

and with wire coils in it okay you see I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.640 
and with wire coils in it okay you see I
got<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> few<00:02:35.210> flats<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.660> there<00:02:35.840> right<00:02:35.990> now<00:02:36.050> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
got a few flats on there right now and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.120 
got a few flats on there right now and
it's<00:02:36.980> run<00:02:37.430> by<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:37.640> thermostatic<00:02:38.800> controlled<00:02:39.800> I

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
it's run by a thermostatic controlled I

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.059 
it's run by a thermostatic controlled I
have<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.760> at<00:02:40.850> 70<00:02:41.300> which<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> good

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
have it at 70 which is a good

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.970 
have it at 70 which is a good
germinating<00:02:43.069> temp<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.550> have<00:02:44.680> three<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.800> these

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
germinating temp I have three of these

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.240 
germinating temp I have three of these
which<00:02:46.430> will<00:02:46.640> hold<00:02:48.250> 15<00:02:49.250> total<00:02:50.120> 10<00:02:50.930> by<00:02:51.080> 20<00:02:51.440> flats

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
which will hold 15 total 10 by 20 flats

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
and I have it right at 70 72 somewhere

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.790 
and I have it right at 70 72 somewhere
in<00:03:18.489> there<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:19.239> seems<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.629> will<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:19.900> an<00:03:20.230> ideal

temp<00:03:21.099> work<00:03:21.610> great<00:03:21.940> for<00:03:22.090> germination<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.590> I

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
temp work great for germination but I

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.550 
temp work great for germination but I
haven't<00:03:23.890> plugged<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.629> you<00:03:26.530> know

weren't using it anymore but it works
great<00:03:35.920> for<00:03:35.950> germinating<00:03:36.879> you<00:03:37.720> know<00:03:37.840> laying

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
great for germinating you know laying

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.830 
great for germinating you know laying
out<00:03:38.260> my<00:03:38.410> flats<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.950> germinating<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:40.569> is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
out my flats and germinating so that is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.910 
out my flats and germinating so that is
where<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.730> seed<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.500> know<00:03:44.500> start

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.470 
where all the seed you know start
germinating<00:03:45.519> where<00:03:45.700> they<00:03:45.880> start<00:03:46.180> their<00:03:46.329> life

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
germinating where they start their life

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.920 
germinating where they start their life
right<00:03:46.900> there<00:03:47.170> on<00:03:47.380> them<00:03:47.560> heating<00:03:47.920> mats<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.930> also

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
right there on them heating mats I also

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.960 
right there on them heating mats I also

started<00:03:52.599> growing<00:03:53.049> my<00:03:53.319> own<00:03:53.349> stuff<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:53.980> this

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
started growing my own stuff and this

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.710 
started growing my own stuff and this
wasn't<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.760> greenhouse<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.329> was<00:03:55.480> just

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
wasn't for the greenhouse this was just

personal<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.470> used<00:03:57.099> to<00:03:57.220> use<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.400> warm<00:03:57.790> room<00:03:58.090> top

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.199 
personal I used to use a warm room top
of<00:03:58.690> fridge<00:03:59.049> or<00:03:59.410> someplace<00:04:00.370> really<00:04:00.790> warm<00:04:01.090> to

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
of fridge or someplace really warm to

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.420 
of fridge or someplace really warm to
germinate<00:04:01.660> my<00:04:01.840> seeds<00:04:02.140> but<00:04:02.349> I<00:04:02.410> found<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:03.400> know

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
germinate my seeds but I found you know

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.390 
germinate my seeds but I found you know
germination<00:04:04.120> wasn't<00:04:04.660> all<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:04.930> great<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:06.370> I

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
germination wasn't all that great so I

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.640 
germination wasn't all that great so I
purchased<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.180> know<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.329> started<00:04:07.750> purchasing

purchased you know I started purchasing
these<00:04:08.950> heat<00:04:09.400> mats<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.079> germination<00:04:11.079> is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
these heat mats and the germination is

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.349 
these heat mats and the germination is
so<00:04:11.980> much<00:04:12.190> better<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.639> it<00:04:12.940> was<00:04:13.120> worth<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
so much better that it was worth the

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.220 
so much better that it was worth the
investment

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
investment

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.020

poor germination inside invest in in the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.100 
poor germination inside invest in in the
heating<00:04:21.400> mat<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:22.150> know<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:22.840> can<00:04:23.020> afford

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
know this shelving several years ago we

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.180 
know this shelving several years ago we
put<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.139> together<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:45.960> now<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.410> know<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:47.770> this

put it together and now you know it this

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.029 
put it together and now you know it this
particular<00:04:49.150> we<00:04:49.539> did<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.840> in<00:04:49.960> sections<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.770> mean

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
particular we did it in sections I mean

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.379 
particular we did it in sections I mean
this<00:04:51.280> was<00:04:51.490> something<00:04:51.700> we<00:04:51.820> just<00:04:51.940> kind<00:04:52.180> of<00:04:52.210> put

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
this was something we just kind of put

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.870 
this was something we just kind of put
together<00:04:52.539> we<00:04:52.930> didn't<00:04:53.200> see<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:53.590> done<00:04:54.370> anywhere

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
together we didn't see it done anywhere

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.219 
together we didn't see it done anywhere
but<00:04:55.180> we<00:04:55.300> thought<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.630> would<00:04:55.810> probably<00:04:56.020> work

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
but we thought this would probably work

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.029 
but we thought this would probably work
