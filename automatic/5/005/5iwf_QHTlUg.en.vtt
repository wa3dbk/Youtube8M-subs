like she's wearing too much eye shadow

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.780 
like she's wearing too much eye shadow
so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> stuck<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> beige<00:00:40.800> eyeshadow<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
so I stuck with a beige eyeshadow or a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
so I stuck with a beige eyeshadow or a
natural<00:00:42.180> color<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.719> i'm<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.350> applying<00:00:43.530> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
natural color and i'm just applying it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.500 
natural color and i'm just applying it
like<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.760> i'm<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
like this and then i'm going in with a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.840 
like this and then i'm going in with a
little<00:00:45.750> bit<00:00:45.930> darker<00:00:46.469> tone<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.309> my<00:00:47.460> crease<00:00:47.760> just

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
little bit darker tone to my crease just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
little bit darker tone to my crease just
that<00:00:48.270> way<00:00:48.420> has<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.960> bit<00:00:49.079> deeper<00:00:49.320> depth

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that way has a little bit deeper depth

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920 
that way has a little bit deeper depth
inside<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.360> doesn't<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.719> look

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
inside so really it doesn't really look

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
inside so really it doesn't really look
like<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.230> wearing<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.800> eyeshadow<00:00:53.010> oh<00:00:53.610> I'm
