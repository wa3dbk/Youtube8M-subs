00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 very good guys here we are in others 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.950
 dgt languages with line and we are here 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.259
 flying over the city of the jumps 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.940
 but already open to be perfect 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.469
 we control, we control like guys 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.210
 as I say we are here in a new trick 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.440
 in which I will teach you how to 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.510
 be able to float so to speak in gt1 almost 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.859
 I fall uncle, well, as I say, I'm going to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.539
 teach a pretty pretty trick 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 funny in which it is about 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.769
 basically how to float in gt5 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 is effectively floating with your character 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.890
 as if I was flying and well then 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.779
 obviously you will not be able to go there 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.219
 flying around the map but with this 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.420
 trick yes you can leave the odd 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.879
 friend look at the plane with the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.570
 plane that has come flying here 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.379
 he stayed 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.700
 models is that you start recording in 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.239
 direct and things like this happen to you and 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.980
 my mother parts 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.980
 freeze good guys like I said let's 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.510
 leave that aside and I find it 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.199
 funny having to record the video with a 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.010
 airplane 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.480
 floating in the air as I say myself well 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.460
 he pointed pretty funny to float in 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.340
 gt5 like this I can not stop looking at the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.530
 plane and as I say let's float 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.899
 that we have to come and come to a 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.690
 pretty tall building which we can 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.340
 stick to a wall look like 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.160
 example I teach you this not that we 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.810
 stick a wall and we can fall 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.310
 of the building between quotes stuck to 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.270
 a wall is worth then for good 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.130
 we have to do so very easy 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.810
 selection we select any weapon 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.979
 for example I select this gun and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.300
 then then once selected 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.860
 we have to walk little by little 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.869
 is still yesterday a bio battery is me 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.310
 staring good because he heard 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.229
 we have to do if very little and when 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.880
 let's have a foot out it's worth a little bit 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.170
 of the foot out or medium that was or medium 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.729
 body out or hand out like 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.470
 You want to say it a little 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.300
 our character a little bit outside of 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.620
 building because the only thing that we have to 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.480
 to do is to point vale 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.140
 we aim and turn around a little 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.950
 to fall down, you'll see what 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.560
 Mysterious mind like take of now 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.290
 we are going down from the building 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.730
 but without falling we are floating like 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.830
 you are left right now the truth is 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.410
 pretty pretty amazing and good 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.910
 I recommend that you do not shoot as it 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.080
 shoot and obviously we're going to have to 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.940
 recharge so that it shoots so the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.140
 asthma runs out of soul or stern because 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.030
 I always explain things so 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 extremely coherent that knows all the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.120
 world of 12 world because if you shoot 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.800
 obviously he's going to have to recharge 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.440
 without recharging it is for this trick and it 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.320
 It does not work if you want to mouth and as 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 you see as I am pointing here not 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.780
 you can stop pointing in no 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.090
 moment since if you are not and then 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.380
 we stayed here floating 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.640
 there is a person down there because we do not 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.690
 You will see searched searched above 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.580
 building but does not wait too 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.320
 floating and good as you see we are 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.960
 going down very little by little and then 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.790
 sincerely, he has never come down 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.740
 the ground I do not know if it can be lowered so 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.450
 let's put this fast shaved camera 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.010
 in attentive shaved fast is not shaved 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.480
 let's put this quick camera to see 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.890
 what happens if we get to go all the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.340
 time until you get to ground so 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.340
 see you 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.020
 to me 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.510
 Y 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.510
 do not 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.209
 good guys, as you have seen 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.650
 We can be here all the time 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.180
 we want to aim of course since 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.170
 if we let you aim then we fall and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.459
 well then when we get to the ground 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.290
 obviously then we can walk 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.220
 so we're not going to stop pointing for 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.560
 that you see what happened we are going to 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.660
 recharge better because it is the most original 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.019
 and let's see look recharge and then 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.019
 do not 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.269
 Hello, it's good that I die when I 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.459
 fall to the ground but I will die before 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.720
 by Carlos LobatÃ³n or I do not know what the hell he has 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.049
 happened but well I killed myself with a 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.239
 wall 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.260
 let's call it the killer wall and good 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.730
 guys, basically, this has been 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.870
 all the project of this video you can 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.640
 tell him lymphocytes and he liked 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.769
 subscribe to the channel if it is not and we 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.769
 we see in the next goodbye 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.329
 one year 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.329
 Y
