00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.720
 Well now we are with this 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.879
 small device the tri of green are 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.559
 and the truth since we took it out in click 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.630
 I really wanted to try it and 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.519
 as soon as I saw it I said let's go to 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.809
 try it because the truth is very 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.639
 interesting the design does everything 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.900
 futuristic and then now that I had the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.760
 opportunity to prove it let me tell you 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.250
 that if it looks very good we say a 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.410
 150 inch screen inside this 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.610
 viewer at a distance of 12 feet already 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.110
 we had seen that those are the 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.610
 problems with the 3-d viewers that 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.890
 really if it looks like you 're watching the 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.020
 remote television as opposed to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.269
 an immersive environment that you want 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.550
 achieve in other types of viewers true 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.670
 but it does look very good the definition is 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.890
 incredible and how can we see it here 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.969
 it gets in a good way first right now 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.039
 he will not put me because he is half 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.440
 complicated but you put it like this 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.420
 you reload your forehead in this part of here 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.089
 and once it's recharged what 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.800
 you do is adjust like this in this way with 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.350
 these little buttons up here what 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.359
 you re-open if you is not is 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.519
 to adjust it depending if you're very 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.870
 stubborn or not so stubborn I now like 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.790
 we see in the part of down here are the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.009
 controls this is very important and we have 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.509
 seen this on all 3d devices 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.399
 because obviously everyone's eyes 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.830
 they are very different this allows you 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.390
 adjust the lenses to which they are 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.610
 some distance in case when you 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.380
 You can not focus well on the image 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.509
 that is inside with this you can move it 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.220
 from left to right and put it right to 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.750
 Make your eyes feel comfortable and at ease 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.039
 and as you can not imagine that you're 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.159
 watching a screen of 100 50 inches 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.750
 you're going to want to make sure that 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.490
 you can see it well without any problem 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.380
 here for example we have the browser 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.670
 from the menu this is very interesting too 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.740
 everything you can control directly 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.330
 from the helmet this connects 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.819
 directly to your team in such a way 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.100
 in which you should not do not need to disconnect 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.050
 your television to access this 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.149
 device so you can leave it 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.580
 connected to the TV your bluray player and 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.259
 apart connect your viewer in 3d the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.119
 design as I told you is very very 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.880
 interesting but let me tell you a 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.880
 thing that caught my attention 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.530
 I have astigmatism and it cost me a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.409
 little bit of work to be able to adjust my 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.210
 lens 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.249
 so look for all those who 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.499
 have some vision problem can 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.330
 that does not look like you want but 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.250
 as good as it depends on each person's 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.230
 team is not heavy at all 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.390
 light and feels very solid though 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 Of course, if you have a face that you have to take care of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.530
 because if you can not break it but good 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 I really want to stay watching a 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.280
 movie here in 3d and try here together 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.900
 because they are playing playstation in this 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.430
 thing that is done here is very very 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 fun and we continue with the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.900
 course here since 6 2003
