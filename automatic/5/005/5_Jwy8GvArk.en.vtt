00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
Godzilla so really quirky really out

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
Godzilla so really quirky really out
there<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.100> why<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.520> TJ<00:01:29.759> Miller

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
there and I that's why I think TJ Miller

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
there and I that's why I think TJ Miller
is<00:01:30.060> gonna<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.270> perfect<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.960> role

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
is gonna be perfect for this role

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
is gonna be perfect for this role
because<00:01:31.409> he's<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> comedian<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.100> he's<00:01:32.490> just

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
because he's a comedian so he's just

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.039 
because he's a comedian so he's just
really<00:01:33.060> gonna<00:01:33.270> bring<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> character<00:01:33.930> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
really gonna bring this character to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
really gonna bring this character to
life<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> will<00:01:34.920> probably<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> great<00:01:35.759> foil

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
life and will probably be a great foil

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.460 
life and will probably be a great foil
