00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.410
 hi chicks and chicks I have been 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.520
 commenting a lot on my networks 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.160
 on the new trend of the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.080
 misplacement and the sixth I saw that is our 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 billy 4 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.410
 then I gave myself to the task of government and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 I just found out that it's a new 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 technique a new style a new way 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.430
 of doing makeup then we were 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.500
 all with the outline and it really is not 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.140
 that has gone out of style but this 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 kind of effect is not for this summer 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 but that's that kind of effect the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.309
 outline is a religion will continue 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.510
 and it's practically indispensable for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.879
 be able to make good contrast effects 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.299
 then the effect of this bing wants 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.570
 to say enlightened means only 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.360
 with illuminator for example this is my 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 I usually use the basic pallet for 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.610
 outline me and the flush these are the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 matte finish 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.800
 except one vanilla and the white tone 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.800
 pure title applies 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.520
 but estro bing is geared to 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.900
 illuminators golden environment in tone 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.550
 silvery in satin with its shades but 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.820
 at the end you have to leave a flash 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.100
 example I have this illuminator requisitioned 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.680
 in golden tone 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.120
 and this decade is an America itself 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.880
 and that the lighting is silver with a 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.870
 sub tone in pink you can do it in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.650
 matte tones or you can do it in tones a 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.560
 shine there something brushes there 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.470
 we can use it can be the typical 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.560
 fan when you apply products 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.490
 Shiny there is also one more option 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.680
 tiny since this part of here is 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.150
 part of each so that it does not cover is 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.140
 a lot and you can blur or extend it 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.350
 a little bit this is very tiny it can be 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.350
 for example for the arch of the eyebrow here 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.230
 the bridge of the nose this part of here 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.390
 of these areas of the face in case 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.850
 do not have these fan 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.780
 then help you with your brushes 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.940
 normal 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.160
 this is one to blur this 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.300
 you can occupy to eliminate this area 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.900
 these are one that area 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.720
 here you could even red with this 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.560
 although it is something small you can occupy a 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.250
 of these or one that has more redondito and 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.980
 occupy the diagonal 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.610
 in this diagonal way so you can 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.640
 distribute the glitters and blend in 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.740
 case that is necessary for example I 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.890
 in this case 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:28.600
 I'm going to occupy this blush, we're going to 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:31.750
 apply in this case let's occupy the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.130
 vanilla tone since white to me 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.130
 It makes me very artificial 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.069
 but we can also occupy this kind of 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.500
 Brush 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:51.440
 how 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.440
 what it does is give precision 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:06.120
 and you can extend it down a little 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:10.110
 you can maintain the illumination of this 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:15.120
 part and go down because that's the effect 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:19.019
 that the face lights up as an effect 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.889
 of angel and here very little very 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.889
 blurred 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.680
 the nose 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.720
 you can see without contours and that 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.720
 depth 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.159
 so hey hey the fashion thing what 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.259
 it accommodates you if you consider that lastro bean 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.800
 it's too bright for your kind of 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.560
 skin 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.259
 Well, lower the level and put 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.400
 only lighting in mate try it 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:00.520
 so that you do not see 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.830
 and see how you like how it looks is for 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.210
 this little summer happened to the strobe and I 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.789
 I think going back to fall to winter 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.000
 I go back to the contour or go there we go 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.789
 campechanÃ­a is not that the two techniques 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.910
 they are incredible and the two techniques will be 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.830
 two completely different looks what 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.710
 what is it and chicken in the I recommend it is 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.430
 that you do not fall into the temptation that the 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.370
 trend as our wine and base says 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.180
 this and my base that serves for this came 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.060
 strobino illuminator 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.500
 the bean is to occupy illuminators 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.889
 be mate 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.690
 Yeimer bright shadows pigments 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:47.370
 ultra-powerful the thing is to illuminate 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:50.070
 shine or illuminate the matte finish like this 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.830
 you already know chicks you liked dale 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.830
 little hands up, tell me what down 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.009
 he seemed to subscribe to the channel so 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:07:23.449
 you see new videos every week so 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:07:23.449
 there are two issues then
