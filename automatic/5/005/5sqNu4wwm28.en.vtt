of<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.230> center<00:01:15.470> section<00:01:15.620> which<00:01:15.920> we'll<00:01:16.040> cover

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
of the center section which we'll cover

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.910 
of the center section which we'll cover
shortly<00:01:16.550> we<00:01:17.330> have<00:01:17.510> our<00:01:17.660> trim<00:01:18.140> high<00:01:18.530> low<00:01:18.710> mid

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
shortly we have our trim high low mid

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.490 
shortly we have our trim high low mid
gains<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.550> meters<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.990> they<00:01:21.110> will<00:01:21.229> have<00:01:21.350> that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
gains and meters and they will have that

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.430 
gains and meters and they will have that
typical<00:01:21.740> pioneer<00:01:22.280> quality<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.760> them<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:26.440> then

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
typical pioneer quality to them and then

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.050 
typical pioneer quality to them and then
you<00:01:27.619> have<00:01:27.770> built<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.130> knobs<00:01:28.310> per<00:01:28.580> channel<00:01:28.850> for

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
you have built a knobs per channel for

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.460 
you have built a knobs per channel for
the<00:01:29.150> insta<00:01:29.390> effects<00:01:29.720> section<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:30.229> you<00:01:30.320> can

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
the insta effects section so you can

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.670 
the insta effects section so you can
control<00:01:30.890> how<00:01:31.070> each<00:01:31.190> effect<00:01:31.550> sounds<00:01:32.680> faders

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
control how each effect sounds faders

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.170 
control how each effect sounds faders
are<00:01:33.800> once<00:01:33.920> again<00:01:34.010> replaceable<00:01:34.729> not<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.090> you

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
are once again replaceable not that you

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.660 
are once again replaceable not that you
ever<00:01:35.330> need<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.750> think<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.890> superb<00:01:37.430> build

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670

our<00:02:26.980> source<00:02:27.310> which<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.700> start<00:02:28.000> by<00:02:28.210> selecting

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
our source which you start by selecting

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.900 
our source which you start by selecting
and<00:02:29.320> then<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.620> select<00:02:29.800> an<00:02:30.160> effective

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
and then you select an effective

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.840 
and then you select an effective
anything<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:32.380> can<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:32.680> set<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.040> BPM<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
anything you can then set the BPM and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.880 
anything you can then set the BPM and
cue<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.270> effect<00:02:34.570> when<00:02:34.840> you're<00:02:34.960> ready<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.410> you

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
cue the effect when you're ready and you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.890 
cue the effect when you're ready and you
can<00:02:36.010> set<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.550> beat<00:02:36.910> length<00:02:37.120> or<00:02:37.360> control<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
can set the beat length or control the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.900 
can set the beat length or control the
frequency<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.800> effect<00:02:39.070> as<00:02:39.190> well<00:02:39.370> so

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
frequency of the effect as well so

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.310 
frequency of the effect as well so
there's<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.210> lot<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.450> controls<00:02:40.810> there<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.200> mess

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
there's a lot of controls there to mess

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.570 
there's a lot of controls there to mess
around<00:02:41.440> with<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.160> can<00:02:42.310> create<00:02:42.490> some

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
around with and you can create some

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.940 
around with and you can create some
stunning<00:02:42.970> effects<00:02:43.360> with<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.650> basically

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
stunning effects with it it is basically

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.910 
stunning effects with it it is basically
any<00:02:45.700> effect<00:02:46.090> 1000<00:02:46.900> right<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.650> middle<00:02:47.860> of

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
any effect 1000 right in the middle of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.450 
any effect 1000 right in the middle of
this<00:02:48.010> mixer

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.880 

and<00:02:54.460> then<00:02:54.580> below<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.300> have<00:02:55.570> our<00:02:55.870> 5.9<00:02:56.860> inch

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
and then below this we have our 5.9 inch

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.600 
and then below this we have our 5.9 inch
multi-touch<00:02:57.870> full-color<00:02:58.870> screen<00:02:59.250> to<00:03:00.250> control

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
multi-touch full-color screen to control

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.790 
multi-touch full-color screen to control
different<00:03:00.730> modes<00:03:01.030> such<00:03:01.270> as<00:03:01.330> mix<00:03:02.080> frequency<00:03:02.650> in

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
different modes such as mix frequency in

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.620 
different modes such as mix frequency in
mixed<00:03:03.070> mode<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.580> frequency<00:03:06.790> mix<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.450> like

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
mixed mode so the frequency mix is like

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.570 
mixed mode so the frequency mix is like
having<00:03:07.930> an<00:03:08.050> extra<00:03:08.140> cross<00:03:08.530> fader<00:03:08.800> split<00:03:09.280> into

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
having an extra cross fader split into

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.060 
having an extra cross fader split into
several<00:03:09.910> frequency<00:03:10.540> band<00:03:10.750> as<00:03:11.500> Internet's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
several frequency band as Internet's

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.710 
several frequency band as Internet's
after<00:03:12.340> MIDI<00:03:12.520> control<00:03:12.880> pages<00:03:13.270> giving<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.660> even

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
after MIDI control pages giving you even

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.860 
after MIDI control pages giving you even
more<00:03:13.870> control<00:03:13.989> as<00:03:14.380> well<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.360> touch<00:03:16.540> screen

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
more control as well so the touch screen

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.199 
more control as well so the touch screen
has<00:03:17.350> got<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> nice<00:03:18.160> feel<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.940> doesn't

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
has got a nice feel to it it doesn't

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.620 
has got a nice feel to it it doesn't
feel<00:03:19.330> cheap<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.810> its<00:03:20.320> multi-touch<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.280> well

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.240 
feel cheap and its multi-touch as well
and<00:03:22.630> then<00:03:22.810> there<00:03:22.989> Buffett<00:03:23.320> we<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.709> our<00:03:23.830> BPM
