00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
a good farming spot that I found but the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.510 
a good farming spot that I found but the
only<00:00:15.780> other<00:00:16.020> halfway<00:00:16.320> decent<00:00:16.949> spot<00:00:17.160> there<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
only other halfway decent spot there is

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.210 
only other halfway decent spot there is
to<00:00:17.760> farm<00:00:18.090> elaborate<00:00:19.020> totems<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.650> game<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
to farm elaborate totems in this game is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.509 
to farm elaborate totems in this game is
in<00:00:20.850> quest<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:22.260> underwater<00:00:22.710> area<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
in quest in this underwater area and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.279 
in quest in this underwater area and
malkor<00:00:23.939> sleep<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.480> they<00:00:25.260> kind<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:26.090> suck

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
malkor sleep and they kind of suck

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.720 
malkor sleep and they kind of suck
because<00:00:28.289> they're<00:00:28.650> either<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:28.980> groups<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
because they're either in groups and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.939 
because they're either in groups and
they're<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.380> constantly

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
they're like they see see you constantly

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
they're like they see see you constantly
so<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:33.090> annoying<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> farm<00:00:33.750> there

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
so it's really annoying to farm there

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.209 
so it's really annoying to farm there
unless<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> lot<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.070> people

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
unless you have like a lot of people

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
unless you have like a lot of people
with<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> might<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.690> worth<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.079> but

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
with you then it might be worth it but

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
with you then it might be worth it but
otherwise<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.640> don't

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
otherwise I don't know I just don't

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.959 
otherwise I don't know I just don't
think<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.210> worth<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.440> uh<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.820> this

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
think it's that worth it but uh so this

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.250 
think it's that worth it but uh so this
might<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.149> your<00:00:42.300> best<00:00:42.360> bet<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> form<00:00:43.020> elaborate

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
might be your best bet to form elaborate

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.750 
might be your best bet to form elaborate
