it's<00:00:27.810> kind<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> hinged<00:00:28.890> mechanism

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it's kind of got a hinged mechanism

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's kind of got a hinged mechanism
where<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.330> halves<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
where there are two halves and what that

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.170 
where there are two halves and what that
allows<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.340> almost<00:00:32.669> functions<00:00:33.120> like

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
allows it to do almost functions like

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.670 
allows it to do almost functions like
shock<00:00:33.570> absorbers<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:34.050> our<00:00:34.170> car<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
shock absorbers in our car so when it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.770 
shock absorbers in our car so when it
hits<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> bump<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> bottom<00:00:36.450> half

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
hits a bump you know the bottom half

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.690 
hits a bump you know the bottom half
just<00:00:37.020> kind<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.260> pops<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.800> little<00:00:38.010> bit<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.280> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
just kind of pops up a little bit and it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.760 
just kind of pops up a little bit and it
makes<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.480> stay<00:00:39.809> very<00:00:40.170> flat<00:00:40.530> on

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
makes it so it can stay very flat on

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
makes it so it can stay very flat on
rougher<00:00:41.219> surfaces<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.540> you're<00:00:42.629> looking<00:00:42.690> to
