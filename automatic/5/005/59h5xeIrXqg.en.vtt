00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.850
 Hello everyone, so welcome guys 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.489
 to the explanation of the flight a mixture 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.829
 really very nice and discreet 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.359
 easy is not very difficult then 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.629
 we immediately start from the position of the 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.019
 fingers 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.199
 we take about three quarters of March more 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.810
 or less and we think between thumb and ad 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.960
 cancel as you see here perfect 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.549
 this point we put the deck all 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 ring your middle left hand 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.700
 in this case he rests it on the ring finger 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.780
 at this point what we do with 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.000
 the index of the right hand 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.690
 let's go to take out a card in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.509
 this way 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.520
 therefore we support them we carry 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.280
 out perfect at this point with 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.530
 thumb and middle finger of the left hand 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.959
 we are going to position this better 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 paper then we move it to this one 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.649
 way 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.690
 now we will need the help of the average thing 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.090
 will do the best best will have to 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.110
 position yourself on this side of the card 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.310
 together with the thumb 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.310
 so this is what we're going to 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.450
 make perfect at this point i love you 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.450
 all a complete 360 â€‹â€‹around the al 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.049
 thumb and we take the paper between thumb 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.450
 and average in the home position we make you 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.469
 then all over again three quarters of a deck 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 we position the card in this way 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.759
 this is where you get this 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.039
 position we make a 360 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.120
 so let's leave then 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.459
 the paper in the hands of the thumb and 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.000
 of the medium at this point what are we going to 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.100
 do we position ourselves with the index above 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.760
 the paper we are going to overturn in 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.359
 this way 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:33.319
 I do them all slowly so it's the same 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.090
 perfect at this point what we have to 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.459
 do we have to do a kind of 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.490
 bullet or this stuff here 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.250
 how it works I explain it to you 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.340
 easily consists simply of 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.310
 paper pliers between index and middle 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.350
 so let's take the middle over this 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.990
 paper then above the furnishings paintings 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.890
 bring to the top and the card will turn into 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.170
 this way 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.750
 after which we turn the whole hand and 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.890
 we bring the card onto the deck in 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.900
 this way 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.640
 we do everything again so we have the card 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.500
 that in this position we turn it 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.940
 slightly to help us think among 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.220
 average and index we turn and we put it back 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.640
 above at this point what we must do 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.510
 with the thumb we move it under the 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.450
 deck 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.570
 in this perfect way we redo 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:32.330
 all over again we do so 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:37.850
 ok at this point let's do the bullet 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:40.940
 so average index we think we turn 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.120
 the whole deck and put it back on with the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.800
 inch we carry it under we are almost 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.960
 that's enough for us at the end of this mix 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.020
 just lift a portion of a bunch 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.310
 with the index and go do this a 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.350
 take the bunch below that 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.000
 obviously thought with the ring finger 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.460
 take it with the thumb in this way 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.070
 and we run it after that 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.330
 we have to change the grip of this one 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.250
 paper then the position of the fingers 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.280
 how we must do we must do it 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.100
 become this very simple this 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.230
 what from this position will suffice 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.220
 slightly lower the 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.450
 then thumb so we carry a 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.190
 little bit lower 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.180
 helping us to keep the house with better e 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.780
 index and close all redo 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.780
 everything is slowly 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.060
 hi all guys i hope the video 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.470

 let me like it below that 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.760
 contributes to cultural well-being e 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.860
 let's say the hole in the sil hole of the ozone 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.510
 sis the hole in the area to close 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.570
 you like me below so 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.860
 see yourself putting it in the sediments at 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.170
 your country if you hold on to yours 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.520
 oh well anyway we talk about something else is one 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.710
 news is very important news 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.630

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.790

 mv is for me 50 but however he saw that 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.870
 it was quite difficult to find ho 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.520
 decided to shorten it so I then 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.040
