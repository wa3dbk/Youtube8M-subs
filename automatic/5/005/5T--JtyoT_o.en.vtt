00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:15.489
 yes yes yes here is vision today a new thinking here is a bang and it is 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.689
 not just a child did it because it is also a finals child with 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.369
 and no bars 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 I thought them to myself I can also send a car for you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.360
 everything free dn dea the series that you have 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.419
 but an I can still for a while 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.730
 for this time at least nice on my channel have no kidding construction 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670
 you could be doing very well with that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.170
 all 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.000
 in the rest of it is indeed 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.409
 I play here with the PC 90 with him I often say insiders 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.420
 in addition i'm with it 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.830
 set urk sets 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.610
 the fact that has 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.890
 and 6 and 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.790
 to study the arrival line 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.620
 medina marc marquez van have 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.460
 m 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.879
 so i played 79 86 in addition i play with the stalker 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.210
 and I think it would also be a better combination to use if 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.330
 astrix anyway 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.850
 look at and 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 special is nothing 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.960
 stalking a booth and based on mexichem our rest was stabbed 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 set up stalker furry dog ​​is on schedule but learning 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.380
 van lingen freshly frozen region 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.840
 but before this i will i have i just played a stalker 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.189
 is that against campers of course you can not claim your mouth can you already know that shit 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.300
 l who have in the game of course 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.350
 that are just about every game 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.310
 yes that is just very unpleasant to play with it and the streak knows it 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.799
 sex game, however, convention falls stitching that 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.829
 just like elsewhere, he says so himself 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.119
 x i play needle with urby park 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.799
 with the ice wall urgency and in addition I play with tents for spyker 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.470
 actually know that is about what you normally never do 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.170
 tweet i never do it 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.560
 the Union 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.850
 because when I play in the party 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.040
 blackpool paul together with eric 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.710
 reckoning sausage and knowing have a seat 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.990
 you know our group a little dylan 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.600
 yes then actually have a kind of rule that you have written 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.060
 can't play with these sticks why not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.969
 suppose that pope title of most beautiful I say whatever 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.490
 he is often on a nice piece than I have of course 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.289
 but yeah 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.289
 in total he tells 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.939
 but a role ok if you do a lot secretly like that 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.969
 and then I arrive then I have not been over the ball 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.189
 and all that she stops being oldies but also not around them 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.339
 be aware all this time in Arnhem 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.439
 However, it goes well for the bags to say so 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.040
 so that's why I say the unwritten rule has been stripped 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.030
 don't play with that and look at the total sergio ermotti that I have one 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.149
 a bit of luck so alms 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.940
 but furthermore, thinking out is a nice idea to look at 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.209
 although it is of course so I just get a little deeper 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.120
 after that I actually only see those in those machines and I will 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.549
 Heating if you have that turnip to turn that on I hope a lot 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.430
 special top around it otherwise well no then you usually trace that through marieke 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.679
 You know, I have lots of things that people themselves do not have in the debate 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:05.219
 I'm just going to let three sit nicely, it's nice to see me 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.859
 skills 16 at least with the keeper who doesn't have a job but yes 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.389
 and you can still and that is a sinister to life itself 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.730
 then a little later also like it more often as an alternative to depression 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.040
 let's say back pocket in the comments with the commons of course 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.209
 because I also don't like to play goodies in shares 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.819
 for the van as will play is that it actually plays a bit relaxed 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:29.559
 because 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.279
 if you bid on it you completely get the idea and if you kill it goes on 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:33.790
 used to go 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.590
 this actually dies fifteen times 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.789
 and this may be your luck it is already animals 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.819
 actually demo about another it's all done 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.199
 so let's leave 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.299
 for the rest of the weekend at least I have natural and the pole it also together 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.619
 bears that and he knows spec ops i have recorded really super nice natural 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:56.049
 and the controversial month 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.909
 tomorrow also come nordic sarajevo I will also include in my lobster 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.659
 kelsey together 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.900
 if all goes well this weekend I hope so because we were getting one 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.449
 up to my size did nothing with it 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:13.359
 deraa is it i go yeah tomorrow night in kiev he designed the view for me is 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.749
 I know how many times you assume the wait would tell you if you go out 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.279
 and where i actually go 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.769
 because I'm really already in the real then you can only have two and the selected sonck 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.999
 and yes 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.940
 and of course again the victim of just a bachelor 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.590
 so could go out and welcome 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.800
 so I'm going to drain tomorrow with paul together 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 eric when comes here and there night sleep nijmeijer 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:40.610
 van den tillaart the song 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.539
 and it is also possible to absorb moisture or look a bit nice for that 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:44.529
 can record 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.599
 and that we are not too drunk muse lohan probably a bit 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.569
 be tipsy 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.199
 but it must be possible sometime I must always be able to have a child on that 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.270
 way also you can naturally deteriorate health 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.650
 but I am going to absorb a bit of moisture from a Sunday body 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.490
 put it online as a club with a follow-on drain 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.650
 seems very nice to me and you can also win already 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.529

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.530

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.790

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.150
 customary right to get a small church packets 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.160
