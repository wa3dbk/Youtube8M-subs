00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
turn it into a writable bike again if

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.380 
turn it into a writable bike again if
not<00:00:24.350> email<00:00:25.350> me<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.189> will<00:00:26.220> walk<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.240> through

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it right

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.660 
it right
speaking<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.039> walking<00:00:29.310> through<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.490> let's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
speaking of walking through it let's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
speaking of walking through it let's
give<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> closing<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.900> operating<00:00:31.230> alone

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
give the closing on I'm operating alone

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.170 
give the closing on I'm operating alone
I<00:00:31.949> don't<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.430> any<00:00:32.550> want<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> hold<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> camera

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I don't have any want to hold the camera

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.229 
I don't have any want to hold the camera
so<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.690> could<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> bit<00:00:34.230> messy<00:00:35.180> probably<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so it could get a bit messy probably the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
so it could get a bit messy probably the
best<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.840> since<00:00:37.140> we're<00:00:37.290> about<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
best thing to do since we're about to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.910 
best thing to do since we're about to
fold<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> bike<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:39.379> obviously<00:00:40.379> make<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> as

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
fold up the bike is obviously make it as

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.729 
fold up the bike is obviously make it as
compact<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.460> possible<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.440> fold

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
compact as possible and do that we fold

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.709 
compact as possible and do that we fold
in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> pedals<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:45.000> here's<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.480> look

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
in the pedals so here's what it look

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
in the pedals so here's what it look
like<00:00:46.460> when<00:00:47.460> they're<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.910> they're

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
like when they're like this they're

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.700 
like when they're like this they're
locked<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.600> you'll<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:49.140> able<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> pedal<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
locked in you'll be able to pedal and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.610 
locked in you'll be able to pedal and
fine<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:52.289> there's<00:00:52.500> this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
fine as you can see but there's this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
fine as you can see but there's this
little<00:00:52.680> pull<00:00:53.399> tab<00:00:53.699> built<00:00:54.510> into<00:00:54.840> them<00:00:54.989> quite

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little pull tab built into them quite

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
little pull tab built into them quite
cleverly<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> pull<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.550> plastic<00:00:56.730> bit<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
cleverly so you pull the plastic bit in

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.349 
cleverly so you pull the plastic bit in
peril<00:00:57.770> yes<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.699> pull<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.059> far<00:01:00.329> enough

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
peril yes and you pull it in far enough

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.439 
peril yes and you pull it in far enough
and<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.100> petal<00:01:02.340> folds<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and the petal folds down like that is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
and the petal folds down like that is
very<00:01:03.690> nice<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.379> obviously<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
very nice and obviously when you go to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.950 
very nice and obviously when you go to
get<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> bike<00:01:06.090> again<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
get on the bike again you just kind of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.140 
get on the bike again you just kind of
pull<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.890> release<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> thing<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.970> comes

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
pull it in release the thing and comes

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.960 
pull it in release the thing and comes
through<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.750> curve<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
through the curve of it and then when it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.260 
through the curve of it and then when it
pops<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.770> its<00:01:13.770> firm<00:01:14.010> again<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.880> anyway

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
pops back in its firm again so anyway

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
pops back in its firm again so anyway
let's<00:01:15.450> hold<00:01:16.140> him<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.770> trying<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> do

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
let's hold him now it's trying to do

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
let's hold him now it's trying to do
this<00:01:17.310> one-handed<00:01:17.810> actually<00:01:18.810> requires<00:01:19.110> more

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this one-handed actually requires more

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.410 
this one-handed actually requires more
finger<00:01:19.770> strength<00:01:20.400> than<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.670> thought<00:01:20.850> necessary

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
finger strength than I thought necessary

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.100 
finger strength than I thought necessary
and<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:23.070> other<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.820> thumb<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.600> time<00:01:24.840> be

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and the other one to thumb this time be

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.010 
and the other one to thumb this time be
easier<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.590> yet<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.880> pedals<00:01:27.630> hold

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
easier if yet there you go pedals hold

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.370 
easier if yet there you go pedals hold
it<00:01:28.200> flat<00:01:28.670> parallel<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> bike<00:01:30.450> frame<00:01:30.479> now

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it flat parallel to the bike frame now

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
it flat parallel to the bike frame now
let's<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.400> we're<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.090> beau'ful<00:01:33.780> by

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
let's see we're going to be beau'ful by

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.469 
let's see we're going to be beau'ful by
handlebar<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.470> next<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
handlebar down next so right thing to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
handlebar down next so right thing to
remember<00:01:36.720> about<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.170> handlebars<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:39.240> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
remember about the handlebars is this is

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
remember about the handlebars is this is
good<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> same<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.350> folding<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.829> unfolding

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
good the same for folding and unfolding

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.330 
good the same for folding and unfolding
is<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.450> you'll<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.290> tire<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.070> front

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is that you'll want the tire the front

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.080 
is that you'll want the tire the front
tire<00:01:44.960> turns<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> left<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.310> I'll<00:01:47.430> step<00:01:47.670> back

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
tire turns to the left so I'll step back

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
tire turns to the left so I'll step back
say<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.229> you're<00:01:49.409> standing<00:01:49.619> behind<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
say see if you're standing behind the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.899 
say see if you're standing behind the
bike<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:52.229> turning<00:01:52.560> towards<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> left<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
bike it's turning towards the left the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.550 
bike it's turning towards the left the
reason<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.780> these<00:01:54.960> cables

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
reason we do this is that these cables

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
reason we do this is that these cables
that<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:56.430> shifter<00:01:56.880> cables

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that you see here these shifter cables

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.380 
that you see here these shifter cables
and<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> brake<00:01:57.719> cables<00:01:58.909> they<00:01:59.909> only<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and the brake cables they only have so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
and the brake cables they only have so
much<00:02:00.509> slack<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.619> when<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> fold<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
much slack so when you fold the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.649 
much slack so when you fold the
handlebars<00:02:02.790> down<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.149> don't<00:02:03.240> want<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> make

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
handlebars down you don't want to make

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630 
handlebars down you don't want to make
it<00:02:03.810> pull<00:02:04.290> them<00:02:04.439> tight<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.009> damage<00:02:05.490> your

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it pull them tight you don't damage your

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.910 
it pull them tight you don't damage your
shifter<00:02:06.030> cables<00:02:06.329> or<00:02:06.390> anything<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.619> slide

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
shifter cables or anything so this slide

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
shifter cables or anything so this slide
gives<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.670> slack<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> need<00:02:09.270> when<00:02:09.629> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
gives you the slack you need when you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.070 
gives you the slack you need when you
fold<00:02:09.989> handlebar<00:02:10.920> centers<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.370> about

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
fold handlebar centers for about

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.340 
fold handlebar centers for about
so<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.560> reach<00:02:12.830> here<00:02:13.160> there's<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.700> clamp<00:02:14.350> flip

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
so you reach here there's the clamp flip

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.020 
so you reach here there's the clamp flip
it<00:02:15.500> out<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.800> way<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.670> spring-loaded

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
it out of the way it's spring-loaded

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.550 
it out of the way it's spring-loaded
just<00:02:17.570> like<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> other<00:02:17.990> clamp<00:02:18.170> I'll<00:02:18.380> show<00:02:18.500> you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
just like the other clamp I'll show you

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.230 
just like the other clamp I'll show you
in<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.710> minute<00:02:18.800> I'm<00:02:19.370> sorry<00:02:19.670> there's<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.970> lot<00:02:20.150> of

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
in a minute I'm sorry there's a lot of

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.680 
in a minute I'm sorry there's a lot of
focus<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.810> digit<00:02:21.800> cam<00:02:21.980> does<00:02:22.220> not<00:02:22.690> adjust

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
focus the digit cam does not adjust

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.570 
focus the digit cam does not adjust
focus<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.410> fly<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:24.650> stays<00:02:25.400> with

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
focus on the fly just stays with

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.770 
focus on the fly just stays with
whatever<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:26.060> when<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.240> started<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.690> video

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
whatever it was when I started the video

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.220 
whatever it was when I started the video
and<00:02:28.180> anyway<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.240> can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.570> this<00:02:29.720> slot<00:02:30.020> is

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and anyway you can see this slot is

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.370 
and anyway you can see this slot is
slightly<00:02:30.590> offset<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:32.510> again<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.080> keep<00:02:33.230> it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
slightly offset that's again to keep it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.960 
slightly offset that's again to keep it
from<00:02:33.530> falling<00:02:34.100> apart<00:02:34.340> while<00:02:34.550> you're<00:02:34.700> writing

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
from falling apart while you're writing

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.060 
from falling apart while you're writing
it<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.750> need<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.230> put<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> little<00:02:36.860> pressure

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
it so you need to put a little pressure

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.949 
it so you need to put a little pressure
in<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.490> push<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.060> then<00:02:38.450> push<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.630> over<00:02:38.870> to

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
in to push it and then push it over to

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.910 
in to push it and then push it over to
the<00:02:39.050> right<00:02:39.170> I'll<00:02:39.380> see<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.590> can<00:02:39.740> do<00:02:39.830> this

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
the right I'll see if I can do this

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.530 
the right I'll see if I can do this
while<00:02:40.130> holding<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.459> camera<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:44.030> require

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
while holding the camera just require

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.420 
while holding the camera just require
bit<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.780> string<00:02:44.989> okay<00:02:45.560> hang<00:02:45.739> on<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.220> answer

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
bit of string okay hang on you to answer

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.690 
bit of string okay hang on you to answer
this<00:02:46.700> we'll<00:02:46.880> put<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.209> down<00:02:48.550> hopefully<00:02:49.550> that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
this we'll put this down hopefully that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.420 
this we'll put this down hopefully that
still<00:02:50.000> pointing<00:02:50.390> at<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.600> bike<00:02:55.870> like<00:02:56.870> that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
still pointing at the bike like that

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.530 
still pointing at the bike like that
let's<00:02:58.430> see<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.790> was<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.060> pointing<00:02:59.390> at<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
let's see it was it pointing at the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.010 
let's see it was it pointing at the
bündchen<00:02:59.959> no<00:03:00.350> uhm<00:03:01.450> anyway<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.660> can<00:03:02.750> see<00:03:02.900> what

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
bündchen no uhm anyway you can see what

I've flipped it down and then yeah just
gently<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:10.430> can<00:03:10.580> fold<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.680> handlebars<00:03:12.680> down

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
gently you can fold the handlebars down

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.990 
gently you can fold the handlebars down
beside<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.450> front<00:03:14.750> tire<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:16.580> really<00:03:16.820> is

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
beside the front tire and that really is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.509 
beside the front tire and that really is
all<00:03:17.330> there<00:03:17.390> is<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:18.140> on<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.320> front<00:03:18.530> end<00:03:18.680> so

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
all there is to it on the front end so

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.550 
all there is to it on the front end so
the<00:03:19.670> other<00:03:19.820> clamp<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.570> one<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.810> hold<00:03:21.049> two

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
the other clamp the one that hold two

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.150 
the other clamp the one that hold two
halves<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.190> bike<00:03:22.340> together<00:03:22.519> ah<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.950> right

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
halves of the bike together ah is right

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.660 
halves of the bike together ah is right
there

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
there

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.210 
there
and<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.239> has<00:03:26.650> another<00:03:27.650> trick<00:03:27.860> up<00:03:28.040> its<00:03:28.130> sleeve

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
and it has another trick up its sleeve

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.530 
and it has another trick up its sleeve
to<00:03:28.519> make<00:03:28.549> sure<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.910> your<00:03:29.000> bike<00:03:29.090> doesn't<00:03:29.299> fall

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
to make sure that your bike doesn't fall

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.360 
to make sure that your bike doesn't fall
apart<00:03:29.750> while<00:03:29.840> you're<00:03:29.989> riding<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:31.220> is

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
apart while you're riding it and that is

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.850 
apart while you're riding it and that is
that<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.640> pin<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.230> will<00:03:33.500> open<00:03:33.620> the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
that the pin that you will open the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.770 
that the pin that you will open the
clamp<00:03:33.980> believer<00:03:34.640> there's<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.330> spring-loaded

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
clamp believer there's a spring-loaded

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.110 
clamp believer there's a spring-loaded
pin<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.500> then<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.340> has<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.640> actually<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
pin and then that has to actually the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.030 
pin and then that has to actually the
whole<00:03:38.299> complex<00:03:38.840> has<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.080> be<00:03:39.260> lifted<00:03:39.470> up<00:03:39.769> it's

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
whole complex has to be lifted up it's

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.910 
whole complex has to be lifted up it's
in<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.730> in<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:41.110> sliding<00:03:42.110> mount<00:03:42.320> or<00:03:42.500> with<00:03:42.590> an

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
in it's in a sliding mount or with an

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.819 
in it's in a sliding mount or with an
anchor<00:03:43.310> but<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.030> pin<00:03:44.239> goes<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.470> even

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
anchor but the pin goes in so that even

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.740 
anchor but the pin goes in so that even
if<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.070> clamp<00:03:46.370> falls<00:03:46.640> open<00:03:46.880> for<00:03:47.239> some<00:03:47.390> reason

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
if this clamp falls open for some reason

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.120 
if this clamp falls open for some reason
the<00:03:47.870> bike<00:03:48.019> won't<00:03:48.260> fall<00:03:48.440> apart<00:03:48.590> unless<00:03:48.980> you

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
the bike won't fall apart unless you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.539 
the bike won't fall apart unless you
manually<00:03:49.670> lift<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:50.570> up<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.900> turn<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.260> out<00:03:51.350> um<00:03:51.590> I

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
manually lift it up and turn it out um I

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.840 
manually lift it up and turn it out um I
will<00:03:53.540> do<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.780> in<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.959> second<00:03:54.640> when<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.700> do<00:03:55.790> it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
will do that in a second when you do it

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.280 
will do that in a second when you do it
right<00:03:55.970> now<00:03:56.120> here<00:03:57.220> do<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.870> then<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.140> can

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
right now here do that and then you can

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.330 
right now here do that and then you can
pull<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:00.739> out

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
pull this out

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.060 
pull this out
but<00:04:02.000> again<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.299> bike<00:04:02.450> won't<00:04:02.840> separate<00:04:03.680> until

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
but again the bike won't separate until

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.890 
but again the bike won't separate until
you<00:04:04.280> lift<00:04:04.549> this<00:04:04.820> whole<00:04:05.030> pin<00:04:05.269> complex<00:04:05.780> which

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
you lift this whole pin complex which

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.009 
you lift this whole pin complex which
I'm<00:04:06.019> about<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:06.880> like<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.390> then

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
I'm about to do like that and then

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.750 
I'm about to do like that and then
whilst<00:04:09.410> that's<00:04:09.650> open<00:04:10.070> you<00:04:10.220> can<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:10.489> kind<00:04:10.700> of

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
whilst that's open you can just kind of

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.630 
whilst that's open you can just kind of
start<00:04:10.970> will<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.140> course<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.560> bike<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.400> also

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
start will of course the bike and also

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.340 
start will of course the bike and also
fall<00:04:13.790> over<00:04:14.000> now<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.690> can<00:04:14.810> see<00:04:14.959> how<00:04:15.260> it

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
fall over now you can see how it

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.509 
fall over now you can see how it
separates<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:15.920> now<00:04:16.040> what<00:04:16.160> I'm<00:04:16.220> going<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.370> do

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
separates so now what I'm going to do

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.270 
separates so now what I'm going to do
and<00:04:17.269> yes<00:04:17.450> yes<00:04:17.690> just<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.200> know<00:04:18.280> you're

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
and yes yes just like I know you're

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.349 
and yes yes just like I know you're
trying<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.489> fall<00:04:19.700> over<00:04:19.910> in<00:04:20.000> my<00:04:20.090> direction

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
trying to fall over in my direction

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.400 
trying to fall over in my direction
because<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.690> don't<00:04:20.840> have<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.989> third<00:04:21.200> hand

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
because I don't have a third hand

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.580 
because I don't have a third hand
because<00:04:21.709> I'm<00:04:21.799> not<00:04:21.890> a<00:04:21.950> Martian<00:04:22.430> there<00:04:23.390> again

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
because I'm not a Martian there again

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.590 
because I'm not a Martian there again
right<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.830> come<00:04:26.010> around<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.460> we<00:04:26.580> will<00:04:26.760> kick

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
right you come around and we will kick

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.210 
right you come around and we will kick
up<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> kickstand<00:04:28.290> because<00:04:28.620> it's<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.070> thing

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
up the kickstand because it's the thing

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.010 
up the kickstand because it's the thing
that's<00:04:29.250> going<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:30.060> prevent<00:04:30.420> us<00:04:30.540> from<00:04:30.600> folding

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
that's going to prevent us from folding

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.160 
that's going to prevent us from folding
this<00:04:31.140> flat<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.700> do<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.360> bit<00:04:33.600> here<00:04:33.900> a

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
this flat so you do is this bit here a

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.310 
this flat so you do is this bit here a
little<00:04:34.440> bit<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.860> sticks<00:04:34.950> out<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:36.320> spring

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
little bit that sticks out is spring

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.100 
little bit that sticks out is spring
control<00:04:37.820> just<00:04:38.820> do<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.120> I'll<00:04:39.660> do<00:04:39.990> that

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
control just do that I'll do that

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.710 
control just do that I'll do that
without<00:04:40.260> pushing<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.680> bike<00:04:40.830> back<00:04:41.720> for

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
without pushing the bike back for

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.860 
without pushing the bike back for
goodness<00:04:42.960> sake<00:04:43.790> or<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:45.210> just<00:04:45.300> do<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.570> manually

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
goodness sake or you just do it manually

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.050 
goodness sake or you just do it manually
like<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.960> there<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.080> go<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.470> then<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.910> can

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
like so there you go and then you can

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.910 
like so there you go and then you can
fold<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.330> bike<00:04:51.510> which<00:04:51.780> again<00:04:52.140> on<00:04:52.380> we<00:04:52.590> need<00:04:52.710> two

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
fold the bike which again on we need two

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.110 
fold the bike which again on we need two
hands<00:04:53.130> for<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.460> I'll<00:04:53.520> put<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.760> camera<00:04:54.060> over

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
hands for so I'll put the camera over

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:04.610 
hands for so I'll put the camera over
here<00:04:55.040> hopefully<00:04:56.040> aiming<00:04:56.400> at<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.850> bike<00:05:03.620> you're

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
here hopefully aiming at the bike you're

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.550 
here hopefully aiming at the bike you're
getting<00:05:04.890> in<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.060> video<00:05:06.300> I'll<00:05:06.600> bring<00:05:07.110> camera

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
getting in the video I'll bring camera

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.910 
getting in the video I'll bring camera
for<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.740> second<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.310> can<00:05:08.370> see<00:05:08.640> better<00:05:09.920> I'll

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
for a second so you can see better I'll

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.200 
for a second so you can see better I'll
just<00:05:11.070> do<00:05:11.250> that<00:05:15.890> right<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.250> don't<00:05:17.790> know<00:05:18.030> if<00:05:18.120> you

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
just do that right I don't know if you

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.730 
just do that right I don't know if you
caught<00:05:18.570> all<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:18.870> in<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.080> video<00:05:19.290> but<00:05:19.590> then

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
caught all that in the video but then

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.310 
caught all that in the video but then
any<00:05:19.920> right<00:05:20.070> now<00:05:20.910> you<00:05:20.970> can<00:05:21.270> leave<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:21.990> together

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
any right now you can leave it together

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.680 
any right now you can leave it together
and<00:05:22.650> if<00:05:23.430> I<00:05:23.550> plan<00:05:23.850> this<00:05:23.970> would<00:05:24.180> better<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.450> could

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
and if I plan this would better I could

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.960 
and if I plan this would better I could
have<00:05:24.950> set<00:05:25.950> it<00:05:25.980> up<00:05:26.130> against<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.580> kitchen

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
have set it up against the kitchen

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.910 
have set it up against the kitchen
cupboards<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.900> you<00:05:28.020> see<00:05:28.290> how<00:05:28.440> far<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.800> goes

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
cupboards and you see how far it goes

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.520 
cupboards and you see how far it goes

but as it is I'm just trying not to

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.920 
but as it is I'm just trying not to
scrape<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.680> all<00:05:31.830> up<00:05:32.010> for<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.280> but<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.730> then
