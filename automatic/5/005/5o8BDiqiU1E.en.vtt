00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 I already have a lot about neon genesis 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.639
 evangelion heard the series was from 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.960
 but many fans absolutely adored 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.940
 seems to be just as many people too 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 they give the series just as much 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.509
 seems to fit why it is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.580
 really urgent to find out and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 That's why I wanted the series 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 look at as well as already louis picture 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.689
 Evangelicals announced a series 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.849
 out of a total of four, the series films 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.160
 The act would reinterpret the action 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.430
 films come from the original inventor 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.710
 hedia kia no and it started with 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.440
 evangelion one point one way you are not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.050
 alone the first six episodes new 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.610
 tell the film worth the series 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.379
 newbies and maybe also for people 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.940
 Maybe the series knows that because 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.469
 i find out and that we discuss 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.469
 now in the new animated 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.800
 evangelical one point one one tells 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.990
 the story of the pupil finne kari 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.640
 that of his distanced father of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 asked to do so tomorrow 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.840
 because just a gigantic gospel 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.580
 control unit and with it in the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.440
 to fight against the angels 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.150
 Of course, they do not look like harbor here 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.760
 playing people with wings 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.670
 instead angels are huge 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.590
 devastating monsters and the first fight 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.479
 between eva and angel you do too 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.240
 very quickly what you are pointing to 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.030
 Getting ready can be incredible 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.479
 good- looking brutal rousing 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.479
 action 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.090
 in fact, evangelion is one point one 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.950
 a very faithful remake of the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.140
 first six follow the series 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.610
 fans would actually have come and 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.650
 to look at it all again 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.900
 if the film is not so retina 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.330
 destroying it would look great 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.670
 Gospels London is the anti cheat 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.410
 movie while me he says in his movie 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.180
 with colorful calm pictures the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.220
 beauty and uniqueness of nature 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.049
 makes clear played by jilin 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.959
 mainly in the cold halls and 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.910
 streets of tokio 3 the movie can do it 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.530
 thereby technically without problems with chips 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.780
 sees masterpieces record 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.730
 but at the same time completely different 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.410
 will you please dreamy worlds 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.780
 often a fairytale atmosphere 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.760
 the world of gospels will build up 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.190
 despite her completely insane premise 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.470
 always realistic evangelion one point 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.480
 one one stays that way is hinrich right 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.879
 simple shinji becomes tokyo three 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.980
 ordered then rises an ev and fights 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.579
 in the future against like angels at least in 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.349
 this movie 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.150
 you would not really be much more complex 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.950
 but the battles themselves manage it 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.810
 really every time to surprise 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.940
 no angel looks like the previous one 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.739
 no fight is like another 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.569
 also in other series often 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.250
 Impersonal Cold Swap 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.790
 between robots work here most 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.319
 brutally 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.329
 that has to do with everything before 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.579
 that both evas and angels are alike 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.040
 not classic robots but 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.230
 then living creatures will hurt you 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.970
 they bleed to what extent an eva at all 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.519
 controllable is a whole 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.319
 elementary question in the series already in 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.060
 Changing so loses his first fight 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.069
 the control over his eva the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.870
 then runs completely amok and even 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.700
 neon genesis becomes a threat 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.769
 evangelion was mainly against 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.480
 his main character criticizes chili 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.400
 is there someone who is constantly in the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.099
 self-pity bathing constantly with 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.410
 his fate is the one around 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.389
 philosophizing about it is how hard it is 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.700
 actually on this world and who has 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.769
 my video robinvest final fantasy 13 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.260
 He will know how good I am 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.000
 clearly come at me with such characters 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.220
 that's why I'm very happy about it 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.780
 that the character of shinji for the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.340
 movie actually changed a bit 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.109
 and he was not so whiny anymore 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.669
 he comes is so much still 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.560
 always very happy about his own 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.570
 misfortune and just interrupt 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.810
 vitally important battles for me all 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.250
 to make his fellow man briefly clear 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.800
 just somehow with the overall situation 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.359
 dissatisfied overall will be 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.010
 Shinji but still pretty fast 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.019
 aware of his own responsibility and 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.769
 therefore a much more pleasant 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.600
 character 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.820
 but for whom exactly is gospel one 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.840
 point one one now well thought of now 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.520
 to get fans has one 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.870
 General overhaul of the first six 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.730
 follow in which above all things the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.080
 convincing great action sequences 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.820
 can and a real step after 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.889
 front in comparison to the series represent 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.930
 The anime basically admits with everything 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.669
 others in genre just completely on 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.350
 but I never with the series 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.510
 had something to do really had fun 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.430
 certainly with the movie I do not have 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.740
 really understood what angel exactly 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.110
 where are they from julians what 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.389
 the secret organization of changes conclusion 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.580
 Actually, all this is hardly going to happen 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.200
 not explained but the film scatter 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.880
 small scenes again and again 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.410
 The evidence suggests that this 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.370
 riddles dissolved in the following film- 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.530
 could become 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.169
 it remains to be hoped that at evangelium 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.940
 to point to you can not band out of the 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.310
 many question marks exclamation mark 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.200
 and the great action scenes 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.510
 with an equally great plot 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.539
 be supported until then you get 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.700
 with gospels 1 1 1 at least one of 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.690
 coolest action movies you so in the 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.260
 probably seen last year 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.270
 will have 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.010
 The history then remains technical 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.630
 still a little something to be desired 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.400
 but as I said there are three more 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.169
 then film the story 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.060
 I can extend myself too 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.120
 blu-ray very much had a lot of fun 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.890
 with it and whether the successors likewise so 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.150
 we will be a lot of fun 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.580
 maybe next week 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.950
 find out at anni east with 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.510
 to do gospel point 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.570
 See you 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.250
 that was anime action at anni - and when 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.260
 you want to see it mixed with fan 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.790
 service so unbelievably much boobs and 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.800
 Who does not want that then he gets it now 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:59.110
 geas luschkow is animated by the link 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.120
 the rebellion kenter is so budig

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.120
 Complete looked at and an insane 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.560
 spectacular speed made of it
