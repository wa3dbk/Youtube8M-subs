creation<00:01:41.329> it<00:01:42.329> goes<00:01:42.540> without<00:01:42.659> saying<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
creation it goes without saying that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.539

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
we're obviously going to be making a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.359 
we're obviously going to be making a
male<00:01:44.850> same<00:01:45.270> character<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.619> obviously<00:01:47.220> that's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
male same character so obviously that's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.730

the<00:01:47.610> first<00:01:47.790> thing<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> way

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the first thing out of the way

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.069 
the first thing out of the way
I<00:01:50.060> think<00:01:51.060> yeah<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.479> pretty<00:01:51.689> sure<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
I think yeah I'm pretty sure that's the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
I think yeah I'm pretty sure that's the
Hyatt<00:01:52.490> that's<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:53.759> much<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> base<00:01:54.210> height

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
Hyatt that's pretty much the base height

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.170 
Hyatt that's pretty much the base height
for<00:01:54.659> nearly<00:01:54.810> every<00:01:55.259> yoke<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> same<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
for nearly every yoke is the same that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.710 
for nearly every yoke is the same that
height<00:01:57.329> Gohan's<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.080> high<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.320> pretty<00:01:58.500> sure

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
height Gohan's that high I'm pretty sure

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.080 
height Gohan's that high I'm pretty sure
like<00:02:00.720> TN<00:02:01.460> they're<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.580> around<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> same

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

in<00:02:11.640> resurrection<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.630> he<00:02:12.720> doesn't<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.050> his

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
in resurrection if he doesn't have his

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.180 
in resurrection if he doesn't have his
spiky<00:02:13.800> hair<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.860> simple<00:02:17.130> fact

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
spiky hair but just for the simple fact

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.170 
spiky hair but just for the simple fact
that<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.849> hair<00:02:18.269> does<00:02:18.510> not<00:02:19.519> change<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.940> style

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
that the hair does not change the style

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.400 
that the hair does not change the style
does<00:02:21.330> not<00:02:21.450> change<00:02:21.660> when<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.930> turn<00:02:22.080> Super

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
does not change when you turn Super

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.030 
does not change when you turn Super
Saiyan<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.540> think<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.750> sake<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.200> having

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
Saiyan I think for the sake of having

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.820 
Saiyan I think for the sake of having
that<00:02:26.340> transformation<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:28.290> could<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.620> use

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
that transformation we could just use

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190 
that transformation we could just use
this<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.269> but<00:02:30.269> if<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.450> really<00:02:30.750> wanted<00:02:31.170> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
this one but if you really wanted to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.240 
this one but if you really wanted to
when<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> didn't<00:02:31.709> really<00:02:31.799> care<00:02:32.100> about

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
when you didn't really care about

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.130 
when you didn't really care about
transforming<00:02:32.970> into<00:02:33.090> Super<00:02:33.420> Saiyan<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.750> think

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
transforming into Super Saiyan I think

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.520 
transforming into Super Saiyan I think
that<00:02:34.500> hair<00:02:34.799> would<00:02:35.040> nearly<00:02:35.489> nearly<00:02:36.480> suffice<00:02:37.019> or

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that hair would nearly nearly suffice or

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.890 
that hair would nearly nearly suffice or
maybe<00:02:37.799> even<00:02:37.920> yeah<00:02:38.760> number<00:02:39.480> three<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:39.870> number

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
maybe even yeah number three or number

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.190 
maybe even yeah number three or number
twelve<00:02:40.319> could<00:02:40.470> easily<00:02:40.700> fit<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:42.209> character

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
twelve could easily fit this character

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.199 
twelve could easily fit this character
creation<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.489> for<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> purpose<00:02:45.030> of

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
creation but just for the purpose of

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.539

I<00:03:19.920> don't<00:03:20.489> think<00:03:20.549> Gohan<00:03:20.940> has<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.269> these

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
I don't think Gohan has like these

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.289 
I don't think Gohan has like these
massive<00:03:21.630> elephant<00:03:22.350> ears<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.120> Gohan<00:03:24.120> has<00:03:24.150> a

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
massive elephant ears and Gohan has a

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.509 
massive elephant ears and Gohan has a
paler<00:03:24.900> skin<00:03:24.930> complexion<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.130> think<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
paler skin complexion so I think the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.990 
paler skin complexion so I think the
dark<00:03:29.730> one

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
dark one

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.130 
dark one
and<00:03:32.940> voice<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.180> nearly<00:03:34.360> found<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.750> voice<00:03:34.900> that

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
and voice I nearly found a voice that

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.940 
and voice I nearly found a voice that
kind<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.500> sounded<00:03:35.800> similar<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.990> Gohan

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
kind of sounded similar to that of Gohan

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.670 
kind of sounded similar to that of Gohan
in<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.160> anime<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.460> think<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.730> was<00:03:39.820> number<00:03:40.030> 5<00:03:40.680> so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
in the anime I think it was number 5 so

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.500 
in the anime I think it was number 5 so
I<00:03:42.160> can't<00:03:42.730> actually<00:03:42.850> hear<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.150> at<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.300> moment

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
I can't actually hear it at the moment

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.020 
I can't actually hear it at the moment
but<00:03:43.630> I'm<00:03:43.720> gonna<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:44.170> think<00:03:44.890> it's<00:03:45.010> 5<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.230> named

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
but I'm gonna I think it's 5 and named

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.500 
but I'm gonna I think it's 5 and named
Gohan<00:03:49.060> oh<00:03:52.410> can't<00:03:53.410> spell<00:03:53.620> apparently<00:03:54.510> and

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
Gohan oh can't spell apparently and

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.780 
Gohan oh can't spell apparently and
then<00:03:55.750> we're<00:03:55.930> gonna<00:03:56.730> all<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:59.580> it's<00:04:00.580> gotta

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
then we're gonna all of the it's gotta

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:15.910 
then we're gonna all of the it's gotta
have<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:00.970> bracket<00:04:01.240> no<00:04:01.660> parentheses

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.490 

and<00:04:16.180> we<00:04:17.180> should<00:04:17.450> be<00:04:17.570> good<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.840> go<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.549> think

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.690 

now<00:04:24.500> we'll<00:04:24.650> just<00:04:24.770> go<00:04:24.890> for<00:04:25.100> up<00:04:25.340> close<00:04:25.520> and

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
now we'll just go for up close and

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.790 
now we'll just go for up close and
personal<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.240> we<00:04:26.840> should<00:04:27.050> be<00:04:27.170> ready<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.470> then

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.160 
personal and we should be ready to then
assemble<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.580> pieces<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.600> we<00:04:29.750> have<00:04:29.960> to

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
assemble the pieces that we have to
