one more time and this this time it have
to<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:44.490> play<00:02:47.180> okay<00:02:49.790> we<00:02:50.790> loaded<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.360> game<00:02:56.150> let's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
to to play okay we loaded the game let's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.420 
to to play okay we loaded the game let's
play<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:58.020> bit

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:14.670 

okay<00:03:05.299> your<00:03:05.810> game<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.480> story<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:11.500> okay
