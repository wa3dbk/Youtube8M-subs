00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.109
 hello today he plays the narrow rappel that is 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.609
 very simple we have a good piece of 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.049
 monkfish, you are tiny because in my 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.750
 family is not very big you can 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:13.500
 get a bigger one we 're going to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.420
 smear well of olive oil and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.590
 we will also put you as along with that 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.930
 salt oil everywhere I use salt 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.260
 fat I have to say if you use 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.020
 at the end then the arm of the way 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.580
 I took the point, we will put on a 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.160
 transparent paper a little bit of 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.140
 paprika that should not be spicy always 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.060
 as red as possible, here I have spent 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.830
 of quantity we must put a little 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.890
 less quantity than what I have put 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.360
 because if does not come out very dark once 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.790
 that we have daubed it well for all 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.699
 already we see that we do not leave any 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.280
 part however nart we wrap it in 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.370
 the transparent paper and we're going to make it 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.300
 a knot in each corner so that it is 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.500
 the most 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.890
 as closed as possible this packet 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.770
 we wrap in aluminum foil and 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.350
 close it well and we will take it to a pot 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.380
 which you are boiling to which you will 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.840
 also salt and a bay leaf as if 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.810
 it was a normal seafood 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.240
 in it we will put about 20 minutes of 20 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.940
 to 25 minutes depending on the size 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.460
 Monkfish I have spent that time and once cold 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.000
 we are going to unpack it from the paper of 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.240
 aluminum and also of paper 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.850
 of the film's transparent paper what 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.160
 Let cool in the fridge to 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.570
 cut it and when we put it in the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.670
 refrigerator as well we will protect it a 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.230
 little so that it does not take odor from the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.420
 fridge 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.120
 while it cools we're going to be doing 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.920
 American sauce that will first be a 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.730
 mayonnaise base with an egg that 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.150
 we have here a handful a bit of 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.740
 salt and then as an oil cup 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.010
 sunflower that I prefer it always for 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.470
 Mayonnaise 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.850
 we will pass the blender from below to 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.030
 up as you see if you want too 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.950
 You can put a cloth under it and take it out 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.620
 mayonnaise we will make the rest of the sauce 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.810
 American keeping as we see with a 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.900
 little piece of ketchup that came out there 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.560
 like a couple of tablespoons and like two 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.170
 tablespoons of brandy or cognac from him in 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.600
 this will see me if the sauce is 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.850
 too light you with the least or if it is 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.040
 artisan but never again and once 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.990
 wrapped up we already have him when he is 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.330
 cold cut it with a knife 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.810
 cut better than mine and if you want 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.060
 you can do it directly cut 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.060
 or obliquely it was very good
