 hello everyone today we are with you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 we will sort the songs from the classic 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.519
 thieves are called in Murka 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:17.990
 at the request of one of our subscribers so 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:22.119
 let's go arrived in Odessa a gang of cupid 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.119
 apandy you write about 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.130
 engaged in dark affairs and watching 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.050
 vandy 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.310
 check and since this part is played 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.920
 let's go the first chord that we put 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.690
 this port is am it is put as follows 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.059
 the way we clamp on the first fret 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.370
 second string on 2 frets third and 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.010
 fourth string 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.230
 and so what does our right hand do 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:56.620
 right hand doing the following we play 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:59.440
 as follows that is you see we 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.079
 lose drunk in the ground then 1 2 3 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.190
 we will lose at the same time later 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:11.250
 fourth fifth three countries and 4 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:19.050
 I think this is understandable so the following we 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.760
 losing input is chord e7 he plays 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.240
 as follows we click on the first 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.509
 fret third string string for 2 fret 4 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.440
 the fifth string and the second string we clamp 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.440
 on the third fret 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.850
 We play and as absolutely as the first 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.020
 chord that is, we play year three countries 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.020
 4 3 country 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.250
 we go back to them 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.900
 further comes chords and in these in the gang were 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.700
 you cheaters believe you play a chord 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.290
 how it is played we clamp completely 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.120
 all the first fret in the second year we 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.690
 we clamp the third string on the third fret 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.180
 fourth fifth string 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.719
 also 5 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:28.920
 4 5 understandable yes thunder fast that is 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:30.569
 if he lost here 2 times and 1 2 1 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 not 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.030
 f 1 risk 1st chord 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.590
 playing with as follows and on the first 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:45.400
 year we clamp the fourth string on the second 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.730
 fret fifth third first hand to us makes 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.730
 same thing 5 3 4 3 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.680
 and then in my opinion the most difficult 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.680
 part in this song we play the following 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.689
 in fact it is not difficult we immediately 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.040
 take here and so is taken in the following 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.170
 the way you are on the second fret 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
 fourth string in the third year 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.299
 pinching the second on the fourth fret 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:21.849
 first and third and here you are right 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.530
 hand play only for those with a large 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.719
 finger you play only on that string 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.920
 which you clamped your index finger 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:34.769
 here it is, that is, first 4 here 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.769
 all three lower then open 4 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.710
 then we clamp the fifth string on the 3rd 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.270
 fret here continue all three here these 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.670
 plays we don't drop and three fingers and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.660
 then point to the advantage of clamping on 5 on 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.350
 second fret fifth string 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.350
 and get 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.439
 understandably 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.439
 play first 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.590
 and so the gang dealt with dark matters 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:36.490
 and bring casket it is played very 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:38.530
 just go back to 4 4 times 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.330
 then we make dark we just 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.460
 lower the index finger and take 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.710
 here it is yes to someone is on 2 mandala 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.220
 Duma we clamp the second string and the fourth 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:53.210
 string 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:57.560
 We play on the same strings 5 â€‹â€‹4 record 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.930

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.030
 we press the third and on the third fret the second 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.930
 then we also play the same year 4 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.690
 I see, yes 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:21.300
