00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
venue it's something they've made little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.719 
venue it's something they've made little
bit<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> ordinary<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.100> certainly

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
bit out of the ordinary but certainly

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.460 
bit out of the ordinary but certainly
it's<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:24.000> intimate<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> show<00:01:25.049> than<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it's more intimate as a show than a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.609 
it's more intimate as a show than a
traditional<00:01:25.860> geek<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:27.500> private<00:01:28.500> gig
