00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to add in brightness control you just

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
to add in brightness control you just
check<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> edit

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710

your<00:01:01.859> brightness<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.090> sliding<00:01:03.629> along

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
your brightness I just sliding along

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.210 
your brightness I just sliding along
here<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.680> know<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
here I don't know if you can see that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
here I don't know if you can see that
but<00:01:05.580> instead<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> editing<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> brightness

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
but instead of editing the brightness

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.830 
but instead of editing the brightness
and<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:08.100> that's<00:01:08.250> pretty<00:01:08.369> cool<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and yeah that's pretty cool but it is a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
and yeah that's pretty cool but it is a
little<00:01:10.049> tricky<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:11.159> used<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.549> once<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
little tricky to a get used to once you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.880 
little tricky to a get used to once you
do<00:01:12.570> apply<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.900> oh<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
do apply it oh and then you have the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.289 
do apply it oh and then you have the
battery<00:01:14.070> status<00:01:14.430> style<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.150> like

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
battery status style so you can like

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.109 
battery status style so you can like
edit<00:01:15.689> your<00:01:15.960> icon<00:01:16.350> right<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:18.000> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
edit your icon right up there so if you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.460 
edit your icon right up there so if you
look<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.450> battery<00:01:18.720> icon<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.229> just

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
look at my battery icon I can just

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
look at my battery icon I can just
change<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> circle<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.549> percentage

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
change to a circle with the percentage

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
change to a circle with the percentage
and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> changes<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.259> yeah<00:01:22.380> that's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and then it changes and yeah that's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.320 
and then it changes and yeah that's
pretty<00:01:22.560> cool<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> quick

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
settings panel this is pretty much the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
settings panel this is pretty much the
panel<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.970> what's<00:01:27.119> cool<00:01:27.270> about
