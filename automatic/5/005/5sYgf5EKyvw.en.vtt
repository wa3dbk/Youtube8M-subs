 pancake argyll i'm new and tartan and 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.110
 Prince of Wales 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.970
 many will think it's just a nickname 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.790
 the kids on the area actually is 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.780
 just types of cell prints like 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.640
 with this fashionable 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.720
 how our participants coped 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.770
 let's learn from our fat besides these 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.140
 varieties pertsovka feels still 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.619
 mass of things in a cage well, that's it 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.310
 really anything coat sharp 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.570
 shoes skirt do not know the dress anything 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.310
 and you chose a super shirt 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.489
 Generally the best plaid shirt 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.260
 representatives 390 yes anastasia in your 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.180
 I am interested in the image exclusively 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.010
 This here is a metallic skirt she 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.110
 looks good she looks interesting 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.670
 and perhaps this is the contrast of things 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.690
 from some different directions of different 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.480
 styles looks and 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.760
 and , in general, justified, but I do not understand 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.160
 why here not to finish this image 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.470
 why not to finish it 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.989
 here is this shirt which is so strange 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.200
 sitting on you looks so strange and 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.410
 and in general a good night skirt in total 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.560
 she doesn't fit with us in general i am watching 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.260
 you understand what you did, you took 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.959
 some shirt from past seasons and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.350
 get dressed now how could you get dressed 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 and five years ago and 6 years ago and 10 years 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.630
 even more back but you look to 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.120
 Sorry this is not a fashion singer at all 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.400
 country style today thank you so much 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.560
 go to the discussion of our 3 participants 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.450
 I think something is probably very 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.400
 Today, is it creative? 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.290
 suspenders up to 3 of course well confuses this 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.410
 here's your rib cage, I choked here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.390
 so here Kristof this confuses and already so 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.830
 say this here, these trousers are 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.800
 with under piled on me deputy somehow behind so 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.410
 you know sex with this fighter but I donâ€™t know what 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.620
 it's not very cool, but under these 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.569
 rhinestones but in this belt of this code you are so 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.300
 on creative river according to this principle it 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:55.590
 my depressed stylist would just be me 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:58.230
 picked up the change that they carried us right 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.069
 before the eyes of iodine he is so income on the hajj 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.989
 this is a gift maria of course you 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.080
 distinguishes from the rest as we are taught that 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.530
 you are not in a shirt now but in a dress was drowning 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.980
 Dress course you such a cell 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.350
 single cell life but honestly it's like 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.980
 just on and it comes to tone 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.160
 the dress it fits i can say that 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.590
 also not 5 days at all already bad in this 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.470
 because bows can be up to Pauline here you can 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:34.440
 agree that she even has a brain 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.540
 included when collecting these things I do not 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.460
 I can understand this dress but pretty 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.550
 so easy is what you wear these 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.430
 tights of this color I put you fashion 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.280
 feet dirty now it would seem 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.080
 whether the task is simple enough for measles 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.100
 the girls had to deal with him but 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 absolutely all his rights were sculpted now we 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.770
 we see just the participants of the beauty contest 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.440
 flow in and 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.800
 and Carlson's first wife is very hard 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.120
 will be judged to choose whom 1 to fail 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.050
 under the podium right now 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.259
 Well, colleagues 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.490
 this is another disappointment of today 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:17.250
 of the day I am shocked by the forces but it is completely 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.319
 level 9 grade 9 grade and uninteresting 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.360
 worth a thin strap which she is in 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.930
 100 jeans but no one is thin 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.419
 thongs 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.849
 friends my jeans are thin straps 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.240
 no need to insert strap 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.909
 across the width of the loop 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.470
 or do not insert it back well, 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:39.870
 rail it just shoot me right away 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.889
 let it be the first shot and he 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.360
 control and as for me the image was not 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.039
 I saw nothing interesting but 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.550
 suspenders that are backwards in practice 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:53.639
 but such but of course this blatant 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.400
 Belt Well listen well, to do with it but I have even 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.169
 here it is maria singer from fictional 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.909
 fictional singer she is not 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.849
 I allowed myself to wear these rhinestones 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:05.129
 and the designer here put them on like this 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.919
 maybe on maria i think that you 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.550
 the color of the shoes is too strong 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:15.000
 correct platform wrong panty hoses 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:20.639
 wrong dress normal but prince 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.949
 greatly fatten and expands normal a 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:27.139
 in color it's all done 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:30.040
 well enough quite the same anastasia 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.220
 why because 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.030
 the skirt was a separate shirt separately 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.280
 shoes separately tights separately there everything 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.290
 nothing fused about 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.570
 anastasia seryozha I support you 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.220
 also did not like it 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.870
 interpreted the cell in its version 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.970
 she is perfect 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.970
 wore things as ours likes to say 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.470
 colleague daniel who among themselves 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.470
 didn't make friends at all 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.830
 who put on a shirt in a cage 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.410
 who looks like a stool 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:09.550
 who is the time to go to texas 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:11.580
 graze there young bulls whose cage 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:16.740
 need to be locked in a cage 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.740
 who will not even reach the semi-finals 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:30.870
 the most unpredictable of your country show 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.870
 the style icon is leaving now 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.740
 anastasia father seems to me that really 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.060
 unfair from the spring girls were 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.900
 dressed absolutely not cool not 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:59.830
 interesting and stylish with you rural 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.210
 animals can produce big i don't 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.930
 I honestly understand how I could leave 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.930
 marian
