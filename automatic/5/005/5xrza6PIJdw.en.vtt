00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.760
Ancient peoples looked at the moon and saw
in its patterns of shadow and light the figures

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.379
of deities or animals.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.430
The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, trained
his telescope on our celestial companion and

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.170
saw mountains and valleys much like those
on Earth.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.230
Scientists today, operating a fleet of spacecraft,
are seeing evidence of past events that shaped

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.820
the lunar landscape, and traces of water and
minerals that may one day support a human

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.300
presence.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.650
Using data from NASAÕs Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter, we now take a virtual tour of this

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.239
ÒnewÓ Moon and some of its most noteworthy
destinations.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.430
HereÕs the Mare Orientale, an impact crater
nearly 4 billion years old.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.400
The color, coded for elevation, highlights
a bulls-eye pattern of concentric rings.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:26.300
Now, letÕs go down under to the South Pole.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.560
The pole sits within the wide rim of the famed
Shackleton Crater.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.030
Direct sunlight never reaches the crater floor.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.300
The Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected higher
than normal amounts of hydrogen within the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:51.929
crater, which may indicate the presence of
water ice.

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.910
From here, we travel to the far side of the
moon.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.800
The South Pole-Aitken Basin is one of the
largest and oldest impact features in the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800
solar system.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:16.330
You can see its true size in the elevation
data.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:33.760
We are approaching the Tycho Crater.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:44.690
Look closely at the mountainous peak in the
center of the crater.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.340
That strange boulder near the summit is about
100 meters wide.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:03:01.390
It might have been left there by an impact.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.420
Now on to the Aristarchus Crater, the product
of a relatively recent impact.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.920
It sits on a plateau thatÕs the site of many
transient lunar phenomena, mysterious shifts

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:27.450
in color or light on the surface.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:36.850
The Sea of Serenity, and to its right the
Sea of TranquilityÉ these dark regions were

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.880
laid down by vast lava flows.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.930
The Taurus-Littrow Valley is in the highlands
to the north.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.540
The image is based on a stereoscopic elevation
map from JapanÕs Kaguya spacecraft.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.050
Here, now, is the Apollo 17 landing site courtesy
of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.650
From this vantage, you can see the lander,
the rover, and trails left by rover tires

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.770
and astronauts.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:25.410
Finally, to the north pole.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.350
In the highlands that blanket this region,
the sides of myriad craters cast long shadows

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.870
acros the craggy lunar landscape.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:56.350
There it is.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.270
Our moon.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.840
Our one and only.
