or<00:00:03.830> in<00:00:04.009> this<00:00:04.190> video<00:00:04.460> we'll<00:00:04.700> do<00:00:04.850> a<00:00:04.880> quick

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.090 
or in this video we'll do a quick

or in this video we'll do a quick
compare<00:00:05.510> with<00:00:05.690> you<00:00:05.870> between<00:00:06.080> two<00:00:06.530> fire<00:00:06.890> steels

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:07.299 
compare with you between two fire steels

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.699 
compare with you between two fire steels
otherwise<00:00:08.299> known<00:00:08.509> as<00:00:08.599> fire<00:00:08.839> rods<00:00:09.139> for<00:00:09.559> our

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:09.709 
otherwise known as fire rods for our

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.739 
otherwise known as fire rods for our
rods<00:00:09.919> fire<00:00:10.490> containers<00:00:10.910> they're<00:00:11.509> under<00:00:11.719> a

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:11.749 
rods fire containers they're under a

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.899 
rods fire containers they're under a
bunch<00:00:11.959> of<00:00:12.019> different<00:00:12.259> names<00:00:12.440> but<00:00:13.280> we'll<00:00:13.759> have

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:13.909 
bunch of different names but we'll have

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.020 
bunch of different names but we'll have
the<00:00:14.119> Sparky<00:00:14.780> fire<00:00:15.259> starter<00:00:15.650> to<00:00:15.889> try<00:00:16.100> out<00:00:16.280> and

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.030 
the Sparky fire starter to try out and

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.800 
the Sparky fire starter to try out and
also<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.600> Primus<00:00:18.080> fire<00:00:18.500> igniter<00:00:18.950> and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
also the Primus fire igniter and

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.670 
also the Primus fire igniter and
normally<00:00:20.810> we<00:00:20.900> would<00:00:21.050> use<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.260> little<00:00:21.530> bit<00:00:21.590> of

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
normally we would use a little bit of

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.680 
normally we would use a little bit of
fire<00:00:21.830> starter<00:00:22.190> to<00:00:22.310> help<00:00:22.520> do<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.300> job<00:00:23.510> but

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
fire starter to help do the job but

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.970 
fire starter to help do the job but
today<00:00:23.780> we're<00:00:24.050> just<00:00:24.080> gonna<00:00:24.320> try<00:00:24.560> with<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:24.740> little

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
today we're just gonna try with a little

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:49.810 
today we're just gonna try with a little
bit<00:00:25.070> of<00:00:25.160> birch<00:00:25.340> bark<00:00:47.710> all<00:00:48.710> right<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.040> the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
bit of birch bark all right so the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.330 
bit of birch bark all right so the
Sparky<00:00:50.329> fire<00:00:50.540> star<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.559> saw<00:00:51.860> that

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
Sparky fire star you can you saw that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.540 
Sparky fire star you can you saw that
you<00:00:53.059> can<00:00:53.210> do<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.600> one-handed<00:00:54.079> operation<00:00:54.550> and

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
you can do the one-handed operation and

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.190 
you can do the one-handed operation and
you<00:00:55.880> can<00:00:56.030> ignore<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.540> way<00:00:56.660> depending<00:00:56.840> on

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
you can ignore that way depending on

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.410 
you can ignore that way depending on
your<00:00:57.320> setup<00:00:57.620> like<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.489> did<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.820> can<00:00:58.850> be<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.300> a

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
your setup like I did you can be on a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.080 
your setup like I did you can be on a
solid<00:00:59.870> surface<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.290> just<00:01:00.620> drive<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.700> sparks

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
solid surface and just drive the sparks

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.520 
solid surface and just drive the sparks
down<00:01:02.469> so<00:01:03.469> depending<00:01:03.860> on<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.670> type<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.879> your

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
down so depending on the type of your

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.100 
down so depending on the type of your
kindling<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.920> can<00:01:07.100> do<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.340> now<00:01:07.520> work<00:01:08.110> did

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
kindling you can do that now work did

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.260 
kindling you can do that now work did
take<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.500> few<00:01:09.860> times<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.430> get<00:01:10.549> going<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:11.030> get<00:01:11.120> the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
take a few times to get going to get the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.840 
take a few times to get going to get the
right<00:01:11.450> amount<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.840> pressure<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.890> sparks<00:01:13.430> but

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
right amount of pressure this sparks but

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.109 
right amount of pressure this sparks but
you<00:01:14.450> know<00:01:14.510> I<00:01:14.570> think<00:01:14.750> after<00:01:15.049> what<00:01:15.380> practice

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
you know I think after what practice

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.510 
you know I think after what practice
should<00:01:17.119> be<00:01:17.240> fine

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
should be fine

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.170 
should be fine
compared<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.720> Primus<00:01:21.170> fire<00:01:21.740> starter<00:01:22.180> the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
compared to the Primus fire starter the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.160 
compared to the Primus fire starter the
included<00:01:24.140> tool<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:25.340> little<00:01:25.820> difficult<00:01:26.170> to

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
included tool is a little difficult to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.260 
included tool is a little difficult to
get<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.130> spark<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.939> actually<00:01:29.330> have<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:31.270> apply

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
get a spark I actually have to apply

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.800 
get a spark I actually have to apply
quite<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.140> bit<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.560> pressure<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:35.420> get<00:01:35.570> a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
quite a bit of pressure to get a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.350 
quite a bit of pressure to get a
sparkling<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:36.560> happen<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.860> lose<00:01:37.159> your

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
sparkling you happen to lose your

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.030 
sparkling you happen to lose your
ignition<00:01:38.360> tool<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:38.869> can<00:01:38.990> always<00:01:39.140> use<00:01:39.500> the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
ignition tool you can always use the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.670 
ignition tool you can always use the
back<00:01:40.220> end<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.549> knife<00:01:40.729> here<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.810> create<00:01:42.470> the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
back end of the knife here to create the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.950 
back end of the knife here to create the
sparks<00:01:43.009> like<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.549> not<00:01:44.060> with<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.540> blade<00:01:44.750> but

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
sparks like that not with the blade but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.290 
sparks like that not with the blade but
with<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.500> end
