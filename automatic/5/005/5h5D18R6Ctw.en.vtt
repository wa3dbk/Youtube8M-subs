right there we do get um sitting clear
he<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> silver<00:01:40.320> last<00:01:40.619> year<00:01:40.770> he<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.009> awesome

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
he was a silver last year he was awesome

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
he was a silver last year he was awesome
i<00:01:41.460> probably<00:01:41.700> won't<00:01:42.060> use<00:01:42.360> his<00:01:42.570> gold<00:01:42.810> version

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
i probably won't use his gold version

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.859 
i probably won't use his gold version
just<00:01:43.290> because<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.619> don't<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.920> BPL<00:01:44.460> team<00:01:44.869> but

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
just because I don't have a BPL team but

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
just because I don't have a BPL team but
hopefully<00:01:46.560> he<00:01:46.649> stole<00:01:46.890> sells<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:48.090> decent

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
hopefully he stole sells for a decent

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.060 
hopefully he stole sells for a decent
amount<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.810> he<00:01:48.869> probably<00:01:49.140> won't<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:49.860> his

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
amount but he probably won't because his

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.590 
amount but he probably won't because his
silver<00:01:50.430> was<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.299> overpowered<00:01:52.310> but

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600
