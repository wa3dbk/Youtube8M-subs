 Europe 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.990
 ghislain hello a novelty of 5.25 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.860
 which is aimed at a segment of customers 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.010
 much more important 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.930
 absolutely the idea was to expand 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.900
 handle it the flagship of the brand 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.970
 who was until then it's going the design 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.210
 5.25 was exclusively for 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.700
 products equipped with a motor of 6 125 cm 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.010
 who were positioned on a price 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.650
 about 7500 euros and so bah on 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.370
 offer we offer this design and who says 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.930
 flagship for us for the brand 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.290
 with a 500 engine and we position ourselves 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.100
 between 5400 euros and 5900 euros but 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.140
 public ttc 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.070
 thank you congratulations for this great initiative 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.040
 we wish you all the success you 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.110
 deserve I'm with joël 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.620
 bontoux I 'm going the new reese liters 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.479
 is misleading 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.830
 an aesthetic we know young people the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.990
 mechanical organs have evolved well and 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.280
 obviously so the management was 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.900
 fully seen so a lot more of 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.030
 couple at low speed a lot more than 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.750
 high power consumption 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.170
 downward reviews 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.970
 between 15 and 20% so we also have a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.670
 wider way so original the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.000
 triangles are enlarged so a lot 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.860
 more stability of comfort like 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.490
 suspension suspensions level 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.100
 journals 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.230
 we also at the noise level we have 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.940
 a much lower sound so 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.590
 which is much less aggressive for 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.270
 ears 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.280
 we also have a lot of small 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.900
 changes at the management level 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.940
 assisted which is much more 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.620
 progressive than in the past so 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.480
 much more flexible at low speed 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.000
 a lot easier a lot more 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.170
 accurate and it hardens a lot more 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.590
 at high speed to have a perfect 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.910
 stability 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.500
 that's what makes me play we 're going 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.080
 try it go let's go we're gone 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.000
 thank you go to my side julien fat 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.200

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.750
 so we are finalizing this 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.239
 competition program here on this 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.620
 vehicle so everything has been reviewed for for 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.959

 the rolling parts part 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.180
 wheels with the rims 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.310
 recorders all one 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.689
 a suspension system and the case a 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.640
 exhaust line 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.810
 complete and then a whole job on the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.010
 engine that's going to be done to make it 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.959
 even more powerful even more 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.670
 effective and put it where it needs to be 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.189

 smashing magali of a big 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.450
 engine that already the results are there 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.659
 to attest to this 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.879
 and we are very successful we are on 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.370
 300 units sold so since mid

 we already have more than 300 units 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.760
 those of 700 so the biggest since 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.790
 with good accessory positions 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.889
 especially for the big fighter he 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.109
 is equipped with serial so there is really 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.820
 a desire to put forward no 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.739
 only the driver equipment but 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.269
 also of the passage and so everything is done 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.530
 for the comfort of the vehicle while hiking 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:28.680

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.419
 thank you magali at canam with bertrand 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.330
 bertrand the novelty last year 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.430
 it was the 1000 honor this year in 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.080
 2014 we fit with a cubic capacity a 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.860
 little bit inferior that fits a 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.750
 little more at the market 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.590
 so this year we come on a 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.930
 machine on the 650 which is really the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.760
 heart of the range at the quad level at the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.470
 power level so we took over 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.720
 the same characteristics as millet 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.820
 who is the reference on on the big 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.039
 fighter on big machines and 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.990
 today we adapted it on the 650 he 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.840
 embeds the same technologies of 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.070
 suspensions the four gas suspensions 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.310
 today it's the full options of the 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.449
 650 range here we keep the knowledge 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.800
 to make it a little bit smaller 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.130
 of the range and power of the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.620
 machine 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.599
 we have kept this 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.310
 we call the x tp ie 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:18.300
 that today this black color 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:21.599
 young full options he has the counter of the 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.340
 spyder is today we see more 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.430
 in addition people come back on 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.530
 intermediate powers who who 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.840
 allow to do everything today 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.610
 to make complicated to do 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.380
 rolling is very flexible that's the 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.090
 new chassis we had it on the on the 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.190
 millet millet was maybe a machine 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.219
 a little more pointed whereas today 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.030
 the 650 will adapt to everyone is 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.890
 very tolerant but 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.120
 if there ladies and gentlemen accounts 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.860
 restored strengths 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.940
 to you to try the models of 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.340
 enjoy great opportunities 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.740
 commercial and especially read the story 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.090
 in pictures and in narrative of what 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.470
 patients magazine with didier baudouin 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.470
 thank you didier thank you
