00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.550
 Hello everyone faced such a problem 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.639
 on cars mazda 6 2015 release 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:15.089
 that not even every dealer knows how to 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 solve the problem lies with the function 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.539
 connection with MS machine supports 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 SMS and pressure notification process with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 Email 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.699
 what is it that is you are driving 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 someone writes you a message 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 stop that is movement on it 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.059
 work and you car Cupid what you 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.120
 there is one message you can read 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.219
 and also you can message with 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.469
 Email 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.210
 At first it's me here is the menu 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.980
 it was just not active that is by 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 principle so much pressure that is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 you see yes here is sulfur and nobody knew nobody 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.190
 could not explain how to do it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 so she was 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 the workers came to the dealer the diver did not say 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.820
 what lada you know is everything 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.030
 only in europe it works for us 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 there is no such thing and so the navigation map 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 the same thing told me but in real 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.590
 It turned all the way around that for this 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.440
 I had to do it all now 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.080
 will show when we connect the phone 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.049
 here we have bluetooth you will see 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.789
 mazda machine 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.009
 go here and you need to put this 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.350
 tick pressure indicators initially 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.000
 Now she does not worth it to us at 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.300
 any beads is if you have a phone 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.539
 iphone 6 5 we are four so on no matter 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.850
 put this tick after that you 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.069
 all at once it will work and suddenly 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.319
 she didn't earn you anyway gray 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.259
 flip through what we do go in 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.869
 settings and here we remove these ticks 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.600
 i.e. automatic unloading and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.960
 the download itself is reset again 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.420
 turn back on the menu then you 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.000
 will earn that is to principle such 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.459
 Here you are for example a message with 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.229
 email hello meter 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.250
 left comments that is, we can 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.009
 read we can listen 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 comments julep 2801 hello 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.849
 dmitry julie 2801 left comments 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.310
 logbook entry and drill back and 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.500
 I hoped that there would be good 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.670
 training does not have to spend on it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.410
 before now 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.710
 Well, something like this 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.110
 the same for example messaging that is 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.410
 please enter the message and we also 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.620
 we see that here is something well, something like this 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.480
 i.e. it works 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.519
 In principle, the function is convenient but also the most 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.940
 the main thing is that if she has a car she 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.280
 should work here again say 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.680
 dealers know nothing when started 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.769
 ask questions but nobody wants can 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.030
 read nothing so forth i mean i 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.030
 I hope that I helped someone
