00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.250
 don't walk the beaten path 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:18.900
 place of it go where no foot has gone 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:21.630
 man and with each his promises 1974 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.289
 almost 40 years ago with the advent of not even 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.760
 dragon's 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.280
 I became one of the first who 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 became interested in this game and I arranged 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.500
 elaborate dnd games for 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 his friends before the appearance 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 personal computers and specifically 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.269
 second model apple computers 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.339
 I started to create the first computer 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.429
 role games based on my dnd 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.319
 worlds after 28 versions of games recorded on 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.539
 first tapes i created what 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:47.579
 subsequently became the ultima series which 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.530
 the longest rpc still remains 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.319
 series with the history of cities 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 but it's time for me to go back to mine 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.370
 fantasy dug flank roots and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.949
 once again help determine what 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.379
 there should be fantasy role-playing games 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.569
 since my original trilogy 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.489
 the trilogy is completed we create a new 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.350
 wonderful world to discover and explore 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.049
 give the opportunity to make new feats 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 and test your strength during the optical 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.729
 events in this game I will be with you in the face 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.450
 lord british and together we will redeem 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.520
 new world 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.159
 I would like to invite you to join 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.740
 me and my team to become involved 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.750
 a grand event creating the future 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.549
 the great game world it will be 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.350
 modern reincarnation adventure 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.180
 a hero named avatar who were 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.469
 so exciting throughout 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.689
 last decades 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.729
 I invite you to participate in 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.729
 creating games from the avatas 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.880
 hello i am still roxbury for some of 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.160
 you lord british creator of the ultima series 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.600
 no doubt that the game industry 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.610
 continues amazing progress in terms of 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.370
 video game visualization 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.230
 process in just 30 years we passed 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.190
 way from simple black to white shapes from 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.800
 my early games 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.660
 up to three dimensional cinema like modern 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.940
 games that compete with the film industry 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.040
 since they are interactive and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.600
 rialto him not 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.030
 but while there are areas in which remain 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.990
 White spots 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 for example most r-cube you 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.200
 face stories 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.940
 programmed stories all that 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.650
 players basically have to do it 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.230
 talk to every anti with a y mark 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.450
 heads click on all options which 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.660
 you can click and walk on the arrows on 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.770
 map until you complete all the tasks 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.750
 players of most modern people 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.790
 have almost the same experience 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.880
 gameplay is what programmed for 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.530
 I think they are developers 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.940
 TV series Dima made a huge 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.740
 pioneering creation work 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.630
 interactive literature which 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.730
 allows players to explore the world since 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.830
 they want to make this decision 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.900
 which really influence something and 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.410
 allow you to get different from each other 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.340
 friend 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.019
 unique for each player gameplay 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.730
 Shalamov avatar we will rebuild 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.910
 role elements rp Ms. on 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.950
 we will not try to please everyone 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.769
 we will create a big interactive and 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.090
 ever changing world and let the player 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.920
 yourself determine your role in it another 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.299
 sides we will fill the world with ours 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.370
 homemade stories 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.989
 but we do it not to 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.620
 provide player list makes 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.660
 requirements 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.340
 that need to be done and not for that 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.110
 to make automatic chips 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.850
 which will show the player where and what is needed 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.519
 the player will have to do himself 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.769
 explore make discoveries think and 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.959
 making decisions which way is worth it 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.790
 choose a few months ago 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.040
 when me and my team started making 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 game plan I posted a small 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.510
 the passage which called what should 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.950
 be the perfect r'hollor british and you 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.860
 can read this article on the site 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.910
 acres 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.220
 here are some key features 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.750
 which I emphasized in that document and 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.260
 which are the cornerstones 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.530
 our new game first we create 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.690
 detailed interactive world if 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.000
 something looks like so you think that 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.430
 you can use it you can 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.500
 use secondly we create 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.900
 physical components that reflect 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.340
 the reality of the world despite the fact that the game 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.650
 will be spread by 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.330
 digital downloads on the internet we already 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.290
 started working on creating items 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.900
 real world 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.780
 maps of manuscripts and other mysterious 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.760
 pieces that will be available to players in 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.190
 third, we will not just quests 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.810
 socially significant consistently and 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.810
 I am logical story to study them 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.030
 player it will help increase the immersion 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.110
 the game will increase the feeling that the world is in 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.780
 where are you 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.560
 present and we will be able to study it together 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.390
 not included above three 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.540
 manifesting wildly important things like that 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.310
 like crafting household and pvp it all 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.420
 will be outlined in the following videos and 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.420
 blog news and finally the most
