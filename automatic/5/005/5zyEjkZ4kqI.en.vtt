00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
guys are going to get the first little

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.130 
guys are going to get the first little
taste<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.899> probably

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
taste of it and you know it's probably

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
taste of it and you know it's probably
going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> be<00:00:43.559> pretty<00:00:43.910> dumb<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.300> there's<00:00:45.809> going

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
going to be pretty dumb or there's going

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.200 
going to be pretty dumb or there's going
to<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> lot<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> um<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:47.129> something<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.360> me

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
to be a lot of um or something I know me

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.470 
to be a lot of um or something I know me
there<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.329> go<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
there we go there we go but you know I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.310 
there we go there we go but you know I
figured<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.899> would<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> great

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
figured this would be a great

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
figured this would be a great
opportunity<00:00:55.670> jump<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.829> try<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> see

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
opportunity jump in here and try to see

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.139 
opportunity jump in here and try to see
what<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.789> did<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.329> did<00:01:00.840> relist<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.149> stuff

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
what they did I did relist and stuff

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.789 
what they did I did relist and stuff
like<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.719> while<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> loading<00:01:04.650> we're

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like it but while this is loading we're

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.550 
like it but while this is loading we're
going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> discuss<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.869> guess<00:01:07.380> they

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
going to discuss that like I guess they

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.920 
going to discuss that like I guess they
affected<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> hipfire<00:01:08.750> they're<00:01:09.750> made<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
affected the hipfire they're made a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.789 
affected the hipfire they're made a
little<00:01:10.170> more<00:01:10.350> scattered<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.640> auto<00:01:11.820> centering

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
little more scattered the auto centering

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.780 
little more scattered the auto centering
basically<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.950> shoot<00:01:14.220> somebody<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
basically when you shoot somebody if you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
basically when you shoot somebody if you
lay<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.570> barrel<00:01:15.869> rise<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.560> they

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
lay on it the barrel rise and they

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
lay on it the barrel rise and they
slowed<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> timing<00:01:18.030> from<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.780> coming

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
slowed the timing from there to coming

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
slowed the timing from there to coming
back<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.770> where<00:01:19.890> you'd<00:01:20.100> normally<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.700> mat

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
back down to where you'd normally a mat

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
back down to where you'd normally a mat
and<00:01:23.780> something<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.869> mean<00:01:25.200> ever<00:01:25.409> there's<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and something I mean ever there's a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609 
and something I mean ever there's a
bunch<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> stuff<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.700> said<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.000> did<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.619> I

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
bunch of stuff I said they did and I

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
bunch of stuff I said they did and I
doubt<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.520> could<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.790> done<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
doubt they could have done that and the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.170 
doubt they could have done that and the
gun<00:01:30.540> still<00:01:30.840> even<00:01:31.140> function<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> game<00:01:32.310> so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
gun still even function in the game so

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020 
gun still even function in the game so

thing<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.360> tell<00:03:09.540> them<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.810> get<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> hell<00:03:10.799> out

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
thing to tell them is get the hell out

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.759 
thing to tell them is get the hell out
the<00:03:11.100> kitchen<00:03:11.299> because<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.959> famas<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.530> still

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
the kitchen because the famas is still

the kitchen because the famas is still
the<00:03:13.860> way<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:17.070> probably<00:03:17.370> still

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the way it is and it's probably still

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.880 
the way it is and it's probably still
going<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> big<00:03:18.330> gripe<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:21.390> know<00:03:21.510> hey

gun<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:26.430> would<00:03:26.610> basically<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.239> have

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
gun that they would basically just have

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.820 
gun that they would basically just have
to<00:03:27.600> take<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.350> out<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:31.049> very<00:03:31.110> much<00:03:31.440> doubt

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
to take it out and I very much doubt

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.910
