the<00:00:04.570> CT<00:00:04.900> is<00:00:04.930> actually<00:00:05.620> very<00:00:05.800> simple<00:00:06.040> if<00:00:06.220> we're

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
the CT is actually very simple if we're

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.000 
the CT is actually very simple if we're
doing<00:00:06.610> a<00:00:06.940> calcium<00:00:07.930> score<00:00:08.200> without<00:00:08.380> a<00:00:08.590> CT

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
doing a calcium score without a CT

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.440 
doing a calcium score without a CT
angiogram

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
angiogram

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.419 
angiogram
there's<00:00:10.750> no<00:00:10.900> IV<00:00:11.290> all<00:00:11.650> that<00:00:11.890> happens<00:00:12.190> is<00:00:12.309> they

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
there's no IV all that happens is they

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.249 
there's no IV all that happens is they
get<00:00:12.549> a<00:00:12.610> couple<00:00:12.880> of<00:00:12.969> EKG<00:00:13.240> leads<00:00:13.660> put<00:00:13.929> on<00:00:14.049> them

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
get a couple of EKG leads put on them

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.320 
get a couple of EKG leads put on them
they<00:00:14.889> go<00:00:15.009> into<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.280> CT<00:00:15.580> scanner<00:00:15.879> which<00:00:16.150> is

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
they go into the CT scanner which is

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.200 
they go into the CT scanner which is
like<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:16.780> big<00:00:16.930> doughnut<00:00:17.640> they<00:00:18.640> take<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.940> quick

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
like the big doughnut they take a quick

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.660 
like the big doughnut they take a quick
Scout<00:00:19.450> film<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:20.109> then<00:00:20.680> there's<00:00:21.130> instructions

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
Scout film and then there's instructions

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.689 
Scout film and then there's instructions
to<00:00:21.820> hold<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.090> breath<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:24.070> scanner

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
to hold the breath and the the scanner

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.960 
to hold the breath and the the scanner
rotates<00:00:25.240> very<00:00:25.420> quickly<00:00:25.720> around<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:26.529> patient

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
rotates very quickly around the patient

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140 
rotates very quickly around the patient
and<00:00:27.970> they<00:00:28.840> wouldn't<00:00:29.080> feel<00:00:29.380> anything<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:31.029> as

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
and they wouldn't feel anything and as

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.450 
and they wouldn't feel anything and as
soon<00:00:31.359> as<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.740> whole<00:00:32.860> heart<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.190> scanned

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
soon as the the whole heart is scanned

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.940 
soon as the the whole heart is scanned
the<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.240> test<00:00:34.450> is<00:00:34.570> over<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:35.560> that's<00:00:35.740> really

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
the the test is over so that's really

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.139 
the the test is over so that's really
all<00:00:36.160> there<00:00:36.309> is<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.489> it<00:00:36.550> it<00:00:36.610> takes<00:00:36.730> about<00:00:36.850> five

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
all there is to it it takes about five

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.170 
all there is to it it takes about five
minutes<00:00:37.410> total<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.800> about<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:39.730> know<00:00:39.790> 10<00:00:40.090> to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
minutes total and about you know 10 to

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.750 
minutes total and about you know 10 to
15<00:00:40.450> seconds<00:00:40.840> of<00:00:40.899> scanning<00:00:41.170> time<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:42.610> we're

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
15 seconds of scanning time if we're

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.000 
15 seconds of scanning time if we're
doing<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.000> CT<00:00:43.239> angiogram<00:00:43.690> then<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.440> requires<00:00:44.620> us

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
doing a CT angiogram then it requires us

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.880 
doing a CT angiogram then it requires us
to<00:00:45.160> put<00:00:45.399> an<00:00:45.820> intravenous<00:00:46.270> line<00:00:46.300> into<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.079> vein

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
to put an intravenous line into a vein

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.250 
to put an intravenous line into a vein
in<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.699> arm<00:00:48.850> just<00:00:49.120> in<00:00:49.780> front<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.110> elbow

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
in the arm just in front of the elbow

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.369 
in the arm just in front of the elbow
and<00:00:50.739> they<00:00:51.340> get<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.489> contrast<00:00:52.030> injection<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
and they get a contrast injection and

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.049 
and they get a contrast injection and
then<00:00:53.590> roughly<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.250> same<00:00:54.399> procedure<00:00:54.789> that<00:00:54.969> I

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
then roughly the same procedure that I

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.819 
then roughly the same procedure that I
just<00:00:55.210> described<00:00:55.600> for<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.899> non<00:00:56.140> contrasted

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
just described for the non contrasted

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.590 
just described for the non contrasted
skin<00:00:57.100> but<00:00:57.340> it<00:00:57.789> takes<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.059> little<00:00:58.210> bit<00:00:58.329> longer

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
skin but it takes a little bit longer

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.099 
skin but it takes a little bit longer
because<00:00:59.609> there's<00:01:00.609> a<00:01:00.670> little<00:01:00.820> bit<00:01:01.030> more

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
because there's a little bit more

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.150 
because there's a little bit more
technical<00:01:02.109> work<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.379> be<00:01:02.469> done<00:01:02.590> when<00:01:03.129> we

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
technical work to be done when we

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.580 
technical work to be done when we
administer<00:01:03.640> contrast<00:01:04.210> but<00:01:04.900> still<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.500> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
administer contrast but still that the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.290 
administer contrast but still that the
whole<00:01:05.770> study<00:01:05.980> is<00:01:06.160> typically<00:01:06.640> done<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:06.970> ten

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
whole study is typically done in ten

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.290 
whole study is typically done in ten
minutes<00:01:07.450> or<00:01:07.630> less<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:09.130> sometimes<00:01:09.670> use<00:01:09.910> drugs

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
minutes or less we sometimes use drugs

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.000 
minutes or less we sometimes use drugs
to<00:01:10.420> slow<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.750> heart<00:01:10.840> rate<00:01:10.960> if<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.710> heart<00:01:11.890> rate

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
to slow the heart rate if the heart rate

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.320 
to slow the heart rate if the heart rate
is<00:01:12.040> fast<00:01:12.400> because<00:01:12.730> that<00:01:12.760> gives<00:01:13.000> us<00:01:13.120> better

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
is fast because that gives us better

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.870 
is fast because that gives us better
pictures<00:01:13.690> of<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.900> heart<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.610> usually<00:01:15.610> we<00:01:15.760> can

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
pictures of the heart and usually we can

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.400 
pictures of the heart and usually we can
just<00:01:16.060> give<00:01:16.180> people<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.510> pill<00:01:16.690> either<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.230> night

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
just give people a pill either the night

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.950 
just give people a pill either the night
before<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.830> morning<00:01:17.980> off<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.370> help<00:01:18.520> do<00:01:18.640> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
before the morning off to help do that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.660 
before the morning off to help do that
we<00:01:19.960> generally<00:01:20.320> give<00:01:20.590> people<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:21.280> pill<00:01:21.550> of

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
we generally give people a pill of

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.520 
we generally give people a pill of
nitroglycerin<00:01:22.150> as<00:01:22.630> well<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.930> help<00:01:23.050> open<00:01:23.290> up

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
nitroglycerin as well to help open up

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.770 
nitroglycerin as well to help open up
the<00:01:23.620> artery<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.070> we<00:01:24.160> can<00:01:24.280> see<00:01:24.430> them<00:01:24.580> better<00:01:24.780> but

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
the artery so we can see them better but

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.960 
the artery so we can see them better but
those<00:01:26.530> are<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.710> only<00:01:26.830> drugs<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.580> are<00:01:27.670> given

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
those are the only drugs that are given

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.300 
those are the only drugs that are given
right<00:01:28.090> now<00:01:28.300> if<00:01:29.290> we're<00:01:29.500> doing<00:01:29.620> some<00:01:29.980> sort<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.220> a

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
right now if we're doing some sort of a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.600 
right now if we're doing some sort of a
stress<00:01:30.670> test<00:01:30.970> during<00:01:31.270> MRI<00:01:32.160> then<00:01:33.160> we<00:01:33.340> have<00:01:33.490> to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
stress test during MRI then we have to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.200 
stress test during MRI then we have to
use<00:01:33.790> drugs<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:35.100> de-stress<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.580> heart<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:37.000> so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
use drugs to de-stress the heart and so

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.640 
use drugs to de-stress the heart and so
we<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:37.660> usually<00:01:38.110> use<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.230> drug<00:01:38.470> called

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
we we usually use a drug called

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.680 
we we usually use a drug called
adenosine<00:01:39.190> if<00:01:39.760> we're<00:01:40.000> doing<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.270> stress<00:01:40.480> test

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
adenosine if we're doing a stress test

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.750 
adenosine if we're doing a stress test
in<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:40.960> magnet<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:42.070> if<00:01:42.190> we're<00:01:42.310> doing<00:01:42.580> a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
in the magnet and if we're doing a

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.420 
in the magnet and if we're doing a
stress<00:01:43.360> test<00:01:43.690> in<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:43.960> echo<00:01:44.290> lab<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:45.220> either

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
stress test in the echo lab we either

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.650 
stress test in the echo lab we either
put<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.730> patient<00:01:46.000> on<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.120> treadmill<00:01:46.480> and

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
put the patient on the treadmill and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.660

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
have them walk to stress the heart or we

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.130 
have them walk to stress the heart or we
use<00:01:48.880> medication<00:01:49.480> that<00:01:49.600> makes<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.930> heart<00:01:50.050> beat

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
use medication that makes the heart beat

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.870 
use medication that makes the heart beat
fast<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:50.830> hard

if<00:01:56.030> we<00:01:56.240> decide<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.690> there<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:56.930> something

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
if we decide that there is something

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.340 
if we decide that there is something
significant<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.550> would<00:01:59.510> likely<00:01:59.750> make<00:02:00.050> a<00:02:00.080> call

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
significant I would likely make a call

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.170 
significant I would likely make a call
to<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.800> doctor<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.490> referred<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:01.880> patient

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
to the doctor that referred the patient

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.790 
to the doctor that referred the patient
there<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.510> say<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.659> think<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.260> patient<00:02:03.620> has<00:02:03.770> a

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
there and say I think this patient has a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.910 
there and say I think this patient has a
significant<00:02:04.729> blockage<00:02:04.880> we<00:02:05.420> ought<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.710> go<00:02:06.710> on

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
significant blockage we ought to go on

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.249

and<00:02:07.190> do<00:02:07.340> some<00:02:07.970> kind<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.270> stress<00:02:08.509> test<00:02:08.810> or<00:02:09.140> we

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
and do some kind of a stress test or we

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.050 
and do some kind of a stress test or we
got<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.440> take<00:02:09.560> them<00:02:09.679> straight<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.490> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
got to take them straight to the the

got to take them straight to the the

see if there's something that needs to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.640 
see if there's something that needs to
be<00:02:14.390> stented<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.590> there<00:02:15.890> or<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.640> could<00:02:16.880> even

have a consultation with a surgeon if we
