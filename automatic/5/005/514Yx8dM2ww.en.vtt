00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello people on youtube 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.410
 I'm here with another episode of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.700
 fuel this time is the fourth 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.500
 episode 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.480
 Let's face it, we'll go now. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.660
 enter the third world out of the four 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.460
 main thing that is going to be is and I usually 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.960
 call a world of lava this world 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 here I think it's not too difficult 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.650
 not a single world that was really 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.439
 difficult is the first one who was the butler 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:38.100
 ninja assassin is calm the clothes that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:42.660
 possible person who falls the most 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.579
 trap is so obvious and we will follow in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.840
 this phase is very broad, let's say 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.520
 like this 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.289
 but you can in any direction that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.870
 You want to download, you keep going. 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.039
 of the right foot 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.719
 independent of being more work more 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.980
 next but eventually you will 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.850
 to launch the end of the phase 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.850
 this is guaranteed 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.090
 Let's go a life that he is this 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:23.830
 and now is that it must under no realized 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.050
 which have these mechanical pterodactyls 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.370
 they are here because the show that 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.640
 face this world that you had a 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.710
 crazy scientist then there will be a theme 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.600
 well behaved with him from time to time 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.780
 something mechanical will appear in this 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.400
 phase but let's finally move on 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.400
 This phase was a cinch 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.100
 Let's now go to the second phase of the world. 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:54.340
 washing this phase is a walking phase 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.720
 alone is not much I can do 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.070
 here we just take care not to 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.660
 touch the lava and basically it just 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.970
 always be on the high point of the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.970
 phase that is safer and that's all the same 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.560
 the farm and then slowly 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.450
 Someone feels and can pass from the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.450
 in a very quiet manner 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.820
 I do not know how to stay a little further back 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.340
 in the phase because so you have a kind of 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.690
 reaction to the house appeared some 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.570
 of those cavemen coming 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.890
 rolling over for you if you 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.180
 They really want to do a lot with 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:43.190
 right may be that you do not have 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:46.060
 time to divert them opa opa can not 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.060
 back down here 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:03:01.810
 the bank and ready to go where 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:11.709
 which is quite short and now we are going to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:13.030
 third phase of the lava world with these 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.019
 guys with vehicles are 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:24.370
 indestructible also has a root now 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:29.040
 turn super saiyajin this we will avoid 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.040
 these guys have a car 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.730
 what the hell 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:45.070
 I wanted to destroy this block in the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:50.020
 Ground I wanted to pass you will leave the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.530
 open area hence it is interesting that 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.140
 I step down 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.140
 I'm not silly 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:13.180
 there you want it, it was still like that 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:16.330
 red this is basically doing 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.030
 is also easy if you have care 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.440
 from the top and bottom and not 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.440
 It has thorns so I wrote t 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.560
 now we are finally going to face the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.650
 boss who's gonna be you scientist 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.640
 crazy that created all those and those 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.640
 mechanical objects that you saw 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.740
 Look out if these people in the neighbor were him 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.840
 who created such a thing is a fan is because 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.580
 He's a big boss who has two ways. 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.370
 the other bosses up a lay off and he 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:55.660
 will have two lives practically going 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.450
 face his mechanic who is the one with 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.180
 sure the easiest boss this game will 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.180
 standing by attacking or doing something 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.550
 mystery the mystery no and always with 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:11.200
 The head back to the top of you attack 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.770
 immediately make me even a joke 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.770
 said here 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.229
 I already defeated the dinosaur 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:25.330
 his mechanic now carry on that 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.559
 will have a second form of it in fact if 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.900
 Do not you do something that I do? 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.839
 look low hold down tighten 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.919
 the jump button is not always a thing 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:34.919
 so obvious, right? 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.779
 now let's face the second way 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:44.650
 of him who was inspired by the doctor lacalle 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:47.860
 surely this is the third reference 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.449
 mega me that I'm finding this game 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.639
 first we can select which 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:57.810
 world that we can react to and there 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:06:00.330
 second second place is 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.560
 arrive and circus 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.969
 I'm taking a blow to a guy so 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.969
 idiot as it is possible 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:15.490
 gladly he just had half life 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:16.870
 so it's easy but who's talking to 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.099
 first reference that this game has 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.349
 mega man is the fact that we can 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.819
 choose how many people there the second 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.399
 reference is because I think this 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.439
 game that has a lot of thorn 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:28.629
 the developer had a certain fetish 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.939
 by placing various disciplines in the 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.219
 and the third reference to the 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:35.499
 such a team facing a ship 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.810
 much like the towel 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:41.589
 usually in the mega series games 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.899
 man the boss I give him and the 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:46.149
 last photo next to where it is mounted 

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:49.149
 in some that some kind of ship 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:50.529
 spherical type and is called there but anyway 

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:52.990
 basically this is what I went through 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.879
 down there is domination of the third world and 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.349
 See you in the next episode to 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:07:01.240
 face the fourth world that will be 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:03.479
 the world of terror their snacks and even the 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.479
 next
