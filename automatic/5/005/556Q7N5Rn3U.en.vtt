a<00:01:52.930> fish<00:01:53.110> here<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.500> last<00:01:53.680> year<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:55.060> Bay<00:01:55.329> and

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
a fish here in last year in this Bay and

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.810 
a fish here in last year in this Bay and
it<00:01:56.530> was<00:01:56.619> amazing<00:01:56.740> actually<00:01:57.250> because<00:01:57.700> it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
it was amazing actually because it

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.690 
it was amazing actually because it
floated<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.329> right<00:01:58.750> near<00:01:58.899> that<00:01:59.079> some<00:01:59.430> tree<00:02:00.430> I

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
floated it right near that some tree I

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.209 
floated it right near that some tree I
just<00:02:01.329> jerked<00:02:01.659> it<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.899> little<00:02:02.020> bit<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.409> pie<00:02:02.979> came

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
just jerked it a little bit and pie came

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.679 
just jerked it a little bit and pie came
outta<00:02:03.340> nowhere<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.729> hit<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:04.030> off<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.210> top<00:02:04.450> I

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
outta nowhere and hit it off the top I

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.069 
outta nowhere and hit it off the top I
just<00:02:05.409> wonder<00:02:06.070> whether<00:02:06.250> or<00:02:06.369> not<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.930> will

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
just wonder whether or not that will

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.870 
just wonder whether or not that will
still<00:02:08.320> float<00:02:08.649> with<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.250> weight<00:02:09.429> on<00:02:09.640> me<00:02:09.789> or

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
still float with that weight on me or

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.539 
still float with that weight on me or
not<00:02:10.380> at<00:02:11.380> least<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.739> will<00:02:11.799> glide<00:02:11.980> over<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.280> top

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
not at least it will glide over the top

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.949 
not at least it will glide over the top
a<00:02:12.579> little<00:02:12.670> bit<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.090> might<00:02:13.390> work<00:02:13.630> slightly

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
a little bit and might work slightly

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.380 
a little bit and might work slightly
better<00:02:14.549> how<00:02:15.549> do<00:02:15.609> you<00:02:15.730> see<00:02:15.880> what's<00:02:16.060> going<00:02:16.299> on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
better how do you see what's going on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.550 
better how do you see what's going on
but<00:02:16.540> we'll<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.049> little<00:02:17.200> look<00:02:17.380> it's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
but we'll just have a little look it's

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.610 
but we'll just have a little look it's
more<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.799> a<00:02:17.829> surface<00:02:18.040> proper<00:02:18.609> and<00:02:19.200> no<00:02:20.200> rattle

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
more of a surface proper and no rattle

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.259 
more of a surface proper and no rattle
make<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:20.859> bit<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.130> vibration<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.790> look<00:02:21.970> at<00:02:22.120> lies

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
make a bit of vibration but look at lies

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.330 
make a bit of vibration but look at lies
house<00:02:23.170> can<00:02:23.350> we<00:02:23.440> move<00:02:23.590> slowly<00:02:23.920> hasn't<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
house can we move slowly hasn't it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.900 
house can we move slowly hasn't it
slowly<00:02:24.760> slowly<00:02:25.120> slowly

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
slowly slowly slowly

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.510 
slowly slowly slowly
I<00:02:25.970> remember<00:02:26.360> rightly<00:02:27.040> now<00:02:28.040> move<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.880> slowly

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
I remember rightly now move it slowly

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.260 
I remember rightly now move it slowly
let's<00:02:31.520> try<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.850> again<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.520> really<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.030> action

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
let's try it again so really the action

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.720 
let's try it again so really the action
we're<00:02:35.390> looking<00:02:35.630> at<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.870> there<00:02:36.080> something

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we're looking at is there something

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.130 
we're looking at is there something
