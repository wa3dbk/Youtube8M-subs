00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Young people funny jokes zero here and 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.170
 today still a video 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.870
 yes and know your match against another 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.660
 starting youtuber it's sign side 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.730
 included so this is the team where he 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.859
 come on, that's my team 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.160
 I play with this team has a 451 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 bpl team and yes the things with the red 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.420
 triangle you above that he is so and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.250
 I am therefore an opponent 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.990
 so it's a little different than normal too 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.219
 included from the other side but it is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.500
 a bit of a match for 20 cheese and yes 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.480
 you well or yes it's a youtuber it and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.309
 First of all I thought I had the vision 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 it was going to get really tough 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.110
 he has something from 915 games 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 won and rectory or lost 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.160
 so i just thought this is really the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 trotter cunt I go I but hard bottom 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.190
 yes eventually you will see the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.360
 party and pretty bad with that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 go down 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.320
 but if you could get more from him at the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.600
 chinese a link to his youtube 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.489
 channel what it is in the description 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.380
 I'll take a quick look, it's just 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.510
 want youtube.com slash use slash 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.530
 michel vd 13 I do not think I'd show 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 don't know how to pronounce it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 but his youtube name is mcl movies 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.600
 but yes those links are already in the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 description you can look at once 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.950
 you do n't want to go to his channel 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 him to like this and to hate him 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.220
 then therefore nothing is useful so come 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.509
 just the soup only if you like 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.939
 actually 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.829
 yes want to subscribe to him and think you 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.470
 they also watch videos and not in 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.000
 you only too hard and dislike 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.189
 your pocket here is pretty nice by the way 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 waves roll really hope to play a top 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.399
 for me there is probably still coming 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.780
 a review from that team what you just got 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 I saw it at the start but so did it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 plays 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.950
 after my vacation because I'm going tomorrow 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.979
 by the way if you think I 'm going 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.420
 quickly to his channel to watch yes me 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.640
 he probably had me 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.360
 Friday on vacation so that is one 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.790
 a pity 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.159
 but the way to go after the holidays i go 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.409
 wants to burn off to he will also disk 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.989
 of course I never know for sure 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.450
 because it is all still his channel 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.319
 but I think that chance 8 is very big 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.409
 so to speak 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.359
 but yes check so you channel you see here 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.040
 that you should not have pity that 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.560
 that trend lot i stand has but 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.540
 no less than 1.1 million and I believe 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.409
 he even 1.5 million if he everything 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.459
 sells 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.530
 I now see that that neon marry 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.139
 matches lost and 500 lost 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.209
 way of that is really a new or 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:36.150
 yes then crazy about that much better than before 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.359
 me i never have 200 wish and 177 loss 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 so yes here the video again 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.499
