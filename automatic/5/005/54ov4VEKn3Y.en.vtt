right<00:00:03.620> this<00:00:03.860> video<00:00:04.250> is<00:00:04.340> going<00:00:04.550> to<00:00:04.640> be<00:00:04.819> about

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 
right this video is going to be about

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.280 
right this video is going to be about
Giffen<00:00:05.779> goods<00:00:06.109> that<00:00:06.769> illusive<00:00:07.340> good<00:00:07.640> that

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
Giffen goods that illusive good that

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.629 
Giffen goods that illusive good that
doesn't<00:00:09.290> really<00:00:09.470> exist<00:00:09.650> in<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.160> real<00:00:10.370> world

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
doesn't really exist in the real world

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.089 
doesn't really exist in the real world
but<00:00:10.940> for<00:00:11.120> some<00:00:11.360> reason<00:00:12.099> economics

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
but for some reason economics

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.009 
but for some reason economics
instructors<00:00:13.700> around<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.269> world<00:00:14.480> like<00:00:14.749> to<00:00:14.900> ask

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
instructors around the world like to ask

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.310 
instructors around the world like to ask
questions<00:00:15.559> about<00:00:15.709> it<00:00:16.360> so<00:00:17.360> basically<00:00:17.810> a<00:00:17.960> Giffen

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
questions about it so basically a Giffen

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.160 
questions about it so basically a Giffen
good<00:00:18.740> results<00:00:19.730> in<00:00:19.849> an<00:00:19.939> upward<00:00:20.449> sloping<00:00:20.990> demand

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
good results in an upward sloping demand

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.339 
good results in an upward sloping demand
curve<00:00:21.560> which<00:00:22.490> violates<00:00:23.119> our<00:00:23.359> law<00:00:23.689> of<00:00:23.869> demand

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
curve which violates our law of demand

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.439 
curve which violates our law of demand
which<00:00:24.650> says<00:00:25.009> that<00:00:25.310> demand<00:00:25.939> has<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.300> be

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
which says that demand has to be

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.200 
which says that demand has to be
downward<00:00:26.900> sloping<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:28.400> curious<00:00:28.910> thing<00:00:29.179> about

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
downward sloping the curious thing about

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.019 
downward sloping the curious thing about
a<00:00:29.539> Giffen<00:00:29.900> good<00:00:30.289> is<00:00:30.500> that<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.310> demand<00:00:31.759> curve

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
a Giffen good is that the demand curve

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.680 
a Giffen good is that the demand curve
isn't<00:00:32.300> always<00:00:32.750> upward<00:00:33.470> sloping<00:00:34.010> at<00:00:34.690> some

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
isn't always upward sloping at some

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.290 
isn't always upward sloping at some
point<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:36.380> has<00:00:36.830> to<00:00:36.860> be<00:00:37.160> downward<00:00:37.700> sloping<00:00:37.730> as

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
point it has to be downward sloping as

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.010 
point it has to be downward sloping as
well<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.380> good<00:00:39.740> can<00:00:39.950> be<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.130> Giffen<00:00:40.490> good<00:00:41.020> over

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
well so a good can be a Giffen good over

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.380 
well so a good can be a Giffen good over
a<00:00:42.050> range<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.040> demand<00:00:43.400> curve<00:00:43.490> but<00:00:44.180> not

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
a range of the demand curve but not

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.740 
a range of the demand curve but not
through<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.720> whole<00:00:45.080> demand<00:00:45.920> curve<00:00:46.540> so<00:00:47.540> what

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
through the whole demand curve so what

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.040 
through the whole demand curve so what
makes<00:00:47.930> a<00:00:48.140> Giffen<00:00:48.350> good<00:00:48.680> first<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:50.570> good<00:00:50.840> has

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
makes a Giffen good first the good has

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.460 
makes a Giffen good first the good has
to<00:00:51.260> be<00:00:51.410> inferior<00:00:52.720> which<00:00:53.720> means<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.290> as

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
to be inferior which means that as

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.500 
to be inferior which means that as
income<00:00:55.040> goes<00:00:55.310> up<00:00:57.100> we<00:00:58.100> want<00:00:58.400> to<00:00:58.610> buy<00:00:58.790> less<00:00:59.180> of

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
income goes up we want to buy less of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.310 
income goes up we want to buy less of
the<00:01:00.050> good<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:01.610> an<00:01:01.730> example<00:01:01.850> here<00:01:02.270> could<00:01:02.810> be<00:01:02.840> Top

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the good so an example here could be Top

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.160 
the good so an example here could be Top
Ramen<00:01:03.620> or<00:01:04.129> potatoes<00:01:04.820> or<00:01:05.180> something<00:01:05.689> very

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
Ramen or potatoes or something very

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.429 
Ramen or potatoes or something very
cheap<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:06.880> we<00:01:07.880> really<00:01:08.359> don't<00:01:08.659> want<00:01:09.079> to<00:01:09.289> buy

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
cheap that we really don't want to buy

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.639 
cheap that we really don't want to buy
but<00:01:10.039> because<00:01:10.369> we're<00:01:10.579> poor<00:01:10.939> we<00:01:11.750> buy<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.020> sustain

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
but because we're poor we buy to sustain

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.029 
but because we're poor we buy to sustain
ourselves<00:01:13.719> so<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.840> good<00:01:15.049> has<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.439> be<00:01:15.590> inferior

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
ourselves so the good has to be inferior

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.209 
ourselves so the good has to be inferior
and<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:17.570> consumer<00:01:18.200> has<00:01:18.499> to<00:01:18.679> have<00:01:18.859> a<00:01:18.890> low

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
and the consumer has to have a low

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:25.330 
and the consumer has to have a low
income<00:01:22.899> so<00:01:23.899> they<00:01:24.049> don't<00:01:24.289> have<00:01:24.469> a<00:01:24.499> choice<00:01:24.859> as<00:01:25.280> to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
income so they don't have a choice as to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.899 
income so they don't have a choice as to
whether<00:01:25.700> they<00:01:25.939> can<00:01:25.999> buy<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.539> good<00:01:26.810> or<00:01:26.960> not

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
whether they can buy that good or not

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.260 
whether they can buy that good or not
okay<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:30.159> what<00:01:31.159> makes<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.670> Giffen<00:01:32.060> good

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
okay so what makes the Giffen good

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.480 
okay so what makes the Giffen good
inferior<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.499> are<00:01:33.649> what<00:01:33.859> makes<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.249> gift

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
inferior that are what makes the gift

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.580 
inferior that are what makes the gift
what<00:01:34.880> makes<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.420> good<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.659> Giffen<00:01:36.170> good<00:01:36.409> is

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
what makes the good of Giffen good is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.649 
what makes the good of Giffen good is
that<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.039> inferior<00:01:37.569> so<00:01:38.569> income<00:01:39.020> goes<00:01:39.289> down

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
that it's inferior so income goes down

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.559 
that it's inferior so income goes down
say<00:01:41.659> consumption<00:01:42.590> will<00:01:42.770> go<00:01:42.950> up<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:43.539> when<00:01:44.539> the

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
say consumption will go up so when the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.859 
say consumption will go up so when the
price<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.350> good<00:01:45.560> goes<00:01:45.619> up<00:01:46.210> that's<00:01:47.210> similar

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
price of a good goes up that's similar

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.129 
price of a good goes up that's similar
to<00:01:48.200> income<00:01:49.100> going<00:01:49.399> down<00:01:49.850> because<00:01:50.539> we're<00:01:51.020> now

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:51.139 
to income going down because we're now

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.219 
to income going down because we're now
spending<00:01:51.439> more<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.189> that<00:01:52.670> good<00:01:52.999> so<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:54.049> like

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
spending more on that good so it's like

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.379 
spending more on that good so it's like
our<00:01:54.409> income<00:01:54.829> is<00:01:55.009> going<00:01:55.189> down<00:01:55.369> that's<00:01:55.969> called

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
our income is going down that's called

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.990 
our income is going down that's called
the<00:01:56.630> income<00:01:57.229> effect

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.090 

and<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:01.810> that's<00:02:02.020> one<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.470> effects<00:02:02.980> that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
and so that's one of the effects that

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.830 
and so that's one of the effects that
makes<00:02:03.430> up<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.790> slope<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.360> demand<00:02:04.540> curve

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
makes up the slope of the demand curve

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.870 
makes up the slope of the demand curve
the<00:02:05.290> second<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:07.350> substitution<00:02:08.350> effect

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.350 

so<00:02:14.510> when<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.810> price<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.500> good<00:02:15.710> goes<00:02:16.070> up<00:02:16.360> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
so when the price of a good goes up the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.200 
so when the price of a good goes up the
income<00:02:17.930> effect<00:02:18.640> depending<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:19.790> whether<00:02:20.030> it's

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
income effect depending on whether it's

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.450 
income effect depending on whether it's
normal<00:02:20.660> or<00:02:20.750> inferior<00:02:21.380> will<00:02:21.620> have<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> positive

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
normal or inferior will have a positive

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.660 
normal or inferior will have a positive
or<00:02:22.640> negative<00:02:22.670> effect<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.630> how<00:02:23.840> much<00:02:24.020> we<00:02:24.230> buy

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
or negative effect on how much we buy

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.230 
or negative effect on how much we buy
since<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.850> goods<00:02:26.090> inferior<00:02:27.640> price<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.970> up

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
since the goods inferior price going up

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.570 
since the goods inferior price going up
has<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.840> positive<00:02:30.590> effect<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.190> how<00:02:31.430> much<00:02:31.640> we<00:02:31.880> buy

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
has a positive effect on how much we buy

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.640 
has a positive effect on how much we buy
the<00:02:34.580> substitution<00:02:35.480> effect<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.020> always

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the substitution effect is always

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.540 
the substitution effect is always
negative

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
negative

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.990 
negative
these<00:02:38.510> here<00:02:38.960> are<00:02:38.990> assuming<00:02:39.770> price<00:02:40.130> goes<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:43.000> so

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
these here are assuming price goes up so

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.850 
these here are assuming price goes up so
the<00:02:44.150> income<00:02:44.480> effect<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.960> positive<00:02:45.290> because

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
the income effect is positive because

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.640 
the income effect is positive because
it's<00:02:46.100> inferior<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.330> substitution<00:02:48.170> effect<00:02:48.500> is

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
it's inferior the substitution effect is

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.430 
it's inferior the substitution effect is
always<00:02:48.890> negative<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.750> what<00:02:50.990> makes<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.380> a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
always negative so what makes it a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.710 
always negative so what makes it a
Giffen<00:02:51.740> good<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.370> upward<00:02:52.760> sloping<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.510> that

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
Giffen good and upward sloping is that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.260 
Giffen good and upward sloping is that
the<00:02:53.870> income<00:02:54.350> effect<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:55.040> greater<00:02:55.640> than<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
the income effect is greater than the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.570 
the income effect is greater than the
substitution<00:02:57.080> effect<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.980> income<00:02:58.400> effect

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
substitution effect so the income effect

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.490 
substitution effect so the income effect
is<00:02:59.000> positive<00:02:59.320> say<00:03:00.320> five<00:03:02.140> substitution<00:03:03.140> effect

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
is positive say five substitution effect

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.920 
is positive say five substitution effect
is<00:03:03.620> negative<00:03:03.980> say<00:03:04.580> four<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.840> 5<00:03:06.140> minus<00:03:06.590> 4<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.220> 1

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
is negative say four so 5 minus 4 is 1

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.870 
is negative say four so 5 minus 4 is 1
which<00:03:08.930> means<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.380> as<00:03:09.620> price<00:03:09.920> goes<00:03:09.950> up<00:03:10.520> we

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
which means that as price goes up we

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.190 
which means that as price goes up we
actually<00:03:11.090> consume<00:03:11.930> more<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.710> good<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:15.050> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
actually consume more of the good so the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.860 
actually consume more of the good so the
income<00:03:15.650> effect<00:03:15.830> dominates<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.030> substitution

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
income effect dominates the substitution

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.740 
income effect dominates the substitution

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
your money on top ramen so as the price

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.040 
your money on top ramen so as the price
of<00:03:54.170> top<00:03:54.680> ramen<00:03:55.070> keeps<00:03:55.400> going<00:03:55.910> up<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:59.780> can

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
of top ramen keeps going up you can

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.810 
of top ramen keeps going up you can
afford<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.950> buy<00:04:01.130> less<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.910> less<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.480> good

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
afford to buy less and less of that good

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.590 
afford to buy less and less of that good
so<00:04:04.820> then<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.420> good<00:04:05.660> here<00:04:07.150> starts<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.300> have<00:04:08.450> our

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
so then the good here starts to have our

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.700 
so then the good here starts to have our
normal<00:04:08.870> downward<00:04:09.410> sloping<00:04:09.890> demand<00:04:10.070> curve

however along this range right here it's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.910 
however along this range right here it's
a<00:04:15.320> Giffen<00:04:15.590> good<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.870> along<00:04:17.870> this<00:04:18.109> range<00:04:18.560> the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
a Giffen good and along this range the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.430 
a Giffen good and along this range the
income<00:04:19.460> effect<00:04:19.640> is<00:04:20.170> dominating<00:04:21.170> the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200
