or up the photo time stamps in each
photo<00:00:36.870> there<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.590> gonna<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.980> tap<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
hold and drag and you can see I can drag

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.540 
hold and drag and you can see I can drag
down<00:00:40.320> it'll<00:00:40.770> actually<00:00:41.010> remember<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
down it'll actually remember the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
down it'll actually remember the
position<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.300> those<00:00:42.780> photos<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.440> each<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.309> both

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
position of those photos in each in both

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.000 
position of those photos in each in both
landscape<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> portrait<00:00:45.450> mode<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
landscape and portrait mode here so you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.670 
landscape and portrait mode here so you
can<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:48.360> remembers<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.899> location<00:00:49.559> I'll

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
can see it remembers the location I'll

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.930 
can see it remembers the location I'll
drag<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.219> all<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> way<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:51.530> see<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
drag this one all the way down see that

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.170 
drag this one all the way down see that
so<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.770> visual<00:00:55.770> reminder<00:00:56.219> basically

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
so this is a a visual reminder basically

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
so this is a a visual reminder basically
or<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> visual<00:00:58.230> cue<00:00:58.559> while<00:00:58.920> using<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
or just a visual cue while using the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.330 
or just a visual cue while using the
Photos<00:01:00.090> app<00:01:00.199> because<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.859> instance<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> go

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
Photos app because for instance if I go

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
Photos app because for instance if I go
in<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.640> try<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> edit<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.390> photo<00:01:03.629> guess<00:01:04.379> what

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
in and try to edit this photo guess what

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.770 
in and try to edit this photo guess what
happens<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.760> time<00:01:06.000> stamp<00:01:06.270> disappears

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
happens that time stamp disappears

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.270 
happens that time stamp disappears
because<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> part<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
because it's not actually a part of the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
because it's not actually a part of the
photo<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:08.939> an<00:01:09.060> overlay<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.689> pulls<00:01:09.900> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
photo it's just an overlay it pulls in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
photo it's just an overlay it pulls in
the<00:01:10.080> metadata<00:01:10.500> from<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.250> photo<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the metadata from that photo and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.580 
the metadata from that photo and
overlays<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.450> fact<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> top<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
overlays it in fact at the top of the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.750 
overlays it in fact at the top of the
screen<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.920> already<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> time<00:01:14.729> stamp

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
screen you already see the time stamp

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.429 
screen you already see the time stamp
there<00:01:15.299> basically<00:01:15.780> gives<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> same

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
there basically gives you the same

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
there basically gives you the same
information<00:01:16.830> January<00:01:17.400> 5th<00:01:17.610> 1218<00:01:18.479> p.m.<00:01:18.780> but

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
information January 5th 1218 p.m. but

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
information January 5th 1218 p.m. but
the<00:01:19.200> nice<00:01:19.409> thing<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the nice thing about this is that you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.890 
the nice thing about this is that you
can<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:21.150> stamp<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
can have that time stamp you can

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
can have that time stamp you can
customize<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.460> can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
customize the look of it and you can

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.249 
customize the look of it and you can
also<00:01:23.729> view<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.570> rest<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> chrome

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
also view it when the rest of the chrome

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.780 
also view it when the rest of the chrome
from<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> from<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> interface<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
from the from the interface is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
from the from the interface is
disappeared<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.439> your

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
disappeared like that and your

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
disappeared like that and your
fullscreen<00:01:29.189> view<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.640> could<00:01:29.790> still<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
fullscreen view you could still see the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
fullscreen view you could still see the
time<00:01:30.570> stamps<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.020> each<00:01:31.170> photo<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.040> obviously

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
time stamps for each photo so obviously

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.560 
time stamps for each photo so obviously
it's<00:01:33.270> not<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.810> most<00:01:34.490> his<00:01:35.490> elegant<00:01:36.060> tweak<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's not the most his elegant tweak in

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's not the most his elegant tweak in
the<00:01:37.200> building<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> mean<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.100> obviously<00:01:38.939> if

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the building I mean it's obviously if

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.240 
the building I mean it's obviously if
