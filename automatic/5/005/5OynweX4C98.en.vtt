00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.000
 Today we read William Shakespeare star 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.100
 wars episode 4 for was a new one 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.779
 hope 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.840
 we are in the eighth scene of the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:33.629
 Third elevator in space on board the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:39.370
 millennium falcon on han solo 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:47.920
 a smuggler hatch skywalker iniesta 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:52.300
 turin obi wan kenobi a grid and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 Chewbacca Hans first officer to Barbara 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 no talking role in this scene 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.150
 starts 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.530
 we leave the speed of light 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.620
 and now enter the area in the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.460
 it will all be on display right away 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.460
 there you see what madness grabbed 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.490
 the falcon's flight is ahead and asteroid 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.770
 the course taken is correct 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.079
 and yet it is not to be seen here 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.640
 of a great evil that omen is 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.350
 what should happen to those who are up 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.659
 if you suddenly bet the stars 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:40.240
 planets what's up we have 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.500
 the goal is not the goal here 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.810
 no one to see it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.859
 the devil you are talking about, this is supposed to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.579
 then a planet from the heavenly tent 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.579
 disappear 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.650
 described excellently because he is 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.610
 not only ashes and stones are here 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:03.410
 still there that can not be because how 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.410
 says how should it be 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.290
 destroyed by the cruel empire one 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.080
 million ships are not enough 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.700
 a planet so destroy something like that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.520
 has never seen mankind 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.180
 But imagine another ship can 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.560
 A small ship is quickly approaching 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.560
 rapidly family environment over perhaps 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:38.520
 they know what happened there here 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:41.489
 Imperial ship otherwise followed no 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.870
 It's a short hunter to think about 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:49.230
 Gives me our situation, see here it is 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.830
 no basis far and wide of courage in 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.360
 I now disappears then, 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.540
 I can not solve this puzzle either 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.540
 to explain 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.320
 The ship disappears quickly when she does 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.410
 have us recognized it so it comes 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.750
 equal to fight this fate 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.670
 I will preserve ourselves 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.670
 Chewbacca blocks a radio traffic 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.170
 no, stop 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.870
 because it is already too far away now 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.710
 not longtime this size so deep 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.600
 in space may not have come alone 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.620
 he broke away from his gstaader 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.530
 therefore the leyen is and honors here 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.550
 I stop it before it can report 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.060
 just see he's flying to this little one 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.160
 moon set before he can do it 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.680
 it seems to me we are in this game 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.210
 a moon no a space station 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.550
 iss that the death star sees the 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.550
 distance to get bigger 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:57.620
 that's too big for a space station 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.480
 a feeling rises, I feel it well 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.050
 It tells me we will play this game 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.050
 to lose 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.860
 I beg you a ship now 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.150
 do 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.680
 instead of quickly the auxiliary engines Tui 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.200
 let's get closer but what can be 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.570
 to do that 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.230
 that is just beaming there I can 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.910
 do nothing 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.300
 they are pulling us now in their country 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:32.669
 You can not do anything you can 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.590
 because no tricks no my trains are 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.990
 forgive it now I turn off 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.460
 otherwise the ship will break 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.260
 they will fight me right there 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.810
 you will lose here 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.400
 but I know alternative to direct 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.950
 The falcon is going to the station 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.380
 pulled by an invisible strong 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.160
 they are still in force right now 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.800
 flown 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.400
 you did not want to turn it around 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.740
 made 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.110
 you see the death star in riot 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.260
 commanders now see the orders 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.230
 screaming also looks like one 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.460
 Armed ripple rushes everyone takes 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.460
 quickly his one post 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.600
 they go off
