longer because I'm showing it off and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.140 
longer because I'm showing it off and
i'm<00:01:43.720> using<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.290> same<00:01:44.590> product<00:01:45.130> which<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.490> eco

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
i'm using the same product which is eco

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.660 
i'm using the same product which is eco
styler<00:01:46.390> gel<00:01:46.600> but<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.860> different<00:01:48.250> method

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
styler gel but just a different method

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.550 
styler gel but just a different method
the<00:01:48.790> first<00:01:49.000> time<00:01:49.210> i<00:01:49.420> use<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.840> rake<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.290> smooth

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
the first time i use the rake and smooth

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.680 
the first time i use the rake and smooth
method<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.160> this<00:01:51.370> time<00:01:51.610> I'm<00:01:51.790> just<00:01:51.850> separating

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
method and this time I'm just separating

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.620 
method and this time I'm just separating
my<00:01:52.810> hair<00:01:53.110> on<00:01:53.320> its<00:01:53.950> own<00:01:54.160> natural<00:01:54.630> separations

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
my hair on its own natural separations

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.470 
my hair on its own natural separations
so<00:01:56.230> it's<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.890> different<00:01:57.550> technique<00:01:58.210> all

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
so it's a different technique all

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.500 
so it's a different technique all
together<00:01:59.220> still<00:02:00.220> nice<00:02:00.430> curl<00:02:00.730> definition<00:02:00.880> and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
together still nice curl definition and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.010 
together still nice curl definition and
it's<00:02:01.630> hanging<00:02:01.900> pretty<00:02:02.320> low<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:04.450> i<00:02:04.510> am<00:02:04.630> at

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
it's hanging pretty low and here i am at

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.900 
it's hanging pretty low and here i am at
the<00:02:05.260> halfway<00:02:05.500> mark<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.400> looks<00:02:06.610> way

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
the halfway mark and it looks way

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.940 
the halfway mark and it looks way
different<00:02:07.240> than<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.960> did<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:08.740> eight

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
different than it is did just eight

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.660 
different than it is did just eight
months<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.399> that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
months of that

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.080 
months of that
so<00:02:11.300> here<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.510> am<00:02:11.599> completely<00:02:12.349> done<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.220> it

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so here I am completely done and it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
so here I am completely done and it
looks<00:02:14.450> way<00:02:15.230> different<00:02:15.560> than<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.040> did<00:02:16.160> before

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
looks way different than it did before

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.970 
looks way different than it did before
but<00:02:17.150> still<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> little<00:02:18.319> afraid<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.739> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
but still a little afraid of the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.250 
but still a little afraid of the
shrinkage<00:02:19.520> not<00:02:20.090> sure<00:02:20.540> what<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:20.989> going<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
shrinkage not sure what it's going to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.160 
shrinkage not sure what it's going to
look<00:02:21.319> like<00:02:21.470> when<00:02:21.860> it's<00:02:22.069> all<00:02:22.340> dry<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.690> here<00:02:24.080> it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
look like when it's all dry but here it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.780 
look like when it's all dry but here it
is<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:25.280> too<00:02:25.580> bad<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:26.239> like<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.620> do<00:02:28.340> wish

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
is and not too bad I like it I do wish

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.900 
is and not too bad I like it I do wish
it<00:02:29.030> had<00:02:29.209> hanged<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:30.260> little<00:02:30.830> bit<00:02:31.010> more<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:31.670> i

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
it had hanged a little bit more but i

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.430 
it had hanged a little bit more but i
think<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.420> hang<00:02:32.600> time<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.050> got<00:02:33.290> was

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
think the hang time that I got was

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.729 
think the hang time that I got was
pretty<00:02:33.739> awesome<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.780> am<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.230> tried<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
pretty awesome so here I am I tried the

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.280 
pretty awesome so here I am I tried the
same<00:02:37.160> hairstyle<00:02:37.850> from<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.360> first<00:02:38.600> time<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
same hairstyle from the first time and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.199 
same hairstyle from the first time and
here's<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.800> side<00:02:40.040> by<00:02:40.250> side<00:02:40.550> eight<00:02:40.849> months<00:02:41.030> later

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
here's a side by side eight months later

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.240 
here's a side by side eight months later
and<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.930> see<00:02:42.110> how<00:02:42.140> much<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:42.680> grown<00:02:42.890> in

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and you can see how much it's grown in

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.910 
and you can see how much it's grown in
that<00:02:43.400> time<00:02:43.750> my<00:02:44.750> hair<00:02:44.959> couldn't<00:02:45.260> even<00:02:45.410> stay<00:02:45.709> up

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
that time my hair couldn't even stay up

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.490 
that time my hair couldn't even stay up
so<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.459> our<00:02:46.670> banged<00:02:47.030> out<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.080> can<00:02:48.260> see

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
so it's our banged out so you can see

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.140 
so it's our banged out so you can see
it's<00:02:48.680> hanging<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.310> second<00:02:49.700> time<00:02:49.880> eight

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
it's hanging the second time eight

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's hanging the second time eight
months<00:02:50.330> later<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:51.400> gave<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.610> one<00:02:52.970> more<00:02:53.420> try<00:02:53.870> back

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
months later I gave it one more try back

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.180 
months later I gave it one more try back
in<00:02:54.650> October<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.900> 2011<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.530> know<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.830> guys

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
remember when I swore up and down I look

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.920 
remember when I swore up and down I look
just<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.250> Corbin<00:03:01.880> Bleu<00:03:02.030> with<00:03:02.299> my<00:03:02.480> pearls

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
just like Corbin Bleu with my pearls

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.320 
just like Corbin Bleu with my pearls

I've never made a video for this but
people<00:03:05.690> did<00:03:05.870> inquire<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.739> how<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.310> achieved

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
wasn't wet at all it was absolutely bone

dry I applied my eco styler gel so it

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.240 
dry I applied my eco styler gel so it
didn't<00:03:20.750> shrink<00:03:20.960> up<00:03:21.170> as<00:03:21.320> much<00:03:21.530> because<00:03:21.830> of<00:03:22.220> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
didn't shrink up as much because of the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.820
