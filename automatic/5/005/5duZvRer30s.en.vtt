highest<00:00:20.780> volume<00:00:27.220> for<00:00:28.220> me<00:00:28.460> was<00:00:28.700> always<00:00:28.940> clear

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
highest volume for me was always clear

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.650 
highest volume for me was always clear
and<00:00:29.390> I<00:00:29.600> want<00:00:29.780> to<00:00:29.900> do<00:00:30.020> this<00:00:30.640> it<00:00:31.640> wasn't<00:00:32.239> clear<00:00:32.629> to

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
and I want to do this it wasn't clear to

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.890 
and I want to do this it wasn't clear to
me<00:00:32.870> that<00:00:33.230> it<00:00:33.320> is<00:00:33.440> fine<00:00:33.920> art<00:00:34.220> but<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.060> had<00:00:35.300> also<00:00:35.540> no

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
me that it is fine art but I had also no

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.250 
me that it is fine art but I had also no
idea<00:00:36.470> what<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:36.770> could<00:00:36.980> be<00:00:37.250> as<00:00:37.690> yeah<00:00:41.230> when<00:00:42.230> I

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
idea what it could be as yeah when I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.930 
idea what it could be as yeah when I
started<00:00:42.770> this<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.280> was<00:00:43.460> actually<00:00:43.700> just

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
started this this was actually just

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.060 
started this this was actually just
because<00:00:44.540> I<00:00:44.570> was<00:00:44.780> doing<00:00:44.960> photography<00:00:45.829> before

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
because I was doing photography before

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.610 
because I was doing photography before
so<00:00:46.850> I<00:00:46.880> decided<00:00:47.450> to<00:00:47.980> stop<00:00:49.060> photographs<00:00:50.060> and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
so I decided to stop photographs and

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.380 
so I decided to stop photographs and
just<00:00:51.620> write<00:00:51.860> down<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.370> reasons<00:00:52.550> why<00:00:53.090> I<00:00:53.120> would

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
just write down the reasons why I would

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.479 
just write down the reasons why I would
have<00:00:53.510> done<00:00:53.720> photographs<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:54.560> as<00:00:54.739> well<00:00:54.980> write

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
have done photographs and as well write

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.319 
have done photographs and as well write
down<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:56.090> situation<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:57.079> look<00:00:57.680> at<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.640> look<00:00:59.120> at

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
down the situation I look at to look at

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.149 
down the situation I look at to look at
the<00:00:59.480> structure<00:01:00.050> of<00:01:00.079> things<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.829> not<00:01:01.070> at<00:01:01.520> the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
the structure of things and not at the

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.520 
the structure of things and not at the
visual<00:01:04.239> impression<00:01:05.239> outside<00:01:08.409> concerning<00:01:09.409> my

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
visual impression outside concerning my

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.520 
visual impression outside concerning my
work<00:01:09.770> could<00:01:09.979> be<00:01:10.219> the<00:01:10.429> fact<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:10.880> it's<00:01:11.270> also<00:01:12.259> a

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
work could be the fact that it's also a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.789 
work could be the fact that it's also a
combination<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.609> very<00:01:14.479> strict<00:01:14.840> rules<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.679> a

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
combination of very strict rules and a

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.059 
combination of very strict rules and a
certain<00:01:16.609> exactness<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.959> combination<00:01:18.829> with

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
certain exactness in combination with

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.910 
certain exactness in combination with
the<00:01:19.280> spontaneous<00:01:20.030> writing<00:01:20.990> never<00:01:21.439> can<00:01:21.709> write

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
the spontaneous writing never can write

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.050 
the spontaneous writing never can write
something<00:01:22.450> exactly<00:01:23.450> in<00:01:23.569> the<00:01:23.689> same<00:01:23.929> way

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
something exactly in the same way

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.550 
something exactly in the same way
I<00:01:26.979> also<00:01:27.979> work<00:01:28.340> after<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.090> certain<00:01:29.869> algorithm

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
I also work after and certain algorithm

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.550 
I also work after and certain algorithm
or<00:01:30.740> after<00:01:31.130> certain<00:01:31.580> rules<00:01:31.850> but<00:01:32.140> part<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.350> this

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
or after certain rules but part of this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.910 
or after certain rules but part of this
rule<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.869> half<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.200> decisions<00:01:36.740> I

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
rule is that half of the decisions I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.690 
rule is that half of the decisions I
make<00:01:37.159> during<00:01:37.670> working<00:01:38.409> spontaneous<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.009> can't

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
make during working spontaneous so can't

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.969 
make during working spontaneous so can't
know<00:01:40.909> before<00:01:41.450> how<00:01:42.380> they<00:01:42.590> look<00:01:42.800> in<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.190> end

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
know before how they look in the end

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.370 
know before how they look in the end
actually<00:01:45.979> until<00:01:46.640> last<00:01:46.880> year<00:01:47.140> I've<00:01:48.140> worked

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
actually until last year I've worked

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.969 
actually until last year I've worked
only<00:01:48.590> in<00:01:48.740> black<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.220> white<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:50.979> discovered

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
only in black and white and I discovered

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.840 
only in black and white and I discovered
the<00:01:52.220> wish<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:53.450> also<00:01:53.930> find<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.830> concept<00:01:55.399> which

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
the wish to also find a concept which

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.450 
the wish to also find a concept which
includes<00:01:56.330> colors<00:01:56.810> because<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.649> course<00:01:58.280> our

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
includes colors because of course our

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.290 
includes colors because of course our
environment<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.270> full<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.050> colors<00:02:01.090> with<00:02:02.090> this

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
environment is full of colors with this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.520 
environment is full of colors with this
work<00:02:02.600> butonly<00:02:03.200> code<00:02:05.080> let's<00:02:06.080> actually<00:02:06.320> work

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
work butonly code let's actually work

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.840 
work butonly code let's actually work
about<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.520> perception<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.269> color<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.580> color

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
about the perception of color the color

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.090 
about the perception of color the color
fields<00:02:11.300> which<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.780> translate<00:02:12.350> out<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.800> this

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
fields which I translate out of this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.840 
fields which I translate out of this
looking<00:02:13.610> at<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> certain<00:02:14.450> plant<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.950> take

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
looking at a certain plant is just take

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.460 
looking at a certain plant is just take
directly<00:02:17.540> from<00:02:17.750> what<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.110> see<00:02:18.440> outside<00:02:20.470> when

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
directly from what I see outside when

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.920 
directly from what I see outside when
you<00:02:21.709> decide<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.610> ready<00:02:22.819> it's<00:02:23.540> leaving

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
you decide that it's ready it's leaving

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.820 
you decide that it's ready it's leaving
your<00:02:24.650> studio<00:02:25.069> in<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.300> best<00:02:26.480> case<00:02:26.810> going<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.650> an

your studio in the best case going to an

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.100 
your studio in the best case going to an
exhibition<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.180> gallery<00:02:29.600> or<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:30.079> a

exhibition or to a gallery or to a
connector<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.060> then<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.570> there<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
connector and then it's there for you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.860 
connector and then it's there for you
know<00:02:34.450> forever<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.810> long<00:02:36.380> time<00:02:36.709> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
know forever a long time and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.080 
know forever a long time and
communicating<00:02:38.980> constantly<00:02:39.980> without<00:02:40.790> you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
communicating constantly without you

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.500 
communicating constantly without you
yeah

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.470 

if<00:02:46.510> somebody<00:02:46.930> asked<00:02:47.320> me<00:02:47.410> in<00:02:48.390> two<00:02:49.390> hundred

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
if somebody asked me in two hundred

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.280 
if somebody asked me in two hundred
years

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
years

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.290 
years
what<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:51.310> you've<00:02:51.490> done<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:55.150> to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
what is this what you've done I want to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.130 
what is this what you've done I want to
remember<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:56.380> true<00:02:57.070> attitude<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.390> want<00:02:59.020> to

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
remember the true attitude I want to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.030 
remember the true attitude I want to
have<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.490> justification<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:01.290> remember<00:03:02.290> by<00:03:02.500> my
