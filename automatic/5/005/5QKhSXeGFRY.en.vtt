with this this laptop would cost right

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.139 
with this this laptop would cost right
around<00:02:01.159> 1100<00:02:02.159> dollars<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.969> gone<00:02:03.119> up

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
around 1100 dollars because it's gone up

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
around 1100 dollars because it's gone up

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
inflationary reason because our dollar

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.690 
inflationary reason because our dollar
doesn't<00:02:07.110> buy<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.439> much<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> costs<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
doesn't buy as much so it costs more to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.839 
doesn't buy as much so it costs more to

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
purchase it and to make it Ben Bernanke

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.339 
purchase it and to make it Ben Bernanke
doesn't<00:02:12.120> see<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.420> happening<00:02:12.720> he<00:02:12.930> sees<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349

a two<00:02:14.100> percent<00:02:14.490> rate<00:02:14.670> while<00:02:14.910> he<00:02:15.210> claims<00:02:15.510> that

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
a two percent rate while he claims that

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.650 
a two percent rate while he claims that
our<00:02:16.590> wage<00:02:17.069> increases<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.850> higher<00:02:18.330> than<00:02:18.510> two

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
our wage increases is higher than two

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.390 
our wage increases is higher than two
percent<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> inflation<00:02:19.830> isn't<00:02:20.130> hurting
