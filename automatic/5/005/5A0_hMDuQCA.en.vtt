ways<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.830> do<00:02:07.100> set<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.119> with<00:02:08.299> different

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
ways that we do set it with different

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.719 
ways that we do set it with different
methods<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.259> stuff<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.039> like<00:02:10.580> i

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
methods and stuff like that so like i

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.750 
methods and stuff like that so like i
said<00:02:10.759> i<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.360> use<00:02:11.390> beaver<00:02:12.049> dam<00:02:12.230> tip-ups

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
said i like to use beaver dam tip-ups

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.000 
said i like to use beaver dam tip-ups
beaver<00:02:13.760> dam<00:02:13.970> has<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.269> handy<00:02:14.720> case<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.290> carry

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
beaver dam has a handy case to carry

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.820 
beaver dam has a handy case to carry
three<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:16.879> tip-ups<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:18.319> onto<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.799> ice

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
three of these tip-ups out onto the ice

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.589 
three of these tip-ups out onto the ice
with<00:02:19.159> you<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.849> put<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:20.030> ice<00:02:20.269> scoop

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
with you you can put your ice scoop

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.630 
with you you can put your ice scoop
right<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:20.930> there<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.379> basically<00:02:22.280> all<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.489> need

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
right in there so basically all you need

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.519 
right in there so basically all you need
is<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> whole<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:24.129> depth<00:02:25.129> bomb<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.700> your<00:02:26.529> your

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:27.529 
is a whole a depth bomb and your your

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.050 
is a whole a depth bomb and your your
tip<00:02:28.189> up

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
tip up

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.790 
tip up
as<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.200> comes<00:02:30.410> out<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.620> there

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
as you can see that comes out of there

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.150 
as you can see that comes out of there
really<00:02:31.040> nicely<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.840> your<00:02:32.840> hooks<00:02:33.050> are<00:02:33.319> held

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
really nicely and your hooks are held

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.760 
really nicely and your hooks are held
really<00:02:34.459> good<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:35.750> got<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.050> hooks<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.470> here

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
really good so we got the hooks on here

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.800 
really good so we got the hooks on here
and<00:02:37.569> dealing<00:02:38.569> with<00:02:38.900> weeds<00:02:39.260> or<00:02:40.209> hard<00:02:41.209> bottom<00:02:41.660> is

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and dealing with weeds or hard bottom is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.059 
and dealing with weeds or hard bottom is
something<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.290> deal<00:02:42.500> with<00:02:42.680> when<00:02:42.890> we're

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
something that we deal with when we're

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.360 
something that we deal with when we're

easier and a lot simpler to set that

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.900 
easier and a lot simpler to set that
rate<00:03:12.350> at<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.709> depth<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.160> want<00:03:13.430> because

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
rate at the depth that you want because

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.850 
rate at the depth that you want because
sometimes<00:03:14.420> with<00:03:14.630> walleyes<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.680> know<00:03:15.799> you

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
sometimes with walleyes you know you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.370 
sometimes with walleyes you know you
want<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.280> set<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:17.060> bait<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:17.900> six<00:03:18.230> inches

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
want to set that bait like six inches

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.710 
want to set that bait like six inches
off<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.799> bottom<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> lot<00:03:20.450> more

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
off the bottom and this is a lot more

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.839 
off the bottom and this is a lot more
precise<00:03:21.230> doing<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.799> this<00:03:21.950> way<00:03:22.010> then<00:03:22.430> using<00:03:22.760> a

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
precise doing it this way then using a

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.550 
precise doing it this way then using a
depth<00:03:23.090> bump<00:03:23.390> so<00:03:23.870> why<00:03:24.019> don't<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.260> use<00:03:24.410> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
depth bump so why don't we use the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.890 
depth bump so why don't we use the
veksler<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.670> time<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.150> i'll<00:03:26.630> show<00:03:26.690> you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
veksler this this time and i'll show you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.479 
veksler this this time and i'll show you
how<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.140> do<00:03:27.349> that<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:28.190> put<00:03:28.280> your

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
how to do that so you just put your

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.640 
how to do that so you just put your
transducer<00:03:29.180> in<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.360> water<00:03:29.569> of<00:03:29.780> course<00:03:29.959> and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
transducer in the water of course and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.800 
transducer in the water of course and
turn<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.489> scale<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.090> here<00:03:32.690> i'm

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
turn it on to the scale and here i'm

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.160 
turn it on to the scale and here i'm
showing<00:03:32.840> 17<00:03:33.530> feet<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.510> i'm<00:03:35.690> going<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.900> do<00:03:36.049> is

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
showing 17 feet so i'm going to do is

I'm going to set this just right off of

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.689 
I'm going to set this just right off of
the<00:04:44.870> bottom<00:04:45.160> actually<00:04:46.160> these<00:04:46.250> guys<00:04:46.460> got<00:04:46.669> a

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.480 
that's the mark i'm going to use to set
my<00:04:56.720> depth<00:04:57.050> i<00:04:58.419> just<00:04:59.419> put<00:04:59.600> that<00:04:59.630> on<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.139> line<00:05:00.490> so

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
my depth i just put that on the line so

my depth i just put that on the line so
now<00:05:01.669> that<00:05:01.880> marks<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.300> depth<00:05:02.600> every<00:05:02.960> time<00:05:03.169> that

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350
