00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 in this brand new na you arm them 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.890
 we 'll talk about the 3 to 3 HP rifle 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.280
 assault 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
 red the fallen summaries of this call of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.050
 duty 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.700
 as always with all of them 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.280
 statistics the best models among the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.280
 our rich matches to google 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 so much blue gamers commented more on the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 your jack of hearts and we're here today 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 finally returned after about a month 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 with the 3 to 3 number with ours 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 beautiful weapon analysis you finally o 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
 from a decent computer if to play if 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.770
 to go out and make videos then 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.329
 eventually every Tuesday will return the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.730
 analysis in Rome until we see it over 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.890
 here's the fake we can invent 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.969
 something of particular level and today 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.219
 let's talk about this gun you are 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870
 really asked a big fan page e 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.700
 then here also rightly on youtube 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.379
 as always today we will talk about 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.809
 statistics the best model and of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.699
 how to use it and I want instead from you 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.559
 that you come to how to use minister of 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.559
 a comment to tell me how you use it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.210
 you this beautiful rifle that preaches 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.399
 the use of Franciacorta is a pop sky 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.739
 also the parts and above all that i 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.049
 classics mounted around because I like 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.909
 always pretty strange game values 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.659
 rather we say from old because now 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.430
 I said no so you want to know you 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.500
 new generation and mine too 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.689
 old men like me what do you think of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.180
 this hb 3 to 3 said this let's move on 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.259
 immediately as the analysis weapon and we start a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.570
 talk about the statistics of this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.369
 rifle that as always does not know why 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.350
 developments of this game want to make a 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.509
 especially of this strange future 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.430
 in which there are the accruals of fires that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.430
 they make no sense so let's start right away 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 talk about the damage 40 of maximum 24 of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 minimum then a slightly good damage 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.640
 higher than average by how much 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.720
 I understand that it is so settles on a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.700
 damage 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.360
 we say good really good because 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.189
 however with 40 40 80 120 with three shots 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.140
 of miano an opponent with instead 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.369
 minimum damage from it will take the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.740
 classic 4 yes almost 45 at least speaking 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.930
 a bit to the cause therefore a good damage 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.409
 a normal course and we arrive 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.270
 finally to the key 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.329
 this rifle is the reason why 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.789
 to me at least here is the basic model 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.040
 don't like this damn fire radio 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.450
 there is then developer but why me 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.620
 do the first four shots they have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.510
 given decent fire say professor 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.760
 857 against minute then decent to have 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.660
 a good rate and then because it becomes later 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.970
 senior cia asthma sto hd3 coming down to 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.590
 625 ie gamers this weapon is there 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.299
 use it by force of things in bursts 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.069
 there is absolutely the most 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.780
 clips that you have underneath that ladies 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.220
 they fired a frantic birkin and up 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.170
 fallen you are not used to shooting at 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.110
 end it was used to shoot out so 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.519
 so you can have fun too often 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.349
 I find this weapon that I had first 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.879
 four strokes start to get old 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.709
 and there is a rate of fire that really 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.690
 I think the hood 47 that of the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.670
 athletes and fanatics therefore anyway 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.290
 inertia you have to be careful with this 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.239
 rifle because here are the first four shots 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.250
 they are decent after which it goes down 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.290
 we come to talk about a charger 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.660
 normal is 18 normal for the action 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.730
 normal you standard normal wind for 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.160
 the category then a gamers rifle that 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.349
 it is good in the middle distance is not 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.819
 approached as always too much to the enemies 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.910
 because unless you succeed 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.260
 delete it with rivas charge after it becomes 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.359
 a little bit difficult 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.099
 then let's talk about the models 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.750
 of the hp 3 to 3 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.730
 and here in mass quarrels that is, there is so much to 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.349
 advise you I would advise 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.319
 just what insects look at 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.930
 nobody's robot says it 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.030
 which is strong but in reality I will do 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.190
 also the numbers that is why it is really 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.930
 strong this rider the riders who 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.670
 of the thing there I kill myself of the Renault is 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.170
 at least we could say a decent model 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.180
 regarding certainly not to 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.160
 is a good model 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.590
 and then I also wanted to advise them here 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.290
 live show which is the model we take 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.500
 at 300 kg per strength so it is already for 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.910
 that 300 gun that the thing is good 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.080
 so as to throw away the basic model 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.670
 for clearly the basic model 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.530
 I do not think it arises 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.840
 look, then, let's go talk about why 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.580
 he breaks them because as you can see 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.270
 from the statistics even if they don't tell you 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.550
 the numbers 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.250
 at the highest minimum damage from 24 goes to 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.630
 25 that one who once gets one wants 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.490
 say a compliment to kill then 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.950
 on the distance he kills with a stroke 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.620
 less and here it would already seem up to take it 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.940
 then the knot of fire is much stronger 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.470
 the first four strokes tone from a thousand 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.400
 strokes per minute then becomes one 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.460
 machine gun is stuff 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.040
 and after the four shots after wished for 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.260
 fire however decent the 750 rounds per 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.710
 minute then it becomes a weapon that also 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.890
 street fight nor the fight in 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.230
 tight environments however it becomes good 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.600
 there becomes decent crossport heracles 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.120
 however, you have understood all this 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.490
 pay that with a malus that in my opinion not 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.230
 it's a bad thing with 10 percent more 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.919
 of the spread cone of the bullet that 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.570
 it doesn't count that much and you can't 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.250
 putting sights is really a but 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.740
 I write I would start crying then 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.050
 as soon as you can just get it out 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.730
 always used teach them then I said 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.669
 in ryder it is a good compromise because 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.169
 I will have some medium fire of course 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.180
 primacy as they are in any case a thousand that 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.680
 elements or pif then the crime of fire 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.200
 it goes down a little but we say that there 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.180
 we are as if all fire was given 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.950
 pays with a more pronounced recoil e 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.570
 this certainly doesn't make sense compared to 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.030
 that other is a charger a little bit 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.950
 capacious so already this too 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.740
 I told you it's a good model and 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.360
 finally says he wanted law the religion is 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.610
 a rifle that we take anyway at 300 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.100
 kills at 20 percent more than 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.050
 spread and then say and use it 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.240
 only in Milan as everyone on the laser 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.730
 because I'm fed up shotgun shoot spray 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.919
 if not targeted and all this has 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.510
 however the maximum damage of 25 then 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.310
 to the same damage, however, to the honored ones 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.020
 not its speed of fire then 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.330
 however it remains a good rifle compared 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.610
 all 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.439
 basic pro recco is definitely not a 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.539
 inserted the other models do not see them 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.669
 I recommend largely because they don't have 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.229
 absolutely nothing special 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.240
 avoid the super elite for those who have 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.439
 worked with rough fire for the rest 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.240
 let's say the other guns remain 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.849
 average said this what 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.460
 accessories we will put on the HD 3 to 3 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.710
 then as always gamers me on a 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.289
 gun that I have to shoot anyway a 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.300
 gust and I don't know why but the handle 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.550
 ergonomic and nurture lightning as you like 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.500
 calling is certainly useful 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.930
 why put in a lot first 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.090
 often changes lives between living and 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.740
 die aiming organs as you always do 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.900
 vobis if you need it 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.729
 silencer as always if you have any 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.960
 need not know why using the 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.360
 silencer it seems to me to get it back it did 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.550
 it just gets uglier slower than most 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.860
 unluckly however still remains one 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.870
 good solution if you are a long walk 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.819
 like me said that we invite 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.259
 soon with or goes wrong arms post up 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.120
 facebook to choose the next one 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.020
 we said early with a hamas analysis 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.020
 ulli lust in game
