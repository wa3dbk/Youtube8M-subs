00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 the pterygium is a benign growth 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.170
 that occurs in the eye and is located in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.980
 the thin and transparent tissue on the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.300
 surface of the eye the pterygium tends to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.460
 go towards the cornea and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 eventually becomes inflamed due to lack of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.890
 lubrication by irritants or by 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.990
 sun exposure its growth is slow 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 There are cases where their growth 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 stops and others where growth is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 such that it covers the pupil of the eye 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 affecting vision 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.070
 a pterygium does not represent a 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 however serious illness can 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.420
 cause discomfort not all 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 patients have symptoms but the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.149
 Most common are itching burning tearing and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 Foreign body sensation in the eye 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.000
 When the pterygium affects both eyes 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.100
 It is called bilateral pterygium 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.170
 pterygium affects more people than 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.329
 have more exposure times to the air 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 free being the risk factors 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.729
 main the prolonged exposure to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.920
 ultraviolet light dryness in the eye and 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.559
 irritating factors such as dust or 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 wind is more common in men than in 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.740
 women and suffers between 20 and 40 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.720
 years old the specialist 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 diagnoses the disease by performing a 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.369
 examination in the front of the eye with 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 a microscope usually does not 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.060
 it requires treatment if the symptoms are 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.670
 slight but in the event that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.149
 symptoms are serious drops will be required 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.149
 lubricants vasoconstrictor drops or 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.000
 drops of steroids if the injury causes 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.730
 much discomfort will be able to intervene 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.010
 surgically 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.190
 the operation is ambulatory and lasts between 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.050
 30 and 45 minutes will be taken in 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.610
 consideration only if the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.920
 traditional treatments not 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.890
 they worked if the patient's eyesight 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.860
 is at risk or if the patient is 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.540
 concerned about the aesthetic appearance and 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.690
 that it can bring complications 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.940
 as scarring of the cornea and 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.580
 perforation of the white part of the eye and 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.550
 in some cases it could even cause 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.980
 astigmatism to prevent the appearance 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.740
 of the pterygium, the use of 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.750
 sunglasses with UV protection 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.610
 and it is important to use them even in 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.640
 cloudy days since the rays 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.560
 ultraviolet clouds pass through the use 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.690
 of a hat can also help 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.990
 evade ultraviolet rays and in turn 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.430
 cover the scalp and face to 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.680
 keep your eyes moist is 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.500
 advisable to use artificial tears 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.540
 in dry or dusty environments 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.330
 people with pterygium should visit the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.400
 ophthalmologist at least once a year 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.110
 so that the condition can be treated 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.110
 before it affects the vision
