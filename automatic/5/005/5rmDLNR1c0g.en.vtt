00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.890
 Hi, how are you? It's good that I'm glad to be able to talk to you again, sharing the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.599
 God's word 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.859
 and today I would like it 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.119
 bring to our meditation 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.240
 the book of psalms in chapter 90 in verse 12 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.850
 is a text that I'm sure you already know 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.410
 but it's worth reflecting on 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.000
 once again 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.710
 it's written like this 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710
 in 100 years counting our days 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.620
 that we may reach hearts 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.650
 we know 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.480
 is the word of God bringing light understanding 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.870
 look how beautiful and what a marvel of text 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.580
 Tell me my days 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.970
 so that is the cancer the healthy heart 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330
 the first thing that comes to mind 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.350
 and count our days 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.350
 some people even use semicircle 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.910
 What is valid is not 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.120
 only it's a text that we go there I hope to show 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.210
 looking translations closer to the regional 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 what we perceive is a text that has more complete information and 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.070
 The following is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.970
 Mr 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.800
 teach me to evaluate my life 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.320
 so that you learn 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 with the experiences I've had 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.100
 Nicely evaluate my life 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.300
 so that I learn 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.530
 with the experiences I had 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.130
 and that this text 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.130
 it draws our attention so that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 I need to learn how to evaluate 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.020
 every step I take 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.570
 my day by day 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.830
 the things that I have programmed 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.329
 I even want to ask you a question about the things you've programmed 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.179
 This year you have already reached some of your dreams. 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.179
 that is the case of some of your projects 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.310
 or did it just stay on paper 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.310
 there at the turn of the year 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.529
 I want to use as a reference 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.069
 the anacom brazilian yachting 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.810
 the aec remaining because in a competition like this all boats are placed 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.070
 in the same position 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.750
 all the boats are in the same place on the influence of it comes the whole 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.489
 same rain from the same show 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.379
 and the same evil 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.759
 what makes the difference between the sailor and the other 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.229
 which causes 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.329
 one arrives in front and the other arrives last 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.609
 Why can you be the champion? 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.529
 and the other does not 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:54.899
 they are not all in the same event 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.899
 I'm not all in the same sea in the same place 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:01.039
 on the same day 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.049
 what is the difference that makes you not a champion and another not 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.560
 I want to tell you what the problem is 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.129
 is not on the boat 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.209
 the problem is not in the wind the problem is not in the day imagine a 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.029
 place 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.839
 because if one got ahead then 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.349
 the experience that will tell 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.149
 Look who's missing you and said sir 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:29.009
 nicely assess my life so that or more cancer experience 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.919
 so that it reaches more understanding and more wisdom so I want to say to 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.079
 you that what makes the difference in the competitions in that modality 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.239
 is the position of the candles 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.789
 the convent is the same 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:50.949
 the position of the candles the way he exposed this or not the candles is what makes 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.949
 that a boat has more or less speed 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.679
 You know what the position of the candles means. 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:00.339
 It's the way you handle the problem. 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.339
 It's the way you handle a challenge. 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.580
 the way the person with all his life 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.519
 and what makes the difference 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.429
 the way I deal with my challenges 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:13.329
 and what makes the difference 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.150
 without homicide count my days so that the more experience you achieve 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.769
 nicely evaluate my life so 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.229
 that I learn more from my mistakes 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.249
 my dear 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.379
 keep one thing in your heart one day is always the same as the other 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.379
 things happen the same way for everyone 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:34.909
 some people 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.599
 better in your life than other 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.169
 but it is not difficult for us to understand why 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.149
 After Sunday, come Monday, it will never change. 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:49.279
 after Friday came Saturday and this will never change 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.870
 after the exhibition comes the recession 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.050
 after success came only weak 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.110
 after the joy of sadness and after the sadness comes joy it never goes 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.639
 to change 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.550
 if today you are well glory to God because the mother of the supposed facing 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.490
 problems in life this will never change after the success of failures after 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.289
 of failures and successes 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.630
 after night comes dawn after dawn dawn day that either 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:16.889
 say that 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.249
 always we will face the same situations the same difficulties and 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:26.669
 they will never change the problem it is not the day or the night the problem 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.490
 it is not in the sun and rain 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.130
 the problem lies in how people deal with it the psalmist realized and 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.169
 develops messi comes to learn from my myiasis nerves and learn from 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.400
 examples that I have already had would tell me how to evaluate my life so 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.009
 that I reach the heart wise my dear many people can not 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.190
 many people can not position their boat 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.900
 to be a champion that's why in the world we meet so many people 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.819
 unsuccessful mass to have 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.389
 they do not learn from their own mistakes 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.330
 and are always pointing 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.860
 the mistake of others 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.499
 day less day 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:11.229
 ended up running into their own failures and live prostrate 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.629
 waiting for the weather to improve 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:16.229
 think about it 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.569
 Mr 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.669

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.559
 so that I learn 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:24.509
 with my own mistakes 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.999
 and with my experiences 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.150
