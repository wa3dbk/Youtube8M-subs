around and there's one left and it goes
to<00:01:25.020> hit<00:01:25.140> Uranus<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.619> Neptune<00:01:26.280> pushes<00:01:26.549> around

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to hit Uranus but Neptune pushes around

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.109

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
Bohr so we couldn't have those pure
heart<00:01:44.610> crystals<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.259> Uranus<00:01:46.619> finds

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
heart crystals and so Uranus finds

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.319 
heart crystals and so Uranus finds
Neptune<00:01:47.280> being<00:01:47.610> held<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.030> she's<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
Neptune being held up she's like

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
Neptune being held up she's like
unconscious<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.649> she<00:01:49.710> runs<00:01:49.920> across<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> tries

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
unconscious so she runs across the tries

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
unconscious so she runs across the tries
to<00:01:50.640> rescue<00:01:50.820> her<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.299> these<00:01:51.450> door<00:01:51.780> things

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to rescue her but all these door things

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
to rescue her but all these door things
shoot<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> lot<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> bullets<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:53.130> her<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.369> knock

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
shoot a lot of bullets at her and knock

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.080 
shoot a lot of bullets at her and knock
her<00:01:53.610> down

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
her down

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630 
her down
so<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.840> Geo's<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.009> fell<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so you Geo's like how you fell for it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
so you Geo's like how you fell for it
and<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> also<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> talisman<00:01:57.750> inside<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and you also have a talisman inside of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.020 
and you also have a talisman inside of
you<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.469> let<00:01:58.619> me<00:01:58.740> take<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.009> one<00:01:59.189> out<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.610> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you so let me take that one out of you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.770 
you so let me take that one out of you
instead<00:02:00.840> Neptune<00:02:01.170> kind<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
instead Neptune kind of

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.480 
instead Neptune kind of
-<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.260> sees<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:02.590> happening<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.310> do

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
- and sees this happening and you do

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.790 
- and sees this happening and you do
about<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.790> shoot<00:02:03.970> her<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:04.960> she<00:02:05.020> runs<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800

breaks<00:02:06.010> free<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.430> restraints<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.120> tries

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
breaks free of the restraints and tries

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.820 
breaks free of the restraints and tries
to<00:02:07.360> cross<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.750> bridge<00:02:07.900> but<00:02:08.200> she<00:02:08.350> gets<00:02:08.500> shot<00:02:08.710> as

Neptune<00:02:18.730> keeps<00:02:18.940> coming<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.600> shoots<00:02:19.870> at

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
Neptune keeps coming and it shoots at

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.740 
Neptune keeps coming and it shoots at
her<00:02:20.230> again<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:21.490> Neptune<00:02:21.880> refuses<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.570> get

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
her again but Neptune refuses to get

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.080 
her again but Neptune refuses to get
down<00:02:22.990> she<00:02:23.260> gets<00:02:23.470> back<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.370> guns<00:02:24.610> go<00:02:25.030> to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
down she gets back up and the guns go to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.420 
down she gets back up and the guns go to
shoot<00:02:25.390> but<00:02:25.930> there<00:02:26.080> are<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> bullets<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.800> so

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
shoot but there are the bullets and so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.040 
shoot but there are the bullets and so
she<00:02:27.490> gets<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.880> UGL<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.510> each<00:02:28.600> other<00:02:28.780> shoots

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
she gets to UGL and each other shoots

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.810 
she gets to UGL and each other shoots
her<00:02:29.140> with<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.380> gun<00:02:29.500> her<00:02:30.220> pure<00:02:30.490> heart<00:02:30.520> crystal

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
her with the gun her pure heart crystal

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.360 
her with the gun her pure heart crystal
comes<00:02:31.150> out<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.870> turns<00:02:32.140> into<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.590> talisman

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
comes out and it turns into a talisman

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.100 
comes out and it turns into a talisman
ah<00:02:33.820> finally

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
ah finally

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.350 
ah finally
so<00:02:36.010> Neptune<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:36.790> kind<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.030> unconscious

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
so Neptune is just kind of unconscious

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.870 
so Neptune is just kind of unconscious
and<00:02:38.290> Uranus<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:38.830> disbelief<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.550> she<00:02:39.610> looks

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
and Uranus is in disbelief so she looks

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.150 
and Uranus is in disbelief so she looks
up<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.330> like<00:02:40.360> oh<00:02:40.600> Messiah<00:02:40.989> what's<00:02:41.890> going
