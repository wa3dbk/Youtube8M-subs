00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
an awesome game except for the hackers

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.180 
an awesome game except for the hackers
that<00:02:21.970> already<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.050> they<00:02:23.500> had<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.769> new<00:02:23.980> hack

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that already but they had this new hack

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.150 
that already but they had this new hack
detection<00:02:24.880> system<00:02:25.269> so<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:26.080> probably<00:02:26.950> I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
detection system so that probably I

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.650 
detection system so that probably I
think<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.640> slowed<00:02:27.880> down<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.209> hackers<00:02:28.540> were

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
think it slowed down the hackers were

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.330 
think it slowed down the hackers were
ever<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.739> he<00:02:29.800> had<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:29.980> game<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.250> awesome
