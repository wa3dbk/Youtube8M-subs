blind beggar and you can see right here
it's<00:00:34.350> got<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.620> blindfold<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.559> so

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it's got this blindfold right there so

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.209 
it's got this blindfold right there so
as<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.309> see<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:39.480> main<00:00:39.690> line<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.770> big

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
as you can see the main line is a big

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.930 
as you can see the main line is a big
kind<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:42.649> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> big<00:00:44.040> triangle<00:00:44.850> or

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
kind of kind of like a big triangle or

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.720 
kind of kind of like a big triangle or
something<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:46.860> our<00:00:47.070> main<00:00:47.219> line<00:00:47.430> that's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
something so that's our main line that's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.119 
something so that's our main line that's
the<00:00:48.180> main<00:00:48.360> thrust<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.899> painting<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the main thrust of this painting the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
the main thrust of this painting the
other<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.520> I'd<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> point<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.420> about

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
other thing I'd like to point out about

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
other thing I'd like to point out about
this<00:00:51.840> composition<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.699> series<00:00:54.030> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
this composition is the series of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.729 
this composition is the series of
triangles<00:00:54.690> he<00:00:54.989> has<00:00:55.140> going

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
triangles he has going

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.189 
triangles he has going
so<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.820> these<00:00:57.000> triangles<00:00:57.570> he's<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:57.840> three

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
so all these triangles he's got three

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.740 
so all these triangles he's got three
dark<00:00:58.469> triangles<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> course<00:01:01.140> him

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
dark triangles and then of course him

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
dark triangles and then of course him
you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.840> even<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.920> light<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.939> light

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you know even this light that's a light

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
you know even this light that's a light
triangle<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.560> there's<00:01:07.710> even<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> bigger

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
triangle and there's even a bigger

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
triangle and there's even a bigger
triangle<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> plot

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
triangle right there so that's the plot

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
triangle right there so that's the plot
of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> story<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.070> mean<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.490> find<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of the story I mean you can find the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.410 
of the story I mean you can find the
triangles<00:01:12.330> everywhere<00:01:14.180> yeah<00:01:15.180> they're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
triangles everywhere yeah they're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140 
triangles everywhere yeah they're
everywhere<00:01:16.400> all<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:18.000> rid<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
everywhere all right I just get rid of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.170 
everywhere all right I just get rid of
the<00:01:18.270> stuff<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:19.979> guys<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.640> separate

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the stuff and here guys we can separate

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.200 
the stuff and here guys we can separate
this<00:01:21.840> painting<00:01:22.259> into<00:01:22.470> thirds<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.920> course

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
this painting into thirds of course

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
this painting into thirds of course
right<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.689> also<00:01:25.350> want<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> put<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> horizon

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
right there I also want to put a horizon

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
right there I also want to put a horizon
line<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.460> something<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.420> third<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.810> your

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
line or something on the third of your

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
line or something on the third of your
painting<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.250> sometimes<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.880> down

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
painting you know sometimes it's down

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420 
painting you know sometimes it's down
there<00:01:30.409> but<00:01:31.409> definitely<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> center<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
there but definitely into the center of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.800 
there but definitely into the center of
interest<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.210> right<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.720> gets

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
interest and right here it gets

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.100 
interest and right here it gets
separated<00:01:34.200> 2/3<00:01:34.650> also<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:37.020> how

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
separated 2/3 also so you can see how

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.609 
separated 2/3 also so you can see how
he's<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> middle<00:01:39.619> powerful

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
he's right there in the middle powerful

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
he's right there in the middle powerful
position<00:01:41.009> put<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> head<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:42.090> check<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
position put a head in here check this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.929 
position put a head in here check this
out<00:01:42.659> -<00:01:42.899> he's<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.649> three<00:01:44.040> dark<00:01:44.280> shapes<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
out - he's it's three dark shapes and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.480 
out - he's it's three dark shapes and
they're<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.149> connected<00:01:46.130> which<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.310> make

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
they're all connected which will make

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.569 
they're all connected which will make
one<00:01:47.759> interesting<00:01:48.479> weird<00:01:48.780> shape<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> look<00:01:50.490> at

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
one interesting weird shape so look at

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.470 
one interesting weird shape so look at
his<00:01:50.729> contour<00:01:51.320> right<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.619> no<00:01:53.040> follow<00:01:53.670> it

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.540 

you<00:01:59.380> know<00:01:59.500> there's<00:01:59.650> all<00:01:59.770> these<00:01:59.920> ins<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.430> outs

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
you know there's all these ins and outs

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.910 
you know there's all these ins and outs
it's<00:02:01.270> just<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:01.930> much<00:02:02.050> interest<00:02:02.440> in<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
it's just so much interest in the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.310 
it's just so much interest in the
contour

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.570 

such<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.350> weird<00:02:09.649> shape<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.950> put<00:02:10.100> on<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.460> I

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
such a weird shape to put on there I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.870
