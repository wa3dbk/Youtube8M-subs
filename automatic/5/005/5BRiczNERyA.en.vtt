00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.930 
know that kind of sounds like a lot and
that<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.649> sequence<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.430> you're<00:02:10.700> going

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
that is the sequence that you're going

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.160 
that is the sequence that you're going
to<00:02:11.000> be<00:02:11.120> doing<00:02:11.300> eventually<00:02:11.900> you're<00:02:11.990> going<00:02:12.080> to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
to be doing eventually you're going to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.140 
to be doing eventually you're going to
be<00:02:12.290> putting<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.710> together

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
be putting that together

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.350 
be putting that together
really<00:02:13.480> fast<00:02:13.989> pop<00:02:14.530> drag<00:02:15.340> turn<00:02:15.970> head<00:02:16.209> and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
shoulders and your head and shoulder

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.699 
shoulders and your head and shoulder
turn<00:02:18.579> is<00:02:18.790> almost<00:02:19.150> simultaneous<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.049> your<00:02:20.290> drag

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
turn is almost simultaneous to your drag

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.500 
turn is almost simultaneous to your drag
up<00:02:20.950> which<00:02:21.159> is<00:02:21.310> almost<00:02:21.459> simultaneous<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.390> your

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
up which is almost simultaneous to your

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.539 
up which is almost simultaneous to your
pop<00:02:22.750> there's<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.560> very<00:02:23.860> very<00:02:24.159> slight

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
pop there's a very very slight

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.009 
pop there's a very very slight
difference<00:02:24.579> in<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.180> timing<00:02:25.510> but<00:02:25.810> that's

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
difference in the timing but that's

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.020 
difference in the timing but that's
about<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:28.659> we<00:02:29.079> have<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.439> with<00:02:30.430> my<00:02:30.640> old

terms<00:03:18.099> of<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.280> 180<00:03:18.699> basically<00:03:19.660> what<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.049> can

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
terms of the 180 basically what you can

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.780 
terms of the 180 basically what you can
think<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.829> this<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.190> you're<00:03:21.340> gonna<00:03:21.430> pop<00:03:21.760> up

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
think of on this is you're gonna pop up

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.420 
think of on this is you're gonna pop up
an<00:03:22.120> ollie<00:03:22.389> into<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.930> air<00:03:23.109> while<00:03:23.949> turning<00:03:24.250> your

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
an ollie into the air while turning your

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.530 
an ollie into the air while turning your
head<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.699> shoulders<00:03:25.000> then<00:03:25.209> you're<00:03:25.359> going<00:03:25.480> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
head and shoulders then you're going to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.599 
head and shoulders then you're going to
turn<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:25.900> legs<00:03:26.169> and<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.099> think<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.459> that

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
turn your legs and I think that that

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.930 
turn your legs and I think that that
concept<00:03:28.209> is<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.599> little<00:03:29.109> bit<00:03:29.290> lost<00:03:29.940> just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
concept is a little bit lost just

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.009 
concept is a little bit lost just
because<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.359> how<00:03:31.590> off-kilter<00:03:32.909> your<00:03:33.909> head<00:03:34.659> and

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
because of how off-kilter your head and

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.770 
because of how off-kilter your head and
your<00:03:35.949> board<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.519> like<00:03:36.879> it<00:03:37.090> there's<00:03:37.359> definitely

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
your board is like it there's definitely

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.610 
your board is like it there's definitely
a<00:03:37.840> big<00:03:38.290> discrepancy<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:39.129> how<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:40.560> don't<00:03:41.560> know

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
a big discrepancy of how I don't know

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.640 
a big discrepancy of how I don't know
how<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.889> describe<00:03:42.099> how<00:03:42.780> turned<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:44.079> are<00:03:44.260> how

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
how to describe how turned you are how

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.830 
how to describe how turned you are how
like<00:03:44.949> off-center<00:03:45.849> you<00:03:46.030> are<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.239> guess<00:03:46.479> is<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
like off-center you are I guess is the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.530 
like off-center you are I guess is the
best<00:03:47.049> way<00:03:47.199> to<00:03:47.229> do<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.909> sense<00:03:49.299> what

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
best way to do it so in that sense what

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.689 
best way to do it so in that sense what
you<00:03:49.659> want<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.260> you<00:03:50.349> want<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.620> bend<00:03:50.979> your
