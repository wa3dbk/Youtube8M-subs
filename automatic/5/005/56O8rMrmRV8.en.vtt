that's<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.000> TNA<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.530> find<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.820> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that's in TNA so I find that kind of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.119 
that's in TNA so I find that kind of
funny<00:00:39.120> consider<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.020> fact<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:41.010> they

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
funny consider it the fact that if they

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
funny consider it the fact that if they
didn't<00:00:41.309> need<00:00:41.430> anyone<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:41.850> TNA<00:00:42.300> why<00:00:43.230> did

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
didn't need anyone from TNA why did

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
didn't need anyone from TNA why did

you all know that I'm a big WWE you guys
I<00:00:47.820> don't<00:00:48.030> even<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.270> TNA<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> much<00:00:49.430> actually

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I don't even like TNA that much actually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
I don't even like TNA that much actually
I<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.879> even<00:00:51.149> watch<00:00:51.329> TNA<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:51.870> yeah<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
I don't even watch TNA so yeah that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.369 
I don't even watch TNA so yeah that
pretty<00:00:53.280> much<00:00:53.399> says<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.379> but
