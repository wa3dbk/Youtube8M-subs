their body they want the ball to be on

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.990 
their body they want the ball to be on
so<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:56.680> very<00:01:56.800> predators<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.550> right<00:01:57.729> side

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
so it's very predators on the right side
