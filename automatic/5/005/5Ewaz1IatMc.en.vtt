00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.590
 Hello everyone, I will be with you today 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.609
 here's a bracelet and earrings 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.910
 blue flowers and anyone interested 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.260
 How I made these decorations 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 get up yourself take not blue blue 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.140
 polymer clay form two flat 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.300
 triangles connect them together to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.960
 formed a rectangle and roll out 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.879
 fold in half or roll and 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.500
 repeat this operation until 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.850
 we can't make a smooth color transition 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 further add up 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.409
 our harmonica harvesting since 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:10.280
 blue end and ending head slightly 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.680
 crush our harmonica and roll the cylinder 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 do we cut even edges 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.289
 next we have to put our cylinder 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.289
 blue side down and blue up 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.219
 we cut our cylinder in half and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.729
 roll out 2 rectangles and blue 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:37.039
 polymer clay and one rectangle from 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.310
 longitude impose two blue 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.600
 rectangle 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.380
 On our two cuts and blue 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.119
 impose rectangle 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.270
 in from flowers over blue 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.720
 rectangle so that it covers 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.399
 cut only partially starting from light 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.799
 the edges of the cylinder and a little short 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.220
 dude 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:08.810
 combine both halves of our cylinder 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:13.540
 we cut off all unnecessary again roll out 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.540
 blue and blue polymer clay and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.200
 we roll our cylinder first in blue 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.010
 preparation 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:28.840
 and then gently stretch the blue 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:34.239
 and roll our cylinder 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:39.519
 cut the sausage into 6 equal parts and 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.519
 each part give the shape of a drop 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.250
 next we take yellow and orange 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.829
 polymer clay is formed from these two 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.530
 colors rectangle roll it out 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.829
 fold in half again roll out to 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.480
 as long as we fail smooth 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:02.660
 the color transition further start yellow 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 end and ending orange we 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.750
 we twist a rectangle in the cylinder 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.299
 roll this cylinder into thin 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.639
 sausage 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.639
 it will be the middle of our flower 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.810
 collect our flower 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.969
 the gaps between the petals we fill 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:34.329
 red flagella next we roll 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:38.349
 red polymer clay and wrap in 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.109
 her our billet stretch our 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.260
 sausage so that one end 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.769
 was more for large flowers 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.620
 and the other is less for little flowers 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:57.040
 and in principle we can all proceed to 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:59.019
 making jewelry to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.299
 make earrings i took you trim 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.659
 polymer clay 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:08.069
 rolled balls of them rolled red 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:11.169
 polymer clay and wrapped these balls 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.769
 Ride sip to all 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:17.079
 folds smoothed out and further cut 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.030
 flower sausage on thin layers 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.590
 cut both large flowers and small 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.259
 I put some big ones on the bead 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.699
 flowers and a few smaller ones rolled into 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.580
 palms to smooth the joints and 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:37.090
 All our earrings are ready for 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.090
 I made the same principle for 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.979
 future bracelet 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.780
 further it is necessary to make a hole in 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:51.099
 of our beads and we do it with the help 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.970
 toothpicks insert toothpicks into the foil 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:57.340
 and send baked 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.729
 After varnish and collect our 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.729
 decoration
