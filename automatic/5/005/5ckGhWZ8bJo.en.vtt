your elapsed time of your dive and your

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
your elapsed time of your dive and your
maximum<00:01:12.600> depth<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:15.290> basically<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> did

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
maximum depth and basically what I did

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.310 
maximum depth and basically what I did
was<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.369> took<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> soda<00:01:17.820> bottle<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
was I just took a soda bottle and I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.070 
was I just took a soda bottle and I
hooked<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:20.100> bicycle<00:01:20.909> pump<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
hooked up a bicycle pump to it to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620 
hooked up a bicycle pump to it to
simulate<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> pressurize<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
simulate you know to pressurize it and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.950 
simulate you know to pressurize it and
simulate<00:01:25.439> water<00:01:25.590> pressure<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.310> dive<00:01:26.960> so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
simulate water pressure and a dive so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
simulate water pressure and a dive so
that's<00:01:28.860> basically<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:29.369> doing<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.670> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that's basically what I'm doing is just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120 
that's basically what I'm doing is just
pumping<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.470> pumping<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.560> bottle<00:01:31.890> full<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
pumping this pumping this bottle full of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.990 
pumping this pumping this bottle full of
air

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
air

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
air
you'll<00:01:33.420> hear<00:01:33.630> two<00:01:33.869> alarms<00:01:35.150> throughout<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you'll hear two alarms throughout the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
you'll hear two alarms throughout the
course<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.780> video<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> ascent

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
course of this video one is the ascent

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.850 
course of this video one is the ascent
rate<00:01:38.070> alarm<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:39.000> tells<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> you're

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
rate alarm which tells you that you're

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.889 
rate alarm which tells you that you're
ascending<00:01:41.159> too<00:01:41.430> quickly<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> let<00:01:42.750> air

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
ascending too quickly and when I let air

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.999 
ascending too quickly and when I let air
out<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> bottle<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.560> you'll<00:01:43.680> see<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
out of the bottle and you'll see that

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.289 
out of the bottle and you'll see that
and<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> second<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.759> depth<00:01:47.759> alarm<00:01:48.060> which

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and the second is the depth alarm which

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.719 
and the second is the depth alarm which
I've<00:01:48.450> set<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.659> 60<00:01:49.140> feet<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.520> just

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I've set for 60 feet so there we just

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.539 
I've set for 60 feet so there we just
hit<00:01:50.880> 60<00:01:51.240> feet<00:01:51.450> 60<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.860> start<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.369> see

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
hit 60 feet 60 to see you start you see

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.380 
hit 60 feet 60 to see you start you see
the<00:01:53.729> death<00:01:53.939> floor<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.450> hitting<00:01:54.720> hitting

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
the death floor I'm just hitting hitting

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.270 
the death floor I'm just hitting hitting
and<00:01:56.659> that's<00:01:57.259> got<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.439> different<00:01:57.799> tone<00:01:58.009> which

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
and that's got a different tone which

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.160 
and that's got a different tone which
you<00:01:58.399> can<00:01:58.549> hear<00:01:58.880> from<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.570> ascent<00:01:59.899> raid<00:02:00.020> alarm

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
you can hear from the ascent raid alarm

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.450 
you can hear from the ascent raid alarm
which<00:02:00.439> is<00:02:00.560> happening<00:02:00.890> now<00:02:01.009> there's<00:02:01.310> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
which is happening now there's the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.800 
which is happening now there's the
ascent<00:02:01.670> rate<00:02:01.729> telling<00:02:02.240> us<00:02:02.329> to<00:02:02.450> slow<00:02:02.659> down

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
ascent rate telling us to slow down

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.919 
ascent rate telling us to slow down
we're<00:02:03.049> ascending<00:02:03.649> too<00:02:03.859> quickly<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.479> those<00:02:05.810> are

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
we're ascending too quickly so those are

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.770 
we're ascending too quickly so those are
the<00:02:05.990> two<00:02:06.140> alarms<00:02:06.500> I'll<00:02:06.649> hear<00:02:07.420> okay<00:02:08.420> right<00:02:08.629> in

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the two alarms I'll hear okay right in

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.930 
the two alarms I'll hear okay right in
here<00:02:08.929> as<00:02:08.989> we<00:02:09.110> get<00:02:09.289> again<00:02:10.099> to<00:02:10.250> 60<00:02:10.550> feet<00:02:10.700> you'll

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
here as we get again to 60 feet you'll

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:21.339 
here as we get again to 60 feet you'll
hear<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.349> depth<00:02:12.349> one<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:12.830> up<00:02:15.640> 67<00:02:16.640> 66<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.260> you

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
hear the depth one go up 67 66 and you

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.339 
hear the depth one go up 67 66 and you
can<00:02:21.500> cancel<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.010> by<00:02:22.879> hitting<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.629> believe

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
can cancel that by hitting I believe

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.089 
can cancel that by hitting I believe
it's<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.830> upper<00:02:25.099> right<00:02:25.250> hand<00:02:25.280> button<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:27.230> and

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
it's the upper right hand button but and

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.809 
it's the upper right hand button but and
then<00:02:28.370> here's<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.700> ascent<00:02:28.970> rate<00:02:29.030> alarm<00:02:29.420> again

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
then here's the ascent rate alarm again

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.910 
then here's the ascent rate alarm again
and<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.000> now<00:02:32.180> we<00:02:32.239> start<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.110> think<00:02:33.709> we're<00:02:33.829> gonna

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
and so now we start I think we're gonna

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.259 
and so now we start I think we're gonna
begin<00:02:34.130> our<00:02:34.310> descent<00:02:34.819> now<00:02:36.549> I'm<00:02:37.549> gonna<00:02:37.880> let<00:02:38.120> air

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
begin our descent now I'm gonna let air

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.800 
begin our descent now I'm gonna let air
out<00:02:38.299> of<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> bottle<00:02:38.989> slowly<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.700> try<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.000> try

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
out of the bottle slowly to try to try

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.650 
out of the bottle slowly to try to try
to<00:02:41.870> simulate<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.319> real<00:02:42.769> ascent<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:45.370> what<00:02:46.370> I

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
to simulate a real ascent and what I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.600 
to simulate a real ascent and what I
think<00:02:47.660> I'm<00:02:47.810> noticing<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.069> little

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
think I'm noticing is that the little

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.059 
think I'm noticing is that the little
orange<00:02:49.819> hand<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.239> shows<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.629> depth<00:02:51.069> is

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
orange hand that shows the depth is

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.650 
orange hand that shows the depth is
recording<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.790> maximum<00:02:53.299> depth<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
recording the maximum depth and then the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.430 
recording the maximum depth and then the
display<00:02:56.660> screen<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.079> showing<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
display screen is showing you the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.470 
display screen is showing you the
current<00:02:57.680> depth<00:02:58.069> because<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:58.970> doesn't<00:02:59.299> look

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
current depth because it doesn't look

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.860 
current depth because it doesn't look
like<00:02:59.859> the<00:03:00.859> little<00:03:01.549> orange<00:03:01.880> hand<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.660> gonna

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
like the little orange hand is gonna

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.660 
like the little orange hand is gonna
move<00:03:03.170> as<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:03.980> ascent

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
move as we ascent

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.970 
move as we ascent
let's<00:03:05.359> see<00:03:05.569> what<00:03:05.720> happens<00:03:06.079> here<00:03:08.859> yeah<00:03:09.859> I'm

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
let's see what happens here yeah I'm

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.750 
let's see what happens here yeah I'm
pretty<00:03:10.160> sure

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
pretty sure

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.000 
pretty sure
showing<00:03:11.359> 49<00:03:11.810> feet<00:03:13.000> or<00:03:14.000> ei<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.769> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
showing 49 feet or ei and and the and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.830 
showing 49 feet or ei and and the and
the<00:03:16.220> small<00:03:16.519> hand<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.940> still<00:03:17.120> showing<00:03:17.359> us<00:03:17.540> above

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
the small hand is still showing us above

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.920 
the small hand is still showing us above
60<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.940> again<00:03:20.180> we're<00:03:20.299> hitting<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.630> ascent

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
60 and again we're hitting the ascent

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.440 
60 and again we're hitting the ascent
right<00:03:21.109> along<00:03:21.859> here<00:03:24.010> current<00:03:25.010> time<00:03:25.239> 236<00:03:26.239> and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
right along here current time 236 and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.259 
right along here current time 236 and
you<00:03:26.540> can<00:03:26.660> see<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:28.519> elapsed<00:03:28.940> time<00:03:28.970> is

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
you can see that the elapsed time is

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.210 
you can see that the elapsed time is
also<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.989> big<00:03:30.169> orange<00:03:30.560> head<00:03:30.859> showing<00:03:31.069> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
also the big orange head showing the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.940 
also the big orange head showing the
elapsed<00:03:31.519> time<00:03:31.549> which<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:31.910> now<00:03:32.060> 6<00:03:32.500> 6<00:03:33.500> minutes<00:03:33.829> or

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
elapsed time which is now 6 6 minutes or

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.479 
elapsed time which is now 6 6 minutes or
so<00:03:34.069> into<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.400> dive

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
so into the dive

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.759 
so into the dive
40<00:03:37.489> feet<00:03:37.640> 39<00:03:38.390> as<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.379> sent<00:03:39.620> alarm<00:03:41.470> small<00:03:42.470> hand

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
40 feet 39 as a sent alarm small hand

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.240 
40 feet 39 as a sent alarm small hand
still<00:03:43.190> above<00:03:43.730> sixty<00:03:44.209> feet<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.739> believe

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
still above sixty feet so I believe

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.759 
still above sixty feet so I believe
that's<00:03:46.489> that's<00:03:46.819> gonna<00:03:47.000> show<00:03:47.209> maximum<00:03:47.720> depth

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.410 

thirty-two<00:03:51.769> feet<00:03:51.800> it's<00:03:52.580> it's<00:03:52.910> really<00:03:53.090> hard<00:03:53.330> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
thirty-two feet it's it's really hard to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.729 
thirty-two feet it's it's really hard to
let<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.720> air<00:03:53.840> out<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:53.989> this<00:03:54.170> thing<00:03:54.349> slowly

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
let the air out of this thing slowly

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.339 
let the air out of this thing slowly
enough<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:55.099> to<00:03:55.610> simulate<00:03:55.849> a<00:03:56.060> real<00:03:56.239> dive<00:03:59.349> you

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
enough to to simulate a real dive you

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.259 
enough to to simulate a real dive you
can<00:04:00.530> see<00:04:00.709> writing<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.220> they<00:04:01.849> sent<00:04:02.120> right

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
can see writing that they sent right

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.860 
can see writing that they sent right
alarm<00:04:02.480> they're<00:04:02.720> continually<00:04:04.720> okay<00:04:05.720> I'm<00:04:05.780> gonna

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
alarm they're continually okay I'm gonna

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.390 
alarm they're continually okay I'm gonna
speed<00:04:06.140> things<00:04:06.379> up<00:04:06.530> here<00:04:06.769> for<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.010> rest<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
speed things up here for the rest of the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.240 
speed things up here for the rest of the
ascent<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:08.420> can<00:04:08.569> see<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.840> depth<00:04:09.019> gauge<00:04:09.250> on

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
ascent you can see the depth gauge on

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.370 
ascent you can see the depth gauge on
the<00:04:10.760> orange<00:04:11.060> hand<00:04:11.239> is<00:04:11.329> still<00:04:11.540> showing<00:04:11.750> over<00:04:12.019> 60

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
the orange hand is still showing over 60

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.860 
the orange hand is still showing over 60
feet<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:12.860> maximum<00:04:13.340> depth<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:14.120> we<00:04:14.390> hit<00:04:14.690> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
feet so maximum depth and we hit the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.569 
feet so maximum depth and we hit the
ascent<00:04:15.200> rate<00:04:15.260> alarm<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.709> couple<00:04:15.920> times<00:04:16.130> as<00:04:16.430> we

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
ascent rate alarm a couple times as we

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.080 
ascent rate alarm a couple times as we
head<00:04:16.790> back<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.060> zero<00:04:18.400> okay<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.820> rig<00:04:19.970> I

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
head back to zero okay this is the rig I

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.360 
head back to zero okay this is the rig I
built<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.930> can<00:04:21.109> see<00:04:21.650> me<00:04:21.829> taking<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
built and you can see me taking the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.070 
built and you can see me taking the
watch<00:04:22.520> out<00:04:22.760> of<00:04:22.820> there<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.690> what<00:04:23.900> you'll<00:04:24.020> see

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
watch out of there so what you'll see

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.540 
watch out of there so what you'll see
here<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.440> what<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.830> watch<00:04:24.979> looks<00:04:25.250> like<00:04:25.370> when

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
here is what the watch looks like when

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.120 
here is what the watch looks like when
you<00:04:25.669> return<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.150> surface<00:04:26.860> it'll<00:04:27.860> be<00:04:27.979> in

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
you return to the surface it'll be in

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.490 
you return to the surface it'll be in
something<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.940> I'm<00:04:29.479> calling<00:04:29.780> shallow<00:04:30.169> water

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
something that I'm calling shallow water

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.860 
something that I'm calling shallow water
mode<00:04:30.770> where<00:04:31.490> it's<00:04:31.789> sort<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.330> still<00:04:32.539> in<00:04:32.690> dive

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.600 
mode where it's sort of still in dive
mode<00:04:33.110> but<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.560> telling<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.010> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
mode but it's just telling you that the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.500 
mode but it's just telling you that the
depth<00:04:34.820> is<00:04:35.060> zero<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:37.370> also<00:04:38.000> I'll<00:04:38.240> show<00:04:38.419> you

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
depth is zero and and also I'll show you

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.719 
depth is zero and and also I'll show you
the<00:04:38.630> second<00:04:39.020> display<00:04:39.380> screen<00:04:39.889> in<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.550> depth

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
measuring mode here in a second so there

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.200 
measuring mode here in a second so there
you<00:04:43.880> see<00:04:44.889> current<00:04:45.889> times<00:04:46.130> zero<00:04:46.610> depth<00:04:46.910> and

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
you see current times zero depth and

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.420 
you see current times zero depth and
then<00:04:47.720> elapsed<00:04:48.470> time<00:04:48.710> on<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.950> large<00:04:49.130> orange

to take the watch from dive mode to

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.420 
to take the watch from dive mode to
surface<00:05:03.169> mode<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:03.530> hit<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.770> lower<00:05:03.919> left<00:05:04.220> hand

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
surface mode you hit the lower left hand

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.730 
surface mode you hit the lower left hand
button<00:05:04.610> for<00:05:04.880> two<00:05:05.000> seconds<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.650> there<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.710> goes

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
button for two seconds and there it goes

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.200 
button for two seconds and there it goes
into<00:05:07.010> surface<00:05:07.310> mode<00:05:07.520> it's<00:05:07.820> saying<00:05:08.030> we've<00:05:08.180> been

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
into surface mode it's saying we've been

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.000 
into surface mode it's saying we've been
at<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.570> surface<00:05:08.900> for<00:05:09.080> zero<00:05:09.320> hours<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:09.889> two

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
at the surface for zero hours and two

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.680 
at the surface for zero hours and two
minutes<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.729> maximum<00:05:11.210> depth<00:05:11.450> we

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
minutes and the maximum depth we

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.350 
minutes and the maximum depth we
achieved<00:05:12.200> was<00:05:12.560> 50<00:05:13.010> feet<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.430> this<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.180> from

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
achieved was 50 feet and this is from

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.860 
achieved was 50 feet and this is from
another<00:05:14.800> another<00:05:15.800> test<00:05:16.099> that<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.340> did<00:05:16.750> with<00:05:17.750> the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
another another test that I did with the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.339 
another another test that I did with the
watch

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
watch

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.129 
watch
so<00:05:19.039> there's<00:05:19.220> maximum<00:05:19.760> depth<00:05:19.940> 50<00:05:20.240> feet<00:05:20.419> if<00:05:20.900> we

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
so there's maximum depth 50 feet if we

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.839 
so there's maximum depth 50 feet if we
hit<00:05:21.289> the<00:05:21.380> upper<00:05:21.740> left<00:05:22.130> hand<00:05:22.220> button

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
hit the upper left hand button

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.400 
hit the upper left hand button
we'll<00:05:23.030> get<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.240> second<00:05:23.539> display<00:05:23.690> screen<00:05:24.139> and

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
we'll get the second display screen and

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.250 
we'll get the second display screen and
that<00:05:24.770> will<00:05:24.979> show<00:05:25.190> us<00:05:25.450> what<00:05:26.450> our<00:05:26.510> elapsed<00:05:27.169> to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
that will show us what our elapsed to

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.040 
that will show us what our elapsed to
dive<00:05:27.470> time<00:05:27.770> was<00:05:28.000> so<00:05:29.000> on<00:05:29.270> this<00:05:29.479> test<00:05:29.720> the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
dive time was so on this test the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.810 
dive time was so on this test the
elapsed<00:05:30.260> dive<00:05:30.500> time<00:05:30.800> was<00:05:31.010> two<00:05:31.190> minutes<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.520> 45

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
elapsed dive time was two minutes and 45

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.589 
elapsed dive time was two minutes and 45
seconds<00:05:32.860> now<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:33.919> can<00:05:34.070> see<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:35.150> it<00:05:35.330> still

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
seconds now you can see it and it still

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:36.850
