draw<00:06:55.860> no<00:06:56.010> bet<00:06:56.040> I<00:06:56.250> think<00:06:56.490> that's<00:06:56.610> a<00:06:56.670> great

draw no bet I think that's a great

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.400 
draw no bet I think that's a great
option<00:06:57.180> then<00:06:57.450> I<00:06:57.480> think<00:06:57.720> it's<00:06:57.810> a<00:06:57.870> safe<00:06:58.140> away

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
option then I think it's a safe away

option then I think it's a safe away
although<00:06:58.950> those<00:06:59.250> Bolivia<00:06:59.730> odds<00:06:59.940> for<00:07:00.120> a<00:07:00.210> win

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
although those Bolivia odds for a win

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.510
