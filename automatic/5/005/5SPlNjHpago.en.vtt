00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
card port so pretty much everything that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400 
card port so pretty much everything that
you<00:02:40.550> could<00:02:40.850> what<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.390> only<00:02:41.540> thing<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:42.020> think<00:02:42.260> is

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
you could what the only thing I think is

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.740 
you could what the only thing I think is
missing<00:02:42.650> would<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.280> HDMI<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.420> do<00:02:44.570> have

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
missing would be HDMI but you do have

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.020 
missing would be HDMI but you do have
your<00:02:44.900> docking<00:02:45.410> port<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.890> your<00:02:46.010> other<00:02:46.490> display

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
your docking port and your other display

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.740 
your docking port and your other display
ports<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.540> not<00:02:48.230> too<00:02:48.500> bad<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.820> webcam<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.540> this

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
ports so not too bad the webcam on this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.980 
ports so not too bad the webcam on this
is<00:02:50.990> 720p<00:02:52.480> honestly<00:02:53.480> with<00:02:53.810> that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
is 720p honestly with that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.780 
is 720p honestly with that
professional-grade<00:02:54.740> quality

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
professional-grade quality

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.030 
professional-grade quality
I<00:02:55.820> think<00:02:56.270> 720p<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.230> fine<00:02:57.410> for<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.650> webcam

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
I think 720p is just fine for a webcam

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.490 
I think 720p is just fine for a webcam
and<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.850> speakers<00:02:59.270> do<00:02:59.480> get<00:02:59.690> pretty<00:02:59.990> decently

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
and the speakers do get pretty decently

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.260 
and the speakers do get pretty decently
loud<00:03:00.800> on<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.250> they're<00:03:01.550> pretty<00:03:01.850> average<00:03:02.060> for

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
loud on this they're pretty average for

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.810 
loud on this they're pretty average for
a<00:03:02.480> laptop<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:03.470> let's<00:03:03.650> move<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.280> screen

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
a laptop now let's move on to the screen

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.720 
a laptop now let's move on to the screen
this<00:03:05.210> is<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.390> 14<00:03:05.900> inch<00:03:06.170> anti-glare<00:03:07.010> screen<00:03:07.070> very

this is a 14 inch anti-glare screen very

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.830 
this is a 14 inch anti-glare screen very
