00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
the window love it

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.529 
the window love it

snowy view out the window there we go

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.669 
snowy view out the window there we go
and<00:02:04.929> I'll<00:02:05.079> give<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.350> bit<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.530> extra<00:02:05.950> exposure

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679
