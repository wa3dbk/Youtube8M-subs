00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.509
 this video corresponds to a question 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.289
 that could be considered for science 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.990
 social of the university or university 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.930
 central venezuela in the part of 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.990
 phase test that has a part that 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.690
 called logical numerical reasoning 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.939
 here is the university behind 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.849
 venezuela psuv page and you can 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:33.230
 then review there what corresponds 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.880
 to the science area test 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.950
 social 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.750
 social sciences let's see where 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.010
 are the faculties 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.010
 for races 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.020
 of economic and social sciences is that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.379
 talks about the diagnostic relationship of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 social sciences and their content is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.219
 you can see that we have reasoning 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.230
 logical number as to pose 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.230
 immediately the question 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.620
 in a room there are 250 people between 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.520
 men and women if there are 50 more women 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.130
 that men how many men there are there 250 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.869
 people between men and women and 50 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.360
 women more than men how many men 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:23.110
 There is my procedure of the following 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 there are 250 people and there are 50 more women 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.060
 let's put men aside 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.030
 of removing the 50 from the group of 250 me 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.860
 there are 200 people left and how 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 women the 50 who are more than 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.570
 men now the group remains with equal 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 number of women and men and so 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.790
 As many as 200 people are the number of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.400
 women in the group is 200 between 2 and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.440
 of men 200 between 2 the 50 are 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.509
 outside the 200 are divided into two groups 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.869
 of men and women equal if in each 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:59.430
 one and fifty who prepared one hundred per 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:02.190
 250 250 the answer in the if 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.490
 visit the teacher advisor website 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.539
 dot com 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.700
 and there you can see proof of the model 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.700
 for social science careers 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.220
 there is a calling area where you are looking 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.910
 try the model here and you can see 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.800
 for example for mathematical model 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.240
 but there is also one of reasoning 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.520
 numerical vocabulary for the test 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.060
 of verbal reasoning that everything is 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.500
 find in learning to reason with 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.670
 physical logical reasoning with fifita 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.770
 reading comprehension 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.760
 spatial reasoning and reasoning 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.330
 logical 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.909
 understanding of graphics a lot of this is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.689
 for social science and you are 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.370
 with the key not the correct answer or 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.319
 is the correct answer but not 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.560
 resolute answer as I have done here 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.030
 on the website that calls advisor 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.160
 dotcom teacher the page is called 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.070
 the page is called 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.800
 dotcom teacher advisor I will write 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:19.070
 here the page number because you 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.070
 has the puntocom teacher advisor 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.620
 Sun 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.760
 advisor or if you have not 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.640
 Sun 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.590
 teacher 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.510
 dot com 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.680
 I have special offer now for 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.680
 social Sciences 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.740
 therefore psychology 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.040
 communication 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.410
 and all of the flame test 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.780
