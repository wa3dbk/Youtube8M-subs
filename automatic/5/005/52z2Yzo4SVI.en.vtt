00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.070 
back that off and you can do it you can
do<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.310> some<00:04:21.609> positive<00:04:22.060> thinking<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.810> start

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
do it some positive thinking just start

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.450 
do it some positive thinking just start
practicing<00:04:23.560> right<00:04:23.590> now<00:04:23.740> some<00:04:24.130> positive

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
practicing right now some positive

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.180 
practicing right now some positive
thinking<00:04:24.760> whatever<00:04:24.909> you

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
thinking whatever you

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.650 
thinking whatever you
a<00:04:25.220> bad<00:04:25.430> feeling<00:04:25.790> about<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.210> no<00:04:26.330> that's<00:04:26.540> gonna

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
a bad feeling about so no that's gonna

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.120 
a bad feeling about so no that's gonna
be<00:04:26.750> alright<00:04:26.990> that's<00:04:27.620> gonna<00:04:27.740> work<00:04:27.980> out

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
be alright that's gonna work out

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.380 
be alright that's gonna work out
properly<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.700> it's<00:04:28.910> gonna<00:04:29.030> work<00:04:29.210> out

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
properly and it's gonna work out

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.330 
properly and it's gonna work out
properly<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:30.380> can<00:04:30.410> get<00:04:30.590> into<00:04:30.740> quantum<00:04:31.040> physics

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
properly we can get into quantum physics

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.510 
properly we can get into quantum physics
later<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:32.500> there<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.650> there's<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:33.980> real<00:04:34.280> power

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
later but there is there's a real power

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.220 
later but there is there's a real power
to<00:04:34.820> thinking<00:04:35.120> positive<00:04:35.570> there's<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.810> power<00:04:36.020> to

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
to thinking positive there's a power to

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.780 
to thinking positive there's a power to
follow<00:04:36.410> your<00:04:36.710> dreams<00:04:37.040> doing<00:04:37.460> what<00:04:37.640> you<00:04:37.760> enjoy

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
follow your dreams doing what you enjoy

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.270 
follow your dreams doing what you enjoy
the<00:04:38.330> very<00:04:38.480> beginning<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:39.440> do<00:04:39.740> what<00:04:39.950> you<00:04:40.100> enjoy

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
the very beginning you do what you enjoy

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.250 
the very beginning you do what you enjoy
and<00:04:40.760> that's<00:04:41.150> gonna<00:04:41.360> lead<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:41.870> down<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.110> path

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
and that's gonna lead you down the path

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.020 
and that's gonna lead you down the path
that<00:04:42.620> you're<00:04:42.740> meant<00:04:42.890> to<00:04:42.920> be<00:04:42.980> going<00:04:43.250> down<00:04:43.430> but

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
that you're meant to be going down but

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.880 
that you're meant to be going down but
if<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.210> start<00:04:44.450> calculating<00:04:44.660> this<00:04:45.200> thing<00:04:45.440> tell

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
if you start calculating this thing tell

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.620 
if you start calculating this thing tell
you<00:04:46.010> man<00:04:46.160> this<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.850> hear<00:04:46.970> story<00:04:47.300> after<00:04:47.390> story

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
rather that brain thinking that led him

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.710 
rather that brain thinking that led him
down<00:05:10.070> there<00:05:10.460> works<00:05:10.700> very<00:05:11.030> well<00:05:11.300> over<00:05:11.480> here<00:05:11.630> in

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
down there works very well over here in

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.970 
down there works very well over here in
production<00:05:12.050> there's<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.200> whole<00:05:12.410> world<00:05:12.770> of

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
in school when I'm sitting around a pool

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.670 
in school when I'm sitting around a pool
in<00:05:17.210> Miami<00:05:17.570> with<00:05:17.810> my<00:05:17.930> whole<00:05:18.140> crew<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.560> we're

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
in Miami with my whole crew and we're

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.750 
in Miami with my whole crew and we're
drinking<00:05:18.980> drinks<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.370> we're<00:05:19.460> talking<00:05:19.670> about

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
drinking drinks and we're talking about

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.700 
drinking drinks and we're talking about
shots<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:20.690> say<00:05:20.900> this<00:05:21.050> is<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.260> best<00:05:21.530> job

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
shots and I say this is the best job

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.990 
shots and I say this is the best job
they<00:05:21.770> never<00:05:22.100> told<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.430> about<00:05:22.460> in<00:05:22.760> school

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
they never told you about in school

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.440 
they never told you about in school
mm-hmm<00:05:24.430> it's<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.550> best<00:05:25.790> job<00:05:25.880> they<00:05:26.180> never<00:05:26.330> told

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450
