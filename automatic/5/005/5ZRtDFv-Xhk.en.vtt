00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.570 

I<00:03:02.710> think<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.920> guys<00:03:04.070> can<00:03:04.250> see<00:03:04.400> for

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.400 
I think that you guys can see for
yourself<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:04.970> even<00:03:05.510> though<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:06.080> guitar

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
yourself that even though this guitar

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.570 
yourself that even though this guitar
has<00:03:06.560> gone<00:03:06.740> through<00:03:06.920> an<00:03:06.980> axe<00:03:07.130> effects<00:03:07.430> too

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
has gone through an axe effects too

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.100 
has gone through an axe effects too
which<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.850> what<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.030> used<00:03:08.270> earlier<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.960> play

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
which is what I used earlier in the play

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.900 
which is what I used earlier in the play
through<00:03:09.380> part<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.130> video<00:03:10.490> this<00:03:10.760> guitar

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
through part of this video this guitar

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.300 
through part of this video this guitar
kicks<00:03:11.300> ass<00:03:11.480> with<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.870> tube<00:03:12.260> amp<00:03:12.440> as<00:03:12.680> well<00:03:13.040> and

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
kicks ass with the tube amp as well and

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.950 
kicks ass with the tube amp as well and
thankfully<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.700> think<00:03:13.910> it's<00:03:14.060> largely<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.780> part

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
thankfully I think it's largely in part

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.840 
thankfully I think it's largely in part
to<00:03:15.080> these<00:03:15.260> amazing<00:03:15.620> Lundgren<00:03:16.130> m6<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:16.640> I'm<00:03:16.790> a

Lundgren's<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.960> think<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.380> guitars<00:04:13.710> made

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
Lundgren's I think that the guitars made

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.800 
Lundgren's I think that the guitars made
super<00:04:14.400> well<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.850> honestly<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.360> think<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:15.690> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
super well and honestly I think that the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.420 
super well and honestly I think that the
weight<00:04:15.990> is<00:04:16.019> totally<00:04:16.560> worth<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.920> for<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.100> custom

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
weight is totally worth it for a custom

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.340 
weight is totally worth it for a custom
instrument<00:04:17.850> that's<00:04:18.030> just<00:04:18.269> fantastic<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:19.079> think

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
instrument that's just fantastic I think

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.750 
instrument that's just fantastic I think

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
that sounds really killer I'm a really

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.340

playing it non-stop and that's kind of

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.880 
playing it non-stop and that's kind of
why<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.270> took<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.020> long<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.410> do<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.650> review

setting<00:04:31.500> right<00:04:31.710> now<00:04:31.860> just<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.190> switch<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.550> up

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
setting right now just to switch it up

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.430 
setting right now just to switch it up
but<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.120> will<00:04:33.240> say<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:33.690> distortion<00:04:34.350> is

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
but I will say that distortion is

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.750 
but I will say that distortion is
definitely<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.890> strong<00:04:35.190> suit<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:35.670> this

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
definitely the strong suit for this

00:04:35.760 --> 00:05:25.950 
definitely the strong suit for this
guitar

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.450

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
so it does clean up real nice even

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.190 
so it does clean up real nice even
though<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:28.700> these<00:05:28.850> pickups<00:05:29.240> are<00:05:29.420> definitely

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
though that these pickups are definitely

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.440 
though that these pickups are definitely
meant<00:05:30.500> for<00:05:30.920> metal<00:05:31.250> guitar<00:05:31.760> playing<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.300> do

obviously<00:05:35.390> in<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.540> clean<00:05:35.720> setting<00:05:35.960> far<00:05:36.230> more

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
obviously in the clean setting far more

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.320 
obviously in the clean setting far more
than<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.770> middle<00:05:36.950> or<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.400> bridge<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.060> just

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
than the middle or the bridge and just

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.000 
than the middle or the bridge and just
for<00:05:38.480> your<00:05:38.570> guys's<00:05:38.930> information<00:05:39.440> there<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:39.800> a

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
for your guys's information there is a

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.160 
for your guys's information there is a
brightness<00:05:40.520> switch<00:05:40.670> which<00:05:40.970> is<00:05:41.120> on<00:05:41.360> right<00:05:42.020> now

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
brightness switch which is on right now

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.660 
brightness switch which is on right now
with<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.440> angle<00:05:42.770> just<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:42.980> give<00:05:43.160> it<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.340> little

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
with the angle just to give it a little

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.610 
with the angle just to give it a little
bit<00:05:43.880> more<00:05:44.180> clarity<00:05:44.600> because<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:45.170> think<00:05:45.230> that

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
bit more clarity because I think that

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.500 
bit more clarity because I think that
clean<00:05:46.220> can<00:05:46.460> sometimes<00:05:46.790> be<00:05:46.970> a<00:05:47.000> little<00:05:47.060> bit<00:05:47.360> just

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
clean can sometimes be a little bit just

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.800 
clean can sometimes be a little bit just
too<00:05:47.690> clanky<00:05:48.170> in<00:05:48.290> and<00:05:48.440> a<00:05:48.980> little<00:05:49.220> bit<00:05:49.400> Oh<00:05:49.810> like

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
too clanky in and a little bit Oh like

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.640 
too clanky in and a little bit Oh like
there's<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:51.050> sock<00:05:51.260> on<00:05:51.470> it

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
there's a sock on it

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.260 
there's a sock on it
so<00:05:51.800> in<00:05:51.920> closing<00:05:52.100> I<00:05:52.400> think<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.730> ran<00:05:52.880> guitars

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
so in closing I think that ran guitars

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.480 
so in closing I think that ran guitars
