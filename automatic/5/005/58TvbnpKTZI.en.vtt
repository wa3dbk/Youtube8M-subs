00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that's a good sign I don't any game so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
that's a good sign I don't any game so
you<00:01:50.009> feel<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.820> don't<00:01:50.940> really<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.390> worry

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you feel you don't really have to worry

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
you feel you don't really have to worry
about<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:52.229> poor<00:01:52.590> customer<00:01:52.860> service<00:01:53.130> with

about some poor customer service with
this<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.740> far<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> haven't<00:01:56.190> had<00:01:56.430> any<00:01:56.700> real

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
this and so far I haven't had any real

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.410 
this and so far I haven't had any real
problem<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.190> just<00:01:59.190> leveled<00:01:59.550> up<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.880> level<00:02:00.270> nine

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
problem I just leveled up to level nine

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.200 
problem I just leveled up to level nine
years<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> could<00:02:01.470> get<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:01.740> energy<00:02:02.210> that's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
years so I could get more energy that's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.400 
years so I could get more energy that's
one<00:02:03.539> of<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.780> downsides<00:02:03.929> I<00:02:04.920> prefer<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.840> as

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
one of the downsides I prefer it if as

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.889 
one of the downsides I prefer it if as
you<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.220> levels<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:09.300> get<00:02:09.720> more

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
you go up your levels actually get more

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.080 
you go up your levels actually get more
energy<00:02:10.080> because<00:02:10.679> according<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.670> it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
energy because according to this it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.040 
energy because according to this it's
like<00:02:12.540> refills<00:02:13.440> every<00:02:14.300> two<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> half<00:02:15.630> hours

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
like refills every two and a half hours

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.930 
like refills every two and a half hours
or<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.540> yeah<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:19.459> don't<00:02:20.459> know<00:02:20.579> if<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> want

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
or so so yeah I don't know if you want

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.610 
or so so yeah I don't know if you want
to<00:02:21.030> log<00:02:21.239> into<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.750> game<00:02:21.989> every<00:02:22.320> two<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
to log into this game every two and a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.240 
to log into this game every two and a
half<00:02:22.799> hours<00:02:25.549> and<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:28.380> lagging<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.799> bit<00:02:28.829> here

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
half hours and it's lagging a bit here

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.600 
half hours and it's lagging a bit here
cuz<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.579> stabbed<00:02:29.940> my<00:02:30.239> cpu<00:02:30.750> set<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.290> low<00:02:31.610> probably

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
cuz I stabbed my cpu set so low probably

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.870 
cuz I stabbed my cpu set so low probably
should<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:32.850> turn<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.299> up<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.570> bit<00:02:33.600> higher

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
should have turn that up a bit higher

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.490 
should have turn that up a bit higher
but<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.120> actual<00:02:36.450> game<00:02:36.480> performance<00:02:37.019> is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
but the actual game performance is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.650 
but the actual game performance is
pretty<00:02:37.950> decent<00:02:38.430> I've<00:02:38.640> had<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.060> haven't<00:02:39.420> had<00:02:39.540> it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
pretty decent I've had I haven't had it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.410 
pretty decent I've had I haven't had it
laying<00:02:39.900> until<00:02:40.440> now<00:02:40.650> which<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.549> because<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.180> just

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
laying until now which is because I just

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.440 
laying until now which is because I just
you<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:44.010> barely<00:02:44.250> has<00:02:44.459> anything<00:02:44.790> cpu

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you know it barely has anything cpu

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.130 
you know it barely has anything cpu
usage<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:46.019> work<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.380> right<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:48.019> I'm<00:02:49.019> just

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
usage to work with right now I'm just

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.300 
usage to work with right now I'm just
going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.380> pause<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.799> I'm<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.190> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
going to pause this I'm going to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.180 
going to pause this I'm going to
increase<00:02:50.549> my<00:02:50.820> cpu<00:02:51.269> here<00:02:51.530> all<00:02:52.530> right<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:53.070> we

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
increase my cpu here all right there we

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.390 
increase my cpu here all right there we
are<00:02:53.310> i<00:02:53.579> put<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.390> up<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:55.320> eighty<00:02:55.769> percent<00:02:56.010> now

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
are i put it up on to eighty percent now

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.940 
are i put it up on to eighty percent now
oh<00:02:57.110> please<00:02:58.110> feeling<00:02:58.620> better<00:02:59.040> anyway<00:03:00.799> this<00:03:01.799> is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
oh please feeling better anyway this is

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.500 
oh please feeling better anyway this is
a<00:03:02.010> sort<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> strategy<00:03:03.000> based<00:03:03.030> game

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
a sort of like a strategy based game

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.620 
a sort of like a strategy based game
everything<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.070> do<00:03:05.250> requires<00:03:05.790> energy<00:03:06.150> for

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
everything you do requires energy for

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.220 
everything you do requires energy for
the<00:03:06.690> most<00:03:06.900> part<00:03:07.140> right<00:03:07.500> every<00:03:07.829> move<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
the most part right every move it

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.069 
the most part right every move it
restores<00:03:10.230> every<00:03:10.650> five<00:03:10.890> minutes<00:03:11.160> but<00:03:12.000> one<00:03:12.959> of

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
restores every five minutes but one of

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.110 
restores every five minutes but one of
the<00:03:13.200> pluses<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.220> will<00:03:14.700> randomly<00:03:15.299> get

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the pluses is that you will randomly get

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.910 
the pluses is that you will randomly get
energy<00:03:18.120> right<00:03:18.390> here's<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> drop<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.739> get

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
energy right here's a drop you just get

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.350 
energy right here's a drop you just get
an<00:03:20.010> extra<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.580> pretty<00:03:20.819> much<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.330> a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
an extra so you pretty much just get a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.860 
an extra so you pretty much just get a
free<00:03:21.660> move<00:03:21.930> or<00:03:22.769> whatever

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
free move or whatever

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.220 
free move or whatever
I<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.159> variety<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.909> unit<00:03:26.269> right<00:03:27.080> now

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
I like the variety of the unit right now

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.649 
I like the variety of the unit right now
there<00:03:27.440> aren't<00:03:27.620> actually<00:03:28.159> a<00:03:28.190> lot<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.659> units

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
there aren't actually a lot of units

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.229 
there aren't actually a lot of units
with<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.019> game<00:03:30.230> right<00:03:30.980> if<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.400> go<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:32.019> shop

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
with the game right if you go to shop

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.119 
with the game right if you go to shop
you<00:03:35.239> can<00:03:35.269> buy<00:03:35.450> units<00:03:36.049> here<00:03:36.319> right<00:03:36.680> there<00:03:36.890> isn't

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
you can buy units here right there isn't

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.789 
you can buy units here right there isn't
too<00:03:37.430> much<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:38.989> think<00:03:39.230> that's<00:03:39.349> because<00:03:39.470> the

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
too much but I think that's because the

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.250 
too much but I think that's because the
game<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.129> fairly<00:03:40.370> new<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.849> that's<00:03:41.780> actually<00:03:41.989> a

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
game is fairly new and that's actually a

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.670 
game is fairly new and that's actually a
lot<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.920> cash<00:03:43.879> as<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.329> can<00:03:44.480> see<00:03:44.659> I<00:03:44.690> barely<00:03:45.200> have

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
lot of cash as you can see I barely have

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.949 
lot of cash as you can see I barely have
3k<00:03:46.280> they're<00:03:46.670> not<00:03:47.540> even<00:03:47.900> right<00:03:49.629> you<00:03:50.629> can<00:03:50.780> use

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
3k they're not even right you can use

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.500 
3k they're not even right you can use
facebook<00:03:51.560> credits<00:03:51.829> here<00:03:52.430> one<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.360> things

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
facebook credits here one of the things

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.539 
facebook credits here one of the things
I<00:03:53.690> don't<00:03:53.750> like<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.920> don't<00:03:55.099> use<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.370> you

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
I don't like is you don't use it you

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.699 
I don't like is you don't use it you
don't<00:03:56.000> get<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.180> confirmation<00:03:56.510> message<00:03:57.049> when

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
don't get a confirmation message when

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.270 
don't get a confirmation message when
you<00:03:57.859> use<00:03:58.099> the<00:03:58.280> credits<00:03:58.670> right<00:03:59.349> so<00:04:00.349> in<00:04:00.980> some

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
you use the credits right so in some

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.460 
you use the credits right so in some
area<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.790> gate<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.150> areas<00:04:03.019> of<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.290> game

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
area of the gate of areas of the game

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.530 
area of the gate of areas of the game
where<00:04:04.129> it<00:04:04.220> seems<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:04.849> somewhat<00:04:05.299> being

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
where it seems to be somewhat being

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.979 
where it seems to be somewhat being
complete<00:04:06.609> you<00:04:07.609> can<00:04:07.760> accident<00:04:08.299> you<00:04:08.599> can<00:04:08.750> find

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
complete you can accident you can find

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.630 
complete you can accident you can find
yourself<00:04:09.079> accidentally<00:04:09.920> spending<00:04:10.280> credits

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
yourself accidentally spending credits

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.339 
yourself accidentally spending credits
I've<00:04:11.269> already<00:04:11.480> accidentally<00:04:12.140> spent<00:04:12.470> like<00:04:12.680> 10

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
I've already accidentally spent like 10

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:22.390 
I've already accidentally spent like 10
but<00:04:15.349> whatever<00:04:19.329> i'm<00:04:20.680> i'm<00:04:21.680> really<00:04:21.949> liking<00:04:22.130> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
but whatever i'm i'm really liking the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.520 
but whatever i'm i'm really liking the
whole<00:04:22.520> defense<00:04:22.910> thing<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.600> you<00:04:23.960> can<00:04:24.139> move<00:04:24.320> all

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
whole defense thing and you can move all

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.909 
whole defense thing and you can move all
of<00:04:24.590> your<00:04:24.770> structures<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:26.410> it's<00:04:27.410> pretty<00:04:27.650> good

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
of your structures and it's pretty good

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.520 
of your structures and it's pretty good
how<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.610> uses<00:04:29.030> supplies<00:04:29.660> or<00:04:30.020> whatever<00:04:30.289> right

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
how it uses supplies or whatever right

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.790 
how it uses supplies or whatever right
this<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.919> your<00:04:31.099> supply<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:32.169> use<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.200> supply<00:04:33.740> to

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
this is your supply and use a supply to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.089 
this is your supply and use a supply to
move<00:04:34.430> them<00:04:34.700> and<00:04:34.910> whatnot<00:04:36.849> yeah<00:04:38.530> here's<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.620> tip

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
move them and whatnot yeah here's a tip

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.420 
move them and whatnot yeah here's a tip
if<00:04:40.460> you're<00:04:40.610> applying<00:04:40.700> this<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:42.650> can<00:04:42.919> use<00:04:42.950> you

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
if you're applying this you can use you

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.520 
if you're applying this you can use you
get<00:04:44.180> multiple<00:04:44.599> headquarters<00:04:45.139> because<00:04:45.380> it

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
get multiple headquarters because it

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.730 
get multiple headquarters because it
takes<00:04:45.710> five<00:04:46.160> minutes<00:04:46.430> for<00:04:46.789> them<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.680> for<00:04:48.680> the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
takes five minutes for them to for the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.580 
takes five minutes for them to for the
cooldown<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.460> wear<00:04:49.639> off<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.419> then<00:04:51.200> you<00:04:51.410> can

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
cooldown to wear off and then you can

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.930 
cooldown to wear off and then you can
collect<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.400> get<00:04:53.210> energy<00:04:53.960> fulness<00:04:54.199> is<00:04:54.530> right

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
collect and get energy fulness is right

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.610 
collect and get energy fulness is right
about<00:04:55.940> fifty<00:04:56.389> percent<00:04:56.810> of<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.110> time<00:04:57.289> you<00:04:57.470> get

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
about fifty percent of the time you get

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.909 
about fifty percent of the time you get
a<00:04:57.650> plus<00:04:58.190> two<00:04:58.460> energy<00:04:58.880> which<00:04:59.150> will<00:04:59.919> increase

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
a plus two energy which will increase

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.500 
a plus two energy which will increase
your<00:05:01.039> energy<00:05:01.280> by<00:05:01.990> one<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:05.180> do<00:05:05.330> get

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
your energy by one and you do get

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.100 
your energy by one and you do get
supplies<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.470> whatnot<00:05:07.570> I'm<00:05:08.570> thinking<00:05:08.990> I'm

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
supplies and whatnot I'm thinking I'm

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.570 
supplies and whatnot I'm thinking I'm
going<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.349> be<00:05:09.440> sticking<00:05:09.770> with<00:05:09.889> that<00:05:09.919> tactic

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
going to be inviting my friends to this

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:08.590 
going to be inviting my friends to this
game<00:05:57.760> and<00:05:58.760> what<00:05:59.210> not<00:05:59.420> and<00:06:07.210> you<00:06:08.210> know<00:06:08.360> that's

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
game and what not and you know that's

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.250 
game and what not and you know that's
pretty<00:06:08.930> much<00:06:09.110> it<00:06:09.350> to<00:06:09.800> it<00:06:10.330> you<00:06:11.330> have<00:06:11.450> quests

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
pretty much it to it you have quests

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.010 
pretty much it to it you have quests
missions<00:06:12.800> or<00:06:12.980> whatever<00:06:13.280> get<00:06:14.030> rewards<00:06:14.540> i<00:06:14.660> think

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
missions or whatever get rewards i think

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.260 
missions or whatever get rewards i think
the<00:06:15.260> experience<00:06:15.650> points<00:06:16.190> though<00:06:16.610> for<00:06:17.030> from

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
the experience points though for from

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.260 
the experience points though for from
the<00:06:17.390> rewards<00:06:17.960> are<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.170> bit<00:06:18.440> low<00:06:18.710> and<00:06:21.880> just<00:06:22.880> a<00:06:23.090> tip

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
the rewards are a bit low and just a tip

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.700 
the rewards are a bit low and just a tip
you<00:06:23.480> should<00:06:23.630> probably<00:06:23.930> do<00:06:23.990> what<00:06:24.110> I<00:06:24.230> did<00:06:24.440> but

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
you should probably do what I did but

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.710 
you should probably do what I did but
when<00:06:25.430> you're<00:06:25.580> first<00:06:25.790> starting<00:06:25.940> off<00:06:26.420> you're

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
when you're first starting off you're

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.930 
when you're first starting off you're
probably<00:06:26.990> going<00:06:27.260> to<00:06:27.350> be<00:06:27.530> wanting<00:06:28.010> to<00:06:28.220> attack

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
probably going to be wanting to attack

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.630 
probably going to be wanting to attack
as<00:06:29.210> many<00:06:29.419> units<00:06:29.630> as<00:06:29.870> possible<00:06:30.530> what<00:06:31.370> I<00:06:31.400> did

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
as many units as possible what I did

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.440 
as many units as possible what I did
here<00:06:31.910> because<00:06:32.419> I<00:06:32.450> saw<00:06:32.930> this<00:06:33.080> coming<00:06:34.450> when

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
here because I saw this coming when

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.510 
here because I saw this coming when
you're<00:06:35.630> low<00:06:35.810> level<00:06:36.169> you'll<00:06:36.440> actually<00:06:36.680> be<00:06:37.280> able

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
you're low level you'll actually be able

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.980 
you're low level you'll actually be able
to<00:06:38.000> just<00:06:38.270> level<00:06:39.050> up<00:06:39.290> by<00:06:40.660> conquering<00:06:41.660> land

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
to just level up by conquering land

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.860 
to just level up by conquering land
rather<00:06:42.620> than<00:06:42.890> attacking<00:06:43.660> because<00:06:44.660> you<00:06:44.780> have

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
rather than attacking because you have

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.810 
rather than attacking because you have
enough<00:06:45.080> energy<00:06:45.230> to<00:06:45.530> do<00:06:45.800> so<00:06:45.830> so<00:06:46.430> when<00:06:46.700> you're

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
enough energy to do so so when you're

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.430 
enough energy to do so so when you're
low<00:06:47.000> level<00:06:47.360> just<00:06:47.510> try<00:06:47.750> to<00:06:47.810> conquer<00:06:48.020> as<00:06:48.260> much

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
low level just try to conquer as much

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.400 
low level just try to conquer as much
fun<00:06:48.680> as<00:06:48.860> you<00:06:48.919> can<00:06:49.660> do<00:06:50.660> that<00:06:50.840> probably<00:06:51.080> till

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
fun as you can do that probably till

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.440 
fun as you can do that probably till
level<00:06:51.740> 5<00:06:52.010> or<00:06:52.220> level<00:06:52.460> 6<00:06:52.760> then<00:06:53.030> you'll<00:06:53.180> start

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
level 5 or level 6 then you'll start

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.260 
level 5 or level 6 then you'll start
having<00:06:53.870> to<00:06:54.080> attack<00:06:55.070> other<00:06:55.310> units<00:06:55.790> and<00:06:56.000> stuff

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
having to attack other units and stuff

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.640 
having to attack other units and stuff
to<00:06:56.750> get<00:06:57.110> larger<00:06:57.860> amounts<00:06:58.160> of<00:06:58.280> experience<00:06:59.650> I'm

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
to get larger amounts of experience I'm

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.740 
to get larger amounts of experience I'm
going<00:07:00.919> to<00:07:00.979> open<00:07:01.040> up<00:07:01.280> the<00:07:01.400> items<00:07:01.700> here<00:07:01.970> what<00:07:02.720> I

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
going to open up the items here what I

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.450 
going to open up the items here what I
like<00:07:02.990> here<00:07:03.200> is<00:07:03.410> that<00:07:03.650> it<00:07:03.830> tells<00:07:04.010> you<00:07:04.220> where<00:07:04.370> you

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
like here is that it tells you where you

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.860 
like here is that it tells you where you
can<00:07:04.610> get<00:07:04.729> item<00:07:05.450> from<00:07:07.510> when<00:07:08.510> you're<00:07:08.660> building

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
can get item from when you're building

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.540 
can get item from when you're building
stuff<00:07:09.350> I<00:07:09.560> don't<00:07:09.680> think<00:07:10.190> that<00:07:10.250> you<00:07:10.520> can

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
stuff I don't think that you can

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.730 
stuff I don't think that you can
highlight<00:07:11.030> over<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.419> items<00:07:11.750> though<00:07:12.020> which<00:07:12.710> is

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
highlight over the items though which is

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.800 
highlight over the items though which is
a<00:07:12.979> downside<00:07:13.310> in<00:07:13.940> case<00:07:14.150> you<00:07:14.300> don't<00:07:14.479> have<00:07:14.570> that

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
a downside in case you don't have that

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.620 
a downside in case you don't have that
item<00:07:15.200> but<00:07:16.160> I'm<00:07:16.790> pretty<00:07:17.000> sure<00:07:17.120> you<00:07:17.479> can

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
item but I'm pretty sure you can

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.270 
item but I'm pretty sure you can
probably<00:07:17.990> find<00:07:18.140> a<00:07:18.290> guide<00:07:18.500> or<00:07:18.530> something<00:07:19.100> for

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 
probably find a guide or something for

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.310 
probably find a guide or something for
this<00:07:19.370> game<00:07:19.580> or<00:07:19.910> I<00:07:20.330> guess<00:07:20.720> I<00:07:20.960> could<00:07:21.140> make<00:07:21.290> a

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
this game or I guess I could make a

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.620 
this game or I guess I could make a
guide<00:07:21.620> or<00:07:21.650> whatever<00:07:25.030> done<00:07:26.030> walk<00:07:26.270> different

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.630 
guide or whatever done walk different

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.350 
guide or whatever done walk different
units<00:07:27.020> all<00:07:27.229> you<00:07:27.350> got<00:07:27.500> to<00:07:27.620> do<00:07:27.740> is<00:07:28.210> you<00:07:29.210> know

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 
units all you got to do is you know

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.340 
units all you got to do is you know
build<00:07:30.200> buildings<00:07:30.860> and<00:07:31.070> stuff<00:07:31.310> and<00:07:32.350> that's

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350 
build buildings and stuff and that's

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.560 
build buildings and stuff and that's
pretty<00:07:33.560> much<00:07:33.680> it<00:07:33.860> it's<00:07:34.700> a<00:07:34.820> fairly<00:07:35.060> addictive

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.570 
pretty much it it's a fairly addictive
