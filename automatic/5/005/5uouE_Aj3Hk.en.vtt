00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.520 
he's also averaging a double-double I'd
say<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.270> number<00:01:54.510> one<00:01:54.660> improvement<00:01:54.930> area<00:01:55.350> for

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
say the number one improvement area for

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770 
say the number one improvement area for
him<00:01:56.090> coincides<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.240> what's<00:01:57.510> been<00:01:57.660> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
him coincides with what's been the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.420 
him coincides with what's been the
biggest<00:01:57.900> improvement<00:01:58.500> area<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.740> my<00:01:58.770> mind<00:01:59.130> for

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
biggest improvement area in my mind for

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
biggest improvement area in my mind for
their<00:01:59.550> team<00:01:59.820> which<00:02:00.300> is<00:02:00.480> their<00:02:00.630> rebounding<00:02:01.140> so

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
their team which is their rebounding so

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
their team which is their rebounding so
I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.760> maybe<00:02:03.180> conventional<00:02:03.840> wisdom

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I think maybe conventional wisdom

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.960 
I think maybe conventional wisdom
thought<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.590> their<00:02:04.740> running<00:02:05.040> game<00:02:05.070> might

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
thought that their running game might

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.790 
thought that their running game might
take<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.210> step<00:02:06.540> back<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.780> Darius<00:02:07.320> Morris<00:02:07.500> not

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
take a step back with Darius Morris not

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.590 
take a step back with Darius Morris not
there<00:02:07.980> I<00:02:08.010> think<00:02:08.100> it's<00:02:08.280> even<00:02:08.399> better<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.940> what

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
there I think it's even better than what

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.160 
there I think it's even better than what
it<00:02:09.720> was<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.990> year<00:02:10.020> ago<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it was a year ago and and the the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.320 
it was a year ago and and the the
defensive<00:02:13.740> rebounding<00:02:14.430> enables<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
defensive rebounding enables that to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.860 
defensive rebounding enables that to
happen<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.010> he's<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> very<00:02:17.610> very<00:02:18.180> good<00:02:18.450> shooter

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
happen so he's a very very good shooter

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.070 
happen so he's a very very good shooter
off<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.680> catch<00:02:20.130> off<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.790> move<00:02:21.000> off<00:02:21.330> screens

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
off the catch off the move off screens

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.550 
off the catch off the move off screens
and<00:02:22.940> at<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> same<00:02:24.330> time<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.900> make<00:02:25.080> plays<00:02:25.320> at

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and at the same time can make plays at

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.700 
and at the same time can make plays at
the<00:02:25.650> basket<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.630> force<00:02:27.990> around<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> rim

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the basket and as a force around the rim

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.630 
the basket and as a force around the rim
because<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.190> way<00:02:29.310> he<00:02:29.340> rebounds<00:02:34.610> well<00:02:35.610> i

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
because of the way he rebounds well i

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.260 
because of the way he rebounds well i
think<00:02:35.970> i<00:02:36.330> think<00:02:36.570> it's<00:02:36.720> they've<00:02:37.470> got<00:02:38.270> very

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
think i think it's they've got very

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.020 
think i think it's they've got very
athletic<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:39.960> i<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:40.820> part<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:41.910> it

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
athletic so i think that's part of it

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.290 
athletic so i think that's part of it
and<00:02:42.270> i<00:02:43.130> don't<00:02:44.130> know<00:02:44.250> i<00:02:44.280> don't<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:45.150> it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
and i don't know i don't know what it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.910 
and i don't know i don't know what it
may<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.260> commitment<00:02:46.530> i<00:02:46.740> don't

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
may be just more of a commitment i don't

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.050 
may be just more of a commitment i don't
know<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.220> be<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> hard<00:02:47.550> question<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.970> answer

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
know that be a hard question to answer

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.690 
know that be a hard question to answer
because<00:02:48.560> i'm<00:02:49.560> not<00:02:49.739> sure<00:02:49.950> what's<00:02:50.130> going<00:02:50.310> into

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
because i'm not sure what's going into

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.810 
because i'm not sure what's going into
to<00:02:51.090> their<00:02:51.209> thought<00:02:51.450> process<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.230> for<00:02:52.440> us

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
to their thought process on that for us

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.400 
to their thought process on that for us
it's<00:02:53.820> got<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.209> be<00:02:54.360> you've<00:02:54.840> got<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.230> more

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
it's got to be you've got to have more

are dinner that are really creating out

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.479 
are dinner that are really creating out
high<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:03.600> their<00:03:03.930> attempts<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.220> can't

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
high in their attempts and and you can't

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.630 
high in their attempts and and you can't
have<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> team<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.890> mix<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.100> matches<00:03:08.459> when

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
have a team that mix and matches when

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.130 
have a team that mix and matches when
they<00:03:08.760> decide<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.540> when<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.660> won<00:03:09.900> again

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
they decide to go and when I won again

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.479 
they decide to go and when I won again
I'm<00:03:10.290> not<00:03:10.410> sure<00:03:10.590> how<00:03:10.680> Michigan<00:03:10.980> teaches<00:03:11.370> him

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
I'm not sure how Michigan teaches him

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.860 
I'm not sure how Michigan teaches him
when<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.760> watch<00:03:11.910> them<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.270> see<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> team<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.840> is

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
when I watch them I see a team that is

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.110 
when I watch them I see a team that is
very<00:03:13.230> consistent<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.980> going<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.940> both

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
very consistent and going to both

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.440 
very consistent and going to both
backboards<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.350> their<00:03:17.160> year<00:03:17.370> stronger<00:03:17.880> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
backboards and their year stronger so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.270 
backboards and their year stronger so
that<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.900> physicality<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.770> blackouts

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
that the physicality of the blackouts

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.350 
that the physicality of the blackouts
and<00:03:20.400> things<00:03:20.640> were<00:03:20.790> probably<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.209> much

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
and things were probably that much

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.729 
and things were probably that much
better<00:03:23.750> he's<00:03:24.750> getting<00:03:25.080> better<00:03:25.200> there's<00:03:25.590> no

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
better he's getting better there's no

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.120 
better he's getting better there's no
question<00:03:26.130> about<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.400> he's<00:03:26.959> he's<00:03:27.959> hungry<00:03:28.380> he's

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
question about it he's he's hungry he's

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.180 
question about it he's he's hungry he's
playing<00:03:29.910> with<00:03:30.470> some<00:03:31.470> force<00:03:31.709> he's<00:03:31.950> playing

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
playing with some force he's playing

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.360 
playing with some force he's playing
with<00:03:32.310> an<00:03:32.430> edge<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:34.260> he's<00:03:34.860> playing<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.130> lot<00:03:35.280> of

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
with an edge and he's playing a lot of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.360 
with an edge and he's playing a lot of
minutes<00:03:35.610> for<00:03:35.670> us<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.590> he's<00:03:37.590> playing<00:03:38.160> both

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
minutes for us and he's playing both

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.550 
minutes for us and he's playing both
ways<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.269> think<00:03:39.510> that's<00:03:39.690> in<00:03:39.989> these<00:03:40.170> games<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
ways and I think that's in these games a

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.720 
ways and I think that's in these games a
lot<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.800> confidence<00:03:41.130> because<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.580> it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.010 

no<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:46.000> hard<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.240> tell<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.690> mean<00:03:46.900> we're

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
no it's hard to tell I mean we're

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.320 
no it's hard to tell I mean we're
getting<00:03:47.260> better<00:03:47.380> but<00:03:47.680> we've<00:03:48.160> got<00:03:48.430> such

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
getting better but we've got such

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.060 
getting better but we've got such
uncharted<00:03:49.870> water<00:03:50.050> right<00:03:50.350> now<00:03:50.500> for<00:03:50.740> this<00:03:50.860> team

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
uncharted water right now for this team

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.070 
uncharted water right now for this team
we've<00:03:51.250> got<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.460> make<00:03:51.580> sure<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:51.790> we<00:03:52.150> are<00:03:52.180> that

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
we've got to make sure that we are that

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.200 
we've got to make sure that we are that
we<00:03:53.230> are<00:03:53.380> really<00:03:53.800> really<00:03:54.070> continuing<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:54.970> stay

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
we are really really continuing to stay

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.390 
we are really really continuing to stay
locked<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.660> I'd<00:03:56.020> say<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.440> consistency<00:03:57.220> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
locked in I'd say the consistency a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.910 
locked in I'd say the consistency a
focus<00:03:58.330> has<00:03:58.540> been<00:03:58.570> really<00:03:59.020> good<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
focus has been really good the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.740 
focus has been really good the
consistency<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.670> our<00:04:00.820> depth<00:04:01.090> has<00:04:01.270> not<00:04:01.450> been<00:04:01.630> as

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
consistency of our depth has not been as

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.900 
consistency of our depth has not been as
good<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.410> again<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.580> don't<00:04:03.640> have<00:04:03.730> any

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
good so again you don't have any

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.670 
good so again you don't have any
consistency<00:04:04.390> when<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.900> don't<00:04:05.050> have<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.410> but

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
consistency when you don't have that but

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.820 
consistency when you don't have that but
it's<00:04:06.550> just<00:04:06.820> a<00:04:06.970> matter<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.330> us<00:04:07.660> there<00:04:08.170> there's

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
it's just a matter of us there there's

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.860 
it's just a matter of us there there's
always<00:04:09.070> such<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.850> group<00:04:10.210> of<00:04:10.330> things<00:04:10.600> that<00:04:10.780> we

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
always such a group of things that we

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.000 
always such a group of things that we
want<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.110> make<00:04:11.260> sure<00:04:11.290> we're<00:04:11.650> getting<00:04:11.740> better

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
want to make sure we're getting better

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.790 
want to make sure we're getting better
at<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.520> at<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.700> same<00:04:12.880> time<00:04:13.470> whatever<00:04:14.470> we<00:04:14.620> feel

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
at and at the same time whatever we feel

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.440 
at and at the same time whatever we feel
our<00:04:14.980> strengths<00:04:15.370> are<00:04:15.520> we<00:04:15.700> want<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:15.970> continue<00:04:16.239> to

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
our strengths are we want to continue to

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.780 
our strengths are we want to continue to
make<00:04:16.480> sure<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:16.959> we're<00:04:17.080> locked<00:04:17.290> into<00:04:17.500> those

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
make sure that we're locked into those

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.750 
make sure that we're locked into those
so<00:04:18.790> it's<00:04:19.420> it's<00:04:20.260> really<00:04:20.500> it'd<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.370> hard<00:04:21.549> for<00:04:21.700> me

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
so it's it's really it'd be hard for me

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.470 
so it's it's really it'd be hard for me
to<00:04:21.850> quantify<00:04:22.300> what<00:04:22.330> would<00:04:22.750> be<00:04:22.960> one<00:04:23.110> area
