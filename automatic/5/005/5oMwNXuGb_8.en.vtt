00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.779
 I want to make this video to clarify 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.779
 some colleagues and suddenly it reaches 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.150
 a rapper 850 x 75 percent as he had 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:13.540
 come this there has arrived because no 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.750
 goes to the bar and reaches 75% what 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.339
 is p tells him the job of 75 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:24.579
 cent as already explained in some videos 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.929
 but here we observe good there what 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.019
 I did not yet cleaned well 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:32.200
 circuit but if you have left of this 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.300
 way as they were seeing at the start 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.570
 that an image appears with squares and not 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.370
 the clear image comes out and reaches a 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.080
 a certain percentage and from there it does not advance 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.080
 inside what we have to do 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.300
 and verify well that we have not been left 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.340
 poorly done work that is not in 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.920
 short any of the lines and we're going to 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.800
 check if that is what is happening 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.379
 because some colleagues have asked me 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.670
 what needs to be done and I think there's a 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.589
 error 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.860
 I think here is a clue that is 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.350
 touching another and if that is the case 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.960
 you have to believe that this track 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.650
 in step 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.870
 the medium is touching the bottom 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.520
 and if you have a similar case should 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.060
 Re -clean and do it again 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.510
 jumper to see if that was the case 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.210
 I will try to observe well and 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.400
 look if you already solve this problem with 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 and now if we see it it is already lighting 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000
 normally after having reviewed 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.950
 those circuits we're going to expect that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.860
 turn everything on and we will see that you have 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.900
 past all 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.240
 No problem 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.670
 and here we see it now so well happening 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.890
 so now it does clarify some things 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.640
 when we have problems like when 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.860
 we saw at the beginning that a screen 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.540
 as with a square and an X is 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.930
 because we made some mistake in the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.930
 process 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.610
 of the 75% solution this is the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.119
 integrated the circuit that manages that the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.039
 two lines that we clean are this and it 's 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.649
 the one on the side with this side and the one on 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.780
 medium with this when we make mistakes 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.550
 and we damage the pizzas here if not 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.349
 we recover with microscope and with the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.349
 technique that I have here in the channel 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.360
 recover damaged pizzas those lines do not 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.310
 I will be able to have a solution that are the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.799
 that enter the process now would lose 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.720
 the phone would have no other solution if 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.549
 are these clues here is very easy because 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.290
 the first one makes this side continue 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.690
 resistance and that of the medium to the other edge 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.630
 the resistance if that resistance still 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.599
 casaÃ±a also will not work and goes 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.049
 to be in the same 75% error if 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.940
 this line from here to the second point here 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.230
 he has no contact he will also give us 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.239
 75% error or battery crossed if it sank 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.250
 of these that has sunk rectifiers 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.780
 is short also will not let us 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.480
 to turn on the phone and can give 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.190
 battery crossed out these capacitors that 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.079
 we see here if they are also short 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.200
 they can affect in the same 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.330
 behavior that we live 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.129
 with this we can solve any 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.129
 failure of which we had we could 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.470
 present to about 75 percent, 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.540
 there with this video it is clear that 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.590
 some mistakes that we see that are like 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.959
 out of the ordinary 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.880
 are by procedures and things that 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.620
 we can soon make more helpful
