here's what I've experienced the last

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890 
here's what I've experienced the last
couple<00:00:26.220> years<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> coming<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> Ireland<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.630> see

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
couple years of coming to Ireland to see

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.640 
couple years of coming to Ireland to see
that<00:00:28.349> core<00:00:28.830> community<00:00:29.779> which<00:00:30.779> has<00:00:31.199> got<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that core community which has got to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.260 
that core community which has got to
literally<00:00:31.859> be<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.460> couple<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.940> handfuls

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
literally be just a couple of handfuls

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.120 
literally be just a couple of handfuls
of<00:00:33.600> people<00:00:33.899> climbing<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> levels<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
of people climbing at the levels that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.620 
of people climbing at the levels that
are<00:00:35.219> happening<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.420> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
are happening right now I think is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.069 
are happening right now I think is
extraordinary<00:00:37.040> based<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> precedent<00:00:38.520> of

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
extraordinary based on the precedent of

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.600 
extraordinary based on the precedent of
what<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> core<00:00:40.469> Irish<00:00:40.890> climbers<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.430> done

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
what the core Irish climbers have done

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060

already<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> date<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> future<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
already to date I think the future it

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.930 
already to date I think the future it
could<00:00:44.280> literally<00:00:44.610> set<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> world<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.600> fire
