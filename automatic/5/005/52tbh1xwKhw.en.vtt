00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
side out that works pretty well I might

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.130 
side out that works pretty well I might
go<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.400> might<00:01:11.400> I've<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.850> lots<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.180> elixir

anyway<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.760> hell<00:01:15.090> I'll<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.750> get

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
anyway but what the hell I'll just get

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
anyway but what the hell I'll just get
the<00:01:16.380> rest<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.759> quit<00:01:19.430> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the rest of it and then just quit so

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.230 
the rest of it and then just quit so
I'll<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.820> run<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> few<00:01:21.659> more<00:01:21.720> arm<00:01:23.210> archers<00:01:24.210> and

goblins<00:01:24.920> they'll<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> job<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:30.500> think

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

goblins they'll do the job I think
there's<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.740> storage<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> top<00:01:33.030> there

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
