00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.290 
soft it makes my hair and that's like
one<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> those<00:00:59.100> important<00:00:59.550> things<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.059> far<00:01:00.270> as

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
one of those important things as far as

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
one of those important things as far as
my<00:01:01.170> shampoo<00:01:01.469> conditioner<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.920> making<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.250> hair

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
my shampoo conditioner is making my hair

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.150 
my shampoo conditioner is making my hair
really<00:01:02.640> soft<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.559> manageable

really soft and like manageable

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.359 
really soft and like manageable
I<00:01:05.190> think<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> shampoo<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.979> damaged<00:01:07.979> hair

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
I think the shampoo is for damaged hair

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
I think the shampoo is for damaged hair
just<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.000> overworked<00:01:09.479> process<00:01:09.840> hairs<00:01:10.080> right

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
just like overworked process hairs right

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.870 
just like overworked process hairs right
