00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.540
 the girls as you are today I am going to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.550
 teach another one of my beauty tricks 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.760
 natural and today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.720
 prepare a body lotion the truth 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.760
 is that how many times have you loved us 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.710
 sell super face creams saying the 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.650
 which are the best options to nourish 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.230
 and have a super radiant skin the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.380
 truth is that if we read the content the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.509
 ingredients of these creams we see that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.909
 many of these ingredients never ever 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.250
 never advertise we would use in 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.989
 our plates would not eat them 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.910
 even the ones that seem most harmless 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.880
 which we see that are organic and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.860
 with 100% natural products if we look 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.010
 the labels we see that they contain 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.830
 alcohols and alcohol par excellence what 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.140
 what it does is dehydrate or re-take 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.380
 skin plus other additives that we're not going to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 want to absorb so what are the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.590
 ingredients that I use to prepare 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.620
 a body cream 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.450
 basically coconut oil that also 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.329
 it can be replaced by oil there 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.050
 butter from here that is still much more 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.960
 dense 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.480
 and much more saturated but I like it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 very much use coconut oil for 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.900
 its smell too 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.670
 what are we going to do this coconut oil 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.369
 that's how simple our cream can be 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.060
 body but I always like that I 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.220
 like in English a plus besides what 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.590
 let's get with the oils 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.750
 essential here I have three oils 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.740
 different essentials that are the ones 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.030
 more I use this first one is a melaleuca 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.950
 and melaleuca serves us a lot for 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.990
 soften the hydrate and ritations that 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.820
 yes we have a more sensitive skin 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.350
 lamela lew that will help us calm down 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.539
 those redness and that if we've been 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.100
 exposed to the sun or if we feel that 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.300
 we need to calm down a little bit our 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.820
 This is a very good option to 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.830
 lemon or here I have a lemon oil 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.289
 essential lemon or we can also 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.390
 use wild orange or any 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.350
 another mixture of any other mixture of 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.539
 typical 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.500
 perfect is going to give us a very 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.180
 refreshing and very invigorating so it's 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.250
 very good in the morning and even as not 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.489
 once again lavender is one of my 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.950
 favorites and mostly I use it for 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.290
 the nights when I come back from yoga and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.020
 I'm like more tired has given me there 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.000
 a fight and then my body cream is 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.340
 the coconut oil plus a few drops of 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.090
 lavender oil that helps us have 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.090
 that more calming effect more relaxed 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.920
 and how are we going to do it well 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.300
 easy 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.300
 I'm going to leave it open 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.660
 we're going let's grab a spoonful 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.280
 of coconut oil 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.430
 Y 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.160
 we are going to add a car droplets of 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.030
 of essential oil 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.030
 mix it well 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.740
 this is the oil that we could go 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.770
 Applying all over our body 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.600
 and if it is true that we are going to be 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.780
 little sticky the body is going to 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.210
 be a bit odiously clear but the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.700
 beneficial effect that this has on 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.550
 our organism deserves a lot the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.040
 sorry let's wait like about 23 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.860
 minutes before dressing up again for 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.180
 that the oil is absorbed already and to not 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.459
 Do not stain our clothes either 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.129
 that you know that this is the best option 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.769
 to rehydrate and moisturize and care 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.260
 pamper our skin so if it has
