00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.699 
our emotions and the north all we use
two<00:02:09.349> different<00:02:09.709> types<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.220> motions<00:02:11.709> we

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
two different types of motions we

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.860 
two different types of motions we
utilize<00:02:13.250> what<00:02:13.519> we<00:02:13.670> call<00:02:13.910> jet<00:02:14.239> motion<00:02:14.660> this

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
utilize what we call jet motion this

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.589 
utilize what we call jet motion this
motion<00:02:15.379> is<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.590> full-speed<00:02:16.579> motion<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.209> cross

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
motion is a full-speed motion to cross

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.350 
motion is a full-speed motion to cross
the<00:02:17.870> formation<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:19.310> use<00:02:19.549> this<00:02:19.790> as<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> type

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
the formation and we use this as a type

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.569 
the formation and we use this as a type
of<00:02:20.390> decoy<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.140> run<00:02:21.379> some<00:02:21.650> other<00:02:21.799> type<00:02:22.129> of<00:02:22.340> play

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
of decoy to run some other type of play

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.979 
of decoy to run some other type of play
other<00:02:23.120> than<00:02:23.480> what<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:24.019> call<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.440> jet<00:02:24.650> sweep<00:02:25.989> we

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
other than what we call the jet sweep we

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.280 
other than what we call the jet sweep we
also<00:02:27.170> utilize<00:02:27.860> personnel<00:02:28.700> motion<00:02:29.290> personnel

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
also utilize personnel motion personnel

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.380 
also utilize personnel motion personnel
motion<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.799> used<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.129> move<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.700> move<00:02:31.970> a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
motion is used to move to move a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.170 
motion is used to move to move a
specific<00:02:33.290> run<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.609> can<00:02:34.730> see<00:02:34.790> right

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
specific run and as you can see right

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.780 
specific run and as you can see right
here<00:02:35.209> we've<00:02:35.690> got<00:02:35.930> an<00:02:36.109> X<00:02:36.379> motion<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.310> called<00:02:37.579> X

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
here we've got an X motion it's called X

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.020 
here we've got an X motion it's called X
10<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.540> we're<00:02:39.290> running<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.739> X<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.670> tenth

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
10 so we're running the X to the tenth

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.289 
10 so we're running the X to the tenth
spot<00:02:41.150> way<00:02:41.780> out<00:02:42.019> here<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.060> then<00:02:44.060> we're<00:02:44.209> going

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
spot way out here and then we're going

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:53.319 
spot way out here and then we're going
to<00:02:44.359> run<00:02:44.599> a<00:02:44.630> play<00:02:44.900> right<00:02:45.200> off<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:47.980> which<00:02:52.329> key

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
to run a play right off of it which key

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.979 
to run a play right off of it which key
to<00:02:53.480> success<00:02:54.049> for<00:02:54.440> us<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.980> for<00:02:55.130> any<00:02:55.250> program<00:02:55.519> is

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
to success for us and for any program is

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.300 
to success for us and for any program is
repetition<00:02:56.989> not<00:02:57.530> just<00:02:57.739> repetition<00:02:58.220> but

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
repetition not just repetition but

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.449 
repetition not just repetition but
quality<00:02:58.730> reps<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.720> what<00:02:59.930> we<00:03:00.079> do<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.530> when<00:03:01.430> we

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
quality reps so what we do is when we

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.059 
quality reps so what we do is when we
start<00:03:01.910> getting<00:03:02.269> out<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.109> classroom<00:03:03.260> we

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
start getting out of the classroom we

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.979 
start getting out of the classroom we
start<00:03:04.310> getting<00:03:04.489> onto<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.970> field<00:03:05.269> we<00:03:05.750> put

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
start getting onto the field we put

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.440 
start getting onto the field we put
together<00:03:06.079> we<00:03:06.620> call<00:03:06.859> a<00:03:06.889> huddle<00:03:07.430> /<00:03:07.760> formation

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
together we call a huddle / formation
