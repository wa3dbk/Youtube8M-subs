00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
meet again and so there is no plan for

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.680 
meet again and so there is no plan for
record<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.300> alone

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
record and alone

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750 
record and alone
there's<00:00:33.960> no<00:00:34.140> plan<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.829> tour<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.430> moment

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
there's no plan for tour at the moment

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.330 
there's no plan for tour at the moment
so<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.270> where<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.510> stand<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so that's where we stand I do like to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
so that's where we stand I do like to
position<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.239> we're<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> moment

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
position that we're in at the moment

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650 
position that we're in at the moment
that<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.030> have

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that we don't really have to have

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
that we don't really have to have
pressure<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.500> certain<00:00:43.829> things<00:00:43.980> when<00:00:44.430> there

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
pressure to do certain things when there

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
pressure to do certain things when there
is<00:00:44.700> no<00:00:44.879> vision<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> think<00:00:46.469> that's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
is no vision you know I think that's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
is no vision you know I think that's
also<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> problem<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
also the problem you know that you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.959 
also the problem you know that you
sometimes<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:49.010> we<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.550> records

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
sometimes do we have to do records

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
sometimes do we have to do records
because<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> promote<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> tour<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:53.010> that's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
because to promote a tour because that's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.950 
because to promote a tour because that's
what's<00:00:53.579> happening<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.059> without

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
what's happening right now without

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 
what's happening right now without
having<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.379> vision<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.910> know

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
having a vision that's where you know

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.959 
having a vision that's where you know
quantity<00:00:57.750> comes<00:00:58.710> along<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.190> that's<00:00:59.609> why<00:00:59.910> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
quantity comes along and that's why the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.229 
quantity comes along and that's why the
quality<00:01:00.300> sucks<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> moment<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:03.000> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
quality sucks at the moment so I do like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
quality sucks at the moment so I do like
the<00:01:03.420> position<00:01:03.570> rum<00:01:04.019> snip<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.830> not

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the position rum snip we actually do not

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.240 
the position rum snip we actually do not
have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.430> works<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:07.189> be<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have to do works but so can be the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
have to do works but so can be the
headliner<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.820> some<00:01:09.119> festivals<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> know

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's a really privileged situation that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's a really privileged situation that
we<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.360> moment<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350
