00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.330 
can continue to survive a good look at a
shotgun<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> purple<00:01:49.740> smoke<00:01:50.040> which

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
shotgun there and purple smoke which

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.370 
shotgun there and purple smoke which
could<00:01:50.640> mean<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.329> drop-off<00:01:51.810> areas<00:01:52.200> for

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
could mean like the drop-off areas for

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.899 
could mean like the drop-off areas for
maybe<00:01:52.590> that's<00:01:52.890> where<00:01:53.100> an<00:01:53.189> airstrike<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.790> be

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
maybe that's where an airstrike can be

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
maybe that's where an airstrike can be
called<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.540> maybe<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> pick<00:01:55.320> something

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
called or maybe you can pick something

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.010 
called or maybe you can pick something
up<00:01:55.860> who<00:01:56.520> knows<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.030> mean<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.390> anyone's<00:01:57.840> guess

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
up who knows I mean it's anyone's guess

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.830 
up who knows I mean it's anyone's guess
a<00:01:58.320> weapon<00:01:59.040> armory<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.180> similar<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
a weapon armory this is similar to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.480 
a weapon armory this is similar to
killing<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> floor<00:02:01.619> where<00:02:01.979> at<00:02:02.159> certain

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
killing the floor where at certain

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.050 
killing the floor where at certain
levels<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.350> buy<00:02:04.350> stuff<00:02:05.250> from<00:02:05.399> an<00:02:05.549> armory

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
levels you can buy stuff from an armory

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.080 
levels you can buy stuff from an armory
when<00:02:06.750> at<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> certain<00:02:07.110> point<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> time<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.090> you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
when at a certain point in time and you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
when at a certain point in time and you
know<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.660> unlock<00:02:09.899> make<00:02:10.140> explosives

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
know you have to unlock make explosives

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.370 
know you have to unlock make explosives
will<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.009> unlocked<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.730> maybe<00:02:11.910> assault<00:02:12.300> rifles

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
will be unlocked or maybe assault rifles

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
will be unlocked or maybe assault rifles
Sedra<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.520> we're<00:02:14.730> inside<00:02:15.120> buildings

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
Sedra so now we're inside buildings

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.270 
Sedra so now we're inside buildings
outside<00:02:15.720> buildings<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.800> seems<00:02:17.130> like

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
outside buildings is it seems like

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.070 
outside buildings is it seems like
there's<00:02:17.430> always<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.790> timer<00:02:18.150> counting<00:02:18.690> up<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
there's always a timer counting up to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.980 
there's always a timer counting up to
the<00:02:19.200> wave<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:20.610> haven't<00:02:21.180> seen<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.690> really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the wave and I haven't seen it really

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.290 
the wave and I haven't seen it really
counting<00:02:22.410> down<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> next<00:02:23.580> wave<00:02:23.940> it's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
counting down to the next wave it's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.240 
counting down to the next wave it's
always<00:02:24.720> counting<00:02:25.200> how<00:02:25.350> much<00:02:25.500> time<00:02:25.770> each<00:02:25.800> wave

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
always counting how much time each wave

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.180 
always counting how much time each wave
takes<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:28.140> again<00:02:28.590> we're<00:02:28.800> back<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
aspect or killing the floor it looks

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.080 
aspect or killing the floor it looks
like<00:02:48.570> I'm<00:02:49.410> differently<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.460> different<00:02:50.940> step

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
like I'm differently a different step

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.940

from<00:02:51.330> zombies<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.140> what<00:02:52.470> we're<00:02:52.650> used<00:02:52.860> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
from zombies of what we're used to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.330 
from zombies of what we're used to
seeing<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:54.030> uh<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.320> aircrafts<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.250> the

trailer we're going to see all the enemy
dogs<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.290> called<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.010> they

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
dogs that can be called in and they

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.010 
dogs that can be called in and they
actually<00:03:02.400> have<00:03:02.700> c4<00:03:02.940> attached<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.720> them<00:03:03.840> that

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
actually have c4 attached to them that

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.350 
actually have c4 attached to them that
they'll<00:03:04.170> explode<00:03:04.710> and<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.060> really

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
they'll explode and this is really

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.810 
they'll explode and this is really
bumping<00:03:06.960> up<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.200> effort<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.370> game<00:03:08.580> to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
bumping up the effort in this game to

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.210 
bumping up the effort in this game to
survive<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.420> many<00:03:09.600> ways<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.020> can<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.440> don't

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
survive as many ways you can I don't

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.310 
survive as many ways you can I don't
know<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.430> there's<00:03:11.580> an<00:03:11.670> end<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.000> sight<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.600> kill

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
know if there's an end in sight but kill

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.950 
know if there's an end in sight but kill
streaks<00:03:13.680> are<00:03:13.890> very<00:03:14.850> expensive<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.600> looks<00:03:15.780> like

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
streaks are very expensive it looks like

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.650 
streaks are very expensive it looks like
and<00:03:16.400> definitely<00:03:17.400> worth<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.180> seems<00:03:18.540> like

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
and definitely worth it it seems like

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.620 
and definitely worth it it seems like
we're<00:03:18.960> right<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.200> top<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.710> air<00:03:19.950> strike

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
we're right on top of that air strike

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.200 
we're right on top of that air strike
location<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:22.100> that's<00:03:23.100> where<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.460> can<00:03:24.030> pick

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
location and that's where you can pick

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.820 
location and that's where you can pick
up<00:03:24.390> your<00:03:24.420> killstreaks<00:03:25.140> maybe<00:03:25.380> those<00:03:25.560> were<00:03:25.800> our

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
up your killstreaks maybe those were our

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.710 
up your killstreaks maybe those were our
armories<00:03:26.550> are<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.940> know<00:03:27.030> explosives<00:03:27.630> or

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
armories are you know explosives or

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.090 
armories are you know explosives or
where<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.870> grenade<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.290> handgun<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:28.950> where

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
in the background I'm just doing this

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.520 
in the background I'm just doing this
live<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.210> you<00:03:36.360> guys<00:03:36.570> as<00:03:36.900> much<00:03:37.050> as<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.320> can

because<00:03:37.770> I<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:39.030> know<00:03:39.150> I'm<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.360> big<00:03:39.570> guy<00:03:39.900> when<00:03:40.170> it

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
because I you know I'm a big guy when it

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.690 
because I you know I'm a big guy when it
comes<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.530> all<00:03:40.680> these<00:03:40.800> different<00:03:40.860> modes<00:03:41.370> I

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
comes to all these different modes I

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.030 
comes to all these different modes I
mean<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.390> looks<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:43.110> care<00:03:43.470> package<00:03:43.680> or

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
mean it looks like a care package or

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.750 
mean it looks like a care package or
maybe<00:03:44.220> even<00:03:44.310> smoke<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.900> smoke<00:03:46.890> areas<00:03:47.280> might<00:03:47.520> be

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
maybe even smoke so smoke areas might be

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.850 
maybe even smoke so smoke areas might be
able<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.420> call<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.630> your<00:03:48.959> air<00:03:49.140> strikes<00:03:49.590> and

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
able to call in your air strikes and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.220 
able to call in your air strikes and
such<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.100> an<00:03:50.430> ac-130<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.480> that's<00:03:52.080> exactly

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
such like an ac-130 and that's exactly

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.660 
such like an ac-130 and that's exactly
what<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.620> looks<00:03:52.800> like<00:03:52.950> when<00:03:53.100> you<00:03:53.190> throw<00:03:53.459> your

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
what it looks like when you throw your

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.090 
what it looks like when you throw your
smoke<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.390> c-130<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.959> gonna<00:03:55.110> hit<00:03:55.740> where<00:03:55.980> the

warfare though a lot of people complain
about<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.530> say<00:04:48.620> why<00:04:48.770> not<00:04:48.890> just<00:04:49.070> click<00:04:49.280> a

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
about it and say why not just click a

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.190 
about it and say why not just click a

button and let someone instantly die um
but<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.250> do<00:04:52.400> like<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.090> return<00:04:53.480> of<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.660> predator

but I do like the return of the predator
missile<00:04:54.380> I<00:04:54.410> think<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:54.950> seems<00:04:55.220> like<00:04:55.580> an

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
missile I think it seems like an

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.410 
missile I think it seems like an
excellent<00:04:55.940> idea<00:04:56.890> moving<00:04:57.890> on<00:04:58.040> now<00:04:58.310> in<00:04:58.700> this<00:04:58.910> we
