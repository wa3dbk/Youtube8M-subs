00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 today now friends a pleasure to be 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.990
 again with you today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.420
 let's talk about the mechanism of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.200
 frank starling or frank's law 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.070
 starling is to say that we are going to talk about 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.539
 the relationship between contractility very 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.449
 attentive eye 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.350
 let's talk about the relationship between 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.070
 against heart activity and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.390
 muscle fiber length I'm 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.960
 saying that the changes and the length 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.239
 of muscle fibers generate changes 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.030
 in contractility let's say that the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.730
 strength in the power with which the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 heart then contracts for that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 I have these three little drawings suppose 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.130
 please with the imagination that it comes to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.950
 three different hearts 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.890
 a very tiny heart that would be the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.390
 ventricular region and these the atria 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.820
 a medium heart 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.260
 atria ventricles and a very heart 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 large ventricles and atria 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.760
 then the question that I want to ask you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.670
 at this time to reflect on 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.700
 of the subject and more than memorize understand 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.690
 what is happening is you consider 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.890
 that the power of contraction is going to 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.770
 be greater or the power of the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.580
 shrinkage will be greater in the heart 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.550
 number 1 number 2 number 3 good if 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.100
 they think that in the tiny heart is 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.880
 the heart that pumps blood that is 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.860
 tiny the contraction is better 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 they are indeed wrong and if 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.070
 they think it's in this they are also 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.479
 wrong 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.320
 the most effective contraction 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.509
 it is done in this heart in the heart 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.820
 median 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.460
 basically if we talk about the law of 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.120
 Frank Starling in Latin America 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.630
 we could say that it is something 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.540
 as not so much that I burn the saint nor so 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.500
 little that does not shine because the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.920
 length of muscle fiber should not 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.830
 being so big should not be so long or 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.830
 it must be so short to be there 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.150
 at a midpoint that alum but that 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.590
 do not burn 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.920
 so that they always have it in 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.480
 account and do not forget let's see 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.280
 I'm going to draw them here the fibers 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 muscle of each of these 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 hearts that is going to take a fiber 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.220
 from each of these hearts and we're going to 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.680
 observe because this heart of the center 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.750
 is the most effective with respect to 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.450
 power that can generate during the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.870
 shrink well then let's see why 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.850
 the best contraction we did not achieve 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.400
 when the heart 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.130
 with a great length or when the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.470
 heart is with a small length the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.530
 reason is extremely simple I know that all 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.710
 you will understand 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.710

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.980
