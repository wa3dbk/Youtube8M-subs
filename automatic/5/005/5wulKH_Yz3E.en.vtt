 welcome to your channel the channel there 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.790
 flowers 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:28.369
 and here is the garden that my 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.410
 dads on the ranch today we are going to enter 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.489
 to see what is all that has 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.430
 planted there my dad here sows this 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.129
 Vegetables and vegetables for consumption 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.580
 of the family is pretty tiny as 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.339
 you can see here they are like three 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.800
 meters wide and long are like 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.110
 seven meters are several things that 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.379
 those who sow here at the entrance 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.930
 we can see an age of onions this 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.489
 is what is called the onion cambray 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.379
 I took some onions now 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.210
 when when we go to breakfast then 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.030
 we come and cut an onion for 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.910
 stew with egg and this here also 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.979
 the onions are planted and this 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.920
 which is seen here in the middle of 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.649
 onions this plantita this a plant 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.369
 of chili here is a papaya plant 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.130
 This is this little girl and here 's another 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.430
 that is a little bigger 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.390
 as we can see here is and this had 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.790
 another truth was cut because 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.130
 because that already paid off but dried 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.990
 after giving the fruit dried here 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.070
 after the onions we see that there 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.020
 Swiss chard are delicious until now 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.600
 they are ready to be eaten to make 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.400
 some that elites 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.340
 I think it is going to be a good breakfast 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.579
 with all these chard 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.219
 here we have cilantro are tiny 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.320
 these are tin of coriander but 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.950
 we can already tear off some leaves 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.840
 to throw the broth as they can 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.310
 watch 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.009
 and here in the background there are tomato plants 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.069
 these tomato plants still do not we 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.810
 they give fruit but already some months more 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.440
 We have been eating tomatoes too 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.569
 of these seedlings and here later 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.560
 we can see that there are radishes these 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.910
 little ones 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.970
 the little ones that are here are radishes 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.280
 there you can there you can see this the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.280
 little head of radish stuck to the ground 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.120
 Here is another little one and there you can see the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.120
 radishes 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.049
 this is lovely this radish 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.140
 because we are not going to cook some eggs 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.269
 we already cut a green onion and then 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.940
 Of course we will accompany him with this one 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.180
 we will accompany it with this one 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.640
 we are going to remove it because this 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.790
 it seems that it is already good to be caught 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.269
 look how delicious is this delicious 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.819
 radish and now we are going to 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.280
 have breakfast and here we have another era 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.370
 quite considerable of radishes here 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.970
 there are enough radishes 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.970
 we can see all this are radishes 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.620
 let's see this they are good they are 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.739
 quite large are fine 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.500
 short ms brian s slowly so that it 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.599
 see how the hand is in a we see that 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.370
 on the other side of the fence 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:43.150
 there are no tomato plants 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.299
 and here we have the milpas that are very 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.269
 little plants are how many 1 2 3 4 5 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.090
 They are 5 plants, but this one is going to 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.190
 give the lot in a few months that you think 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.349
 we will give a few corn Mr. 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.569
 if this will make a good broth 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.670
 with these lots when they are already 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.700
 good these are the ones we call him 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.860
 chiltepÃ­n chiles there is the little plant 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.959
 It is also small because the plants 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.730
 that even though they sometimes dry out or 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.849
 my dad cuts them to plant other 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.120
 things or change the place here there 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.190
 one of chile also this has chile is 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.010
 if this little plant is already a little 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.730
 bigger and we see here the chinitos 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.920
 see the chiles these 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.260
 they are already good and here in the 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.510
 there's another one also from Chile is that 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.910
 these peppers are already bigger these 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.460
 they look like those anaheim chiles because these 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.830
 chile are bigger here there is a chile 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.260
 big and outside it already 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.180
 good for the broth after a while we're going to 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.670
 run a cock to kill him and go 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.200
 to make a carlo with these chips is already 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.480
 It's so big after chillies 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.450
 since there is more tomato seedling almost 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.530
 all around are plants of 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:00.620
 tomato here is a plant this is the 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.450
 which is called the moringa plant which is 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.910
 but about have time to 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.390
 do is a video with this plant 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.180
 It is a medicinal plant and serves to 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.070
 prevent and cure many diseases 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.040
 here this already has red chilitos look 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.630
 How nice of these chiles here has 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.820
 another that is a little orange that 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.800
 this is already good 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.800
 chilies and is 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.530
 every day we come here and we cut 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.830
 what we need for breakfast for 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.659
 the food that is a tiny mango that 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.699
 this they just planted is very 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.460
 I hope that in a few years 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.400
 be it is already giving fruit here 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.770

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.229
