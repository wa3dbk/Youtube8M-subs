problem so it's a combination of doing
some<00:00:42.120> different<00:00:42.239> things<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.320> have

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
some different things and what we have

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
some different things and what we have
to<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> make<00:00:44.100> sure<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.460> change<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to do is make sure that we change the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
to do is make sure that we change the
environment<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.260> less<00:00:46.469> conducive

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
environment so that it's less conducive

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.220 
environment so that it's less conducive
to<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> birds<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> by<00:00:49.020> using

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
to the birds we can do that by using

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
to the birds we can do that by using
gels<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.190> laid<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.940> i-beams

or<00:00:51.629> tree<00:00:51.930> branches<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.070> sticky<00:00:53.460> substance

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
or tree branches it's a sticky substance

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.700 
or tree branches it's a sticky substance
when<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> bird<00:00:54.629> lands<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.260> doesn't<00:00:55.500> like

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
when the bird lands on it doesn't like

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.130 
when the bird lands on it doesn't like
it<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.980> its<00:00:56.129> feet<00:00:56.399> there's<00:00:57.120> also<00:00:57.360> sonic<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it on its feet there's also sonic and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
it on its feet there's also sonic and
ultrasonic<00:00:58.559> devices<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.609> install

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
ultrasonic devices that we can install

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.270 
ultrasonic devices that we can install
and<00:01:00.149> warehouse<00:01:00.480> situations<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.770> will<00:01:01.949> repel

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and warehouse situations that will repel

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
and warehouse situations that will repel
the<00:01:02.309> birds<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> push<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.149> someplace<00:01:03.390> else

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the birds and push them someplace else

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.899 
the birds and push them someplace else
these<00:01:04.379> devices<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.100> give<00:01:05.280> off<00:01:05.460> distress

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
these devices will give off distress

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
these devices will give off distress
calls<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.570> predator<00:01:07.350> calls

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
calls or predator calls

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.219 
calls or predator calls
there's<00:01:08.610> also<00:01:08.850> bird<00:01:09.240> spikes<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.080> use

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
there's also bird spikes that we can use

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
there's also bird spikes that we can use
on<00:01:10.380> top<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.799> signage<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.760> top<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.150> eye

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.969 
on top of signage and on top of eye
beams<00:01:12.600> make<00:01:13.170> sure<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.560> clean<00:01:13.799> those

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
beams make sure that we clean those

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
beams make sure that we clean those
surface<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.490> well<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> then<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.630> glue

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
surface as well and then you just glue

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.149 
surface as well and then you just glue
these<00:01:16.049> down<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> surface

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
these down to the surface

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.870 
these down to the surface
there's<00:01:18.150> also<00:01:18.390> ear<00:01:19.080> tape<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:20.159> reflects

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
there's also ear tape which reflects

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.510 
there's also ear tape which reflects
from<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> Sun<00:01:21.479> birds<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.470> blink<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
from the Sun birds don't blink so it's a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.890 
from the Sun birds don't blink so it's a
deterrent<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.240> move<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.570> someplace

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
deterrent and they move on someplace

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.420 
deterrent and they move on someplace
else<00:01:26.330> we<00:01:27.330> also<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.869> bird<00:01:28.259> netting<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:29.280> are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
else we also have bird netting there are

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910 
else we also have bird netting there are
some<00:01:29.670> situations<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.420> warehouses<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.650> birds

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
some situations in warehouses that birds

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
some situations in warehouses that birds
get<00:01:32.159> into<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.790> corners<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.390> maybe<00:01:33.869> bird

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
get into up in corners and maybe bird

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.569 
get into up in corners and maybe bird
netting<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> best<00:01:35.100> solution<00:01:35.549> for

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
netting would be the best solution for

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.929 
netting would be the best solution for
that<00:01:36.049> remember<00:01:37.049> birds<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.189> difficult<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that remember birds are difficult to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
that remember birds are difficult to
control<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.320> changing<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
control but it's about changing the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
control but it's about changing the
