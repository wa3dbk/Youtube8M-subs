00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.690
 well as your math teacher is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.190
 dearly asked you to solve the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.549
 following equation 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.520
 but because he loves you so much then 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.400
 after solving the equation of 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.380
 ask for the test or check then 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.900
 let's do this exercise 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.689
 where we have to solve that 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 equation and to the right we're going to 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.910
 try yes 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.380
 it was good not the exercise 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.380
 then we proceed like this 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.410
 we give you the same and 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.900
 under 200 of x and this one fifth that 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.890
 is adding would happen to the other side to 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.240
 subtract and this one under like 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.170
 I wanted less one 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.400
 and a fifth 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.290
 then we have here 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.110
 x same and I must do this operation that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.780
 we usually forget how it's done 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.950
 then there are two negatives that make a 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.380
 sum and how do I solve that operation 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.390
 there are several ways to do it myself 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.659
 I recommend then when we work with the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.659
 one 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.359
 I can write a 1 below 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.220
 and 1 over 1 is equal to the workers and not 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.700
 I can write myself as 3 out of 3 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.560
 4 out of 4 and the number that I want if 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.510
 is over 100 2 million over 2 million 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.480
 so 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.050
 they taught me you taught them 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.540
 that then to be able to operate fractions 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.030
 I need you to have miraculous good that 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.960
 here the 1 on 1 would be useful to write 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.960
 5 out of 5 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.240
 then that way he's going to write it 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.650
 this one on one what to write is 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.680
 minus 5 out of 5 to be able to operate 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.720
 easily with that number that I have here 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.380
 so that I would stay two fifths of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.230
 x just how this is done is left the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.660
 same denominator and the numbers of 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.060
 above are added or subtracted according to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.640
 his signs if the two are negative is 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.670
 add up and it would make negative then it gives me 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.670
 minus 6 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.900
 6 out of 5 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.599
 so how do I resolve this 5 that 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.040
 is dividing would happen to multiply the 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.220
 right side and that the ones that are 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.340
 multiplying would happen and then that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.340
 gives 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.650
 - equipment to be equal 5 multiplies the 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.700
 above 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.420
 - 30 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.630
 and this 2 is going to live 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.730
 that we would multiply the 2 by 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.440
 5 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.440
 so we can solve it 5 x 6 32 by 5 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.800
 days 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.460
 the edition is exact 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.510
 if it continues then it's going to be that 32 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.510
 10 is going to be 3 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.110
 and less for more would give less then that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.730
 would be the solution to this equation but 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.890
 it is not enough to do it but it is not 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.400
 expanding a test that would be a support 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.470
 that I replace the letter of x for this 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.470
 number minus 3 and I am satisfied 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.800
 equality then I'm going to write and I 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.800
 you say 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.819
 200 of x plus a fifth equal 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.040
 - good 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.349
 but I'm not going to write the X but 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.629
 I'll change this number x 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.719
 minus 3 and to do it destroy between 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.599
 parentheses this parenthesis means a 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:13.409
 multiplication that will multiply 2 x 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.019
 minus 3 and 5 for this I have here that 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:20.510
 it would be a 1 that there are no fools that the 5 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.320
 for 1 532 for less 3 would give 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.450
 - 6 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.600
 we say and applying them day in the 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.380
 denominator would be 5 by 15 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.200
 and minus six points plus a fifth I'm going to 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.240
 look if I get less one then that 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.530
 We said that if they have the same 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.900
 denominator are placed and operates as of 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.560
 up by two signs are negative 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.710
 devices would be a network therefore 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.520
 six and one if I would answer 5 and the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.520
 zinc major 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.200
 if I'm doing this edition give me 1 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.350
 not exact and applied the and I decide to give 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.020
 minus one then I got to minus one 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.290
 is equal to minus one therefore means 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.380
 that is true and that the exercise of 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.220
 here 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.220
 I'm good
