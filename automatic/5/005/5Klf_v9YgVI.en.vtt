00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:20.539 

because<00:01:11.229> ting

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.810 

but<00:01:21.539> to<00:01:21.689> me<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.259> fantastic<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> think

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
but to me I think it's fantastic I think

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.389 
but to me I think it's fantastic I think
it<00:01:24.000> helps<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:24.509> Minnesota<00:01:24.990> people<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:26.219> right

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
moms

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.490 
moms
players<00:01:28.030> understand<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:30.140> take<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
players understand that to take the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.219 
players understand that to take the
funnel<00:01:30.740> funnel<00:01:31.670> glasses<00:01:32.210> off<00:01:32.390> basically<00:01:32.900> but

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
funnel funnel glasses off basically but

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.810 
funnel funnel glasses off basically but
look<00:01:33.439> what<00:01:33.590> else<00:01:33.770> out<00:01:34.100> there<00:01:34.310> across<00:01:34.549> the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
look what else out there across the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.460 
look what else out there across the
country<00:01:35.180> there<00:01:35.659> are<00:01:35.689> kids<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.080> could<00:01:36.290> play

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
country there are kids that could play

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.139 
country there are kids that could play
this<00:01:36.649> game<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.100> play<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.280> very<00:01:37.610> well

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
this game and play it very well

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.880 
this game and play it very well
so<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:38.570> think<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.110> will<00:01:39.170> help<00:01:39.380> change<00:01:39.619> that

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
so I think it will help change that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.499 
so I think it will help change that
mindset<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.580> little<00:01:40.850> bit<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.180> it's<00:01:41.330> not

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
mindset a little bit that it's not

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.480 
mindset a little bit that it's not
always<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:42.049> about<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.619> Minnesota<00:01:43.159> hockey

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
always just about the Minnesota hockey

00:01:43.490 --> 00:03:15.170 
always just about the Minnesota hockey
with<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:43.820> minnesota<00:01:44.240> kid

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.729 

I<00:03:17.900> thought<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.049> team<00:03:19.230> he<00:03:19.349> played<00:03:19.590> was

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
I thought the team he played was

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.369 
I thought the team he played was
outstanding<00:03:20.239> kids<00:03:21.239> were<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.959> only<00:03:22.110> very

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
outstanding kids were not only very

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.770 
outstanding kids were not only very
talented<00:03:22.680> players<00:03:23.189> but<00:03:23.519> worked<00:03:24.450> extremely

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
talented players but worked extremely

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.170 
talented players but worked extremely
hard<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.769> was<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.760> game<00:03:27.000> that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
hard and it was you know a game that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.170 
hard and it was you know a game that
could<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.390> could<00:03:27.659> have<00:03:27.689> went<00:03:27.900> either<00:03:27.959> way<00:03:28.110> we

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
could have could have went either way we

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.610 
could have could have went either way we
certainly<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.689> finish<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.230> we<00:03:31.530> were

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
certainly you finish and we were

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.750 
certainly you finish and we were
fortunate<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.069> think<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.310> were<00:03:32.370> fortunate

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
fortunate I think we were fortunate

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.220 
fortunate I think we were fortunate
enough<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.909> win<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.269> really<00:03:33.810> because<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.140> could

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
enough to win it really because it could

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.990 
enough to win it really because it could
