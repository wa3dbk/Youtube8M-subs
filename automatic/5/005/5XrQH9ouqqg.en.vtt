00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.179
 i demoting the car is now allowed but 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:22.350
 it will be worth it 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:23.369
 the soft one but when the ground grabbed 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.170
 in her 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 There are people who think that the car 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 it is more beautiful especially the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.990
 young people tactically I think getting a 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.990
 wonderful 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.059
 others come from the clues 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.129
 Batman difficult is not the most sports car 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.660
 the fastest car but looking at the car 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.879
 low of the imposition that he 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:54.940
 is totally modified because the wheel 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.620
 rim 15 for the wheel for the legal 20 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.600
 outlawed from the beginning of May to 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.909
 legislation that allows you to change your 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 the suspension of the car inside certain 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:09.560
 limits is clear the most obvious is the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.220
 from the floor to the bottom of the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.009
 headlights 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.009
 the minimum distance is 48 centimeters 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.770
 and the new measure has to be 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.770
 car's document 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.200
 suspension is very important in 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.670
 behavior of the vehicle of any 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.619
 change requires a lot of care can 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.360
 bring benefits of the car in terms of 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.759
 appearance between use stability 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.950
 sport but it has to be done by taking 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.670
 care not to compromise 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.020
 excessively to comfort and not to 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.130
 mainly to compromise the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.130
 of the vehicle 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.890
 there is no denying that the car lowered 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.050
 looks more sporty 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.060
 but how much to change the suspension 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.390
 may compromise the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.390
 dirigibility 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.990
 who made the tests for us was the ceiling 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 george stock car driver 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.800
 first by car without changes or 70 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.250
 kilometers per hour in third gear 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.300
 I entered the visual and feel the suspension of the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.030
 car working hard and realize 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.900
 that the car moves considerably 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.540
 called proof 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.060
 this brings about relative difficulty in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.060
 can do this test 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.220
 a visit to the workshop where the car comes back 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.480
 to the track 10 centimeters lower one 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.670
 other behavior almost unchanged 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.670
 it makes Islam easier 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 Another test was the deviation after a braking 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900
 strong 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.510
 she again the demoted car seems 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.730
 much younger 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.209
 in a closed circle was also more 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.209
 likes 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.010
 already in the braking of the full one goal 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.910
 in fact I was a little surprised the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.800
 original conventional street car 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.620
 The one I tested first I 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.470
 able to do all the maneuvers more 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.480
 without printing much aggressiveness in the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.670
 car car they carried him 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.700
 was quite comfortable 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.850
 already the car is lowered I got to do 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.100
 all this but more so then 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.440
 I was super satisfied with the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:48.140
 Car result is lowered but 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:55.870
 usually the car is used on the street there 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.870
 has ditch lauded hole 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.640
 the shortest suspension stroke 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.370
 greatly impairs comfort 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.459
 on the rear wheel spine comes out of the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.459
 floor 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.150
 Are you doing this because of 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.310
 competition certainly will not be 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.280
 concerned about comfort and is taking 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.180
 sun and lane so you will put a lot 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.820
 lower 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.660
 a car that you will also use in the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.880
 floor to a normal use would be a night 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.700
 more prudent not to do the 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.470
 dramatic tone relegation so you 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.610
 think beauty and performance is worth one 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.919
 take some care 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.070
 to run well the spring and damper 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.430
 have to combine shorter ball demands 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.980
 a stiffer damper 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.680
 this test evaluates the suspension in several 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.200
 use situations mobile platform simulates 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.090
 the irregularity of the view and even the 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.090
 that happens in the corners 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.789
 if you miss the ball or shorten your 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.219
 a torch is risky and it is not 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:09.020
 The law also allows for the use of 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:11.909
 trousers and adjustable suspensions 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.430
 was this a green sign for our 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.169
 two friends there who are able to pass 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.759
 in the survey that can get a car 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.830
 no problem with the police being able to 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.219
 quiet that never another out 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.219
 of the law, right? 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.889
 yea
