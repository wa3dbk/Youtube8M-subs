00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 6 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.069
 this time it was him 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.309
 recording still dares to make predictions with a printer in 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.949
 collect earmarks 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.240
 10 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.039
 since then it cost them around 600 dollars when 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.310
 commercial for this type of prototypes in three dimensions 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.470
 after so many comings and goings laredo 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.929
 the bundle by mail at 12 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.789
 yes now it will officially be done as before with two more people 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.040
 an atomic weapon and which is not perfumed by the former personal premier 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.410
 on Thursday you need 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.290
 during the summer 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.460
 so they mention 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.900
 in the case of existing the one that will have to wait what is 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.680
 pedrito because it is not a harness or marketing twitter 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.050
 makes it quite complex since the epp and therefore writing is working 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.630
 if programs are used to clean up the image 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 practices 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.870
 the format 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.300
 what what is needed more 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.240
 is very delicate issue is not 5 millimeters in such a way they go 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.960
 generating 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.870
 foto efe in the image the capable safor was trying to create 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.300
 the holder of the quintana we are seeing 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.050
 On the other hand, the professor of the PCC 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.050
 the truth 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
 this calm that there were numerical control machines 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.420
 I keep on numbers 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 that they controlled 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.940
 To generate 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.330
 those that require 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.979
 hopeline the deadline was met 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.150
 he said wait 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.720
 projecting on the pieces 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.440
 it needs to be a little 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.510
 the piece 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.510
 Austin Texas 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.410
 tactically prototypes 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.920
 I incera that used a tasting program that is intended to live well 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.820
 these arrests 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.170
 I think most of them can generate 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.039
 a sort of passive independence hero seems to me excellent that hamilton 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.039
 of mclaren 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:19.479
 so it has to be 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.379
 the printer to recover the old europe belonging to the city where 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.959
 hundreds of players authorities 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.619
 I studied against the mafia 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.279
 the established format 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.279
 so it did not necessarily allow to create programs 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.509
 creators of this printer this August 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.259
 this beauty hostel 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.879
 the cardinal because you think 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.879
 society any problem of them 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.129
 the same levels of liberalization of the cover of the same already trotaba finish 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.689
 with the couple of minutes 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.419
 as you can see 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.359
 the electoral process to friendly people 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.369
 I would say that pajín before because it creates an internal structure 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.259
 because the one to have totally solid but that is a comma 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.109
 I know it is indicating 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.029
 and good is staying solidary solidarity is a solid figure output we try a 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.449
 Swedish party 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.459
 Well, the cases, we can see 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.459
 you have equipment that you are staying there is a raid that sometimes 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.309
 but good is part of the show 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.639
 the prototype is staying 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.639
 and the head states and about 20 degrees Celsius 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:45.849
 although it does not touch to go to a good coxswain 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.849
 the lid depends 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.559
 the cdc gov ar 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.559
 creating with a mesh of equity and 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.569
 to generate the image you want 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.669
 the general tellado 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.489
 Libya be more open 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.249
 portfolio 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.249
 pedestrians who have programmed into the atp 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.259
 so that each treatment 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180
 the traffic is a long long tour 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
 originality 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.779
 not only on the waterfront 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.270
 villén the night well then we have finished with the image 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.370
 we are now raising our heads 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.169
 i in short moments we are going to take 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.169
 this also the platform price relative to how it was 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.979
 and a little later when it gets cold because we're going to clean it 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.879
 It's already over 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.089
 and completed 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:03.870
 so we have the model here 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.680
 Finally 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.300
 we just passed 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.749
 for 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.539
 bilbao carlo de gavardo 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.539
 my brother is imprisoned for labor 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.259
 min 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.400
 see yourself 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.849
 we feel like winning 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.249
 the piece 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:26.569
 what they owe me besides he read 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.419
 from here 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.990
 lorca 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.819
 let's tell you how much employment 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.279
 Ok, here we have the piece 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.610
 shaped 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.469
 a group of people who want 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.319
 the prototype 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.550
 already done 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.550
 the truth that pretty good 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:50.069
