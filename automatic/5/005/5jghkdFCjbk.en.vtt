00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.620 
know the lattice it's it's a very toned
down<00:01:43.170> lattice<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.430> white<00:01:44.759> it's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
down lattice it's it's not white it's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.410 
down lattice it's it's not white it's
not<00:01:45.899> bad<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.680> look<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> wanted<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
not bad to look at but what I wanted to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
not bad to look at but what I wanted to
do<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.750> soften<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.619> bit<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.729> went

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
do was soften it up a bit so we went

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
do was soften it up a bit so we went
with<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.119> nice<00:01:51.329> boxwood<00:01:52.020> hedge<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> back

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
with a nice boxwood hedge in the back

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.700 
with a nice boxwood hedge in the back
here<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:54.149> time<00:01:54.390> goes<00:01:54.630> by<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.899> boxwood

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
here and as time goes by that boxwood

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.160 
here and as time goes by that boxwood
hedge<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> grow<00:01:56.399> up<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.509> three<00:01:57.840> three

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
hedge is going to grow up to three three

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.130 
hedge is going to grow up to three three
and<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> half<00:01:58.439> feet<00:01:58.649> tall<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.180> cover<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.840> base

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
and a half feet tall and cover the base

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
and a half feet tall and cover the base
of<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> lattice<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.090> prune<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
of that lattice now you can prune the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.219 
of that lattice now you can prune the
box<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.990> whatever<00:02:04.170> size<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.119> but

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
box with to whatever size you like but

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.540 
box with to whatever size you like but
my<00:02:07.229> goal<00:02:07.469> there<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
my goal there would be to go for like a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.809 
my goal there would be to go for like a
36<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> 42<00:02:09.599> inch<00:02:09.929> height<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> shrub

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
36 to 42 inch height and then the shrub

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.580 
36 to 42 inch height and then the shrub
we've<00:02:11.970> got<00:02:12.150> planted<00:02:12.540> over<00:02:12.780> here

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
we've got planted over here

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.400 
we've got planted over here
this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> called<00:02:14.400> Katonah<00:02:14.910> yester<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:16.170> has

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
reason you grow it is you can just see

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.059 
reason you grow it is you can just see
it's<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.300> starting<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.569> get<00:02:21.720> its<00:02:22.069> berries

there its fruits these are going to turn

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.199 
there its fruits these are going to turn
red<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.800> late<00:02:26.099> summer<00:02:26.370> through<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> fall<00:02:26.819> off

spreading shrub so as time goes by this

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.850 
spreading shrub so as time goes by this
Katonah<00:02:33.209> asters<00:02:33.599> gonna<00:02:33.750> fill<00:02:34.080> out<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
Katonah asters gonna fill out here and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.710 
Katonah asters gonna fill out here and
it's<00:02:35.549> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.760> soften<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.420> edge<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
it's going to soften the edge of the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.479 
it's going to soften the edge of the
wall<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> bit<00:02:38.750> now<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:40.110> issue<00:02:40.379> we<00:02:40.890> did<00:02:41.160> have

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
wall a bit now one issue we did have

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.210 
wall a bit now one issue we did have
with<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.120> walkway<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:43.590> because<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
with this walkway was because of the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.630 
with this walkway was because of the
change<00:02:44.519> in<00:02:44.670> grade<00:02:44.879> with<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.269> new<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:47.549> know

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
change in grade with the new you know

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.880 
change in grade with the new you know
the<00:02:47.760> new<00:02:47.880> addition<00:02:48.420> they<00:02:48.989> had<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.290> add<00:02:49.410> two

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the new addition they had to add two

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.910 
the new addition they had to add two
steps<00:02:50.280> there<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:52.590> know<00:02:52.739> why

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
steps there but I don't really know why

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.080 
steps there but I don't really know why
exactly<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.150> Masons<00:02:54.569> didn't<00:02:54.930> build

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
exactly that the Masons didn't build

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.289 
exactly that the Masons didn't build
sides<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.569> wall<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.370> there's<00:02:59.819> actually<00:03:00.269> a

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
sides on the wall so there's actually a

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.940 
sides on the wall so there's actually a
downspout<00:03:00.780> if<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.110> take<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> look<00:03:01.530> back<00:03:01.680> there

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
downspout if you take a look back there

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.020 
downspout if you take a look back there
there's<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> downspout<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:04.790> would<00:03:05.790> end<00:03:05.940> up

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
there's a downspout that would end up

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.690 
there's a downspout that would end up
dumping<00:03:06.390> water<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.709> water<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:08.370> just

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
dumping water and if the water was just

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.729 
dumping water and if the water was just
washing<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.420> dirt<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.810> everything<00:03:10.049> onto

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
washing all the dirt and everything onto

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.610 
washing all the dirt and everything onto
the<00:03:10.829> walkway<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.810> what<00:03:12.989> what<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.260> ended<00:03:13.530> up

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the walkway so what what I ended up

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.199 
the walkway so what what I ended up
doing<00:03:13.860> was<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.640> know<00:03:14.730> they've<00:03:14.910> got<00:03:15.030> some

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
doing was I you know they've got some

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.940 
doing was I you know they've got some
beautiful<00:03:15.900> rocks<00:03:16.170> around<00:03:16.530> here

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
beautiful rocks around here

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.250 
beautiful rocks around here
so<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.579> went<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.819> found<00:03:18.030> some<00:03:18.239> nice<00:03:18.420> rocks<00:03:18.750> and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
so I went and found some nice rocks and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.590 
so I went and found some nice rocks and
I<00:03:19.380> placed<00:03:19.709> them<00:03:19.970> along<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.239> edge<00:03:21.359> of<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
I placed them along the edge of the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.629 
I placed them along the edge of the
walkway<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.410> tried<00:03:22.920> not<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.400> anything

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
walkway and I tried not to do anything

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.259 
walkway and I tried not to do anything
too<00:03:23.910> formal<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.579> place<00:03:26.790> them<00:03:27.000> along<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
too formal but we place them along the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.910 
too formal but we place them along the
walkway<00:03:27.630> I've<00:03:27.930> got<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.200> lichens<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
walkway I've got the lichens on the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.949 
walkway I've got the lichens on the
rocks<00:03:29.160> showing<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.880> that's<00:03:30.630> what's<00:03:30.840> gonna

there and then the other thing I did was
where<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.829> where<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.579> drain<00:03:38.880> pipe<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.450> I

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
where this where this drain pipe is I

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.250 
where this where this drain pipe is I
put<00:03:41.819> this<00:03:41.940> little<00:03:42.120> black<00:03:42.419> drain<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.989> know<00:03:43.079> one

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
put this little black drain you know one

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.140 
put this little black drain you know one
of<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.440> most<00:03:43.530> overlooked<00:03:44.190> features<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:44.790> see<00:03:45.030> in

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
of the most overlooked features I see in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.589 
of the most overlooked features I see in
landscapes<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:47.040> downspouts<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.419> what<00:03:48.569> I

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
landscapes are the downspouts so what I

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.449 
landscapes are the downspouts so what I
did<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.169> took<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.440> downspout<00:03:50.010> put<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.400> this

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
did is I took the downspout put in this

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.319 
did is I took the downspout put in this
little<00:03:50.579> black<00:03:50.819> pipe<00:03:51.120> ran<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.169> along<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.620> back

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
little black pipe ran it along the back

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.589 
little black pipe ran it along the back
over<00:03:54.329> here<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.900> then<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.230> comes<00:03:55.470> out<00:03:56.269> into<00:03:57.269> the

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
over here and then it comes out into the

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.470 
over here and then it comes out into the
into<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.319> drive<00:03:58.760> now<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.910> a<00:03:59.940> perfect<00:04:00.359> world

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
into the drive now in a perfect world

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.210 
into the drive now in a perfect world
before<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.169> walkway<00:04:01.500> was<00:04:01.650> built<00:04:01.919> it<00:04:02.099> would

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
before the walkway was built it would

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.270 
before the walkway was built it would
have<00:04:02.310> been<00:04:02.430> very<00:04:02.639> nice<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.709> have<00:04:04.859> run<00:04:05.069> this

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
have been very nice to to have run this

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.300 
have been very nice to to have run this
underneath<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.389> walkway<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.200> then<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.190> could

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
underneath the walkway and then it could

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.729 
underneath the walkway and then it could
have<00:04:08.400> very<00:04:08.430> easily<00:04:08.639> come<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.299> over<00:04:09.599> there<00:04:09.840> but

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
have very easily come out over there but

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.259 
have very easily come out over there but
sometimes<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.579> just<00:04:11.609> got<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:11.880> work<00:04:12.060> with<00:04:12.209> what

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
sometimes you just got to work with what

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.400 
sometimes you just got to work with what
you<00:04:12.480> got<00:04:14.030> now<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.090> other<00:04:15.329> issue<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:15.840> had<00:04:16.019> here

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
you got now the other issue we had here

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.009 
you got now the other issue we had here
was<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.700> know<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.910> old<00:04:18.060> beds<00:04:18.359> didn't<00:04:18.840> have

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
was you know the old beds didn't have

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.409 
was you know the old beds didn't have
this<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.590> kind<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:19.859> curve<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.160> them<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:21.329> know

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
this this kind of curve to them you know

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.940 
this this kind of curve to them you know
we<00:04:21.570> were<00:04:21.690> working<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:22.079> what<00:04:22.260> was<00:04:22.380> there<00:04:22.650> so

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
we were working with what was there so

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.500 
we were working with what was there so
to<00:04:23.039> make<00:04:23.190> things<00:04:23.460> blend<00:04:23.789> in<00:04:23.969> and<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.180> ended<00:04:24.390> up

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
to make things blend in and I ended up

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.700 
to make things blend in and I ended up
carving<00:04:25.490> like

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
carving like

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.680 
carving like
the<00:04:27.039> bed's<00:04:27.220> out<00:04:27.400> over<00:04:27.639> here<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.090> then<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.449> also

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
the bed's out over here and then I also

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.480 
the bed's out over here and then I also
carve<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.380> beds<00:04:29.560> out<00:04:29.710> over<00:04:29.949> there<00:04:30.100> for<00:04:30.370> this

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
carve the beds out over there for this

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.689 
carve the beds out over there for this
kind<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.729> Halfmoon<00:04:30.940> effect<00:04:31.539> and<00:04:32.340> then<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.370> added

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
kind of Halfmoon effect and then I added

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.960 
kind of Halfmoon effect and then I added
some<00:04:33.850> spiraea<00:04:34.449> over<00:04:34.780> here<00:04:35.169> and<00:04:35.349> one<00:04:36.340> Andromeda

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
some spiraea over here and one Andromeda

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.010 
some spiraea over here and one Andromeda
as<00:04:37.090> well<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.750> make<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:38.080> come<00:04:38.289> together<00:04:40.020> okay

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
as well to make it come together okay

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.909 
as well to make it come together okay
and<00:04:41.319> then<00:04:41.530> up<00:04:41.680> here<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:43.440> brought<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.680> lot<00:04:44.889> of

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
and then up here I brought in a lot of

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.800 
and then up here I brought in a lot of
soil<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.490> grade<00:04:45.729> was<00:04:45.970> actually<00:04:46.419> fairly<00:04:46.630> low

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
soil the grade was actually fairly low

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.990 
soil the grade was actually fairly low
here<00:04:47.349> and<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.620> kind<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:47.979> mounted<00:04:48.430> up<00:04:48.550> my<00:04:48.729> grade

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
here and I kind of mounted up my grade

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.659 
here and I kind of mounted up my grade
in<00:04:49.270> this<00:04:49.360> bed<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.830> we<00:04:50.949> would<00:04:51.099> have<00:04:51.220> some<00:04:51.460> more

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
in this bed so we would have some more

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.240 
in this bed so we would have some more
height<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.360> then<00:04:53.169> as<00:04:53.289> our<00:04:53.380> focal<00:04:53.830> point<00:04:54.039> we're

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
height and then as our focal point we're

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.740 
height and then as our focal point we're
doing<00:04:54.550> this<00:04:54.669> beautiful<00:04:55.349> lace<00:04:56.349> leaf<00:04:56.560> maple<00:04:56.860> and

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
doing this beautiful lace leaf maple and

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.730 
doing this beautiful lace leaf maple and
this<00:04:58.750> will<00:04:58.900> get<00:04:59.050> bigger<00:04:59.259> and<00:04:59.410> this<00:04:59.620> will

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
this will get bigger and this will

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.290 
this will get bigger and this will
eventually<00:04:59.830> get<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.220> be<00:05:00.400> maybe<00:05:00.639> five<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.090> six

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
eventually get to be maybe five to six

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.249 
eventually get to be maybe five to six
feet<00:05:01.419> tall<00:05:01.979> similar<00:05:02.979> spread<00:05:03.400> and<00:05:03.729> I<00:05:04.630> also<00:05:04.870> went

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
feet tall similar spread and I also went

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:06.990 
feet tall similar spread and I also went
and<00:05:05.470> picked<00:05:05.919> some<00:05:06.130> rocks<00:05:06.400> out<00:05:06.639> of<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:06.789> woods

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
and picked some rocks out of the woods

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.029 
and picked some rocks out of the woods
again<00:05:07.360> with<00:05:07.840> these<00:05:07.930> beautiful<00:05:08.199> lichens

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
again with these beautiful lichens

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.219 
again with these beautiful lichens
put<00:05:09.910> them<00:05:10.030> at<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.180> level<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:10.660> they<00:05:10.780> look<00:05:10.930> kind<00:05:11.169> of

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
put them at a level so they look kind of

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.100 
put them at a level so they look kind of
natural<00:05:11.710> there<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.280> as<00:05:13.210> things<00:05:13.570> grow<00:05:13.810> in<00:05:13.960> the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
natural there and as things grow in the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.450 
natural there and as things grow in the
more<00:05:14.289> things<00:05:14.560> grow<00:05:14.860> in<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.160> more<00:05:15.310> natural

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
more things grow in the more natural

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.760 
more things grow in the more natural
this'll<00:05:16.030> look<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:17.139> just<00:05:17.349> look<00:05:17.500> at<00:05:17.620> these

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.680 
this'll look and just look at these
beautiful<00:05:18.159> lichens<00:05:18.699> on<00:05:18.849> that<00:05:19.030> rock<00:05:19.240> I<00:05:19.479> mean

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
that is just gorgeous and then we did

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.050 
that is just gorgeous and then we did
continue<00:05:23.320> our<00:05:23.800> boxwood<00:05:24.430> hedge<00:05:24.639> along<00:05:24.819> the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
back over here and there was one

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.640 
back over here and there was one
existing<00:05:28.120> boxwood<00:05:28.720> that<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.500> planted<00:05:31.530> at<00:05:32.530> the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
existing boxwood that I planted at the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.990 
existing boxwood that I planted at the
end<00:05:32.800> of<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:32.979> hedge<00:05:33.190> there<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.490> had<00:05:33.759> to<00:05:33.880> move

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
end of the hedge there I had to move

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.850 
end of the hedge there I had to move
that<00:05:34.210> from<00:05:34.389> somewhere<00:05:34.720> else<00:05:34.750> and<00:05:35.229> it<00:05:35.680> just

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
that from somewhere else and it just

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.899 
that from somewhere else and it just
seemed<00:05:36.009> to<00:05:36.070> fit<00:05:36.190> in<00:05:36.340> really<00:05:36.490> nicely<00:05:36.759> there<00:05:38.909> now

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
seemed to fit in really nicely there now

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.439 
seemed to fit in really nicely there now
on<00:05:40.330> either<00:05:40.599> side<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.940> gate<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.330> the

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
on either side of the the gate to the

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.219 
on either side of the the gate to the
pool<00:05:43.659> we<00:05:44.620> ended<00:05:44.889> up<00:05:45.009> planting<00:05:45.430> a<00:05:46.030> couple<00:05:46.960> dwarf

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
pool we ended up planting a couple dwarf

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.610 
pool we ended up planting a couple dwarf
fountain<00:05:47.620> grasses<00:05:48.330> you<00:05:49.330> know<00:05:50.259> for<00:05:50.500> some

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
fountain grasses you know for some

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.890 
fountain grasses you know for some
summer<00:05:50.860> interest<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.610> then<00:05:52.180> actually<00:05:52.780> this

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
summer interest and then actually this

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.839 
summer interest and then actually this
sedum<00:05:53.349> was<00:05:53.530> already<00:05:53.889> growing<00:05:54.130> in<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.460> bed<00:05:54.639> i<00:05:54.669> I

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
sedum was already growing in the bed i I

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.570 
sedum was already growing in the bed i I
dug<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.389> out<00:05:55.509> when<00:05:55.659> the<00:05:55.719> project<00:05:55.870> started<00:05:56.620> but

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
dug it out when the project started but

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.560 
dug it out when the project started but
to<00:05:57.610> try<00:05:57.940> to<00:05:58.000> make<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.389> landscape<00:05:58.630> fit<00:05:59.349> in<00:05:59.530> to

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
to try to make the landscape fit in to

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.499 
to try to make the landscape fit in to
to<00:06:01.570> what<00:06:02.229> was<00:06:02.349> already<00:06:02.560> here<00:06:03.099> we<00:06:03.400> replanted<00:06:04.389> it

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
to what was already here we replanted it

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.149 
to what was already here we replanted it
I<00:06:04.599> divided<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.139> clump<00:06:05.380> of<00:06:05.590> replanted<00:06:06.070> it

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
I divided the clump of replanted it

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.740 
I divided the clump of replanted it
there<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.639> then<00:06:06.759> I<00:06:06.820> put<00:06:06.849> some<00:06:07.060> over<00:06:07.300> here<00:06:07.659> as

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
there and then I put some over here as

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.659 
there and then I put some over here as
well<00:06:08.039> so<00:06:09.039> you<00:06:09.130> get<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.250> little<00:06:09.460> bit<00:06:09.550> of

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
well so you get a little bit of

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.969 
well so you get a little bit of
repetition<00:06:09.990> so<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.110> repetition<00:06:11.650> is<00:06:11.740> good

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
repetition so the repetition is good

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.820 
repetition so the repetition is good
because<00:06:12.430> that<00:06:13.050> way<00:06:14.050> it<00:06:14.259> feels<00:06:14.620> like<00:06:14.800> a

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
because that way it feels like a

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.430 
because that way it feels like a
landscape<00:06:15.159> is<00:06:15.430> one<00:06:15.840> it's<00:06:16.840> also<00:06:17.050> nice<00:06:17.380> because

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
landscape is one it's also nice because

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.550 
landscape is one it's also nice because
I<00:06:17.830> know<00:06:18.009> there<00:06:18.250> is<00:06:18.370> some<00:06:18.550> sedum<00:06:19.050> mixed<00:06:20.050> in<00:06:20.199> so

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
I know there is some sedum mixed in so

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.459 
I know there is some sedum mixed in so
buying<00:06:20.770> having<00:06:21.099> some<00:06:21.250> sedum<00:06:21.550> mixed<00:06:21.880> in<00:06:22.030> in<00:06:22.750> the

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
buying having some sedum mixed in in the

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:24.870 
buying having some sedum mixed in in the
older<00:06:23.770> part<00:06:23.979> of<00:06:24.039> the<00:06:24.130> landscape<00:06:24.550> and<00:06:24.580> the<00:06:24.729> new

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
older part of the landscape and the new

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.850 
older part of the landscape and the new
part<00:06:25.150> it<00:06:25.449> makes<00:06:25.659> it<00:06:25.810> all<00:06:25.930> seem<00:06:26.139> like<00:06:26.199> one<00:06:26.530> one

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
part it makes it all seem like one one

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.890 
part it makes it all seem like one one
project<00:06:27.130> and<00:06:27.580> if<00:06:28.270> you<00:06:28.360> look<00:06:28.509> over<00:06:28.630> there<00:06:28.840> you

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
project and if you look over there you

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.270 
project and if you look over there you
can<00:06:29.169> see<00:06:29.199> there's<00:06:29.500> some<00:06:29.620> beautiful<00:06:29.860> yarrow

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
can see there's some beautiful yarrow

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.270 
can see there's some beautiful yarrow
and<00:06:30.520> in<00:06:30.699> full<00:06:30.969> bloom<00:06:31.180> so<00:06:32.169> I<00:06:32.199> had<00:06:32.530> some<00:06:32.710> yarrow<00:06:32.979> I

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
and in full bloom so I had some yarrow I

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.120 
and in full bloom so I had some yarrow I
divided<00:06:33.849> and<00:06:33.969> I<00:06:34.150> talked<00:06:34.960> it<00:06:35.080> in<00:06:35.260> right<00:06:35.979> in<00:06:36.070> the

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
divided and I talked it in right in the

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.959 
divided and I talked it in right in the
front<00:06:36.339> over<00:06:36.580> here<00:06:38.010> and<00:06:39.010> then<00:06:39.159> finally<00:06:39.190> I<00:06:39.699> went

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
front over here and then finally I went

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:40.620 
front over here and then finally I went
with<00:06:40.180> some<00:06:40.300> nice

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
with some nice

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.840 
with some nice
you<00:06:40.720> star<00:06:40.990> junipers<00:06:41.530> you<00:06:42.310> know<00:06:42.430> quite<00:06:42.670> often

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
you star junipers you know quite often

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.550 
you star junipers you know quite often
I'll<00:06:43.090> see<00:06:43.270> people<00:06:43.300> planting<00:06:44.020> spreading

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
I'll see people planting spreading

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.220 
I'll see people planting spreading
junipers<00:06:45.070> and<00:06:45.310> the<00:06:46.300> spreading<00:06:46.630> ones<00:06:46.930> can

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
junipers and the spreading ones can

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.640 
junipers and the spreading ones can
sometimes<00:06:47.680> get<00:06:47.920> a<00:06:47.950> little<00:06:48.010> bit

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
sometimes get a little bit

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.480 
sometimes get a little bit
high-maintenance<00:06:50.650> because<00:06:51.190> of<00:06:51.310> all<00:06:51.400> the

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
high-maintenance because of all the

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.430 
high-maintenance because of all the
pruning<00:06:51.730> needed<00:06:52.120> and<00:06:52.270> they'll<00:06:52.840> sometimes<00:06:53.080> get

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
pruning needed and they'll sometimes get

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.050 
pruning needed and they'll sometimes get
disease<00:06:53.770> as<00:06:53.980> well<00:06:54.160> if<00:06:54.310> they're<00:06:54.430> over<00:06:54.550> watered

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
disease as well if they're over watered

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.300 
disease as well if they're over watered
so<00:06:55.810> I<00:06:55.840> really<00:06:56.200> like<00:06:56.350> the<00:06:56.500> blue<00:06:56.680> star<00:06:56.980> because

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
so I really like the blue star because

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.520 
so I really like the blue star because
it's<00:06:57.460> a<00:06:57.520> much<00:06:57.670> more<00:06:57.850> tight<00:06:58.210> habit<00:06:58.660> and<00:06:58.810> I<00:06:59.380> also

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
it's a much more tight habit and I also

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.010 
it's a much more tight habit and I also
like<00:06:59.830> the<00:06:59.950> nice<00:07:00.100> blue<00:07:00.520> color<00:07:00.880> which<00:07:01.780> is<00:07:01.900> going

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
like the nice blue color which is going

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.540 
like the nice blue color which is going
to<00:07:02.080> play<00:07:02.320> very<00:07:02.560> nicely<00:07:02.770> off<00:07:03.070> the<00:07:03.220> red<00:07:03.400> of<00:07:03.520> the

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
to play very nicely off the red of the

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.080 
to play very nicely off the red of the
maple<00:07:03.970> and<00:07:04.680> then<00:07:05.680> the<00:07:06.190> final<00:07:06.580> feature<00:07:06.760> we<00:07:06.970> have

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
maple and then the final feature we have

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.510 
maple and then the final feature we have
in<00:07:07.180> the<00:07:07.240> back<00:07:07.420> of<00:07:07.600> the<00:07:07.660> bed<00:07:07.980> this<00:07:08.980> is<00:07:09.160> a<00:07:09.190> plant

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
in the back of the bed this is a plant

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.020 
in the back of the bed this is a plant
called<00:07:09.850> Clara<00:07:10.570> cleft<00:07:11.350> or<00:07:11.500> alna<00:07:11.860> folia<00:07:12.280> now

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
called Clara cleft or alna folia now

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.690 
called Clara cleft or alna folia now
this<00:07:13.210> has<00:07:13.420> a<00:07:13.450> white<00:07:13.810> bloom<00:07:14.200> and<00:07:14.700> Klepfer

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
this has a white bloom and Klepfer

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.160 
this has a white bloom and Klepfer
actually<00:07:16.150> if<00:07:16.240> I<00:07:16.330> were<00:07:16.450> to<00:07:16.600> walk<00:07:16.780> in<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:17.050> woods

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.170 
actually if I were to walk in the woods
