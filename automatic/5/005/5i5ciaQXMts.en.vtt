00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.299

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.589
 welcome to the magician how long is it 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.799
 since we were last here 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.799

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.400
 Sochi minor adjustments and there the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.369

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.369

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:31.070
 but is also i you told me about that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 someone has called our names 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 nothing at all i told that now 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:45.989
 happened in one of the old languages 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.700
 this one that was still marmot about me 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.649

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.430
 machines that I need you alone 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.789
 just point to this bookcase king 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.789
 as you can see 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.229
 missing yes what should i know my i 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.480
 maybe a little more about that than our names 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.150
 his outspoken king 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.420
 you know we have our lines 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.290
 ejected in the south of the world 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.870
 we are busy doing our evil there 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.420
 spread chaos and anarchy 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.300
 but at the time I was not bowing 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.050
 I have looked at our options 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.370
 for north of the world and me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.640
 saw that in it 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.900
 marino read some curious books 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 this person was very essential 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.340
 so called help how in marino 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.220
 read 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.350
 so i thought why would i still not have it 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.090
 given a book 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.340
 marino is located in the north of the world 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.290
 and he has been given to me 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.450
 full of old texts that assize 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.470
 well studied and able to learn more 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.110
 about 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.100
 helios but there is a little snag 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.050
 under the grass 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.960
 the more she reads from the book the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.000
 more we get a grip on and get 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.590
 so you just go so late at night 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.730
 and thought up 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:22.310
 yes I actually do not test anything tasks 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:25.010
 how come I thought it was too crowded 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.750
 with framework addresses this concern to 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.180

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.390

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.780
 they must be able to trust 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.989
 but if I tell you what is possible in 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.959
 the past of church cards you had then 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.819

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:00.010

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.099

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.370

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.930

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:44.190

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:48.290

 just look but in the past 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:33.039
 knowledge of the past is not always 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:42.670
 my advantage had emese come to isham 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:45.070
