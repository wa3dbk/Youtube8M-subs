have we're optimistic points of view for
it<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> think<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
it but I think this is going to be a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
it but I think this is going to be a
total<00:00:26.699> train<00:00:27.090> wreck<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:29.090> really<00:00:30.090> don't

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
total train wreck and I really don't

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.959 
total train wreck and I really don't
know<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.990> else<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.289> say<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:32.099> will<00:00:32.640> think

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
know what else to say but I will think

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
know what else to say but I will think
it's<00:00:33.120> kind<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> funny<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.260> bring

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
it's kind of funny that if they bring

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.280 
it's kind of funny that if they bring
out<00:00:34.980> many<00:00:35.640> ladders<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> many<00:00:36.540> chairs<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.140> many

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.860 
out many ladders and many chairs in many

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
tables maybe they can put them to good

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470 
tables maybe they can put them to good
use<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.739> kind<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> funny<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:42.270> man

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
wrestling is something that started in

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.640 
wrestling is something that started in
the<00:01:23.820> world<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.240> carnies<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.780> circus<00:01:25.350> freaks

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the world of carnies and circus freaks

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.300 
the world of carnies and circus freaks
so<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.170> its<00:01:28.439> world

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

to<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.939> midgets<00:01:30.869> wrestle<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.740> think

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to have midgets wrestle so I think

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.770 
to have midgets wrestle so I think
everyone<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.520> being<00:01:32.850> unfairly<00:01:33.360> cruel

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
everyone is just being unfairly cruel

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.210 
everyone is just being unfairly cruel
and<00:01:33.960> closed-minded<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:34.979> we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and closed-minded to it I think we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.499 
and closed-minded to it I think we
should<00:01:35.250> give<00:01:35.460> these<00:01:35.579> guys<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> chance<00:01:35.909> cuz<00:01:36.329> El

that<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.250> don't<00:05:35.520> like<00:05:35.640> Dylan<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.180> think<00:05:36.360> he's

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
that I don't like Dylan I think he's

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.880 
that I don't like Dylan I think he's
really<00:05:36.630> won<00:05:36.900> me<00:05:36.930> over<00:05:37.050> with<00:05:37.320> this<00:05:37.560> three<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:37.860> a

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
really won me over with this three and a
