from<00:00:22.830> other<00:00:22.980> aircraft<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.910> looking<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.720> this

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
from other aircraft in looking at this

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.630 
from other aircraft in looking at this
one<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.260> really<00:00:25.439> looks<00:00:25.859> no<00:00:26.130> different<00:00:26.160> than

one it really looks no different than
any<00:00:26.849> others<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.449> inside<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> some<00:00:28.410> magic

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
any others but inside it is some magic

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.580 
any others but inside it is some magic
now<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:30.060> taking<00:00:30.660> data<00:00:30.900> from<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.380> flight

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
now it's taking data from the flight

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.250 
now it's taking data from the flight
management<00:00:31.980> system<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.540> sending<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
management system and it's sending it to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
management system and it's sending it to
the<00:00:34.350> transponder<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.880> transponder<00:00:36.450> is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the transponder and that transponder is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.369 
the transponder and that transponder is
essentially<00:00:37.739> transmitting<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:39.379> GPS

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379

building right here Houston Center what
that<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.070> means<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.210> offshore

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
that what that means is that offshore

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.540 
that what that means is that offshore
let's<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.850> say<00:00:57.030> 150<00:00:57.690> miles<00:00:58.079> offshore

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
let's just say 150 miles offshore

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.639 
let's just say 150 miles offshore
whereas<00:00:59.550> before<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> pilot<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:01.289> unable<00:01:01.469> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
whereas before the pilot was unable to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.850 
whereas before the pilot was unable to
either<00:01:02.160> communicate<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.570> senator<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.680> not

either communicate or senator was not

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
either communicate or senator was not
able<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.939> aircraft<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.659> their<00:01:06.810> radar

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
able to see this aircraft on their radar

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.280 
able to see this aircraft on their radar
screens<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:09.000> slowed<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
screens that that slowed down and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
screens that that slowed down and
hindered<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> IFR<00:01:11.610> process<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.540> many

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
hindered the IFR process and in many

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
hindered the IFR process and in many
cases<00:01:13.080> made<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> impractical<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.150> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
cases made it impractical to go I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.230 
cases made it impractical to go I
thought<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.590> delays<00:01:16.920> separation<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
thought because of delays separation and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
thought because of delays separation and
the<00:01:18.990> fact<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> when<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.799> routed<00:01:20.280> these

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the fact that when they routed these

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.510 
the fact that when they routed these
aircraft<00:01:21.000> offshore<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:22.409> had<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> often<00:01:23.340> take

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
aircraft offshore they had to often take

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
aircraft offshore they had to often take
them<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.880> circuitous<00:01:24.720> routes<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.290> order<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
them on circuitous routes in order to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.819 
them on circuitous routes in order to
maintain<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.520> separation<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
maintain that separation so now when the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
maintain that separation so now when the
pilot<00:01:29.189> Falls<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.670> flight<00:01:29.909> plan<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.240> indicates

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pilot Falls a flight plan and indicates

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410 
pilot Falls a flight plan and indicates
that<00:01:31.560> he's<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.950> DSP<00:01:32.310> equipped<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.210> does<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that he's a DSP equipped it does a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.210 
that he's a DSP equipped it does a
couple<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.900> things<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.470> him<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.070> gives

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
couple of things for him one it gives

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
couple of things for him one it gives
him<00:01:35.460> priority<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.600> Houston<00:01:37.200> Center<00:01:37.560> will

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
him priority because Houston Center will

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370 
him priority because Houston Center will
give<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.130> DSP<00:01:38.490> aircraft<00:01:39.150> eye<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.689> priority

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
give an a DSP aircraft eye for priority

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
give an a DSP aircraft eye for priority
over<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> non<00:01:41.070> ATS<00:01:41.610> mayor<00:01:41.850> okay

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
over a non ATS mayor okay

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170 
over a non ATS mayor okay
okay<00:01:43.350> number<00:01:43.590> two<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.280> I'd<00:01:44.610> mentioned<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
okay number two and I'd mentioned this

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
okay number two and I'd mentioned this
before<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> three

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
before I think that this is a three

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.940 
before I think that this is a three
legged<00:01:47.159> stool<00:01:47.579> those<00:01:47.970> sites<00:01:48.299> offshore<00:01:48.960> also

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
legged stool those sites offshore also

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.179 
legged stool those sites offshore also
have<00:01:50.220> weather<00:01:50.490> reporting<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:52.189> communication

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
have weather reporting and communication

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.179 
have weather reporting and communication
so<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.180> addition<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.990> air<00:01:55.799> traffic

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
so now in addition to air traffic

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.830 
so now in addition to air traffic
knowing<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> position<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.570> aircraft

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
knowing the position of this aircraft

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.469 
knowing the position of this aircraft
they<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:58.590> talk<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.399> pilot<00:01:59.880> through

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
they can also talk to this pilot through

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.620 
they can also talk to this pilot through
that<00:02:00.659> same<00:02:01.020> site<00:02:01.530> offshore<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.969> pilot<00:02:03.450> has

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that same site offshore the pilot has

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.020 
that same site offshore the pilot has
the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.700 
the
advantage<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.720> knowing<00:02:04.930> what<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.320> weather<00:02:05.560> is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
advantage of knowing what the weather is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.920 
advantage of knowing what the weather is
at<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.250> site<00:02:06.549> through<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.119> wuss<00:02:07.510> or<00:02:07.780> they

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
at that site through the a wuss or they

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.169 
at that site through the a wuss or they
automated<00:02:08.560> weather<00:02:08.770> system<00:02:09.310> which<00:02:09.819> he<00:02:10.000> can
