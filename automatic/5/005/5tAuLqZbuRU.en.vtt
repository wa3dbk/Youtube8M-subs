okay<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:44.969> I've<00:00:45.629> been<00:00:45.690> working<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.289> chord

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
okay so I've been working a lot on chord

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.049 
okay so I've been working a lot on chord
voicing<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:49.340> what<00:00:50.340> I'm<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
voicing and so what I'm going to do and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
voicing and so what I'm going to do and
this<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.180> kind<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> essentially<00:00:52.170> what<00:00:52.430> Freddie

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this is kind of essentially what Freddie

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
this is kind of essentially what Freddie
green<00:00:53.760> did<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.800> Ranger<00:00:55.800> Doug<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:57.690> play

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
green did and Ranger Doug is you play

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.459 
green did and Ranger Doug is you play
the<00:00:58.469> sixth<00:00:59.370> string<00:00:59.660> you<00:01:00.660> note<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> sixth

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the sixth string you note the sixth

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.490 
the sixth string you note the sixth
string<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.399> use<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> fifth<00:01:02.910> string<00:01:03.239> note<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
string and use the fifth string note the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
string and use the fifth string note the
third<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.640> fourth<00:01:05.909> string<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:07.909> always

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
third and fourth string and then always

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.410 
third and fourth string and then always
mute<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> last<00:01:10.049> two<00:01:10.290> strings<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> essentially

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
mute the last two strings so essentially

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.530 
mute the last two strings so essentially
you're<00:01:12.630> playing<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.080> three<00:01:13.110> string<00:01:13.619> guitar<00:01:14.540> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you're playing a three string guitar and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.160 
you're playing a three string guitar and
skipping<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> string<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.759> every<00:01:18.299> every

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
skipping a string here so every every

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.340 
skipping a string here so every every
chord<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.830> hear<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:22.080> fall

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
chord that you hear in this will fall

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.480 
chord that you hear in this will fall
into<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.890> same<00:01:23.450> voicing<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
into that same voicing and it's kind of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.429 
into that same voicing and it's kind of
a<00:01:26.549> neat<00:01:26.700> sound<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.960> sometimes

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
a neat sound because you know sometimes

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
a neat sound because you know sometimes
you're<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> put<00:01:29.540> something

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you're going to have to put something

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
you're going to have to put something
that's<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.259> root

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that's not the root

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's not the root
on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> top<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> strange<00:01:36.689> it's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
on the top so it's kind of strange it's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.560 
on the top so it's kind of strange it's
it's<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.770> weird<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> hear<00:01:38.579> once<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> once

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
