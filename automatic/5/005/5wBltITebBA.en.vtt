00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.690
 all afternoon the heat of dialing 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.509
 Hello, people, my name is Carol. 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.460
 everybody calls me carol ghetto and 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.550
 I decided to make the channel because I'm a 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 addicted to youtube so you can select and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 so why not make a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.289
 channel is for me then the intention of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.300
 thinking about creating content that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 I would like to see doing things in my 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.820
 Head then in today's video I'm going 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.590
 talk about the five books that I most 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.380
 I liked it there in 2014 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.899
 I wanted to talk a little bit is imported a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.590
 society the role of fair play I have 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.870
 two letters from the album and I started to read 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.550
 and interpret the media in with the foot behind 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.950
 because I had seen a lot of people 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.219
 saying badly that he did not like it final 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.840
 It was very random but dear, I loved it. 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 this book talking so fast 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.140
 about what it is the story of a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.379
 boy called quentin what the sevilla that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.110
 is a normal teenage boy to 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.360
 school every day of their lives. 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 a girl that he was a super friend of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.590
 childhood neighbor of his and that currently 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.240
 She studies in the same school as him but she 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.580
 is part of the popular 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.710
 this first contact and she will one day hit 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.840
 in the middle of the night he talks to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.520
 the companies to leave an adventure he 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 have an incredible night making several 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 cool things together and he celebrates 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 expectation of the next day already in 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.100
 school finds that her hand is bitter and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 arrive there he does not find 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 and then I had to talk about it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 his music because she understands a little 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.380
 her personality is where the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 to prepare but any analogy with the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 imported which is a very 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 odd that I'd rather not say what 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.799
 is that you find out how to read in the book I loved 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 I think it talks a lot about the philosophy of 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.799
 life just like that 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
 because with the line that make me dance 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.840
 in my life then the best person 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.610
 books in sukhumi but ok nor portal was 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.610
 the other book that I wanted to talk is 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.000
 extraordinary art in palace book 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.599
 cute almost like this from the point of view 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.510
 view of writing of soothing 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.310
 really you can leave a child 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.769
 law she is calm and tells the story 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.360
 of the glasses that the boy intends 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.780
 possible damages 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.660
 he has a disease that is genetic and she 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.080
 gave partial disability he is 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.810
 really really like the formed 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.940
 incredible thing is that as it deals with 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.830
 this situation with which it deals with 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.230
 school is an environment that we know 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.450
 It can be very stylish, even it's a 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.060
 true life lesson for everybody 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.209
 is that a person with this so 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.340
 bad inside and you 're such an incredible people. 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.440
 made me cry made him cry the hell 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.569
 The third book I wanted to talk to is a 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.370
 science fiction I already said 50 million 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.070
 of times in all places of the universe 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.959
 which is the exterminator game I think 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.209
 will not repeat his synopsis because it is 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.640
 difficult and also because I have already 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.530
 cylinder in video gws not to stay 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.600
 is a book that has been 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.000
 commissioned by Flemish in my time 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.440
 She said that book and a lot of ball. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.230
 it took much longer when 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.569
 finally changed my life he has 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.790
 a sensational writing where only 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.850
 but he mixes philosophy 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.519
 politics mixes things so it seems to be 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.989
 very much nerd he is even that you 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.970
 do not identify with this type of 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.609
 literature I think it might be that you 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.739
 I like emails and third book has 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:37.260
 kill for blue coats for sure 5 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.569
 buy the stars of course an earring 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.720
 that I will say not everyone knows about 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.440
 his existence 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.260
 You do not know the story. 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.050
 I will explain super fast from the region that 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.790
 is a teenage girl has cancer and 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.280
 she goes to the support group that 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.210
 thank you for the mother and there she knows a 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.420
 August boy who is a Brazilian people . 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:06.790
 and we find that life can be 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.440
 very legal when required by law it is 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.450
 a book that did not make me cry but the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.820
 movie made it look funny and why 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.620
 last I'm American would be beautiful 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.080
 No one but a long time ago had never 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.760
 I read none of them was the first single I 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.760
 I think I started very well in half 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.670
 I actually read things about my game 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.800
 Stedman star party a little bit either 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.169
 I have law I'm not even close to finishing 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.210
 and so the good balance basically the 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.210
 history is based more on the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.160
 premise that the gods only exist 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.910
 from the moment that you with your 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.160
 then in the time of Greek god for example 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.350
 he only became real figures who 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.930
 there is a worshiper from the moment that 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.230
 you leave from the doral they pass the 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.300
 lose strength and this as god and today in 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.700
 day in the world that we live the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.650
 technology one of the most beloved things 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.860
 television technology and so on 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.780
 basically what is proposed is that these 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.020
 things we love today too 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.900
 did not give the ancient gods they kind 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.530
 want to get his post back 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.720
 while the new gods do not 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.570
 is a no less interested in 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.110
 losing is but the adult is stronger nÃ© 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.530
 not 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.470
 face you enter the gay universe you 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.770
 can anyone imagine what the 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.510
 their status 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.040
 battling then this is the fifth book 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.690
 I think it's this 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.640
 I also want to know that you parents 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.030
 It was the books you read the most. 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.880
 liked 2014 telling us to start in 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.520
 tell on twitter with the tech cuca 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.620
 so in the lac channel in the middle of 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.770
 live the next fight to 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.470
 achieve this for the television crew 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.240
 now I only see certain movies instead of 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.240
 youtube is a marvel, right?
