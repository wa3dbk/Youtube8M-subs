insulation system run we're using on

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.560 
insulation system run we're using on
this<00:00:16.619> house<00:00:16.830> we've<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.119> hybrid

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this house we've got really a hybrid

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.000 
this house we've got really a hybrid
system<00:00:18.750> where<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:19.529> types<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
system where we have two types of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.560 
system where we have two types of
insulation<00:00:20.400> being<00:00:20.850> used<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.180> these<00:00:21.300> walls

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
insulation being used in these walls

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.790

these<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.580> 2x4<00:00:23.660> exterior<00:00:24.660> walls<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.230> think

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
these are 2x4 exterior walls I think

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.290

the<00:00:30.689> outside<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.500> here's<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:32.759> doing

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the outside and here's what we're doing

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.280 
the outside and here's what we're doing
on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> inside<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.719> cavity<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
on the inside of this cavity this is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.080 
on the inside of this cavity this is
what<00:00:34.559> they<00:00:34.680> call<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> closed<00:00:35.370> cell<00:00:35.640> phone<00:00:35.910> you

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
what they call a closed cell phone you

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.540 
what they call a closed cell phone you
can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> can't<00:00:36.719> push<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
can see I can't push on it at all it's a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.750 
can see I can't push on it at all it's a
super<00:00:39.030> tough<00:00:39.239> phone<00:00:39.960> very<00:00:40.379> very<00:00:40.620> rigid<00:00:40.920> much

we spray that to a minimum depth of 1

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
we spray that to a minimum depth of 1
inch<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.910> that's<00:00:48.120> done<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.420> that's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
inch and what that's done is that's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.690 
inch and what that's done is that's
given<00:00:49.020> us<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> perfect<00:00:49.680> air<00:00:49.890> seal<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
given us a perfect air seal on the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
given us a perfect air seal on the
outside<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.239> house<00:00:51.449> also<00:00:52.199> adds<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.620> lot<00:00:52.800> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
outside of this house also adds a lot of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.410 
outside of this house also adds a lot of
structural<00:00:53.280> rigidity<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.879> house<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
structural rigidity to the house and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
structural rigidity to the house and
then<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.140> we're<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> come<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.710> behind

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
then what we're going to come in behind

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.209 
then what we're going to come in behind
that<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.199> wet<00:00:58.199> blown<00:00:58.530> cellulose

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that and do is do a wet blown cellulose

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
that and do is do a wet blown cellulose
or<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.699> call<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> damp<00:01:00.210> alone<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
or what they call it damp alone so this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
or what they call it damp alone so this
hey<00:01:01.320> before<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> leave<00:01:01.890> real<00:01:02.070> quick<00:01:02.250> though

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
hey before you leave real quick though

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.979 
hey before you leave real quick though
let<00:01:02.520> me<00:01:02.550> show<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> outside<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
let me show you on the outside the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
let me show you on the outside the
outside<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> house<00:01:04.619> also<00:01:04.920> has<00:01:05.309> 3/4<00:01:06.000> inch

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
outside of the house also has 3/4 inch

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.230 
outside of the house also has 3/4 inch
white<00:01:07.040> basically<00:01:08.040> styrofoam<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> outside

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
white basically styrofoam on the outside

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
white basically styrofoam on the outside
so<00:01:09.570> we've<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.740> inch<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.040> closed<00:01:11.310> cell<00:01:11.670> or

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
so we've got one inch of closed cell or

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
so we've got one inch of closed cell or
part<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.360> inch<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.689> rigid<00:01:13.320> foam<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
part of a one inch of rigid foam on the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460 
part of a one inch of rigid foam on the
outside<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:15.060> inch<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.450> closed<00:01:15.780> cell<00:01:16.110> rigid

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
outside one inch of closed cell rigid

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.230 
outside one inch of closed cell rigid
foam<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.790> walk<00:01:17.970> around<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
foam here and if you walk around the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.310 
foam here and if you walk around the
corner<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.930> where<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> guys<00:01:19.290> are

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
corner you can see where the guys are

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.990 
corner you can see where the guys are
starting<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.890> blow<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.340> damp<00:01:20.790> alone

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
starting to blow the damp alone

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.080 
starting to blow the damp alone
cellulose<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.890> here's<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.340> cellulose<00:01:23.820> right

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
cellulose so here's the cellulose right

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.840 
cellulose so here's the cellulose right
here<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> dead<00:01:25.590> blood<00:01:25.830> product<00:01:26.310> we're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
here this is a dead blood product we're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
here this is a dead blood product we're
filling<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> half

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
filling up the other two and a half

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
filling up the other two and a half
inches<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.890> three<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> half<00:01:29.460> inch
