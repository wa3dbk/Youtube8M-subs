then<00:00:00.709> causing<00:00:01.709> me<00:00:01.829> so<00:00:02.040> much<00:00:02.100> grief<00:00:04.460> so<00:00:05.460> as<00:00:05.819> we

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
then causing me so much grief so as we

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.140 
then causing me so much grief so as we
can<00:00:06.060> see<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:07.109> my<00:00:07.319> hoping<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:08.069> hear<00:00:08.309> an

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
can see here is my hoping to hear an

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
can see here is my hoping to hear an
orange<00:00:09.840> LED<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.590> blinking<00:00:10.620> happy<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.889> we're

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
orange LED is blinking happy and we're

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.060 
orange LED is blinking happy and we're
all<00:00:14.160> set<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.910> test<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.990> software<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.830> that

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
all set to test the software here that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.290 
all set to test the software here that
should<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.760> give<00:00:18.060> us<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:19.160> PWM<00:00:20.160> output<00:00:21.000> that's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
should just give us a PWM output that's

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.620 
should just give us a PWM output that's
dependent<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:23.930> throttle<00:00:24.930> pot<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.630> we

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
dependent on the throttle pot here so we

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.889 
dependent on the throttle pot here so we
have<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.050> scope<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:31.189> on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.910> scope

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
have the scope here on the on the scope

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.310 
have the scope here on the on the scope
here<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.100> gate<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.719> first<00:00:38.960> IGBT<00:00:39.960> here

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
here on the gate of the first IGBT here

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.580 
here on the gate of the first IGBT here
which<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.469> going

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
which is this going here so we're going

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.270 
which is this going here so we're going
to<00:00:43.680> power<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.149> I've<00:00:45.570> got<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.280> DC

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to power this up now and I've got a DC

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.650 
to power this up now and I've got a DC
amp<00:00:47.730> clamp<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.660> most

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
amp clamp on here it's not the most

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.619 
amp clamp on here it's not the most
accurate<00:00:52.699> thing<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.500> it<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.680> give<00:00:55.860> us<00:00:56.629> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
accurate thing but it will give us a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.459 
accurate thing but it will give us a
general<00:00:58.559> idea<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.550> how<00:01:00.090> much<00:01:00.780> current<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
general idea of how much current that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.740 
general idea of how much current that
were<00:01:01.680> drawing<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.100> our<00:01:02.489> 12<00:01:02.760> volt<00:01:02.850> gel

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
were drawing from our 12 volt gel

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
were drawing from our 12 volt gel
battery<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:05.760> turn<00:01:06.510> over<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.700> starter

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
battery here to turn over the starter

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.109 
battery here to turn over the starter
here<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:10.280> I'll<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.729> ahead<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.689> start<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
here so I'll go ahead and just start to

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.810 
here so I'll go ahead and just start to
advance<00:01:16.310> PWM

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.780 

from<00:01:21.090> start<00:01:21.480> to<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.870> it<00:01:22.050> take<00:01:22.500> shape<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.400> go

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
from start to see it take shape and go

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.150 
from start to see it take shape and go
and<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.050> see<00:01:25.260> we're<00:01:25.440> starting<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> draw

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
and you can see we're starting to draw

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.490 
and you can see we're starting to draw
some<00:01:26.520> Corinth<00:01:26.970> there<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.480> as<00:01:27.720> well<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
some Corinth there now as well as I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.770 
some Corinth there now as well as I
increase<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
increase it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
increase it
quarantine<00:01:30.780> creases<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:31.620> above<00:01:34.460> our<00:01:35.460> starter

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
quarantine creases and above our starter

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.990 
quarantine creases and above our starter
start<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.600> tar<00:01:36.870> now<00:01:39.380> whenever<00:01:40.520> 26<00:01:41.520> amps

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
start with the tar now whenever 26 amps

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.290 
start with the tar now whenever 26 amps
there<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.330> 27<00:01:42.900> amps<00:01:43.430> can<00:01:44.430> hear<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.820> Harding

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
there are 27 amps can hear with Harding

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.300 
there are 27 amps can hear with Harding
now<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> bit<00:01:48.150> of<00:01:48.330> extra<00:01:48.900> face<00:01:49.590> hair<00:01:50.040> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
now and on a bit of extra face hair so

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.690 
now and on a bit of extra face hair so
we<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:51.500> hopefully<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> bending

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
we can hopefully see the bending

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.230 
we can hopefully see the bending
starting<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:58.050> spinning<00:01:59.000> the<00:02:00.000> only

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
starting that and spinning the only

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
starting that and spinning the only
thing<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:03.750> interesting<00:02:03.960> problem

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
thing that that's interesting problem

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.290 
thing that that's interesting problem
there<00:02:06.710> okay<00:02:07.710> let<00:02:08.130> me<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.250> start<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
there okay let me just start with the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.010 
there okay let me just start with the
pot<00:02:09.540> down<00:02:09.780> okay<00:02:10.730> but<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.910> increase<00:02:12.420> which<00:02:12.840> we

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
pot down okay but we increase which we

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:29.500 
pot down okay but we increase which we
are<00:02:13.140> quarantine<00:02:13.830> free

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:39.800 

all<00:02:33.290> fitting<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.470> crazy<00:02:36.800> around<00:02:37.800> 44<00:02:38.760> now<00:02:39.480> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
all fitting like crazy around 44 now I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.350 
all fitting like crazy around 44 now I
have<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.770> drive<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.070> battery<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.850> stage

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
have to drive the battery of the stage

00:02:42.360 --> 00:03:07.130 
have to drive the battery of the stage
so<00:02:43.430> get<00:02:44.430> off<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:55.010> me<00:03:04.550> throwing<00:03:05.550> about<00:03:06.060> mark<00:03:06.900> be

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
so get off of me throwing about mark be

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.210 
so get off of me throwing about mark be
warm<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.010> half<00:03:08.220> ounce<00:03:08.580> or<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.830> going<00:03:10.830> to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
warm and a half ounce or so going to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.720 
warm and a half ounce or so going to
have<00:03:11.370> me<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.580> little<00:03:11.610> bit<00:03:11.940> concerned

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
have me a little bit concerned

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.729 
have me a little bit concerned
so<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:14.970> can<00:03:15.090> see<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.420> too<00:03:15.600> low<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.050> camera

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
so if you can see it too low with camera

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.710 
so if you can see it too low with camera
look<00:03:16.980> there<00:03:17.850> there<00:03:18.230> spike<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.420> gate

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
look there there spike here for the gate

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.020 
look there there spike here for the gate
arms<00:03:22.410> off<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.540> need<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.840> try<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.080> figure<00:03:25.410> out

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
arms off so I need to try to figure out

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.479 
arms off so I need to try to figure out
what's<00:03:27.030> going<00:03:27.329> on<00:03:27.660> there<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.370> think<00:03:29.370> our

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
what's going on there I think our

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.140 
what's going on there I think our
battery<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:29.970> starting<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.630> die<00:03:30.870> here<00:03:31.290> now

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
battery is starting to die here now

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.120 
battery is starting to die here now
causing<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.480> star<00:03:34.049> for<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.739> bit<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
causing a star for to have a bit of a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.900 
causing a star for to have a bit of a
heart<00:03:35.370> attack<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.500> increase<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.190> PW<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.760> have

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
heart attack and increase the PW I have

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:48.590 
heart attack and increase the PW I have
a<00:03:38.940> small<00:03:39.269> but<00:03:45.140> she's<00:03:46.140> God<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.620> would<00:03:46.739> imagine

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
a small but she's God I would imagine

seem to solve this part off issue here
if<00:06:47.080> you<00:06:47.230> gave<00:06:47.410> a<00:06:47.440> scale<00:06:47.980> up<00:06:48.190> this<00:06:56.430> takes<00:06:57.430> a<00:06:57.550> bit

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
if you gave a scale up this takes a bit

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:07.340 
if you gave a scale up this takes a bit

spinning<00:07:08.350> away<00:07:10.950> yeah<00:07:11.950> I<00:07:12.840> think<00:07:13.840> so<00:07:14.140> far<00:07:15.030> need

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
spinning away yeah I think so far need

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.410 
spinning away yeah I think so far need
to<00:07:16.240> beat<00:07:16.600> this<00:07:16.900> top<00:07:17.110> with<00:07:17.350> the<00:07:17.560> 1600<00:07:18.430> rpm<00:07:18.940> ie

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.420 
to beat this top with the 1600 rpm ie

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.800 
to beat this top with the 1600 rpm ie
the<00:07:19.750> keys<00:07:20.020> that<00:07:20.050> I<00:07:20.350> have<00:07:20.530> coming<00:07:20.800> in<00:07:21.040> now

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810

the keys that I have coming in now
hopefully<00:07:22.810> we'll<00:07:24.240> see<00:07:25.240> how<00:07:25.480> that<00:07:26.550> idea

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590
