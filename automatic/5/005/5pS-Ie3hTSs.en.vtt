00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello how about friends from to introduce 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.800
 one of my lines of the twists and you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.990
 brady with hatch 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.490
 well what is the characteristic of these 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.230
 Roosters that I really like 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.120
 very good when selecting the 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.340
 feature that are very strong roosters 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.189
 They are very resistant roosters and they are very 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.800
 smart in combat when you 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.220
 you need to fly high they do it when you 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.680
 you need this quickness of legs do it 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.130
 then they are roosters that to my point of 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.720
 view are very complete roosters in the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.760
 combat 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.940
 What I especially like is that 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.350
 enter the shock to the legs in front 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.960
 fall to the floor are removed yes and again 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.370
 when they have their rival close they dance 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.980
 standing up 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.809
 the legs come out then that really 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.589
 these cocks I like a lot because 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.379
 I recycle because when you win fighting I 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.809
 they come out almost clean or with very 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.449
 mild now good this kind of roosters 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.449
 that are very fliers that are liberal 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.390
 from legs to certain fast points I 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.920
 I recommend a type of snack with 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 advantage is to say maximum an advantage of 3 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.640
 millimeters for example this snack that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.420
 Skin is skin 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.610
 Eel skin has 13 millimeters in 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.060
 the part here opposite 2 millimeters 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 in the back now you're this 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.540
 I always recommend botana with a 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.240
 razor of this type comes out that is with 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.960
 full heel and that is straight for 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.460
 compensate a little better and is more or 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.240
 less would be like this 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.220
 it would be like this more or less now if we see it 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 our on this good side 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:58.880
 we see it from this side friends 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.840
 that would be a boot with this 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 type of knife 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.050
 txiki as it would be lonely 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.470
 and if they realize it, I have always 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.980
 said that at the time of the snack 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.080
 the razor is well seated and in the end 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.260
 of accounts I sign here 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.850
 then I in this case 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.000
 how many results have been given to me 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.310
 this line of roosters because I raised her and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.100
 because I love him he left him and I loose him in 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.620
 the moment of combat such friends I hope 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.020
 let this information serve you 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.790
 it serves you me 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.790
 worked fine thank you very much
