00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
ball joint so it pretty much could

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.180 
ball joint so it pretty much could
rotate<00:03:34.770> all<00:03:35.160> around<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.730> everything<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:38.100> it's

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
rotate all around and everything so it's

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.340 
rotate all around and everything so it's
