to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> landscape<00:01:11.490> photography<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.100> i<00:01:14.100> came

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to the landscape photography so i came

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.340 
to the landscape photography so i came
up<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.290> design<00:01:16.440> i'm<00:01:16.979> gonna<00:01:17.160> call

up with the design i'm gonna call

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
up with the design i'm gonna call
organic<00:01:19.729> because<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.000> forms<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> chase<00:01:21.660> are

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
organic because it forms and chase are

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.770 
organic because it forms and chase are
natural<00:01:22.619> forms<00:01:22.979> instead<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> boxes<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.690> know

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
natural forms instead of boxes you know

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.980 
natural forms instead of boxes you know
buddy<00:01:24.960> boxes<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.619> nature<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.220> normal<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.030> i

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
buddy boxes in nature very normal so i

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
buddy boxes in nature very normal so i
create<00:01:28.770> some<00:01:28.979> forms<00:01:29.280> its<00:01:29.430> might<00:01:29.760> be<00:01:30.360> suggested

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
by and I felt it before

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.340 
by and I felt it before
which<00:01:37.270> they<00:01:37.540> where<00:01:37.720> they<00:01:37.870> really<00:01:38.080> love<00:01:38.230> the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.320 
which they where they really love the
design<00:01:38.680> but<00:01:39.670> then<00:01:39.790> we<00:01:39.880> had<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.030> go<00:01:40.120> through<00:01:40.270> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
design but then we had to go through the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.450 
design but then we had to go through the
process<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:41.080> working<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.680> neighbors<00:01:42.010> and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
process of working the neighbors and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.160 
process of working the neighbors and
work<00:01:42.700> with<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.940> gentleman<00:01:43.120> there<00:01:45.990> cause<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
work with the gentleman there cause the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.980 
work with the gentleman there cause the
house<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.590> be<00:01:47.740> traditionally<00:01:48.550> is<00:01:48.790> because<00:01:49.360> we

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
house to be traditionally is because we

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.600 
house to be traditionally is because we
had<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.170> couple<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.590> batters<00:01:50.830> faced<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:54.070> he

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
wanted to back this way but that

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.400 
wanted to back this way but that
actually<00:01:58.330> made<00:01:58.600> our<00:01:58.720> deal<00:01:58.900> better<00:01:59.080> because

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
actually made our deal better because

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.690
