00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:15.190
 Hello I am today 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:16.670
 A few days ago with the introduction of lenses A story about the handling of protective filters and lenses 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:23.810
 When 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.890
 It has appeared though nikkor af s nikkor 50mm f 1.4 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.440
 g lens 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.310
 I hope to introduce you here a little 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.310
 Do you have 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.720
 It was trims 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.720
 It is such an image when attached to 800 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.310
 It is what looks like 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.820
 Masu entered Tei 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.820
 So 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 Feeling of copying 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.330
 Of this plane 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.320
 It is taking the road a little talked name for a photo 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.659
 Though you want compared 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.899
 On top of that when I buy a little lens 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.069
 I'm most concerned Autofocus speed 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:29.950
 Because the lens of that dog of this place contains a motor inside 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:31.370
 The speed of this motor makes the speed quite good depending on the performance of the lens 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.840
 It will change 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:44.530
 So I think that I want to introduce you to a little is Hey door up its sides 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.530
 Please refer to the square dregs speed in a state in which the attached now lens to octopus 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:03.580
 It will be such a speed 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:06.600
 A little shooting using this bonus plane to make a little shooting of the difference of f 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.410
 If you can see 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.410
 I think f is a bit over with 5.6 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.290
 It is good to enter 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 f value 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.350
 We will make wealth 4 f 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.870
 Hmm 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.769
 f 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.769
 2.8 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.930
 Has entered 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.310
 May 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.420
 Enter f and f 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.420
 It becomes 8 contains 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.680
 f 1.4 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.390
 How was it to have you look at it ? 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.790
 8 a little bit now 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.110
 Though I've been to change the shooting edge is better to leave with this lens still one I Is 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.880
 Good 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.460
 I think that it is good 50 mm of the standard said from the old days after all 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:40.340
 Really close to 3 human eyes 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:47.470
 Because it is a lens of the angle of view , if you have money, first of all 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:51.200
 Either 50 mm 1.4 or 1.8 of here you first think is better, which is in the hand 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.830
 I know you After all means get 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.880
 In Ittenyon 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.700
 Or 1.8 for 1.8 lenses 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.670
 Please try to in to the shooting 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.610
 That particular thing when you take something or go through people 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.470
 Because the condition of the surrounding blur makes the shot taken out 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.560
 By all means single focus lens 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.500
 Who was bought is your consideration is try changing the aperture value 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.910
 Please try to enjoy 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.750
 I think one of the fun of the photo is found 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.750
 This side is today
