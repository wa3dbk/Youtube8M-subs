00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.600 

I'm<00:00:07.870> very<00:00:08.230> concerned<00:00:08.500> about<00:00:08.740> the<00:00:09.219> fact<00:00:09.430> that

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
I'm very concerned about the fact that

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.660 
I'm very concerned about the fact that
there<00:00:09.850> is<00:00:09.969> a<00:00:10.000> waste<00:00:10.360> separation<00:00:10.870> system<00:00:11.710> for

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
there is a waste separation system for

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.839 
there is a waste separation system for
me<00:00:12.910> a<00:00:12.940> green<00:00:13.269> city<00:00:13.540> should<00:00:13.990> be<00:00:14.230> with<00:00:14.920> parks<00:00:15.519> and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
me a green city should be with parks and

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.870 
me a green city should be with parks and
with<00:00:16.420> the<00:00:16.660> pure<00:00:17.439> air<00:00:17.740> I<00:00:18.400> want<00:00:18.670> to<00:00:18.730> make<00:00:18.820> the

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
with the pure air I want to make the

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.859 
with the pure air I want to make the
pleasant<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.240> live<00:00:19.360> we<00:00:19.509> want<00:00:19.630> to<00:00:19.690> make<00:00:19.779> them

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
pleasant to live we want to make them

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.120 
pleasant to live we want to make them
sustainable<00:00:20.080> in<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.529> future<00:00:20.590> and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
sustainable in the future and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.800 
sustainable in the future and
sustainable<00:00:21.670> growth<00:00:21.789> in<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.060> future<00:00:22.210> so<00:00:22.630> that

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
sustainable growth in the future so that

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.380 
sustainable growth in the future so that
they<00:00:22.930> can<00:00:23.080> continue<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.560> grow<00:00:24.090> yeah<00:00:25.090> there<00:00:25.300> are

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
they can continue to grow yeah there are

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.000 
they can continue to grow yeah there are
some<00:00:25.510> cities<00:00:25.810> in<00:00:26.050> which<00:00:26.080> you<00:00:26.470> have<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.740> center

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
some cities in which you have the center

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.279 
some cities in which you have the center
that<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.580> quite<00:00:27.760> nice<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.420> suburb<00:00:28.750> which

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
that is quite nice and the suburb which

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.929 
that is quite nice and the suburb which
is<00:00:29.470> awful<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:29.859> I<00:00:30.010> think<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:30.250> contributes<00:00:30.460> to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
is awful and I think it contributes to

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.549 
is awful and I think it contributes to
people<00:00:31.269> behavior<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:32.169> one<00:00:32.290> another

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
people behavior to one another

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.799 
people behavior to one another
especially<00:00:33.040> in<00:00:33.430> big<00:00:33.610> cities<00:00:33.790> I<00:00:34.090> would<00:00:34.600> say

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
especially in big cities I would say

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.890 
especially in big cities I would say
where<00:00:35.019> cars<00:00:35.320> are<00:00:36.239> completely<00:00:37.239> prohibited<00:00:37.750> in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
where cars are completely prohibited in

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.860 
where cars are completely prohibited in
the<00:00:37.930> center<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.830> city<00:00:39.180> also<00:00:40.180> it<00:00:40.720> would

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
the center of the city also it would

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.049 
the center of the city also it would
definitely<00:00:41.170> have<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.620> have<00:00:42.030> facilities<00:00:43.030> for

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
definitely have to have facilities for

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.570 
definitely have to have facilities for
people<00:00:43.360> to<00:00:43.629> be<00:00:43.659> able<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:43.960> use<00:00:44.110> bikes<00:00:44.379> a<00:00:44.710> city

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
people to be able to use bikes a city

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.810 
people to be able to use bikes a city
where<00:00:46.049> the<00:00:47.049> air<00:00:47.290> is<00:00:47.530> very<00:00:47.620> of<00:00:48.100> good<00:00:48.400> quality

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
where the air is very of good quality

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.570 
where the air is very of good quality
there's<00:00:49.780> no<00:00:49.900> traffic<00:00:50.049> congestion<00:00:50.650> well<00:00:51.400> when

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
there's no traffic congestion well when

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.310 
there's no traffic congestion well when
I<00:00:51.610> have<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.150> describe<00:00:52.420> green<00:00:52.839> city<00:00:53.080> i'm

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
I have to describe green city i'm

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.859 
I have to describe green city i'm
thinking<00:00:53.890> of<00:00:54.129> most<00:00:54.640> about<00:00:54.909> public<00:00:55.390> transport

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
thinking of most about public transport

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.270 
thinking of most about public transport
facilities

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.320 

percentage<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.460> our<00:01:00.580> electricity<00:01:01.060> off

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
percentage of our electricity off

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.600 
percentage of our electricity off
renewable<00:01:01.840> power<00:01:01.990> we<00:01:02.200> have<00:01:02.380> very<00:01:02.800> very<00:01:03.430> well

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
renewable power we have very very well

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.220 
renewable power we have very very well
integrated<00:01:03.940> transport<00:01:04.390> we<00:01:04.570> just<00:01:04.780> started

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
integrated transport we just started

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.140 
integrated transport we just started
building<00:01:05.620> new<00:01:06.160> tramway<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:06.790> we<00:01:06.880> started

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
building new tramway so we started

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.100 
building new tramway so we started
digging<00:01:07.390> up<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.540> streets<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.900> build<00:01:08.050> a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
digging up the streets to build a

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.470 
digging up the streets to build a
tramway<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.980> increase<00:01:09.340> public<00:01:09.670> transport<00:01:10.270> I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
tramway to increase public transport I

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.680 
tramway to increase public transport I
think<00:01:10.960> in<00:01:11.080> Paris<00:01:11.410> a<00:01:11.680> public<00:01:12.370> transports<00:01:12.910> two

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
think in Paris a public transports two

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.400 
think in Paris a public transports two
buses<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:15.520> kind<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.300> well<00:01:16.540> develops<00:01:16.990> compared

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
buses are kind of well develops compared

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.900 
buses are kind of well develops compared
to<00:01:17.530> other<00:01:17.680> cities<00:01:18.010> one<00:01:18.460> thing<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.820> would

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
to other cities one thing I would

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.340 
to other cities one thing I would
definitely<00:01:19.119> change<00:01:19.600> about<00:01:19.900> Brussels<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
definitely change about Brussels is the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.609 
definitely change about Brussels is the
traffic<00:01:23.350> congestion<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.250> would<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:25.540> think<00:01:26.290> apply

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
traffic congestion I would I think apply

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.260 
traffic congestion I would I think apply
a<00:01:26.650> system<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.430> have<00:01:27.580> in<00:01:27.670> London<00:01:28.000> where

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
a system like you have in London where

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.940 
a system like you have in London where
you<00:01:28.420> have<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.720> pay<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.930> get<00:01:29.260> into<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.770> city

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
you have to pay to get into the city

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.389 
you have to pay to get into the city
centre<00:01:30.720> decentralized<00:01:31.720> energy<00:01:32.399> supply

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
centre decentralized energy supply

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.700 
centre decentralized energy supply
basically<00:01:34.300> people<00:01:34.570> been<00:01:34.899> able<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.440> supply

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
basically people been able to supply

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.650 
basically people been able to supply
themselves<00:01:36.070> with<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.640> energy<00:01:36.790> meaning<00:01:37.270> solar

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
themselves with the energy meaning solar

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.749 
themselves with the energy meaning solar
energy<00:01:38.170> wind<00:01:38.440> energy<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.310> these<00:01:39.430> kind<00:01:39.670> of

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
energy wind energy in these kind of

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.520 
energy wind energy in these kind of
things<00:01:39.820> make<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.630> center<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.170> shopping

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
things make the center the shopping

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.590 
things make the center the shopping
centre<00:01:41.830> pedestrian<00:01:42.369> zones<00:01:42.640> yeah<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.390> would

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
centre pedestrian zones yeah I would

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.900 
centre pedestrian zones yeah I would
definitely<00:01:43.720> look<00:01:44.259> at<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.070> situation<00:01:45.280> with

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
definitely look at the situation with

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.359 
definitely look at the situation with
the<00:01:45.940> carbon<00:01:46.750> emissions<00:01:47.290> that<00:01:47.590> cars<00:01:48.009> produced

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
the carbon emissions that cars produced

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.700 
the carbon emissions that cars produced
another<00:01:49.119> very<00:01:49.360> important<00:01:49.750> issue<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:50.229> feel<00:01:50.259> is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
another very important issue I feel is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.120 
another very important issue I feel is
cities<00:01:51.670> use<00:01:51.880> of<00:01:52.090> water<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.750> without<00:01:53.740> fail<00:01:54.100> i

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
cities use of water and without fail i

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.160 
cities use of water and without fail i
think<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:54.670> once<00:01:55.119> or<00:01:55.270> twice<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.540> week<00:01:55.869> the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
think it's once or twice a week the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.350 
think it's once or twice a week the
clean<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.830> streets<00:01:57.100> are<00:01:57.399> cleaned<00:01:57.729> with<00:01:58.030> power

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
clean the streets are cleaned with power

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.600 
clean the streets are cleaned with power
jets<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:59.080> must<00:01:59.350> waste<00:01:59.590> incredible<00:02:00.280> amounts

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
jets that must waste incredible amounts

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.210 
jets that must waste incredible amounts
of water<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.930> green<00:02:02.140> thing<00:02:02.380> about<00:02:02.530> Amsterdam

for my work life
I<00:02:55.319> think<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.790> attract<00:02:57.090> young<00:02:57.299> professional

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
I think to attract young professional

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.110 
I think to attract young professional
cities<00:02:58.379> should<00:02:58.560> always<00:02:59.159> care<00:02:59.459> for<00:02:59.700> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
cities should always care for the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.720 
cities should always care for the
environment<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.590> for<00:03:01.890> how<00:03:02.129> green<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.610> is

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
environment and for how green it is

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.089 
environment and for how green it is
because<00:03:03.239> when<00:03:04.049> young<00:03:04.230> professionals<00:03:04.739> come<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
because when young professionals come to

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.309 
because when young professionals come to
work<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.610> city<00:03:05.790> they<00:03:06.000> don't<00:03:06.599> want<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:07.019> to
