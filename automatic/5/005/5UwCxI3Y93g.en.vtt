00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.770
 hi friends of tablatures and sheet music 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.200
 dotcom today we come with another video 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.049
 tutorial today we're going to see a 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.660
 hash theme that is called sorry forgiveness 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.960
 I'm Javier Barrero and well let's go to 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.960
 tutorial 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.980
 well let's go with the verse as they can 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.040
 see I'm using a capo after having the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.320
 first fret we're going to have to use it and 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.180
 the chords we're going to make is the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.800
 first it is greater 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.770
 then with the fourth little finger we're going to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.040
 take it to the fifth string and dial 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.380
 this low and then we keep marking 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.380
 re greater but with this low 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.540
 then we make greater sun 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.610
 and let's make a step chord that goes 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.830
 to be this with the bass in the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.810
 we mark as if it were the first 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 two fingers 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.659
 with the fourth and the third finger we use 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.659
 the first two strings on the fret 3 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.050
 and that only to then move on to the greater 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.940
 the rhythm that we are going to use is a bit 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.940
 slow will always be going down 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.730
 I'm going to play the verse to see 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.730
 how's it going 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 good 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730
 greater sun 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.570
 he asks me 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.410
 A) Yes 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.299
 well I'm going again that's going to do two 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.299
 times more nothing 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.940
 i 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.200
 return 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.120
 ok now we go with the pre chorus in the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.060
 preco let's go with B flat that 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.470
 I say with lesser forgiveness 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.470
 then we are going to do the biggest 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.670
 followed by greater sun 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.010
 and we are going to do 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.110
 the step note that we use in the agreed 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.110
 step that we use in in the stanza 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.849
 then we will continue doing the 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.499
 Same pace as always coming down with 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.670
 a little weight and we're going to accentuate a 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.990
 little bit 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.990
 I do not know very expensive 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.290
 walk 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.890
 I'm going slower again 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.590
 ok we go with the choir in the choir 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.420
 we go back to D major and then we change to 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.140
 to 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.970
 and here we will do as a 7 but 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.810
 with the bass in b-flat in what would be 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.360
 the first fret 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.630
 we mark this only for here 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.710
 and less 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:11.450
 then the biggest 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.250
 and we end in G minor then we go 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.070
 to continue making the rhythm going down but 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.830
 we're going to do it with more hits and a 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.540
 little more moved by being the chorus then 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.540
 I'm going to touch it so I can see how it is 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.100
 in the truck 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.100
 i 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.550
 and come back 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.159
 ah 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.280

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.729
 new to see how it is a bit more 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.729
 slow 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.509
