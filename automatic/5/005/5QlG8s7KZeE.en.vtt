methods<00:01:29.720> let's<00:01:30.720> say<00:01:30.869> wheezing<00:01:31.200> air<00:01:31.320> wave

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
methods let's say wheezing air wave

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.219 
methods let's say wheezing air wave
which<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> base<00:01:32.189> damage<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> 595<00:01:33.229> when

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
which has a base damage of 595 when

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.810 
which has a base damage of 595 when
using<00:01:34.380> our<00:01:34.590> staff<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> 1.5<00:01:35.640> times

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
using our staff we have a 1.5 times

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.490 
using our staff we have a 1.5 times
multiplier<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.720> gives<00:01:36.869> us<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> damage<00:01:37.320> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
multiplier so that gives us a damage of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.179 
multiplier so that gives us a damage of
892<00:01:38.460> point<00:01:38.670> 5<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.960> damage<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.770> casting<00:01:41.100> at

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
892 point 5 this damage when casting at

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
892 point 5 this damage when casting at
a<00:01:41.220> speed<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> once<00:01:41.670> every<00:01:41.939> 2.6<00:01:42.299> seconds<00:01:42.780> gives

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a speed of once every 2.6 seconds gives

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.420 
a speed of once every 2.6 seconds gives
us<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> damage<00:01:43.680> per<00:01:43.770> second<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> two<00:01:44.369> hundred

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
us a damage per second of two hundred

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.569 
us a damage per second of two hundred
and<00:01:44.610> forty<00:01:44.909> seven<00:01:45.060> point<00:01:45.329> nine<00:01:46.220> when<00:01:47.220> using<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and forty seven point nine when using a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
and forty seven point nine when using a
wand<00:01:47.759> without<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.180> book<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> one

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
wand without the book we have a one

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
wand without the book we have a one
times<00:01:49.259> damage<00:01:49.530> multiplier<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.280> we're<00:01:50.399> dealing

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
times damage multiplier so we're dealing

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.789 
times damage multiplier so we're dealing
the<00:01:50.700> base<00:01:50.880> found<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.509> 95<00:01:51.869> damage<00:01:52.140> every<00:01:52.320> 2.4

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the base found in 95 damage every 2.4

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.649 
the base found in 95 damage every 2.4
seconds<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.759> also<00:01:54.090> equates<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> two<00:01:54.570> hundred

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
seconds this also equates to two hundred

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.330 
seconds this also equates to two hundred
and<00:01:54.899> forty<00:01:55.140> seven<00:01:55.259> point<00:01:55.470> nine<00:01:55.560> damage<00:01:56.189> per

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and forty seven point nine damage per

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.510 
and forty seven point nine damage per
second<00:01:57.409> finally<00:01:58.409> when<00:01:58.860> using<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> wand<00:01:59.340> with

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
second finally when using the wand with

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.090 
second finally when using the wand with
a<00:01:59.549> book<00:01:59.790> we<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.479> our<00:02:00.600> 595<00:02:01.469> base<00:02:01.740> damage

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
a book we have our 595 base damage

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.550 
a book we have our 595 base damage
multiplied<00:02:02.759> by<00:02:02.880> nor<00:02:03.060> point<00:02:03.270> seven<00:02:03.479> five<00:02:03.630> this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
multiplied by nor point seven five this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.950 
multiplied by nor point seven five this
comes<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> damage<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.310> 446<00:02:06.090> point<00:02:06.570> two<00:02:06.750> five

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
comes as a damage of 446 point two five

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.040 
comes as a damage of 446 point two five
every<00:02:07.680> 1.2<00:02:08.160> seconds<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.690> equates<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
every 1.2 seconds now this equates to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.210 
every 1.2 seconds now this equates to
371<00:02:10.950> 0.875<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:12.270> as<00:02:12.390> per<00:02:12.510> second

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
371 0.875 now as per second

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.060 
371 0.875 now as per second
which<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.490> lot<00:02:13.640> better<00:02:13.730> than<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.000> other<00:02:14.150> two

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
which is a lot better than the other two

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.870 
which is a lot better than the other two
now<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.130> got<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.370> bear<00:02:16.520> in<00:02:16.550> mind<00:02:16.760> these

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
now you got to bear in mind these

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.430 
now you got to bear in mind these
numbers<00:02:17.180> won't<00:02:17.270> be<00:02:17.450> exact<00:02:17.840> as<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.200> will<00:02:18.320> also

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
numbers won't be exact as you will also

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.750 
numbers won't be exact as you will also
have<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.830> consider<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.310> critical<00:02:19.430> hit<00:02:19.730> damage

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
have to consider the critical hit damage

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520 
have to consider the critical hit damage
based<00:02:20.240> on<00:02:20.390> your<00:02:20.510> magic<00:02:20.810> crit<00:02:20.990> modifier<00:02:21.380> but

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
based on your magic crit modifier but

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.930 
based on your magic crit modifier but
this<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:21.800> vary<00:02:21.980> depending<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.610> what<00:02:22.730> gear

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
this can vary depending on what gear

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.580 
this can vary depending on what gear
you've<00:02:23.090> got<00:02:23.270> so<00:02:23.540> I've<00:02:23.960> just<00:02:24.020> ignored<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.530> for

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
you've got so I've just ignored it for

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.760 
you've got so I've just ignored it for
these<00:02:24.740> calculations<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:27.050> as<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.380> see<00:02:27.440> a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
these calculations so as you can see a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.170 
these calculations so as you can see a
stack<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.580> same<00:02:28.820> amount<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.000> damage

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
stack is the same amount of damage

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.210 
stack is the same amount of damage
output<00:02:29.450> as<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> wand<00:02:30.050> without<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> book<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.160> at

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
output as a wand without a book but at

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.520 
output as a wand without a book but at
the<00:02:31.310> cost<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.580> being<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.850> 200<00:02:32.210> weapon<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:33.320> staff

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
the cost of being a 200 weapon the staff

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.780 
the cost of being a 200 weapon the staff
does<00:02:33.740> however<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> greater<00:02:34.520> accuracy

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
does however have a greater accuracy

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.030 
does however have a greater accuracy
than<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.360> wand<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.780> same<00:02:35.960> magic<00:02:36.170> level<00:02:36.530> but

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
than a wand of the same magic level but

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.650 
than a wand of the same magic level but
personally<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:37.640> feel<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.030> 1<00:02:38.270> but<00:02:38.360> will<00:02:38.480> always<00:02:38.570> be

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
personally I feel a 1 but will always be

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.180 
personally I feel a 1 but will always be
