00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
have that pop by using HDR algorithms

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
have that pop by using HDR algorithms
and<00:01:20.909> running<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.930> image<00:01:22.500> through<00:01:23.369> HDR<00:01:24.320> this

is<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.400> look<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> differential

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is what we get look at the differential

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.590 
is what we get look at the differential
look<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.829> sky<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.329> back

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it is with HDR look at that it just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.520

all<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> sky<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.540> process

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
all the sky up here but when we process

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.240 
all the sky up here but when we process
it<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.560> HDR<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> dynamic

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
it through HDR look at the dynamic

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.060 
it through HDR look at the dynamic
dimension<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.460> got<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> sky

what<00:01:56.070> HDR<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:57.060> does<00:01:57.270> its<00:01:57.479> high<00:01:57.780> dynamic

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
what HDR really does its high dynamic

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.740 
what HDR really does its high dynamic
