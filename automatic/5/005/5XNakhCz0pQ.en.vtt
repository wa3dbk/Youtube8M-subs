00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 

well<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.040> finished<00:01:05.550> this<00:01:05.700> first<00:01:06.000> role<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
well I just finished this first role and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.940 
well I just finished this first role and
I<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> total<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> hundred<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.800> five

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
I got a total of a hundred and five

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.070 
I got a total of a hundred and five
potatoes<00:01:08.550> out<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.600> include

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
potatoes out of it if I don't include

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870 
potatoes out of it if I don't include
the<00:01:10.290> real<00:01:10.440> little<00:01:10.650> ones<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.550> it's<00:01:11.700> funny

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the real little ones and it's funny

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.070 
the real little ones and it's funny
because<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> potatoes<00:01:12.960> are

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
because down there the potatoes are

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.330 
because down there the potatoes are
bigger<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.620> I<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.220> they

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
bigger and then as I get up here they

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.010 
bigger and then as I get up here they
get<00:01:14.520> smaller<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.240> smaller

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
get smaller and smaller

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.350 
get smaller and smaller
at<00:01:16.440> least<00:01:16.650> these<00:01:16.830> last<00:01:17.100> three<00:01:17.490> plants<00:01:17.940> did<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
at least these last three plants did and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000 
at least these last three plants did and
that's<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.260> that<00:01:19.470> tree<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:19.800> there

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
that's because that tree right there

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.950 
that's because that tree right there
blocks<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.820> Sun<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> part<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> day
