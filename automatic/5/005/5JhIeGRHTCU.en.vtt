00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.040
 here I am super happy to be able to 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.380
 offer you that so of course again what 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.270
 are that with my money I 'm going to you 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.560
 buy a lipstick mac I'll 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.149
 order on the internet and in particular 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.189
 goal is not mac next to my home 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.640
 so I would send it to you in fact all 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.530
 simply 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.729
 so I'm going to show you the three 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.649
 lipsticks that I have in everything 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.560
 first of all the one I am currently wearing 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.130
 on my lips it's the viva glam nikki 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 this is a packaging like these 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.219
 in this writing mac in red this is in 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 do this is this lipstick there 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.569
 simply 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.359
 which is safe but looks so I think 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:56.429
 that brightness she and she is not 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:57.810
 very good to see well see the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.069
 color so in fact I'm going to try 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.429
 you describe it a little bit it's a 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:06.810
 pink at his auger flows make you re either 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:10.340
 on the hand here so I do not know if 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.340
 scholars alike on my lips or not 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.430
 so here if I put a number that's what 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.310
 that gives me looks more like that in 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.879
 does that completely in the sun I 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.440
 find 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.510
 here I think that's how you go 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.319
 get to see the color even better on 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.099
 my lips I have the impression that it 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.879
 seems a little better 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.860
 so that's so it's a pretty fluo pink 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.510
 anyway and you will see that his 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.470
 title in super fly is not going to you 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.780
 describe the smell but the divine moms 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.640
 then as your lipstick I 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.200
 this one which is really very very 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.910
 pretty that does not look like that at all 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.879
 What I have is the passionate ym 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 that is really a superb or 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.389
 lipstick for this season 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.389
 also 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:59.579
 so he's right next here so he has 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.840
 a little darker and it's pretty flashy 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.609
 also the show is still pretty good 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.680
 also 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.230
 it is really very very pretty also the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.530
 hole here I think that sailing and 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.280
 better the color I decide to hide a 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.480
 little bit here at least you see 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.849
 really good colors if not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.750
 that it's not easy to order on 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.910
 website 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.590
 short and the last red is what I 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.370
 it's a place of those lipstick 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.900
 mac myth actually at mac it's not 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.239
 too ridiculous 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.569
 yeah but last where I was going to be his 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:38.400
 limits that is written like this 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.269
 so me it's all satin textures 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.849
 seems to me no have since made the most 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.140
 dark it's a name so the 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.629
 it passes to be born it is an amplified 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.400
 so here are the texts the different I 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.420
 do not see too much going a little bit more 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:03.299
 creamy that's all so that's the myth 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:06.180
 that's it and it's a nude actually it does 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:10.349
 pale enough 1 even this one I 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.930
 find but very pretty so so here we go 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.909

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.470
 I have so I intend to do 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.530
 so still other accounts for mac 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.320
