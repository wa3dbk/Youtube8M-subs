00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.290
 how 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 hello to everyone is today we wanted 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.540
 record another game with arc as in the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.540
 last video that I got from this game 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.470
 You know I'm terrible with the bow 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.260
 but that's why I play it that's why I record it to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.430
 challenge mode because here in the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.190
 said badly said badly 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.130
 look there has been one with here or 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.020
 with any gun type firearm 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.260
 assault 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.240
 said fast like that and I'm very good at 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.700
 I'm pretty good at not but with the 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.310
 I'm a negate bow we go a putt 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.250
 useless with the bow is why I'm 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.390
 recording this type d 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.390
 how will you see how it goes up here 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.390
 and so he did not remember 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.719
 liar 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.050
 I do not remember well 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.350
 go cloth as I am wrong with the bow 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.799
 Well, I've decided that I'm going to record to see 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.799
 if so 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.909
 but how is it possible 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.450
 game you have seen that was not right 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.969
 a 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.149
 are worth several have fallen there as I go 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:55.020
 30 30 with the bow is a moment 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.020
 historical no 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.870
 to see to shoot them there my fast 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.540
 this is a very historic moment that 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.540
 takes a 40 bow uncle 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.140
 and there we have the lara 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.819
 more were waiting for you know I was 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.130
 that's clear, yes, it also escapes already in that 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.760
 corner 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.590
 good in 41 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.590
 we can not appear with the partner 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.370
 we have them here tight 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.849
 ok it has fallen 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.510
 I think it 's where the tourist shoots 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.510
 you are a tourist 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.740
 discomfort 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.740
 I'm in a hurry of life I think 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.249
 from this height 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 but that you release mother 10 no more 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.530
 clear me with these uncle controls 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.980
 vale has fallen fallen shit buf almost almost 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.230
 they almost killed me uncle how are we going 71 I'm going 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.390
 first of my team to arc this is a 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.950
 historical moment but more I am 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.110
 recording because this is what I tell 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.010
 there is no one that I bow 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.010
 is getting this score 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.200
 another drop fell another uncle has fallen 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.370
 if he could throw arrows more 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.370
 specialist from around the world 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.560
 we have to look at hosts 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.970
 it has gone down well if I said it before 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.330
 that it came out even but it has 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.330
 fallen like that 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.740
 the arrow is spent I do not have a bitch 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.389
 idea how are we going 9 2 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.389
 and there was a 92 with arc 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.110
 vale is a 10 2 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.610
 It is giving me good state the arches 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.289
 very well I think that this is flippant is 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.810
 that it's a good thing I'm recording it as 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.720
 I'm telling you, I'm terrible with a bow in 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.040
 general 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.040
 but this friendly game 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.710
 Look, it's loaded me and the other 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.970
 good victory to see how it has been 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.520
 I think there's an 11-2 left 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.529
 I would say with a c 2 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.159
 with bow uncle 11-2 with bows 3 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:22.189
 11 22 10 as it is audio I have not seen it 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:25.189
 Your team has an advantage that you tell me 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.929
 clearer without voting solution to side 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:30.260
 for last rounds 

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:33.410
 the survivors I have been 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.820
 and this one has been left in the end is I think 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.100
 that I've been 10 1 and you 're watching the 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.870
 score of the above, then 10 ones 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.810
 perfect I do not care 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.980
 liked has been in second position and 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.980
 until the next video goodbye
