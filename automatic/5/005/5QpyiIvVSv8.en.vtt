booklet<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.620> haven't<00:02:20.010> read<00:02:20.130> through<00:02:20.370> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
booklet I haven't read through it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920 
booklet I haven't read through it
properly<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.030> has<00:02:21.150> instructions<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.810> how

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
properly but it has instructions on how

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.260 
properly but it has instructions on how
to<00:02:21.990> care<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.320> your<00:02:22.500> wig<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.100> I'm<00:02:23.760> guessing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
to care for your wig so I'm guessing

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.970 
to care for your wig so I'm guessing
that<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.990> probably<00:02:25.170> tells<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.560> how<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.770> wash

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that it probably tells you how to wash

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.210 
that it probably tells you how to wash
it<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.840> only<00:02:27.990> downpours<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.710> week<00:02:28.950> for

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
it and the only downpours this week for

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.620 
it and the only downpours this week for
me<00:02:29.370> was<00:02:29.550> when<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.820> arrived<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.180> was<00:02:30.210> quite

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
me was when it arrived it was quite

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.330 
me was when it arrived it was quite
tangled<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.530> because<00:02:31.830> obviously<00:02:31.980> they

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
tangled that was because obviously they

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.470 
tangled that was because obviously they
had<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.670> fit<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> obviously<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:39.330> still

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
had to fit it so obviously we still

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.970 
had to fit it so obviously we still
packaged<00:02:39.900> really<00:02:40.110> nice<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.740> there's<00:02:40.860> no

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
packaged really nice and there's no

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.040 
packaged really nice and there's no
problems<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.640> had<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.180> comb<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.390> through<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
problems just had to comb it through and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.440 
problems just had to comb it through and
so<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.250> my<00:02:44.370> only<00:02:44.580> complaint<00:02:44.850> really<00:02:45.120> other

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
so that's my only complaint really other

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.990 
so that's my only complaint really other
than<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.140> really<00:02:46.320> nice<00:02:46.470> wig<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
than that it's a really nice wig and it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300 
than that it's a really nice wig and it
looks<00:02:48.240> as<00:02:48.390> natural<00:02:48.840> as<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> synthetic<00:02:49.650> lace<00:02:49.980> wig

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
looks as natural as a synthetic lace wig

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.430 
looks as natural as a synthetic lace wig
of<00:02:50.520> little<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:50.940> wrinkled<00:02:51.360> there<00:02:51.510> could<00:02:52.230> look

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
of little and wrinkled there could look

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.040 
of little and wrinkled there could look
and<00:02:52.830> obviously<00:02:53.580> I'm<00:02:54.300> not<00:02:54.510> fooling<00:02:54.840> anyone

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
and obviously I'm not fooling anyone

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.980 
and obviously I'm not fooling anyone
saying<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:55.920> my<00:02:56.070> real<00:02:56.250> hair<00:02:56.520> because<00:02:57.000> you

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
saying this is my real hair because you

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.390 
saying this is my real hair because you
couldn't<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.410> hair<00:02:58.560> let's<00:02:58.770> call<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.130> long

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.900 
couldn't have hair let's call this long
it<00:03:00.240> would<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:01.080> dead<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.340> obviously

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
it would just be dead so obviously

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
it would just be dead so obviously
people<00:03:03.000> would<00:03:03.390> probably<00:03:03.570> know<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.020> way

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
people would probably know it's a way

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.740 
people would probably know it's a way
