password is Tekken bit starting off with
a<00:00:53.969> capital<00:00:54.750> letter<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:57.500> we<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> few<00:00:59.039> files

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
a capital letter so we have a few files

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.869 
a capital letter so we have a few files
one<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.870> audio<00:01:01.379> since<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.550> see

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
that the audio still isn't working

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
that the audio still isn't working
perfectly<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.470> need<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> driver<00:01:11.460> for

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
perfectly so we will need a driver for

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.620 
perfectly so we will need a driver for
that<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.710> VMware<00:01:14.430> tools<00:01:14.880> we

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
that then we have the VMware tools we

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.560 
that then we have the VMware tools we
have<00:01:15.780> flash<00:01:16.229> player<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.970> another

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
have flash player we have another

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.660 
installer of flash player we have a
mouse<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.970> update<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> mouse<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.400> less

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
mouse just update so the mouse is less

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.620 
mouse just update so the mouse is less
laggy<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.590> vga<00:01:29.100> adapter<00:01:29.630> so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
laggy and then we have a vga adapter so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.929 
laggy and then we have a vga adapter so
that<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.200> will<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.890> able<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.460> set<00:01:32.759> the

that we will be able to set the
resolution<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.009> order<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.670> run

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
resolution in that so in order to run

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.289

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.469 
continue installation and it will start
installing<00:02:07.299> so<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.800> did<00:02:09.129> tell<00:02:09.459> us<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.179> we

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
installing so it did tell us that we

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.160 
installing so it did tell us that we
will<00:02:10.810> have<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.319> restart<00:02:12.360> during<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> process

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
will have to restart during the process

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.440 
will have to restart during the process
so<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:15.190> will<00:02:15.220> do<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:17.700> will<00:02:18.700> get<00:02:19.269> back

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so we will do that and I will get back

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.449 
so we will do that and I will get back
to<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.720> as<00:02:19.900> soon<00:02:19.930> as<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.620> has<00:02:21.130> been

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
to you as soon as that has been

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:29.530 
to you as soon as that has been
rebooting

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.390 

so<00:02:30.200> now<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:30.920> installing<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:33.200> sound<00:02:33.560> driver

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
so now it's installing the sound driver

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.470 
so now it's installing the sound driver
and<00:02:35.829> before<00:02:36.829> it<00:02:37.040> reboots<00:02:37.579> it's<00:02:37.970> very

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
and before it reboots it's very

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.160 
and before it reboots it's very
important<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:40.189> don't<00:02:40.459> reboot<00:02:41.180> yet<00:02:41.569> but

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
important that we don't reboot yet but

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.589 
important that we don't reboot yet but
we<00:02:42.470> shut<00:02:43.010> down<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.730> Mac<00:02:44.540> os10<00:02:45.310> line<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:47.180> order

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
we shut down the Mac os10 line in order

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.430 
we shut down the Mac os10 line in order
that<00:02:47.810> we<00:02:48.290> can<00:02:48.560> configure<00:02:49.040> our<00:02:49.459> audio<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.110> click
