00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
hey guys so it's time to do a quick

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey guys so it's time to do a quick
video<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.250> got<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:02.850> request<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.510> galaxy

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
video I got this request to the galaxy

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.920 
video I got this request to the galaxy
s6<00:00:04.290> vs.<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.980> oneplus<00:00:05.910> one<00:00:06.240> here<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.720> have<00:00:06.899> a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
s6 vs. the oneplus one here and I have a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.430 
s6 vs. the oneplus one here and I have a
1<00:00:07.259> plus<00:00:07.440> 1<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.069> oxygen<00:00:08.460> OS<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:10.230> if<00:00:10.320> I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
1 plus 1 on the oxygen OS and if I

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680 
1 plus 1 on the oxygen OS and if I
window<00:00:10.650> pick<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.120> let's

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
window pick to it I think it is so let's

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.560 
window pick to it I think it is so let's
take<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> look<00:00:13.200> at<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.880> how<00:00:15.299> it

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
take a look at it here see and how it

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.480 
take a look at it here see and how it
can<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.400> speed<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.789> against<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.510> galaxy

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
can be a speed here against the galaxy

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:49.580 
can be a speed here against the galaxy
s6<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.000> let's<00:00:22.490> go

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.220 

oh<00:00:50.090> my<00:00:51.090> god<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:52.880> was<00:00:53.880> thinking<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.630> my<00:00:54.780> head<00:00:54.810> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
oh my god I was thinking in my head that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.420 
oh my god I was thinking in my head that
they<00:00:55.380> would<00:00:55.560> do<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.310> they<00:00:56.670> did<00:00:57.710> Wow<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
they would do that and they did Wow the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.030 
they would do that and they did Wow the
same<00:00:59.790> almost<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:00.720> one<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.560> them<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
same almost I think one of them was a

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.160 
same almost I think one of them was a
little<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.430> faster<00:01:02.610> but<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.330> don't<00:01:03.690> reckon<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
little bit faster but I don't reckon I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.580 
little bit faster but I don't reckon I
remember<00:01:04.770> it<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.980> my<00:01:05.070> head<00:01:06.140> but<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> did<00:01:07.410> see

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
remember it in my head but you did see

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740 
remember it in my head but you did see
some<00:01:07.740> lag<00:01:07.950> he<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.310> definitely<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.910> oxygen<00:01:09.270> OS

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
some lag he are definitely on oxygen OS

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.590 
some lag he are definitely on oxygen OS
I<00:01:10.140> mean<00:01:10.380> yeah<00:01:11.090> that's<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.240> we're<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:13.580> yeah

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.300 

you<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.780> something<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:20.100> their<00:01:20.400> Galaxy<00:01:21.240> UI

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
you have something with their Galaxy UI

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.250 
you have something with their Galaxy UI
which<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.910> see<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.330> seems<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.050> be<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
which is as you see there seems to be a

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.390 
which is as you see there seems to be a
little<00:01:26.130> bit<00:01:26.690> snappier<00:01:27.690> there<00:01:28.160> see<00:01:29.160> you're

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
little bit snappier there see you're

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:44.170 
little bit snappier there see you're
multitasking<00:01:31.010> maybe<00:01:32.010> not

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.870

you see here and if I would open two on
both<00:01:47.390> these<00:01:47.630> devices<00:01:51.400> sweet<00:01:58.660> bring<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.960> one

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.850 
both these devices sweet bring that one
up<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:01.220> well<00:02:01.660> see<00:02:02.660> here<00:02:02.900> can<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.140> hold<00:02:03.410> in<00:02:03.560> here

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
something on theme manager in oxygen OS

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.770 
something on theme manager in oxygen OS
I'm<00:02:12.680> pretty<00:02:13.040> sure<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.430> can<00:02:13.610> also<00:02:13.760> tweak<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.480> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
I'm pretty sure you can also tweak it a
