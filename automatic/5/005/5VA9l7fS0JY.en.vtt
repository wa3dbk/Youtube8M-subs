00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.520
 after the long wait after a 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.530
 unexpected delay 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.470
 scribblenauts to the limit comes at last to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.820
 nintendo 3ds and wii so that we give rein 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.820
 release our imagination 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 these versions of the game are 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.879
 practically identical to the view in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 steam which is already analyzed the year 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 gone through so we re -incarnate 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.879
 maxwell you will have to help people 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.530
 from all over the world to get the star 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.910
 eyes and break the spell that is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 turning his sister into stone 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.580
 the mechanics of the game is maintained 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.530
 intact every problem to solve will be 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.880
 a puzzle that we must solve by invoking 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.680
 an object with the help of our 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.930
 magic notebook that turns into 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.330
 actually the words in this way 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.010
 we get a piece of starlight or a 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.490
 will be complete if the riddle is 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.490
 complex 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.300
 the changes found in the versions 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 of nintendo are not abundant 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.650
 in the 3ds version the whole game is 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960
 develops at the bottom of the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.820
 console leaving the top one with the only 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.100
 show us our progress 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.050
 in the levels therefore it is not done 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.510
 use of the 3d effect during all the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.280
 heading this has an explanation and it's 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.440
 to be able to use the touch screen to 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.480
 move maxwell through the stage though 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.550
 if we wish, we can also use the 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.610
 analog stick and buttons for 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.310
 handle the Wii version features 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.320
 way off tv being able to use the stick or the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.690
 touch screen to control maxwell 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.300
 the big differences between the two 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.370
 versions are in online mode in wii 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.740
 we have the creator editor in which 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.860
 we can create upload and share our 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.929
 creations with the other users in 3ds 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.880
 we do not have an editor but we can use 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.770
 the streetpass function with the intention 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.770
 to get solutions for the puzzles 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.220
 as a curiosity a little added that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.710
 it has been wanted to give these two versions 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.300
 of nintendo is the ability to invoke 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.030
 to characters from the saga mario and zelda 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.480
 something curious to see but is relevant in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.480
 the game 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.920
 on the other hand the game filled again 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.630
 totally in Spanish although the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.970
 dubbing has been changed with respect to the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.130
 PC version is now located at a 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.730
 Spanish from Spain and not a 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.730
 neutral spanish 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.409
 unlimited scribblenauts paraguay has 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.560
 left in different and the 3ds version 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.480
 he has disappointed us after so much 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.849
 We were expecting some added 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.290
 greater weight in the two versions having 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.870
 note that the steam version is 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.250
 identical takes more time on sale and its 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.739
 price has been lowered in many 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.840
 occasions now that they have all three 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.250
 versions to choose only remains that you 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.250
 decide which one is best for you
