not on the road proper but it kind of on
the<00:01:06.630> map<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> looks<00:01:06.960> sort<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:08.090> like<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> Tail

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the map it looks sort of like the Tail

the map it looks sort of like the Tail
of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> Dragon<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.289> a<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.950> twisty<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399

turny very few crossroads or doesn't

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.910 
turny very few crossroads or doesn't
look<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.350> development<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
look like there's much development of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.490 
look like there's much development of
any<00:01:17.039> sort<00:01:17.340> along<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> road<00:01:18.679> and<00:01:21.440> looks<00:01:22.440> like

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
any sort along the road and looks like

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.630 
any sort along the road and looks like
it<00:01:22.679> should<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.979> fun<00:01:24.950> yeah<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> say<00:01:26.190> I<00:01:26.220> found<00:01:26.490> it

myself<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.210> mean<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> didn't<00:01:29.000> discover<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> road

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
myself I mean I didn't discover the road

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
myself I mean I didn't discover the road

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
but I've never heard anybody else

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.499 
but I've never heard anybody else
talking<00:01:32.310> about<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> I've<00:01:32.850> never<00:01:33.119> seen<00:01:33.360> any

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
talking about it I've never seen any

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.089 
talking about it I've never seen any
videos<00:01:33.869> about<00:01:33.899> it<00:01:34.289> or<00:01:34.409> read<00:01:34.679> anything<00:01:34.890> about

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:35.099 
videos about it or read anything about

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.370 
videos about it or read anything about
it<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.429> just<00:01:35.459> sort<00:01:35.789> of<00:01:36.830> discovered<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:39.349> when<00:01:40.349> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it I just sort of discovered it when I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.690 
it I just sort of discovered it when I
was<00:01:40.590> perusing<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.310> maps

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:56.250 

so<00:01:49.810> yeah<00:01:51.820> should<00:01:52.820> be<00:01:52.939> up<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:53.090> somewhere

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.900 

and<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.200> go

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
and here we go

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.520 
and here we go
North<00:02:00.910> 32

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:03:05.130 

let's<00:02:07.040> see<00:02:07.280> what<00:02:07.400> it's<00:02:07.520> all<00:02:07.640> about

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.610 

the<00:03:05.620> road<00:03:05.830> isn't<00:03:06.220> quite<00:03:06.430> as<00:03:06.720> smooth<00:03:07.720> or<00:03:08.110> as

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
the road isn't quite as smooth or as

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.200 
the road isn't quite as smooth or as
clean<00:03:09.070> as<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:10.150> Tail<00:03:10.330> of<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> Dragon<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:12.210> it

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
clean as the Tail of the Dragon but it

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:39.420 
clean as the Tail of the Dragon but it
is<00:03:13.330> pretty<00:03:13.570> similar

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:04:01.840 

very<00:03:40.430> similar

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.560 

I<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.660> seen<00:04:02.990> some<00:04:03.290> driveways<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:05.450> the

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
I have seen some driveways on the

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.070 
I have seen some driveways on the
right-hand<00:04:05.960> side<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.560> guess<00:04:06.860> that<00:04:07.040> must<00:04:07.220> be

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
right-hand side so I guess that must be

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.170 
right-hand side so I guess that must be
public<00:04:09.080> land<00:04:09.290> or<00:04:09.620> well<00:04:10.460> not<00:04:10.640> public<00:04:10.970> private

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
public land or well not public private

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.730 
public land or well not public private
land<00:04:11.560> privately<00:04:12.560> owned<00:04:12.710> on<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.910> left<00:04:14.740> I'm

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
land privately owned on the left I'm

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:55.409 
land privately owned on the left I'm
pretty<00:04:16.190> sure<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.840> Smoky<00:04:18.560> Mountain<00:04:18.890> Park

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.330 

one<00:04:55.960> thing<00:04:56.169> that's<00:04:56.319> very<00:04:56.620> different<00:04:57.189> about

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
one thing that's very different about

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.520 
one thing that's very different about
this<00:04:57.520> road<00:04:57.789> as<00:04:58.090> compared<00:04:58.539> to<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:59.169> tail<00:04:59.379> the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
this road as compared to the tail the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:12.719 
this road as compared to the tail the
dragon<00:04:59.889> is<00:05:00.180> there<00:05:01.180> ain't<00:05:01.330> no<00:05:01.419> traffic<00:05:01.840> ona

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.220 

no<00:05:13.330> motorcycles

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:40.270 

I've<00:05:17.710> seen<00:05:18.990> two<00:05:19.990> cars<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.560> think<00:05:20.590> so<00:05:21.070> far

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:49.500 

coming<00:05:41.030> into<00:05:41.210> civilization<00:05:41.930> here<00:05:42.530> looks<00:05:42.800> like

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:06:23.610 

such<00:05:50.510> as<00:05:50.720> it<00:05:50.870> is

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.629 

okay

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
okay

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.820 
okay
the<00:06:26.120> traffic<00:06:26.539> is<00:06:26.689> starting<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:27.110> overwhelm<00:06:27.680> me

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
the traffic is starting to overwhelm me

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.110 
the traffic is starting to overwhelm me
here<00:06:28.099> so<00:06:28.669> I<00:06:29.210> think<00:06:29.539> we'll<00:06:29.840> call<00:06:30.020> this<00:06:30.229> a<00:06:30.439> video

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
here so I think we'll call this a video

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.240 
here so I think we'll call this a video
