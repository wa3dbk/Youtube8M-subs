00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.070 

okay<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.429> we're<00:00:11.759> working<00:00:11.940> with<00:00:12.240> immersion<00:00:12.570> RC

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
okay so we're working with immersion RC

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.519 
okay so we're working with immersion RC
and<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:14.670> flagship<00:00:15.330> product<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.870> version<00:00:16.260> RC

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and the flagship product of version RC

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.230 
and the flagship product of version RC
is<00:00:16.740> therefore<00:00:17.130> txt<00:00:17.369> run<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> very<00:00:18.090> cool

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
is therefore txt run it's a very cool

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.300 
is therefore txt run it's a very cool
drone<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:19.500> were<00:00:19.590> kind<00:00:19.740> enough<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.130> send

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
drone and they were kind enough to send

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.300 
drone and they were kind enough to send
us<00:00:20.490> their<00:00:20.939> 3d<00:00:21.359> model<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> drone<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
us their 3d model of the drone but the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.990 
us their 3d model of the drone but the
problem<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.420> make<00:00:24.960> their<00:00:25.140> model<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:26.099> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
problem is they make their model in a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.750 
problem is they make their model in a
CAD<00:00:27.689> program<00:00:28.109> which<00:00:28.830> means<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.279> get<00:00:29.550> very

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
CAD program which means you can get very

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.540 
CAD program which means you can get very
accurate<00:00:30.179> accurate<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:31.080> also<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:32.130> dense

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
accurate accurate but also very dense

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
accurate accurate but also very dense
and<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.759> high<00:00:33.059> poly<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.140> take<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and very high poly so when we take a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.900 
and very high poly so when we take a
look<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.649> place<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.309> model<00:00:35.760> right

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
look at this place at this model right

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.139 
look at this place at this model right
here<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.410> see<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.680> very<00:00:37.860> accurate<00:00:38.149> but

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
here you can see it's very accurate but

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.280 
here you can see it's very accurate but
when<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.360> selected<00:00:39.719> anyone<00:00:39.989> look<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
when we selected anyone look at the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.380 
when we selected anyone look at the
wireframe<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.010> seats<00:00:41.219> very<00:00:41.550> very<00:00:41.850> tense<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
wireframe it seats very very tense I

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.950 
wireframe it seats very very tense I
think<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:44.270> 140,000<00:00:45.270> pounds<00:00:45.420> right

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
think it's around 140,000 pounds right

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.920 
think it's around 140,000 pounds right
now<00:00:47.570> yeah<00:00:48.590> 139<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> did<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.899> took

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
now yeah 139 so what I did is I took

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
now yeah 139 so what I did is I took
this<00:00:52.140> CAD<00:00:52.350> model<00:00:52.699> important<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.789> tamiya<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
this CAD model important in tamiya and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.729 
this CAD model important in tamiya and
then<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.809> went<00:00:54.989> piece<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.440> piece<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
then I went piece by piece and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.490 
then I went piece by piece and
reconstructed<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> geometry<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> low<00:00:58.260> poly

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
reconstructed to geometry as a low poly

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.150 
reconstructed to geometry as a low poly
model<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.210> ended<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
model and we ended up with this so that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
model and we ended up with this so that
is<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.520> yeah<00:01:02.969> 25,000<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.739> thing<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.159> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
is about yeah 25,000 the thing is if you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.640 
is about yeah 25,000 the thing is if you
see<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.549> side<00:01:05.790> by<00:01:05.820> side<00:01:06.350> even<00:01:07.350> though<00:01:07.470> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
see them side by side even though this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.260 
see them side by side even though this
one<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.130> way<00:01:08.850> lower<00:01:09.450> body<00:01:10.820> from<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.909> normal

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
one is way lower body from a normal

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
one is way lower body from a normal
viewing<00:01:12.479> distance<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.590> barely<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
viewing distance you can barely see it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.460 
viewing distance you can barely see it
at<00:01:14.610> all

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.930 

okay<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> things<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.640> want

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
okay so one of the things we really want

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.990 
okay so one of the things we really want
to<00:01:24.030> show<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:24.710> its<00:01:25.710> level<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.340> detail<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.880> have

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to show off its level of detail we have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.660 
to show off its level of detail we have
in<00:01:27.300> in<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.780> drones<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.710> no

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
in in the drones and we're kind of no

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.780 
in in the drones and we're kind of no
comparing<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.690> do<00:01:30.930> modern<00:01:31.260> race<00:01:31.500> games

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
comparing it to do modern race games

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.250 
comparing it to do modern race games
where<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.390> your<00:01:33.480> garage<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
where you can get into your garage and

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.170 
where you can get into your garage and
maybe<00:01:35.420> add<00:01:36.420> new<00:01:36.600> parts<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.080> your<00:01:37.110> car<00:01:37.940> or<00:01:38.940> do

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
maybe add new parts to your car or do

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.320 
maybe add new parts to your car or do
customizations<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.830> want<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
customizations so we really want to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.870 
customizations so we really want to
implement<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.870> game<00:01:43.700> that's<00:01:44.700> why

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
implement that in the game that's why

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.210 
implement that in the game that's why
we're<00:01:45.060> taking<00:01:45.150> extra<00:01:45.600> care<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.050> adding<00:01:47.010> enough

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
we're taking extra care in adding enough

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
we're taking extra care in adding enough
polish<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.790> detail<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.360> our<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.810> our<00:01:48.840> game

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
polish and detail to our to our game

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.860 
polish and detail to our to our game
mouths<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.940> one<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.330> things<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.750> I've

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
mouths so one of the things that I've

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.510 
mouths so one of the things that I've
been<00:01:51.990> doing<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.440> which<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.130> fun<00:01:53.250> by

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
been doing and which was really fun by

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
been doing and which was really fun by
the<00:01:53.580> way<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.470> adding<00:01:55.470> these<00:01:56.570> fingerprints<00:01:57.570> or

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the way is adding these fingerprints or

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.460 
the way is adding these fingerprints or
finger<00:01:58.710> smudges<00:01:59.160> on<00:01:59.580> the<00:02:00.390> throne<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.260> give<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
finger smudges on the throne to give it

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.560 
finger smudges on the throne to give it
a<00:02:01.560> feel<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:02.010> someone's<00:02:02.370> been<00:02:02.640> handling<00:02:03.360> with

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
a feel that someone's been handling with

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
a feel that someone's been handling with
it<00:02:03.690> bill<00:02:04.260> handling<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.220> been<00:02:05.400> playing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it bill handling it or or been playing

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.790 
it bill handling it or or been playing
around<00:02:05.760> with<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.960> could<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.470> drove

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
around with it this could be the drove

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.290 
around with it this could be the drove
you<00:02:07.920> start<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.490> within<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.000> beginning

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
you start out with within the beginning

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.150 
you start out with within the beginning
of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> race<00:02:09.570> it's<00:02:10.200> very<00:02:10.350> clean<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.979> doesn't

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
of the race it's very clean and doesn't

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.500 
of the race it's very clean and doesn't
have<00:02:11.400> any<00:02:11.580> dents<00:02:11.820> or<00:02:12.060> dings<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.570> scratches<00:02:14.510> but

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
have any dents or dings or scratches but

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.949 
have any dents or dings or scratches but
then<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:15.959> add<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.620> damage<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:18.240> think<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
then we can add like damage I think I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.320 
then we can add like damage I think I
have<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.170> layer<00:02:19.320> here<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.880> add<00:02:21.090> like

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
have a layer here so we can add like

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.280 
have a layer here so we can add like
scratches<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.790> try<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.970> dance<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.110> stuff

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
scratches and try and dance and stuff

scratches and try and dance and stuff
like<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.500> that's<00:02:26.100> really<00:02:26.340> easy<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.940> just

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
like that that's really easy this just

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.500 
like that that's really easy this just
to<00:02:27.450> make<00:02:27.900> these<00:02:28.080> maps<00:02:29.209> right<00:02:30.209> here<00:02:30.390> in

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
to make these maps right here in

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.900 
to make these maps right here in
substance<00:02:30.870> painter<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.350> then<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.950> basically

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
substance painter and then to basically

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.090 
substance painter and then to basically
use<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.480> mouse<00:02:33.810> clicks<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.380> export<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.920> out<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
use to mouse clicks and export it out a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.229 
use to mouse clicks and export it out a
unity<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:36.959> use<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> game

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.119 

the<00:02:45.239> first<00:02:45.450> video<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.959> soft<00:02:46.379> road<00:02:46.590> racing<00:02:47.010> two

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and that's why we decided to make our

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.550 
and that's why we decided to make our
teaser<00:02:51.239> video<00:02:51.629> also<00:02:51.900> take<00:02:52.170> place<00:02:52.379> in<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
thing things to do in a video game is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.770 
thing things to do in a video game is
make<00:02:57.720> trees<00:02:58.220> because<00:02:59.220> trees<00:02:59.420> take<00:03:00.420> us<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
make trees because trees take us it is a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.890 
make trees because trees take us it is a
very<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.650> lot<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.790> different<00:03:03.209> elements<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.750> got

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
very a lot of different elements you got

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.350 
very a lot of different elements you got
the<00:03:03.989> trees<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.440> cut<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.680> branches<00:03:05.209> which<00:03:06.209> is

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the trees to cut the branches which is

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.110 
the trees to cut the branches which is
really<00:03:06.870> difficult<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.380> make<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:08.730> fortunately

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
really difficult to make but fortunately

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.449

for<00:03:09.330> us<00:03:09.360> there's<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> program<00:03:10.530> program<00:03:11.010> called

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
for us there's a program program called

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.640 
for us there's a program program called
speed<00:03:11.700> three<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.420> being<00:03:12.569> used<00:03:12.630> by<00:03:12.959> just

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
speed three it's being used by just

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.729 
speed three it's being used by just
about<00:03:13.739> every<00:03:14.519> game<00:03:14.819> company<00:03:15.299> out<00:03:15.450> there<00:03:15.739> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
we can get very realistic-looking trees

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:30.720 
we can get very realistic-looking trees
in<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.049> program
