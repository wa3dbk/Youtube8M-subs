00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
real diversity in the type of things we

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.790 
real diversity in the type of things we
can<00:00:43.210> see<00:00:43.360> today<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:44.560> what's<00:00:44.740> very

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
can see today and what's very

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.530 
can see today and what's very
interesting<00:00:44.980> some<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.670> these<00:00:45.790> solutions<00:00:46.300> are

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
interesting some of these solutions are

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.870 
interesting some of these solutions are
aimed<00:00:46.750> for<00:00:47.020> providers<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:48.040> some<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.730> them<00:00:48.850> are

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
aimed for providers and some of them are

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.790 
aimed for providers and some of them are
aimed<00:00:49.060> at<00:00:49.180> consumers<00:00:49.360> so<00:00:49.960> hopefully<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:50.680> can

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
aimed at consumers so hopefully we can

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.140 
aimed at consumers so hopefully we can
have<00:00:50.950> a<00:00:50.980> good<00:00:51.160> idea<00:00:51.280> of<00:00:51.520> what's<00:00:51.910> really<00:00:52.120> out

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
have a good idea of what's really out

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.569 
have a good idea of what's really out
there<00:00:52.270> in<00:00:52.540> terms<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.840> innovation<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.190> why

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
there in terms of innovation so why

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.920 
there in terms of innovation so why
don't<00:00:54.700> we<00:00:54.730> take<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.090> look<00:00:55.210> around<00:00:55.329> and<00:00:55.630> see<00:00:55.780> what

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
don't we take a look around and see what

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:06.240 
don't we take a look around and see what

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
behind developing this that was by our

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.150 
behind developing this that was by our
ethnographers<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.590> they<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.860> be<00:02:32.980> used

you're<00:02:50.650> talking<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.070> them<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.520> know<00:02:51.550> they

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
you're talking to them you know they

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.910 
you're talking to them you know they
they<00:02:52.660> put<00:02:52.870> their<00:02:53.020> makeup<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.650> all<00:02:53.739> that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
they put their makeup on and all that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.210 
they put their makeup on and all that
stuff<00:02:54.040> before<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.580> call<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.910> they<00:02:55.090> look<00:02:55.300> good

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
stuff before you call it they look good

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.910 
stuff before you call it they look good
but<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.640> actually<00:02:58.180> will<00:02:58.570> hold<00:02:58.780> 30<00:02:59.350> days<00:02:59.620> worth

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
but it actually will hold 30 days worth

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.760 
but it actually will hold 30 days worth
of<00:03:00.130> biometric<00:03:00.880> data<00:03:01.120> also<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.200> device<00:03:02.500> so

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
of biometric data also on the device so

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.290 
of biometric data also on the device so
that<00:03:02.800> patients<00:03:03.040> can<00:03:03.310> interact<00:03:03.790> with<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.150> which

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
that patients can interact with it which

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.180 
that patients can interact with it which
is<00:03:04.480> really<00:03:04.690> good<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.020> what<00:03:05.170> we<00:03:05.290> really<00:03:05.560> want

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
is really good and what we really want

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.800 
is really good and what we really want
to<00:03:06.280> do<00:03:06.459> with<00:03:06.700> all<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.360> not<00:03:07.540> just

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
to do with all of this it's not just

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.300 
to do with all of this it's not just
about<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.110> piece<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.410> equipment<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.040> really

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
about a piece of equipment it's really

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.759 
about a piece of equipment it's really
about<00:03:09.400> getting<00:03:09.670> patients<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.450> change<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.590> way

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
about getting patients to change the way

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.030 
about getting patients to change the way
they<00:03:12.040> they<00:03:12.489> function<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.350> helping

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
they they function in and helping

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.009 
they they function in and helping
clinicians<00:03:15.310> actually<00:03:16.030> change<00:03:16.390> their<00:03:16.660> model

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
clinicians actually change their model

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.770 
clinicians actually change their model
of<00:03:17.140> care<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:18.070> kind<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.430> technology<00:03:19.180> fits

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
of care so this kind of technology fits

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.540 
of care so this kind of technology fits
in<00:03:19.930> with<00:03:20.110> it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
in with it

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.300 
in with it
it's<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.120> first<00:03:22.330> so<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.660> are<00:03:22.810> enabled

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
it's the first so you are enabled

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.160 
it's the first so you are enabled
glucometer<00:03:24.310> but<00:03:25.240> also<00:03:25.390> we<00:03:25.750> give<00:03:25.960> back

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
glucometer but also we give back

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.250 
glucometer but also we give back
messages<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.220> patient<00:03:28.000> himself<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.750> from

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
messages to the patient himself so from

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.480 
messages to the patient himself so from
a<00:03:29.730> physician<00:03:30.730> generated<00:03:31.630> set<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.650> messages<00:03:32.830> so

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
a physician generated set of messages so

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.580 
a physician generated set of messages so
that<00:03:33.520> at<00:03:34.000> point<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.570> care<00:03:34.810> we're<00:03:35.110> doing<00:03:35.440> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
that at point of care we're doing it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.410 
that at point of care we're doing it
with<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.100> behavioral<00:03:36.610> scientists<00:03:37.120> would<00:03:37.210> say

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
with the behavioral scientists would say

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.010 
with the behavioral scientists would say
a<00:03:37.570> teaching<00:03:38.200> moment<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.770> we<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.100> change<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.900> we

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
a teaching moment so we can change so we

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.110 
a teaching moment so we can change so we
can<00:03:41.170> change<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.890> way<00:03:42.040> they<00:03:42.220> bathe<00:03:42.460> tell<00:03:42.970> them

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
can change the way they bathe tell them

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.660 
can change the way they bathe tell them
take<00:03:43.600> another<00:03:43.900> unit<00:03:44.290> if<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:44.560> required<00:03:44.740> eaten

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
take another unit if it's required eaten

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.210 
take another unit if it's required eaten
with<00:03:45.880> their<00:03:46.180> blood<00:03:46.840> stool<00:03:47.200> out<00:03:47.380> more<00:03:48.010> than<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
with their blood stool out more than a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.710 
with their blood stool out more than a
teaching<00:03:48.670> moment<00:03:48.820> that's<00:03:49.150> right<00:03:49.330> it's<00:03:49.510> also

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
teaching moment that's right it's also

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.300 
teaching moment that's right it's also
life-saving<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.470> enjoyment<00:03:50.680> writing<00:03:51.130> right
