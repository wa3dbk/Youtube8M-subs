00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
 good afternoon so time to sum up 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.440
 Before you highscreen thor 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:15.799
 1 8 nuclear honest 8-core smartphone 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.799
 caught in moderation 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.580
 As usual, I remind you that this video 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.869
 which you see is not 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 full-fledged 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.980
 review review you can read us 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.400
 Online 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.769
 helpix.ru it will be published there 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.769
 shortly after i record this video 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.800
 eight-core means ours quickly means 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.270
 many many parrots 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.899
 programs like antutu this is definitely yes 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.730
 to be honest 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.180
 other special advantages of this 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.539
 multi-core and I have not discovered before 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:03.449
 the device is definitely smart certainly 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:06.360
 nice but how much is merit 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.890
 these eight nuclear is not very 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.909
 big doubts more about it 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.610
 written in a review 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.810
 go out and read briefly 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.600
 speed more than satisfied 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.060
 the screen is very good claims against him 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.640
 also no good brightness good 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.380
 danger is not the maximum possible 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 happened and get but very well 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 battery with battery is difficult 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:47.149
 average not bad but when you try 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:52.320
 do something heavy type of toys he 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.970
 burns discharged impetuous even 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.979
 the easiest pear on which I 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.520
 I'm testing 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:04.880
 battery is a little less than three hours 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.880
 on average brightness, bad result 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 when we are providing the most common 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.280
 android thought nothing like a phone 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.740
 works well dvuhsimochny any 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.670
 problems they are marked flash can be 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.500
 flashlight is not too bright but quite 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:33.490
 reasonably the camera itself smashed averages 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 the impression is nothing special about it 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:42.660
 although many many 13 pixels 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.520
 megapixel camera camera fast 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.120
 user-friendly interface of any type of inclusion 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.140
 Hadera 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:56.470
 and others but the quality of photos 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.510
 correctly average pleased frontal 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.090
 camera are you yes that's good 5 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.459
 megapixels and it is very high quality 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.380
 megapixels so if you will with 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.380
 someone to chat on skype will see you 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.380
 OK 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:20.350
 Further as navigator as navigator 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.040
 yes this is basically normal again 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.230
 considering taking into account the battery should 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.549
 say that in elevator mode everything 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:36.160
 far not so bad as when you 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:41.950
 trying to play it so check 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:46.290
 movie tracks are moderately even and sometimes 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.290
 look worse 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.830
 of course this gap 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.230
 it is really very understand the point 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:01.659
 Start and Finish matched videos with 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.010
 video playback problems is not certain 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:08.500
 cypher any full hd 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.560
 but as usual with us and we are 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.269
 mediatek when and not only they need 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.010
 use a third-party player 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.010
 otherwise there will be no sound 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.040
 and here it was full hd video in all its 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.860
 beauty 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.340
 Perhaps almost all of us could, as usual 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.630
 finally, let's play a little with games 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.440
 as you probably thought it was all 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.440
 about dash 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:06:00.139
 that's all I wanted to show you and about 

00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:03.019
 what to tell the eight core processor 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:06.419
 on the smartphone from of course fun 

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:10.859
 although something has a special meaning in his 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.819
 I didnâ€™t see availability here 

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:13.769
 go to our website 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.649
 get acquainted with the detailed text on 

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:18.649
