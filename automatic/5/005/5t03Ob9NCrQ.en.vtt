00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
know what this is and you probably all

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.189 
know what this is and you probably all
picked<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> sword<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.359> thrown<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.109> out

picked up the sword and thrown it out
about<00:00:25.439> five<00:00:25.710> levels<00:00:26.039> later<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.320> really

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
about five levels later but I really

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.040 
about five levels later but I really
like<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.490> also<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.880> sword<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.359> use<00:00:30.599> in

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
like it so I'm going to build this one

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.729 
like it so I'm going to build this one
this<00:00:48.090> image<00:00:48.600> actually<00:00:49.079> looking<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.559> is

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
this image actually looking at is

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.450 
this image actually looking at is
actually<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:51.680> retexture<00:00:52.680> project<00:00:53.160> that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
actually a retexture project that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.510 
actually a retexture project that
somebody<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.969> working<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> internet

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
somebody is working on in the internet

somebody is working on in the internet
and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.789> looking<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.149> seeing

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and I was just looking at that seeing

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.090 
and I was just looking at that seeing
what<00:00:57.809> he<00:00:57.989> had<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:59.489> know<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:01.109> course<00:01:01.500> the

concern<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.489> getting<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> scroll<00:01:03.840> work<00:01:04.049> here

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
concern is getting the scroll work here

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.190 
concern is getting the scroll work here
down<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.840> trying<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
scroll work down here kind of at a good

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.140 
scroll work down here kind of at a good
picture<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.270> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.510> difficult<00:01:14.150> but

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
picture that is kind of difficult but

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
picture that is kind of difficult but
just<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> show<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.049> did<00:01:16.170> basically<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
just to show you what I did basically to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
just to show you what I did basically to
start<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.170> screencap<00:01:19.170> from

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
start out is this is a screencap from

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.510 
start out is this is a screencap from
the<00:01:19.530> game<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> did<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.040> because

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the game and all I did was because

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.740 
the game and all I did was because
there's<00:01:23.790> no<00:01:24.030> real<00:01:24.630> measurements<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.470> these

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
there's no real measurements for these

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.219 
there's no real measurements for these
basically<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.990> only<00:01:28.110> thing<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.220> used<00:01:30.229> was

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
basically the only thing that I used was

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.649 
basically the only thing that I used was
what<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> call<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> hand<00:01:32.070> method<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.670> just

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
what I call the hand method and just

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.469 
what I call the hand method and just
means<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.650> blow<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.479> fairly

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
means that you just blow this up fairly

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.069 
means that you just blow this up fairly
large<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> only<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.960> really

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
large and then the only thing you really

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.289 
large and then the only thing you really
know<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> only<00:01:40.710> corresponding<00:01:41.640> elements

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
know the only corresponding elements

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.910 
know the only corresponding elements
between<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.470> real<00:01:43.649> world<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:45.270> game<00:01:45.479> is

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
between the real world and the game is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.319 
between the real world and the game is
the<00:01:46.920> fact<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.340> how<00:01:47.579> wide<00:01:47.970> your

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the fact that you know how wide your

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.550 
the fact that you know how wide your
palm<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.270> from<00:01:51.479> top<00:01:51.720> basically<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
palm is you know from top basically the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.740 
palm is you know from top basically the
sort<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.799> grip<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.100> hand<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:54.600> know

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
sort of grip of your hand and you know

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.200 
sort of grip of your hand and you know
how<00:01:54.960> why<00:01:55.170> they're<00:01:55.500> holding<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:57.000> game

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
how why they're holding that in the game

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
how why they're holding that in the game
so<00:01:58.049> basically<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.950> use<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.399> hand<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.939> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so basically if you use your hand as a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.929 
so basically if you use your hand as a
scale<00:02:00.329> reference<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.920> distance<00:02:02.460> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
scale reference for this distance you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.450 
scale reference for this distance you
can<00:02:03.090> apply<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.659> scale<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.799> rest<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
can apply that scale to the rest of the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.619 
can apply that scale to the rest of the
sword<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:07.079> what<00:02:07.560> I've<00:02:07.680> done<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.239> sword

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
sword so what I've done is that my sword

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.720 
sword so what I've done is that my sword
my<00:02:09.929> palm<00:02:10.679> width<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> about<00:02:11.220> four<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.670> half

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
my palm width is about four and a half

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.790 
my palm width is about four and a half
inches<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.300> that's

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
inches and that's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.090 
inches and that's
fairly<00:02:13.580> tight<00:02:13.820> for<00:02:14.780> me<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.590> I'm<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:15.980> go

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
fairly tight for me so I'm going to go

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.590 
fairly tight for me so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.310> lengthen<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.060> out<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.390> five

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
ahead and lengthen that out to five

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.030 
ahead and lengthen that out to five
inches<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.710> be<00:02:18.770> 5<00:02:18.980> inches

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
inches so this is going to be 5 inches

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.200 
inches so this is going to be 5 inches
long<00:02:20.020> then<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.080> might<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.350> about<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.620> width<00:02:22.210> 1

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
long then I might have about a width 1

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.440 
long then I might have about a width 1
inch<00:02:23.390> width<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.090> takes<00:02:26.210> us<00:02:26.360> about

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
inch width and then it takes us about

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.720 
inch width and then it takes us about
three<00:02:26.780> quarters<00:02:27.100> I'm<00:02:28.100> going<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.370> kind<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.550> have

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
three quarters I'm going to kind of have

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.180 
three quarters I'm going to kind of have
this<00:02:28.880> as<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.290> carryover<00:02:30.290> from<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.830> katana

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
this as a carryover from the katana

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.940 
this as a carryover from the katana
project<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:31.850> started<00:02:32.390> which<00:02:32.780> was<00:02:32.950> using

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
project that I started which was using

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.130 
project that I started which was using
quarter<00:02:34.220> inch<00:02:34.370> wood<00:02:34.810> we're<00:02:35.810> going<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.990> try<00:02:36.110> and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
quarter inch wood we're going to try and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.120 
quarter inch wood we're going to try and
use<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.320> we're<00:02:36.620> going<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:36.800> use<00:02:36.890> some<00:02:36.920> other

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
use that we're going to use some other

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.360 
use that we're going to use some other
elements<00:02:37.640> for<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.820> scrollwork<00:02:39.040> about<00:02:40.040> using

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
elements for the scrollwork about using

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.700 
elements for the scrollwork about using
that<00:02:40.400> five<00:02:40.760> inch<00:02:40.970> measurement<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.350> can<00:02:42.500> kind

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
that five inch measurement you can kind

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.010 
that five inch measurement you can kind
of<00:02:42.770> apply<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.610> rest<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.020> with

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
of apply that to the rest of that with

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.930 
of apply that to the rest of that with
using<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.440> tape<00:02:45.650> measure<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.610> if<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.850> know

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
using a tape measure so if you know

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.120 
using a tape measure so if you know
that's<00:02:47.180> five<00:02:47.420> inches<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> scale<00:02:48.920> it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
that's five inches and as a scale it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.010 
that's five inches and as a scale it
shows<00:02:49.340> up<00:02:49.460> as<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> half<00:02:49.880> an<00:02:50.030> inch<00:02:50.210> on<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.690> screen

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
shows up as a half an inch on the screen

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.280 
shows up as a half an inch on the screen
with<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> tape<00:02:51.800> measure<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.170> know

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
with a tape measure and this is you know

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.780 
with a tape measure and this is you know
an<00:02:54.470> inch<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.770> half<00:02:54.830> across<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.490> means<00:02:55.640> it's

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
an inch and half across that means it's

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.820 
an inch and half across that means it's
15<00:02:56.150> inches<00:02:56.420> across<00:02:56.660> that's<00:02:57.320> not<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.470> actual

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
15 inches across that's not the actual

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.510 
15 inches across that's not the actual
number<00:02:58.210> but<00:02:59.230> that<00:03:00.230> gives<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.620> good<00:03:00.800> you

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
number but that gives you a good you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.400 
number but that gives you a good you
know<00:03:01.610> idea<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:01.940> how<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.120> do<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.140> basically

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
know idea of how to do it so basically

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.930 
know idea of how to do it so basically
what<00:03:03.620> I've<00:03:03.740> come<00:03:03.980> down<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.460> is<00:03:04.640> I'm<00:03:04.760> going<00:03:04.850> to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
what I've come down to is I'm going to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.070 
what I've come down to is I'm going to
make<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.180> entire<00:03:05.510> sword<00:03:06.400> 38<00:03:07.400> inches<00:03:07.670> long

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
make the entire sword 38 inches long

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.590 
make the entire sword 38 inches long
from<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.410> bottom<00:03:09.740> here<00:03:10.550> of<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.730> hilt<00:03:10.910> all<00:03:11.360> the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
from the bottom here of the hilt all the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.910 
from the bottom here of the hilt all the
way<00:03:11.690> up<00:03:11.780> from<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.110> bottom<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.620> pommel

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
way up from the bottom of the pommel

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.380 
way up from the bottom of the pommel
excuse<00:03:13.130> me<00:03:13.250> all<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.520> way<00:03:13.610> up<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.850> top<00:03:13.940> of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
excuse me all the way up to the top of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.620 
excuse me all the way up to the top of
the<00:03:14.510> sword<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:15.710> be<00:03:15.800> able<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:16.010> 38<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.480> did<00:03:17.600> a

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
the sword to be able to 38 and I did a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.140 
the sword to be able to 38 and I did a
little<00:03:17.750> bit<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:17.959> research<00:03:18.680> not<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.010> ton<00:03:19.280> but<00:03:19.310> I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
little bit of research not a ton but I

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.920 
little bit of research not a ton but I
guess<00:03:20.780> traditional<00:03:21.350> Viking<00:03:22.720> swords<00:03:23.720> for

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
guess traditional Viking swords for

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.280 
guess traditional Viking swords for
about<00:03:24.550> 35<00:03:25.550> little<00:03:26.180> shorter<00:03:26.390> than<00:03:26.510> 36<00:03:26.989> inches

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
about 35 little shorter than 36 inches

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.400 
about 35 little shorter than 36 inches
so<00:03:27.620> we're<00:03:27.770> kind<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.130> close<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:30.170> the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
so we're kind of close to that so the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.400 
so we're kind of close to that so the
scale<00:03:30.739> is<00:03:30.980> fairly<00:03:31.280> good<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.970> we're<00:03:32.120> using

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
scale is fairly good that we're using

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.600 
scale is fairly good that we're using
and<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.650> said<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:34.010> handles<00:03:34.370> going<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.550> be

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
and like I said that handles going to be

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.229 
and like I said that handles going to be
5<00:03:34.790> inches<00:03:34.840> tall<00:03:36.760> then<00:03:37.760> we're<00:03:37.910> going<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.090> have

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
5 inches tall then we're going to have

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.580 
5 inches tall then we're going to have
you<00:03:38.600> know<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> other<00:03:38.959> measurements<00:03:39.500> from

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
you know the other measurements from

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.140 
you know the other measurements from
there<00:03:39.800> but<00:03:39.980> we'll<00:03:40.100> take<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.880> through<00:03:40.910> those

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
there but we'll take you through those

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.699 
there but we'll take you through those
measurements<00:03:41.480> there<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.320> other<00:03:42.470> thing<00:03:42.590> I'm

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
measurements there the other thing I'm

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.370 
measurements there the other thing I'm
working<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.100> now<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.370> translating<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
working on now is translating the the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.729 
working on now is translating the the
scrollwork<00:03:45.830> pattern<00:03:46.310> on<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.940> hilt<00:03:47.300> here<00:03:47.739> and

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
scrollwork pattern on the hilt here and

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.400 
scrollwork pattern on the hilt here and
on<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.010> pommel<00:03:49.480> trying<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.570> transfer<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:50.989> to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
on the pommel trying to transfer that to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.580 
on the pommel trying to transfer that to
a<00:03:54.459> like<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.489> PDF<00:03:56.000> file<00:03:56.330> that<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.900> can<00:03:57.140> post<00:03:57.350> for

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
a like a PDF file that I can post for

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.350 
a like a PDF file that I can post for

squirrel work portion so that you don't

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.520 
squirrel work portion so that you don't
have<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.250> try<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:01.850> free<00:04:02.060> hand<00:04:02.239> all<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.660> so

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
have to try and free hand all that so

have to try and free hand all that so
I'm<00:04:03.709> basically<00:04:03.830> trying<00:04:04.070> to<00:04:04.250> draft<00:04:04.520> that<00:04:04.760> up<00:04:04.940> so

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
I'm basically trying to draft that up so

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.790 
I'm basically trying to draft that up so
i<00:04:05.120> can<00:04:05.330> post<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:05.989> then<00:04:06.380> we're<00:04:06.650> going<00:04:06.739> to

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
i can post that and then we're going to

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.060 
i can post that and then we're going to
get<00:04:06.920> moving<00:04:07.780> but<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:09.290> start<00:04:09.470> off<00:04:09.620> with<00:04:09.860> we've

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
get moving but to start off with we've

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.600 
get moving but to start off with we've
got<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.610> blade<00:04:11.330> that<00:04:11.630> we<00:04:11.810> can<00:04:12.250> start<00:04:13.250> cutting

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
got the blade that we can start cutting

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.220 
got the blade that we can start cutting
out<00:04:13.760> essentially

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
out essentially

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.580 
out essentially
and<00:04:15.519> again<00:04:16.519> using<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.970> scale<00:04:17.560> basically<00:04:18.560> all

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
and again using the scale basically all

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.710 
and again using the scale basically all
i've<00:04:18.859> done<00:04:18.889> is<00:04:19.160> i<00:04:19.639> have<00:04:19.790> determined<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.479> it's

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
i've done is i have determined that it's

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.200 
i've done is i have determined that it's
going<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.019> be<00:04:21.109> 3<00:04:21.620> inches<00:04:21.650> wide<00:04:22.220> here<00:04:22.850> at<00:04:23.030> the

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
going to be 3 inches wide here at the

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.680 
going to be 3 inches wide here at the
very<00:04:23.449> bottom<00:04:23.990> of<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.380> blade<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:25.570> it's<00:04:26.570> going

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
very bottom of the blade and it's going

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.960 
very bottom of the blade and it's going
to<00:04:26.750> be<00:04:26.840> 3<00:04:27.080> inches<00:04:27.110> there<00:04:27.590> three<00:04:28.070> inches<00:04:28.250> at

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
to be 3 inches there three inches at

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.240 
to be 3 inches there three inches at
this<00:04:29.540> little<00:04:29.810> part<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.560> sticks<00:04:30.740> out<00:04:30.889> here

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
this little part that sticks out here

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.450 
this little part that sticks out here
and<00:04:31.600> then<00:04:32.600> close<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.560> three<00:04:33.800> inches<00:04:33.949> here<00:04:34.340> and

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
and then close to three inches here and

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.040 
and then close to three inches here and
then<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.669> whole<00:04:34.820> thing<00:04:35.120> obviously<00:04:35.600> you<00:04:35.930> have

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
then the whole thing obviously you have

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.110 
then the whole thing obviously you have
these<00:04:36.169> little<00:04:36.350> curves<00:04:36.760> but<00:04:37.760> then<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.000> whole

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
these little curves but then the whole

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.520 
these little curves but then the whole
thing<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.449> going<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.720> taper<00:04:39.050> down<00:04:39.169> to<00:04:39.410> about

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
thing is going to taper down to about

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.920 
thing is going to taper down to about
two<00:04:39.800> inches<00:04:40.100> up<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.490> top<00:04:40.610> here<00:04:40.720> about<00:04:41.720> two

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
two inches up to the top here about two

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.100 
two inches up to the top here about two
inches<00:04:42.139> around<00:04:42.320> here<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.770> then<00:04:43.660> we'll<00:04:44.660> do<00:04:44.840> a

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
inches around here and then we'll do a

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.600 
inches around here and then we'll do a
little<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.590> know<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.889> little<00:04:46.160> separate

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
little you know a little separate

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.960 
little you know a little separate
freehand<00:04:47.120> curved<00:04:47.449> tip<00:04:47.690> on<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.930> top<00:04:48.729> but<00:04:49.729> I'm

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
freehand curved tip on the top but I'm

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.719 
freehand curved tip on the top but I'm
going<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.270> draw<00:04:50.510> up<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.810> design<00:04:51.169> and<00:04:51.729> that'll

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
going to draw up the design and that'll

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.530 
going to draw up the design and that'll
be<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.850> nice<00:04:53.060> video<00:04:53.389> cutting<00:04:54.020> out<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.139> blade
