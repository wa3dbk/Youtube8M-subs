chocolate one is in a bowl over a small

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.269 
chocolate one is in a bowl over a small
amount<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.299> boiling<00:00:15.630> water<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.529> gentle

amount of boiling water or just a gentle
tumble<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> water<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:19.080> don't<00:00:19.260> need<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> water

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
tumble of water you don't need the water

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.950 
tumble of water you don't need the water
to<00:00:19.740> touch<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> bowl<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:21.060> break<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.660> bar

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to touch the bowl and you break one bar

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.660 
to touch the bowl and you break one bar
of<00:00:22.080> chocolate<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:23.039> break<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
of chocolate up just break it up in the

packaging<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.740> pop<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
packaging like this and then you pop it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.740 
packaging like this and then you pop it
straight<00:00:29.099> into<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.789> bowl<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:33.239> other<00:00:33.270> method

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
straight into your bowl the other method

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.970 
straight into your bowl the other method
that's<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.260> quicker<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> way

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that's a little bit quicker and the way

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
that's a little bit quicker and the way
that<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> prefer<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.880> melt<00:00:36.059> chocolate<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.660> in

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that I prefer to melt chocolate is in

that I prefer to melt chocolate is in
the<00:00:37.079> microwave<00:00:37.530> put<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> microwave<00:00:38.430> on

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the microwave put in the microwave on

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.520 
the microwave put in the microwave on
medium<00:00:38.969> setting<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.840> once<00:00:40.020> again<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.500> just

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
medium setting so once again we just

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.100 
medium setting so once again we just
break<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> chocolate<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> packaging

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.360 

okay<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.170> we've<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:49.410> those<00:00:49.620> into<00:00:49.890> nice<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
okay so we've got those into nice and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
okay so we've got those into nice and
manageable<00:00:50.730> size<00:00:50.969> pieces<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:52.020> put<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.320> in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
manageable size pieces we put them in

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
manageable size pieces we put them in
the<00:00:52.469> microwave<00:00:52.829> key<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> remember<00:00:54.300> always

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the microwave key to remember always

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.470 
the microwave key to remember always
must<00:00:55.230> go<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.250> medium<00:00:56.699> setting<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
must go in on the medium setting in the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
must go in on the medium setting in the
microwave<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.559> put<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> high<00:00:59.160> you're

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
microwave if you put it on a high you're

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
microwave if you put it on a high you're
likely<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> burn<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.539> sugars<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
likely to burn the sugars in the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.360 
likely to burn the sugars in the
chocolate<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.070> cause<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
chocolate and that can cause the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
chocolate and that can cause the
chocolate<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.820> seize<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.629> don't<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.960> concerned

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
chocolate to seize so don't be concerned

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
chocolate to seize so don't be concerned
if<00:01:04.619> after<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> first<00:01:05.250> minute<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.760> take<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
if after the first minute you take the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000 
if after the first minute you take the
chocolate<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.960> microwave<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
chocolate out of the microwave and it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
chocolate out of the microwave and it
hasn't<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.369> melted<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.540> would<00:01:09.689> be

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
hasn't really melted this would be

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.649 
hasn't really melted this would be
expected<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> our<00:01:10.860> microwaves<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.820> vary<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
expected and our microwaves do vary in

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
expected and our microwaves do vary in
the<00:01:13.619> amount<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.040> energy<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.970> deliver

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the amount of energy that they deliver

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
the amount of energy that they deliver
so<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.750> better<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.229> give<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.650> quick

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
so it's better just to give it a quick

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.570 
so it's better just to give it a quick
little<00:01:17.460> mix<00:01:17.759> put<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.200> once<00:01:20.070> again<00:01:20.369> on

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
little mix put it back in once again on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.440 
little mix put it back in once again on
medium<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.659> minute

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
medium for one more minute

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.760 
medium for one more minute
and<00:01:24.450> you'll<00:01:24.930> normally<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and you'll normally have to do that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380 
and you'll normally have to do that
three<00:01:26.189> times<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.670> you've<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:26.909> three<00:01:27.240> minutes

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
three times so you've got three minutes

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
three times so you've got three minutes
total<00:01:27.960> cooking<00:01:28.229> time<00:01:28.290> which<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.280> said

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
total cooking time which as I said

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.950 
total cooking time which as I said
earlier<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.850> half<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.780> takes

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
earlier is half the time that it takes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.710 
earlier is half the time that it takes
to<00:01:31.229> melt<00:01:31.710> chocolate<00:01:31.950> over<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> pan<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.240> boiling

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
to melt chocolate over a pan of boiling

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.580 
to melt chocolate over a pan of boiling
water<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> after<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.360> three<00:01:36.509> minutes<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
water so after your three minutes the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
water so after your three minutes the
chocolate<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.130> normally<00:01:38.610> look<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
chocolate would normally look like this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730 
chocolate would normally look like this
so<00:01:39.450> you've<00:01:39.570> still<00:01:39.750> got<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> few<00:01:40.170> lumps<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
so you've still got a few lumps but you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.219 
so you've still got a few lumps but you
just<00:01:40.950> stir<00:01:41.220> those<00:01:41.460> through<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
just stir those through and there you

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.609 
just stir those through and there you
have<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
have it

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.039 
have it
perfect<00:01:44.100> melted<00:01:44.520> chocolate<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.869> do

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
perfect melted chocolate if you do

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.690 
perfect melted chocolate if you do
happen<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.680> water<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> chocolate

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
happen to get water in the chocolate

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.420 
happen to get water in the chocolate
it's<00:01:47.820> normally<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> point<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.869> no<00:01:49.079> return

thicker than place dough so I actually

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.280 
thicker than place dough so I actually
