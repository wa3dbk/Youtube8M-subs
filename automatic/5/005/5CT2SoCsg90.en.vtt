up time I'm going to ignore that for the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.930 
up time I'm going to ignore that for the
firing<00:01:30.140> race<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.950> even<00:01:31.490> though<00:01:31.520> they<00:01:31.759> have

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
firing race so even though they have

Gatling gun gold have the same firing

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.199 
Gatling gun gold have the same firing
rate<00:01:35.690> whereas<00:01:36.229> rpk<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.009> slower<00:01:37.399> than<00:01:37.549> two<00:01:37.940> I'll

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.240 
rate whereas rpk is slower than two I'll
replay<00:01:38.989> it<00:01:39.080> again<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.440> slow<00:01:39.470> motion<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:40.220> that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
replay it again in slow motion so that

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:49.170 
replay it again in slow motion so that
you<00:01:40.429> can<00:01:40.550> see<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.789> difference

this<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.929> same<00:02:11.200> but<00:02:11.710> this<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.040> mostly<00:02:12.280> due<00:02:12.370> to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
this the same but this is mostly due to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.250 
this the same but this is mostly due to
the<00:02:12.700> spin-out<00:02:12.940> speed<00:02:13.330> I'll<00:02:13.630> replay<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.170> again

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
the spin-out speed I'll replay it again

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.720 
the spin-out speed I'll replay it again
in<00:02:14.500> slow<00:02:14.710> motion<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.580> actually

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
in slow motion so that you can actually

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.700 
in slow motion so that you can actually
see<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.150> difference<00:02:16.510> between<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> three

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:34.240 

you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.370 

and<00:02:34.450> finally<00:02:35.450> draw<00:02:35.750> speed<00:02:36.080> now<00:02:36.260> you've

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
and finally draw speed now you've

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.870 
and finally draw speed now you've
probably<00:02:36.530> already<00:02:36.830> guessed<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.640> spin

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
probably already guessed it but the spin

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.610 
probably already guessed it but the spin
up<00:02:38.000> kills<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.510> Gatling<00:02:38.840> gun<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> Gatling

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
up kills the Gatling gun and the Gatling

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.100 
up kills the Gatling gun and the Gatling
getting<00:02:39.860> gold<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.030> RPK<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.540> faster<00:02:42.080> than

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
getting gold so the RPK is faster than

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.570 
getting gold so the RPK is faster than
the<00:02:42.350> two<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.950> Gatling<00:02:43.250> gun<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.520> the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
the two but the Gatling gun and the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.630 
the two but the Gatling gun and the
Gatling<00:02:43.850> gun<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.060> gold<00:02:44.210> are<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.510> same<00:02:45.640> right

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
Gatling gun and gold are the same right

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.850 
Gatling gun and gold are the same right
then<00:02:46.850> my<00:02:47.210> own<00:02:47.330> opinion<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> gun<00:02:47.930> now<00:02:48.080> this

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
then my own opinion of the gun now this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.860 
then my own opinion of the gun now this
gun<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.100> great<00:02:49.580> him<00:02:49.970> what<00:02:50.210> it's<00:02:50.360> designed<00:02:50.540> for

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
gun is great him what it's designed for

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.070 
gun is great him what it's designed for

and it takes a lot of time to get the
