couple<00:05:51.650> for<00:05:51.890> seems<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.340> be<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> very<00:05:52.670> simple

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
couple for seems to be a very simple

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.220 
couple for seems to be a very simple
method<00:05:53.480> but<00:05:53.630> it's<00:05:54.020> not<00:05:54.470> it<00:05:54.830> requires<00:05:55.760> that

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
method but it's not it requires that

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.230 
method but it's not it requires that
continuous<00:05:57.230> one<00:05:57.500> side<00:05:57.770> one<00:05:58.340> direction<00:05:58.910> stir

it<00:06:00.020> might<00:06:00.320> be<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.920> little<00:06:01.310> backbone<00:06:01.820> and<00:06:02.060> so<00:06:02.180> now

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
it might be a little backbone and so now

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.330 
it might be a little backbone and so now
it's<00:06:02.570> done<00:06:02.840> but<00:06:03.080> don't<00:06:03.290> do<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.530> until<00:06:03.980> you<00:06:04.160> see

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
it's done but don't do it until you see
