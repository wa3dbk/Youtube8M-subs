sounds<00:02:20.780> no<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.019> mean<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.440> not<00:02:21.590> exactly<00:02:21.650> like

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
sounds no I mean it's not exactly like

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.729 
sounds no I mean it's not exactly like
that<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:22.760> i<00:02:23.599> think<00:02:23.690> i'm<00:02:24.080> doing<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.500> close

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
that but i think i'm doing a close

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.339 
that but i think i'm doing a close
impression<00:02:25.340> right<00:02:25.580> now<00:02:26.440> at<00:02:27.440> number<00:02:27.620> 2<00:02:29.349> 150

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
impression right now at number 2 150

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.410 
impression right now at number 2 150
times<00:02:30.590> normal<00:02:31.010> gravity<00:02:31.549> explaining<00:02:32.209> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
times normal gravity explaining and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.539 
times normal gravity explaining and
you'll<00:02:32.930> see<00:02:33.140> what<00:02:33.260> i<00:02:33.319> mean<00:02:33.440> as<00:02:33.890> i<00:02:34.010> elaborate

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
you'll see what i mean as i elaborate

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.259 
you'll see what i mean as i elaborate
further<00:02:34.819> into<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.810> actual<00:02:36.739> second<00:02:37.610> place

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
further into this actual second place

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.630 
further into this actual second place
for<00:02:38.599> this<00:02:38.750> video<00:02:39.110> now<00:02:39.830> what<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.099> mean<00:02:40.400> by<00:02:40.459> that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
for this video now what I mean by that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.120 
for this video now what I mean by that
is<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.180> don't<00:02:41.330> know<00:02:41.420> if<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.540> guys<00:02:41.690> remember

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
is I don't know if you guys remember

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.710 
is I don't know if you guys remember
back<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.370> earth<00:02:43.670> at<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> wish<00:02:44.239> happened<00:02:44.630> to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
back on earth at the wish happened to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.110 
back on earth at the wish happened to
Shenron<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.950> kakarot<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.580> be<00:02:46.700> brought<00:02:46.940> back

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
Shenron for kakarot to be brought back

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.699 
Shenron for kakarot to be brought back
to<00:02:47.330> life<00:02:47.360> because<00:02:47.930> everybody<00:02:48.380> thought<00:02:48.650> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
to life because everybody thought that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.610 
to life because everybody thought that
he<00:02:48.920> was<00:02:49.040> dead<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.299> fact<00:02:50.480> he<00:02:50.660> was<00:02:50.780> alive<00:02:51.170> and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
he was dead but in fact he was alive and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.830 
he was dead but in fact he was alive and
he<00:02:52.130> refused<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.700> come<00:02:52.940> back<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:53.360> his<00:02:53.510> cell<00:02:53.720> d

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
he refused to come back but his cell d

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.640 
he refused to come back but his cell d
return<00:02:53.989> at<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.980> later<00:02:55.010> time<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.420> then<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.959> Vegeta

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
return at a later time so then I Vegeta

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.400 
return at a later time so then I Vegeta
wasn't<00:02:58.579> had<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.849> go<00:02:59.000> inside<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.840> spaceship

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
wasn't had to go inside of the spaceship

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
wasn't had to go inside of the spaceship
that<00:03:00.620> kakarot<00:03:01.160> used<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:02.450> go<00:03:03.109> dynamic<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.950> at

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
that kakarot used to go dynamic and at

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.300 
that kakarot used to go dynamic and at
some<00:03:04.700> point<00:03:04.970> Vegeta<00:03:05.750> realized<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.799> kokoro

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
some point Vegeta realized that kokoro

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.420 
some point Vegeta realized that kokoro
trained<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.910> non<00:03:08.150> times<00:03:08.600> gravity<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.620> so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
trained in the non times gravity and so

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.430 
trained in the non times gravity and so
that<00:03:10.609> exactly<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.660> exactly<00:03:12.049> what<00:03:12.380> I

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
that exactly that is exactly what I

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.610 
that exactly that is exactly what I
Vegeta<00:03:13.100> did<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.760> trained<00:03:14.660> at<00:03:14.870> her<00:03:14.959> own<00:03:15.139> times

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
Vegeta did I trained at her own times

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.129 
Vegeta did I trained at her own times
normal<00:03:16.100> gravity<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.940> by<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.600> time<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.959> return

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
normal gravity and by the time I return

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.650 
normal gravity and by the time I return
to<00:03:18.500> Earth<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:19.190> had<00:03:19.400> already<00:03:19.609> mastered<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:20.630> a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
to Earth I had already mastered on a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.330 
to Earth I had already mastered on a
times<00:03:21.079> gravity<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.079> was<00:03:24.620> able<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:25.040> start

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
times gravity so I was able to start

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.729 
times gravity so I was able to start
right<00:03:25.579> off<00:03:25.609> without<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.720> 50<00:03:27.079> times<00:03:27.319> normal

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
right off without and 50 times normal

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.860 
right off without and 50 times normal
gravity<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.489> don't<00:03:29.120> know<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.299> anybody<00:03:29.690> ever

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
gravity I don't know if anybody ever

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.319 
gravity I don't know if anybody ever
wondered<00:03:30.350> that<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> explaining

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
wondered that but that is the explaining

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.830 
wondered that but that is the explaining
a<00:03:32.510> vegeta<00:03:33.200> training<00:03:33.950> under<00:03:34.239> under<00:03:35.239> 50<00:03:35.569> times

over gravity without having to try the
other<00:03:39.590> times<00:03:40.069> or<00:03:40.370> 50<00:03:40.880> because<00:03:41.660> i<00:03:41.780> have<00:03:41.870> already

did you guys know no one I fought go on

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.850 
did you guys know no one I fought go on
and<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.489> defeated<00:03:53.090> go<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.629> and<00:03:53.900> go<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:54.680> was

and I defeated go on and go on was

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.280 
and I defeated go on and go on was
facing<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.340> ground<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.970> happened<00:03:56.480> when<00:03:57.140> the

for everybody to be brought back to

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.899 
for everybody to be brought back to
earth<00:04:02.540> except<00:04:03.170> for<00:04:03.409> Kakarot<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.190> Frieza<00:04:04.489> I

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
earth except for Kakarot and Frieza I

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.930 
earth except for Kakarot and Frieza I
was<00:04:05.750> there<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.769> challenged<00:04:07.310> going<00:04:07.670> pretty

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
was there and I challenged going pretty

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.570 
was there and I challenged going pretty
much<00:04:08.150> actually<00:04:08.569> going<00:04:08.840> challenge<00:04:09.500> me<00:04:09.830> and<00:04:10.099> as

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
much actually going challenge me and as

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.479 
much actually going challenge me and as
I<00:04:10.730> was<00:04:10.910> able<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:12.709> was<00:04:12.830> pretty<00:04:13.040> much<00:04:13.250> about

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
I was able to that was pretty much about

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.210 
I was able to that was pretty much about
to<00:04:13.640> kill<00:04:13.849> going<00:04:14.379> piccolo<00:04:15.379> interrupted<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.160> he

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
to kill going piccolo interrupted and he

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.270 
to kill going piccolo interrupted and he
was<00:04:16.340> like<00:04:16.489> not<00:04:17.120> today<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:18.139> I<00:04:18.799> was<00:04:18.979> pretty<00:04:19.190> much

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
was like not today and I was pretty much

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.310 
was like not today and I was pretty much
expecting<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.239> somebody<00:04:20.690> would<00:04:20.870> prevent

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
expecting that somebody would prevent

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.800 
expecting that somebody would prevent
that<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.739> happen<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.970> is<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.240> only<00:04:23.389> thing<00:04:23.539> I

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
that to happen that is the only thing I

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.439 
that to happen that is the only thing I
did<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.770> protect<00:04:24.800> my<00:04:25.310> image<00:04:25.760> that

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449
