00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.480
 the trend is certainly that of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 go towards a type of climbing more 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.029
 sure here I don't agree with why 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.160
 me climbing is mainly a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.860
 luck that if we make everything safe 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.410
 we lose the adventures and take it for myself 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.170
 the most important component there is 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.290
 there is in mountaineering there is no need to say 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.820
 also that in these years maybe there is 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.000
 are clarifying the ideas a bit 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.320
 in the sense that there are various trends that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.390
 they begin to take their own identity 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.290
 here he was always alone once 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.050
 confused 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.690
 now there are those who do saxism clearly 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.760
 there is and there are those who climb the cliff 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.940
 you that makes rampi fell in the mountains 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.070
 they are very, very separated things 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.100
 precise and even say 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.870
 in short, mass media are understanding that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.540
 they are different things once it was 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.210
 all confused everything 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.150
 I mixed up I think if I had 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.310
 twenty years now 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.740
 or maybe you will be more directed maybe on 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.299
 on the bomber 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 on things like that anyway 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 my big adventure would be to go 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.549
 in the mountains this is what I think I think of 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.009
 hundred percent 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.049
 I totally agree with 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.909
 certain speeches that is when 16 is definitive 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.810
 finished there is no need for you to do 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.610
 in my opinion it is not true because this is true 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.009
 they said that not even the first ones 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.899
 explorers the second explorers of the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.649
 dolomites or Himalayas one speaks of that 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.750
 before it was finished 100 years ago by 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.210
 what they said certain instead of 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.670
 so it was not finished the first was not 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.869
 finished then it is not finished now here 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.630
 sure that they make me grow in my opinion 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.789
 to say should mean that an area that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.709
 I want to originate in the sense that it should 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.780
 face the mountain with honest mediums 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.780
 here in my opinion is always is always that 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.970
 there are some things a little bit 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.069
 absolute relative things when climbing 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.069
 comedian indication of the 30s 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.750
 that is something absolute when 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.600
 put a writing in the 5 meters 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.940
 that 's a relative thing I like 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.620
 talk about what I know 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.970
 in the sense that it could give such a rite of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.100
 on the fly on Himalayan companies or 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.840
 but I think even of malaja is a 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.520
 as he said put years ago if there 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.540
 had been the cameras 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.730
 probably the history of certain 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.160
 mountain would be very different then 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.470
 they are two things that are heard saying things 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.850
 who see us maybe even movies though 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.530
 I want to take the town of 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.770
 wounding something you know in every 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.890
 that is, the dolomites are permitted by the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.270
 unattached fish chair a thing 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.180
 big business here is what he has 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.330
 really brought forward also because 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.980
 when he went untied from Mexico first 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.410
 not compromises are not compromised 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.670
 what you do is true eni no one can 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.740
 say nothing 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.459
 so surely the absence of stripes 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.459
 it's something he left me 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.550
 no I fish I did not 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.730
 I'm going to look trier marmolada 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.850
 marmolada I go there as I in plagas 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.069
 a geeky professor isco 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.650
 so I prefer the overhangs 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.109
 the professional or another type of 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.849
 however climbing in any case yes I have 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.700
 did others say no to i know how i am with 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.950
 the plates 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.870
 in short, I can understand one who 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.200
 faces a life of the years bound 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.930
 in terms it must or must have must 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.819
 having that never forgets is a bit of a step 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.530
 go ahead like in the 1950s philippe 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.970
 faced forward of not climbing 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.220
 because why he made a way in 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.709
 clean way with next nails without 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.500
 pressure nails here I think that 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.239
 are those of companies here they are 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.380
 surely they are an example but also 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.440
 other other routes 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.980
 climbs were of the stones 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.340
 miliari here's here do not ask do not believe 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.970
 in the milestone that bears ours 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.410
 c in the mountains however that is in 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.780
 not even with the basic mentality is not the 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.200
 mindset that changes is its own 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.740
 in short, technically, to reopen 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.740
 to make her my own
