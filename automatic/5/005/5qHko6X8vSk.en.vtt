00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
even though I like new core the easy

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.460 
even though I like new core the easy
money<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.970> what<00:03:27.209> drew<00:03:27.480> me<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.080> it's<00:03:28.320> now

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
money is what drew me to it and it's now

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.410 
money is what drew me to it and it's now
hard<00:03:28.769> money<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.850> market<00:03:30.269> where

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
hard money and in a market where

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.090 
hard money and in a market where
tomorrow<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.050> get<00:03:31.170> an<00:03:31.290> employment<00:03:31.830> number

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
tomorrow we get an employment number

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.670 
tomorrow we get an employment number
that<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.640> don't<00:03:32.850> have<00:03:33.200> knowledge<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.620> that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
that we don't have knowledge of that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.740 
that we don't have knowledge of that
could<00:03:35.070> be<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> variable<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.030> hard<00:03:36.269> money<00:03:36.480> too

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
could be a variable the hard money too

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
could be a variable the hard money too
dangerous<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.680> might<00:03:37.860> have<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.100> look

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
dangerous so we might have to look

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.070 
dangerous so we might have to look
