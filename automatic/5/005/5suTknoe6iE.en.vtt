00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.520
 autumn rain and start again 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.240
 the sweatshirt the chatter shower in 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.400
 friendship 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.829
 the gray sky the melancholy with the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.829
 smile the heavier blankets up to 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.760
 cover the face the wine the chestnuts la 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.769
 polenta and mushrooms 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.080
 the trees are already there the years and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.480
 ice wraps we move slowly to 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.269
 keep everything intact man and relationships 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.550
 woman in which contact is avoided and I am 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.860
 so good only so much is so true is 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.660
 fake like moving in careful darkness 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.020
 the only fact of kissing more 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.879
 important I gave you in the dark magic 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.550
 hold you and tell a lie and go 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.379
 so because it cannot be otherwise 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.199
 streams of thoughts that I take and carry 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.829
 away in the only moments when I leave 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.960
 to go 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.379
 yet another drop in this sea what you want 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.379
 that is 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.430
 lulled by frequencies in situations now 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.479
 console between consonant players and 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.090
 lonely people 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.120
 among so many books I don't even know e 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.700
 light as light as a feather savored 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.280
 the autumn with the heaviest jacket and the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.560
 green sweatshirt with the head a little distant 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.600
 but still smiling with the smoke that 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.600
 it envelops me with the Rome that upsets 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.970
 distorted makes the colors of Saturday morning 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.550
 no work but you wake up anyway 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.940
 first the moisture on the car windows 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.000
 the apache arba dark that punctually 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.460
 forget about the seat and fear from the seat 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.380
 from my office I see the night fall 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.869
 the street noise of those who come back 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.479
 towards home and that only darkness lives 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.009
 seven mediums of tivano the armchairs 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.009
 take some songs
