Ronald so Burnley this weekend and I

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.670 
Ronald so Burnley this weekend and I
guess<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.870> expectation<00:00:03.870> kind<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.259> changes

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
guess the expectation kind of changes

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.320 
guess the expectation kind of changes

one way you're expected to win as a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.999 
one way you're expected to win as a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
group and as a manager how do you deal

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.140 
group and as a manager how do you deal
with<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.450> night<00:00:15.450> was<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> tough<00:00:16.470> week<00:00:17.150> because

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
with that night was a tough week because

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.630 
with that night was a tough week because
we<00:00:18.330> played<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:19.170> several<00:00:20.010> days<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.430> played

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
we played in several days we played

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.349 
we played in several days we played
shitty<00:00:20.900> arsenal<00:00:21.900> man<00:00:22.140> united<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.210> think<00:00:24.210> in

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
shitty arsenal man united I think in

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.769 
shitty arsenal man united I think in
general<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:25.050> play<00:00:25.260> well<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:26.539> think<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> best

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
general we play well I think the best

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.240 
general we play well I think the best
was<00:00:28.019> last<00:00:29.010> Monday<00:00:29.480> against<00:00:30.480> United<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
was last Monday against United but it

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.780 
was last Monday against United but it
was<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.210> result<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.430> expect<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
was not the result what we expect and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.130 
was not the result what we expect and
then<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.530> deserved<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.160> dead<00:00:38.579> night<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.989> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
then what we deserved a dead night it is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.400 
then what we deserved a dead night it is
difficult<00:00:40.350> because<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:41.460> are<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.700> used<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.410> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
difficult because we are not used to to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.270 
difficult because we are not used to to
lose<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> games<00:00:44.899> three<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> row<00:00:46.280> 3

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
lose that kind of games three in a row 3

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.150 
lose that kind of games three in a row 3
defeats<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:48.510> course<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:48.989> always<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
defeats and of course then always the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.420 
defeats and of course then always the
pressure<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.090> higher<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> win

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
pressure is higher to have and to win

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
pressure is higher to have and to win
the<00:00:53.550> next<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:53.850> that's<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.719> normally<00:00:55.289> but

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the next one that's that's normally but

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.580 
the next one that's that's normally but
but<00:00:55.770> probably<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> tough<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.590> Burnley

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
but probably a tough one because Burnley

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.759 
but probably a tough one because Burnley
is<00:01:00.379> stuff<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.559> home<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.820> physical<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.809> will

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
is stuff at home and it physical it will

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.530 
is stuff at home and it physical it will
be<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> tough<00:01:05.189> game<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.880> team<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.210> done<00:01:06.330> well

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
be a tough game the team have done well

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.880 
be a tough game the team have done well
in<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.780> kind<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.110> match<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.500> far<00:01:07.530> haven't

was encouraging in some of the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.859 
was encouraging in some of the
performance<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.759> ultimately<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.540> very

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

disappointing result yeah disappointed

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
disappointing result yeah disappointed
because<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> make<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.579> next<00:01:53.729> step

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
because we like to make the next step

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.389 
because we like to make the next step
and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.960> come<00:01:55.140> closer<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> big<00:01:56.159> teams

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and then to come closer to the big teams

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.959 
and then to come closer to the big teams
and<00:01:57.409> in<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.799> way<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> playing<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.790> our

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and in the way of playing in our

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.929 
and in the way of playing in our
performance<00:02:00.299> i<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.729> same

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
performance i think it was the same

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.929 
performance i think it was the same
level<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.540> maybe<00:02:03.810> against<00:02:04.259> united<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.670> played

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
level and maybe against united we played

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.290 
level and maybe against united we played
better<00:02:06.180> than<00:02:06.329> them<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
better than them but but it's it's the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
better than them but but it's it's the
decision<00:02:09.840> about<00:02:09.959> small<00:02:10.800> details<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.580> football

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
decision about small details in football

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.350 
decision about small details in football
we<00:02:14.180> had<00:02:14.330> more<00:02:14.510> chances<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:16.250> we<00:02:16.430> didn't<00:02:16.790> score

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
we had more chances but we didn't score

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.410 
we had more chances but we didn't score
two<00:02:18.170> goals<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.520> we<00:02:19.700> have<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
two goals and and and and we have and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.450 
two goals and and and and we have and
that<00:02:20.570> i<00:02:20.600> think<00:02:20.990> that's<00:02:21.320> that's<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.920> little<00:02:22.370> bit

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
that i think that's that's a little bit

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.830 
that i think that's that's a little bit
different<00:02:22.850> than<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.270> beginning<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
different than in the beginning of the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.310 
different than in the beginning of the
seasons<00:02:25.000> opponents<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:26.510> create<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.960> lot<00:02:27.290> of

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
seasons opponents don't create a lot of

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.640 
seasons opponents don't create a lot of
chances<00:02:28.010> against<00:02:28.460> us<00:02:28.610> but<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.650> defending

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
chances against us but but in defending

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.070 
chances against us but but in defending
we<00:02:30.860> are<00:02:31.040> make<00:02:31.280> some<00:02:31.790> mistakes<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.840> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
we are make some mistakes and and and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.370 
we are make some mistakes and and and
okay<00:02:33.740> they<00:02:33.980> punished<00:02:34.640> us<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.780> case<00:02:35.990> and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
okay they punished us in that case and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.590 
okay they punished us in that case and
and<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.400> was<00:02:37.550> difficult<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.150> terms<00:02:38.450> of

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
and that was difficult in terms of

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.790 
and that was difficult in terms of
dealing<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:38.960> those<00:02:39.080> mistakes<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.680> there

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
dealing with those mistakes is there

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.900 
dealing with those mistakes is there
anything<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.130> can<00:02:40.310> do<00:02:40.490> on<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.670> training

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
anything you can do on the training

can you can keep going you have to talk

can you can keep going you have to talk
about<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.950> do<00:02:46.460> you<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.000> show<00:02:47.270> videos

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
about that do you have to show videos

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.790 
about that do you have to show videos
about<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.250> but<00:02:49.780> personal<00:02:50.780> faults<00:02:51.620> in

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
about that but but personal faults in

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.640 
about that but but personal faults in
football<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:53.330> difficult<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.080> handle<00:02:54.290> that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
football it's difficult to handle that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.670 
football it's difficult to handle that
because<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:56.270> want<00:02:56.480> people<00:02:56.540> we<00:02:57.200> are<00:02:57.260> doing<00:02:57.440> our

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
because you want people we are doing our

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.370 
because you want people we are doing our
best<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.630> we<00:02:59.840> have<00:02:59.990> to<00:03:00.140> come<00:03:00.350> back

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
best and then but we have to come back

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.250 
best and then but we have to come back
like<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:02.000> we<00:03:02.180> was<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.720> beginning<00:03:02.870> and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
like what we was in the beginning and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.430 
like what we was in the beginning and
then<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.420> that's<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.750> feeling<00:03:06.230> but

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
then and that's it that's a feeling but

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.130 
then and that's it that's a feeling but
but<00:03:06.770> football<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.400> strange<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.690> win<00:03:08.900> one

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
but football is strange if you win one

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.190 
but football is strange if you win one
and<00:03:09.380> then<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.070> confidence<00:03:10.550> will<00:03:11.030> be<00:03:11.060> back<00:03:11.420> and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and then the confidence will be back and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.620 
and then the confidence will be back and
still<00:03:13.010> we<00:03:13.130> believe<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.610> our<00:03:13.730> way<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.090> playing<00:03:14.330> I

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
still we believe in our way of playing I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.440 
still we believe in our way of playing I
think<00:03:15.290> that's<00:03:15.470> that's<00:03:15.860> our<00:03:16.070> quality<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.850> we

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
think that's that's our quality and we

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.240 
think that's that's our quality and we
have<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.750> show<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:17.959> again<00:03:18.230> against<00:03:18.890> burnley

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
have to show that again against burnley

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.130 
have to show that again against burnley
in<00:03:19.580> terms<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:19.940> how<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.120> approach<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.810> Burnley

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
in terms of how you approach the Burnley

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.300 
in terms of how you approach the Burnley
game<00:03:21.320> you've<00:03:21.500> obviously<00:03:21.620> got<00:03:21.920> there<00:03:22.130> the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
game you've obviously got there the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.100 
game you've obviously got there the
final<00:03:22.910> coming<00:03:23.120> up<00:03:23.209> against<00:03:23.420> sheffield<00:03:23.690> united

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
final coming up against sheffield united

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.780 
final coming up against sheffield united
a<00:03:24.200> few<00:03:24.709> days<00:03:24.860> later<00:03:25.130> do<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.370> have<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.670> think

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
a few days later do you have to think

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.400 
a few days later do you have to think
about<00:03:25.940> these<00:03:26.239> two<00:03:26.420> games<00:03:26.690> almost<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.230> batch

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
about these two games almost in a batch

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.750 
about these two games almost in a batch
especially<00:03:27.920> at<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:28.040> time<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.310> year<00:03:28.459> with

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
especially at this time of year with

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.390 
especially at this time of year with
players<00:03:29.330> being<00:03:29.780> slightly<00:03:30.350> more<00:03:30.650> conditioned

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
players being slightly more conditioned

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.070 
players being slightly more conditioned
to<00:03:31.610> play<00:03:32.000> games<00:03:32.269> once<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.630> week<00:03:32.780> when<00:03:32.930> you've

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
to play games once a week when you've

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.840 
to play games once a week when you've
got<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.380> in<00:03:33.530> such<00:03:33.709> close<00:03:33.890> successions<00:03:34.730> you

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
got to in such close successions you

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.370 
got to in such close successions you
have<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.120> plan<00:03:35.570> accordingly<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:36.110> that

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
have to plan accordingly for that

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.479 
have to plan accordingly for that
anomaly<00:03:36.950> we<00:03:37.450> think<00:03:38.450> always<00:03:38.989> at<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:40.370> the

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
anomaly we think always at that to the

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.330 
anomaly we think always at that to the
first<00:03:40.730> one<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.269> we<00:03:41.630> have<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.989> play<00:03:42.230> but<00:03:43.040> ok

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
first one that we have to play but ok

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.460 
first one that we have to play but ok

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
you know that we will stay over in

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.240 
you know that we will stay over in
manchester<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.459> we<00:03:47.080> we<00:03:48.080> travel<00:03:48.500> with<00:03:48.680> 22

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
manchester and we we travel with 22

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.960 
manchester and we we travel with 22
players<00:03:49.550> because<00:03:50.920> Tuesday<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:51.950> always<00:03:52.550> it's

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
players because Tuesday is always it's

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.720 
players because Tuesday is always it's
also<00:03:53.269> important<00:03:54.110> for<00:03:54.170> us<00:03:54.440> but<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:55.040> we're<00:03:55.670> not

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
also important for us but but we're not

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.110 
also important for us but but we're not
in<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.030> situation<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.780> think<00:03:57.260> now<00:03:57.800> at<00:03:58.370> tuesday
