00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.959 
quickly and then I can go back to my
work<00:00:56.500> so<00:00:57.070> my<00:00:57.969> terms<00:00:58.420> were<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:59.460> that<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.700> had

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.119 
work so my terms were that that it had
to<00:01:01.120> be<00:01:01.149> something<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:02.020> I<00:01:02.050> could<00:01:02.469> easily<00:01:03.010> work

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
to be something that I could easily work

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.070 
to be something that I could easily work
into<00:01:03.430> my<00:01:03.520> schedule<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.119> so<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:04.960> what
