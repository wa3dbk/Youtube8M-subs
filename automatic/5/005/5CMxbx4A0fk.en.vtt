00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
four revolutions that's what makes it so

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
interesting is the choreography this you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.450 
interesting is the choreography this you
can<00:00:22.320> count<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.189> makes<00:00:23.340> it

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
can count and that's what makes it

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:37.000 
can count and that's what makes it
exciting

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
revolutions came out really clean I just

00:00:47.610 --> 00:01:08.510 
revolutions came out really clean I just
hope<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:47.940> didn't<00:00:48.090> leave<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.449> warm-up

finally<00:01:21.070> got<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.430> point<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.850> he<00:01:22.060> was

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
finally got to the point that he was

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.840 
finally got to the point that he was
getting<00:01:23.320> frustrated<00:01:23.680> it<00:01:24.340> seems<00:01:24.610> that<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
getting frustrated it seems that the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.430 
getting frustrated it seems that the
media<00:01:25.119> people<00:01:25.270> were<00:01:25.479> concentrating<00:01:26.140> only<00:01:26.259> on

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
media people were concentrating only on

media people were concentrating only on
the<00:01:26.619> quad<00:01:26.890> rather<00:01:27.310> than<00:01:27.580> on<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.820> complete

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
the quad rather than on the complete

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.150 
the quad rather than on the complete
skater<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:28.960> this<00:01:29.140> year<00:01:29.289> he's<00:01:29.410> concentrated<00:01:30.039> on

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
what it looked like three days ago

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.430 
what it looked like three days ago
you<00:01:44.920> say<00:01:45.100> nice<00:01:45.369> people

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440

rotates once twice three and about three

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.140 
rotates once twice three and about three
quarters<00:02:21.069> he<00:02:21.249> didn't<00:02:21.519> quite<00:02:21.639> get<00:02:21.849> all<00:02:21.939> the<00:02:22.030> way

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.459 
quarters he didn't quite get all the way
around<00:02:22.269> that's<00:02:22.629> why<00:02:22.810> he<00:02:22.870> couldn't<00:02:23.139> hold<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
around that's why he couldn't hold the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
with the kind of wait for they get it

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.150 
with the kind of wait for they get it
until<00:02:34.180> they<00:02:34.420> get<00:02:34.569> around<00:02:34.870> four<00:02:35.170> times<00:02:35.410> as<00:02:35.739> you
