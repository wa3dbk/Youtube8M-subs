 history but the lucos luco that we have 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.170
 eaten for decades today is in the middle of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.829
 for a local sandwich in 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.690
 puntarenas invested signage posters and 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.239
 start- up until he enrolled the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.829
 website the barros luco punto cl no 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.690
 notification that he had been objected 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.180
 another company contacted me by 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.890
 food products lawyers 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.850
 limited donuts that is dominated for 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.879
 try to reach an agreement because 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.250
 they have registered the brand muds 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.110
 luco domino has registered the brand 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.360
 lucos for use in areas of 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.270
 restaurant and the like but also the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.580
 website barros luco classic point similar to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.560
 he barros luco punto cl de mauricio 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.020
 vidal who does not accept to sell it for 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.330
 500 thousand pesos that offer you I think 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.970
 an unfair moment this the sandwich more 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.009
 traditional chile that exists does more 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.520
 of 100 years in our country be 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.350
 ownership of a company in the registry 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.880
 of intellectual property clarify that the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.369
 inscription of the brand barros luco 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.020
 implies specific rights but not 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.719
 prevents the sandwich from being followed 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.840
 preparing and selling freely the 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.880
 brand barros luco 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.159
 as a word is registered in chile 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.130
 for restaurants hotels wat cafeteria 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.560
 and therefore protects the provision of 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 those services of course not the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.069
 product itself as it could be by 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.289
 example and sandro although none of the 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.539
 web pages is working so far 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.729
 the domino company object registration 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.129
 made by Mauricio Vidal through a 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.509
 written statement domino argued that 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.610
 the current regulation for 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.099
 registration of a site establishes 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.470
 cause of revocation the existence of a 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.239
 preferential interest in this case the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.150
 possession and use of the trademark 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.280
 registered and renewed for 30 years 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.230
 what is important in this case is that the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.030
 good faith in terms of who I am 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.220
 using the domain for an interest 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.660
 legitimate and who does not collide with 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.280
 rights of another is something that is going to 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.410
 have to prove in the arbitration trial 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.610
 another vision is what the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.500
 current owners of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.709
 establishment in which according to history 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.200
 in 1910 the president RamÃ³n himself 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.360
 lucos luco invented the sandwich never 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.180
 they determined to inscribe it precisely 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.819
 because it's history who owns a 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.980
 thing that belongs to us 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.829
 that is part of the identity of this 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.889
 country is how to appropriate to appropriate 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.840
 something let's say it's all between three to 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.060
 four months could last the dispute for 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.859
 the website a real battle for 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.659
 occupy the name of one of the 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.659
 most popular sandwiches of chile
