other<00:04:13.000> cults<00:04:13.360> boat<00:04:13.569> that's<00:04:13.900> really<00:04:14.260> all<00:04:14.409> we

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
other cults boat that's really all we

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.830 
other cults boat that's really all we
could<00:04:14.650> hope<00:04:14.860> for<00:04:15.099> at<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.280> very<00:04:15.489> least<00:04:15.840> because

they're you know dishonorable liars
really<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:24.400> think<00:04:24.699> there's<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.449> lot<00:04:25.479> that<00:04:25.660> can<00:04:25.870> be

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
really I think there's a lot that can be

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.900 
really I think there's a lot that can be
said<00:04:26.139> about<00:04:26.169> their<00:04:26.500> character<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.190> think<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.880> lot

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
said about their character I think a lot

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.240 
said about their character I think a lot
of<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.330> negative<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.740> think<00:04:29.889> I'm<00:04:29.979> above

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
of it is negative and I think I'm above

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.310 
of it is negative and I think I'm above
that<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.610> think<00:04:30.789> I'm<00:04:30.880> above<00:04:31.210> saying<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.050> things

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
that I think I'm above saying the things

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.590 
that I think I'm above saying the things
that<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:34.360> everybody<00:04:34.690> knows<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:37.419> know<00:04:37.539> you

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
that that everybody knows you know you

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.510 
that that everybody knows you know you
win<00:04:37.900> some<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.169> lose<00:04:38.289> some<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:39.010> ultimately<00:04:39.430> I

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
win some you lose some but ultimately I

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.180 
win some you lose some but ultimately I
think<00:04:39.580> we're<00:04:39.850> all<00:04:39.910> winners<00:04:40.090> because<00:04:40.949> ours<00:04:41.949> was

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
think we're all winners because ours was

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.129 
think we're all winners because ours was
heavier<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:43.300> we<00:04:43.389> had<00:04:43.479> more<00:04:43.630> people<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:44.110> the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
heavier and we had more people in the

00:04:44.139 --> 00:05:01.580 
heavier and we had more people in the
boat<00:04:44.410> mmm<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.580> know
