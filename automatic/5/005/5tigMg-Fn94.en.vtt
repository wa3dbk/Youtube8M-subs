guys understand some the basic
procedures<00:00:14.109> of<00:00:14.260> working<00:00:14.709> on<00:00:14.770> these<00:00:14.889> engines

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
procedures of working on these engines

procedures of working on these engines
today<00:00:16.029> we're<00:00:16.150> going<00:00:16.240> to<00:00:16.330> cover<00:00:16.480> tool<00:00:17.109> carves

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
today we're going to cover tool carves

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.230 
today we're going to cover tool carves
and<00:00:17.650> how<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.769> synchronize<00:00:18.250> it<00:00:18.279> there<00:00:19.090> is<00:00:19.210> a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
and how to synchronize it there is a

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.060 
and how to synchronize it there is a
couple<00:00:19.539> different<00:00:19.599> sets<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:19.990> dual<00:00:20.170> carbs<00:00:20.530> the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
couple different sets of dual carbs the

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.670 
couple different sets of dual carbs the
adjustments<00:00:21.670> are<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.930> alike<00:00:23.230> but<00:00:23.530> they're

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
adjustments are not alike but they're

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.439 
adjustments are not alike but they're
different<00:00:23.890> on<00:00:24.190> the<00:00:24.580> different<00:00:24.880> set<00:00:25.030> of<00:00:25.119> carbs

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
different on the different set of carbs

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.570 
different on the different set of carbs
but<00:00:26.020> the<00:00:26.289> principle<00:00:26.650> is<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.740> same<00:00:26.800> they<00:00:27.550> both

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
but the principle is the same they both

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.730 
but the principle is the same they both
open<00:00:28.060> at<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.360> same<00:00:28.539> time<00:00:28.810> feed<00:00:29.560> the

open at the same time feed the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.590 
open at the same time feed the
carburetors<00:00:30.279> you<00:00:30.520> send<00:00:30.820> them<00:00:30.940> but<00:00:31.270> at<00:00:31.510> the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
carburetors you send them but at the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.090 
carburetors you send them but at the
same<00:00:31.779> time<00:00:32.020> that<00:00:32.289> fits<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.619> purpose<00:00:32.920> of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
same time that fits the purpose of

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.040

synchronizing<00:00:33.550> write<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.239> sync<00:00:34.600> they'll<00:00:34.780> pop

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
synchronizing write a sync they'll pop

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.500 
synchronizing write a sync they'll pop
they'll<00:00:35.350> scan<00:00:35.850> you'll<00:00:36.850> believe<00:00:37.089> maybe<00:00:37.300> your

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
time is off or close valve etc etc etc

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.649 
time is off or close valve etc etc etc
it's<00:00:41.859> just<00:00:42.039> routine<00:00:42.699> maintenance<00:00:42.909> thing<00:00:43.479> that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
it's just routine maintenance thing that

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.419 
it's just routine maintenance thing that
that<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.260> need<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.469> keep<00:00:44.589> up<00:00:44.710> with<00:00:44.889> rich<00:00:45.190> so

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
that you need to keep up with rich so

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.590 
that you need to keep up with rich so
today<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.879> are<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.120> tools<00:00:49.299> are<00:00:49.449> going<00:00:49.539> to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
today these are the tools are going to

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.599 
today these are the tools are going to
use<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.960> synchronize<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.499> carbs<00:00:50.829> this<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.489> the

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
use to synchronize the carbs this is the

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.430 
use to synchronize the carbs this is the
unis<00:00:51.879> think<00:00:52.089> this<00:00:52.329> is<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.479> snail<00:00:52.809> style<00:00:53.139> it's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
unis think this is a snail style it's

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.500 
unis think this is a snail style it's
the<00:00:54.069> easiest<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.579> best<00:00:54.670> one<00:00:54.969> to<00:00:55.059> use<00:00:55.210> there's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
the easiest and best one to use there's

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.840 
the easiest and best one to use there's
no<00:00:55.629> adjustment<00:00:55.959> it<00:00:56.379> just<00:00:56.920> pops<00:00:57.190> right<00:00:57.459> on<00:00:57.519> top

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
no adjustment it just pops right on top

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.340 
no adjustment it just pops right on top
of<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.030> velocity<00:00:58.420> stacks<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:58.989> measure<00:00:59.170> the

the<00:01:11.860> first<00:01:12.040> step<00:01:12.190> we're<00:01:12.460> going<00:01:12.550> to<00:01:12.610> do<00:01:12.730> is

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
the first step we're going to do is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.550 
the first step we're going to do is
going<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.060> our<00:01:13.510> air<00:01:13.660> cleaner<00:01:13.930> tops<00:01:14.260> and

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
going to our air cleaner tops and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.140 
going to our air cleaner tops and
elements<00:01:15.160> from<00:01:15.220> both<00:01:15.370> carburetors

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.100 

our<00:01:22.150> next<00:01:22.420> step<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:22.720> going<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.900> be<00:01:23.020> to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
our next step is going to be to

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.410 
our next step is going to be to
disconnect<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.680> linkage<00:01:24.070> rod<00:01:24.340> from<00:01:25.180> the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
disconnect the linkage rod from the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.210 
disconnect the linkage rod from the
linkage<00:01:25.780> from<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.020> carburetor<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.590> isolate

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
linkage from the carburetor to isolate

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.620 
linkage from the carburetor to isolate
them<00:01:27.310> we<00:01:27.400> want<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.610> both<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.970> be<00:01:28.090> independent

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
them we want to both to be independent

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.850 
them we want to both to be independent
whenever<00:01:28.810> we<00:01:28.960> get<00:01:29.080> ready<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.350> fire<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.650> up<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
whenever we get ready to fire it up and

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.500 
whenever we get ready to fire it up and
measure<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.520> volume<00:01:30.820> they're<00:01:30.970> drawn<00:01:31.120> at<00:01:31.270> idle

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
measure the volume they're drawn at idle

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.480 
measure the volume they're drawn at idle
but<00:01:32.110> before<00:01:32.410> I<00:01:32.440> disconnect<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:32.950> linkage<00:01:33.280> rod

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
but before I disconnect this linkage rod

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.010 
but before I disconnect this linkage rod
I'm<00:01:34.030> going<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.240> break<00:01:34.390> these<00:01:34.570> little<00:01:34.840> lock

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
I'm going to break these little lock

longer<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.140> shorter<00:01:44.290> if<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.590> know<00:01:44.680> which<00:01:44.800> way

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
longer and shorter if you know which way

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.950 
longer and shorter if you know which way
I<00:01:44.950> turn<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.340> rod<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:46.180> will<00:01:46.300> come<00:01:46.479> into<00:01:46.810> play

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
I turn the rod that will come into play

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.499 
I turn the rod that will come into play
later<00:01:47.009> after<00:01:48.009> we<00:01:48.100> get<00:01:48.190> them<00:01:48.340> adjusted<00:01:48.910> right

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
later after we get them adjusted right

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.270 
later after we get them adjusted right
then<00:01:49.990> we<00:01:50.110> can<00:01:50.259> put<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.470> linkage<00:01:50.740> back<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:51.100> and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
then we can put the linkage back on and

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.690 
then we can put the linkage back on and
make<00:01:51.369> them<00:01:51.490> open<00:01:51.640> at<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.940> same<00:01:52.119> time<00:01:53.520> okay<00:01:54.520> our

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
make them open at the same time okay our

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.070 
make them open at the same time okay our
next<00:01:54.729> step<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.420> fire<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.750> up<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:55.990> we're

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
next step is to fire it up and we're

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.450 
next step is to fire it up and we're
going<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.229> measure<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.619> amount<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.280> volume

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
going to measure the amount of volume

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.160 
going to measure the amount of volume
that<00:01:57.700> they're<00:01:57.880> drawn<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.210> idle<00:01:58.479> we've<00:01:58.930> got<00:01:59.080> the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
that they're drawn it idle we've got the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.740 
that they're drawn it idle we've got the
linkage<00:01:59.470> disconnected<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.750> they're

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
linkage disconnected and they're

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.850 
linkage disconnected and they're
independent<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.410> they're<00:02:02.560> each<00:02:02.649> going<00:02:02.800> to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
independent so they're each going to

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.650 
independent so they're each going to
have<00:02:03.039> it<00:02:03.160> own<00:02:03.340> their<00:02:03.850> own<00:02:03.880> individual<00:02:04.360> reading

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
have it own their own individual reading

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.810 
have it own their own individual reading
until<00:02:04.899> we<00:02:04.990> get<00:02:05.080> them<00:02:05.200> set<00:02:05.380> right<00:02:05.560> now<00:02:06.430> one

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
until we get them set right now one

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.940 
until we get them set right now one
thing<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.119> note<00:02:07.300> is<00:02:07.539> one<00:02:07.960> carburetor<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.679> going

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
thing to note is one carburetor is going

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.930 
thing to note is one carburetor is going
to<00:02:09.009> be<00:02:09.130> different<00:02:09.399> than<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.550> other

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
to be different than the other

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.490 
to be different than the other
they<00:02:10.450> haven't<00:02:10.630> been<00:02:10.810> set<00:02:11.050> up<00:02:11.080> yet<00:02:11.200> they're

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
they haven't been set up yet they're

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.050 
they haven't been set up yet they're
going<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.680> be<00:02:11.739> different<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.640> we're<00:02:12.820> going<00:02:12.940> to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
going to be different so we're going to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.600 
going to be different so we're going to
do<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.330> bring<00:02:13.660> either<00:02:14.200> one<00:02:14.410> up<00:02:14.650> or<00:02:14.920> one<00:02:15.070> down<00:02:15.310> to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
do is bring either one up or one down to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.970 
do is bring either one up or one down to
match<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.850> other<00:02:16.360> one<00:02:16.630> for<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.290> RPM<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:17.769> we

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
match the other one for the RPM that we

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.810 
match the other one for the RPM that we
want<00:02:18.220> we<00:02:18.550> want<00:02:18.580> around<00:02:19.000> 900<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.570> 1000<00:02:20.019> rpm<00:02:20.820> just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
want we want around 900 to 1000 rpm just

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.370 
want we want around 900 to 1000 rpm just
for<00:02:21.970> instance<00:02:22.180> if<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.600> one<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:22.900> ten<00:02:23.140> and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
for instance if you have one at ten and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.470 
for instance if you have one at ten and
one<00:02:23.530> at<00:02:23.709> seven<00:02:24.070> if<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.760> brought<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.239> from

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
one at seven if I brought the one from

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.630 
one at seven if I brought the one from
seven<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.049> ten<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.410> might<00:02:26.560> be<00:02:26.680> around<00:02:26.890> 2200

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
seven up to ten we might be around 2200

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.610 
seven up to ten we might be around 2200
rpm<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.600> might<00:02:28.750> need<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> bring<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.200> 10<00:02:29.440> down

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
rpm so I might need to bring the 10 down

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.080 
rpm so I might need to bring the 10 down
to<00:02:29.650> seven<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:30.489> we're<00:02:30.580> going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.730> fire<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:30.970> up

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
to seven but we're going to fire it up

00:02:31.090 --> 00:03:04.309 
to seven but we're going to fire it up
here<00:02:31.239> we're<00:02:31.360> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> see<00:02:31.690> where<00:02:31.840> at

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.450 

now<00:03:05.319> we<00:03:05.380> saw<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.650> carburetor<00:03:06.130> on<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.310> right

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
now we saw the carburetor on the right

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.210 
now we saw the carburetor on the right
side<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.940> pulling<00:03:07.690> around<00:03:07.780> 11<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.920> one<00:03:09.100> on

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
side was pulling around 11 the one on

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.640 
side was pulling around 11 the one on
the<00:03:09.340> left<00:03:09.670> side<00:03:09.910> was<00:03:10.209> around<00:03:10.510> 9<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.470> what<00:03:11.620> I

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the left side was around 9 so what I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.990 
the left side was around 9 so what I
want<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.890> do<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.190> I'm<00:03:12.310> going<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.459> lower<00:03:12.700> this

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
want to do is I'm going to lower this

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.620 
want to do is I'm going to lower this
number<00:03:13.530> down<00:03:14.530> by<00:03:14.740> using<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.100> idle<00:03:15.340> stop<00:03:15.520> screw

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
number down by using the idle stop screw

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.300 
number down by using the idle stop screw
by<00:03:16.630> coming<00:03:16.990> out<00:03:17.110> that's<00:03:17.440> going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.740> lower<00:03:18.160> it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
by coming out that's going to lower it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.010 
by coming out that's going to lower it
down<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.880> want<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> bring<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.330> down<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.660> 9<00:03:19.990> I

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
down I want to bring that down to 9 I

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.330 
down I want to bring that down to 9 I
want<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.320> match<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.740> one<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.070> left-hand

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
want to match the one on the left-hand

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.949 
want to match the one on the left-hand
side<00:03:21.550> so<00:03:22.180> I'm<00:03:22.300> going<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.480> fire<00:03:22.630> it<00:03:22.750> up<00:03:22.810> and

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
side so I'm going to fire it up and

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:59.520 
side so I'm going to fire it up and
we're<00:03:23.290> going<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.470> see<00:03:23.530> what<00:03:23.620> we<00:03:23.709> got

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.470 

okay<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.590> heard<00:04:00.770> out<00:04:00.980> settle<00:04:01.370> down<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:02.300> I've

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
okay you heard out settle down that I've

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.000 
okay you heard out settle down that I've
got<00:04:02.720> nice<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.110> smooth<00:04:03.320> once<00:04:03.560> we<00:04:03.680> got<00:04:03.800> it<00:04:03.920> to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
got nice and smooth once we got it to

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.920 
got nice and smooth once we got it to
where<00:04:04.130> it's<00:04:04.220> supposed<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.580> be<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.540> now<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.810> we

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
where it's supposed to be so now that we

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.930 
where it's supposed to be so now that we
got<00:04:05.960> to<00:04:06.170> both<00:04:06.320> balance<00:04:06.860> independent<00:04:07.790> we're

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
got to both balance independent we're

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.420 
got to both balance independent we're
going<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.120> reattach<00:04:08.360> our<00:04:08.720> linkage<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.860> we're

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
going to reattach our linkage and we're

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.580 
going to reattach our linkage and we're
going<00:04:10.550> to<00:04:10.640> adjust<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.090> linkage<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.480> where<00:04:11.840> it

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
going to adjust the linkage to where it

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.500 
going to adjust the linkage to where it
doesn't<00:04:12.800> push<00:04:13.100> your<00:04:13.280> pull<00:04:13.460> or<00:04:13.610> twist<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:14.330> just

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
doesn't push your pull or twist we just

we're<00:04:21.019> going<00:04:21.140> to<00:04:21.200> work<00:04:21.290> on<00:04:21.440> next<00:04:24.880> now<00:04:25.880> we've

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
we're going to work on next now we've

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.820 
we're going to work on next now we've
reattached<00:04:26.300> our<00:04:26.750> linkage<00:04:27.110> arms<00:04:27.410> back<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:27.710> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
reattached our linkage arms back to the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.220 
reattached our linkage arms back to the
linkage<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.480> like<00:04:29.480> I<00:04:29.600> said<00:04:29.750> earlier<00:04:30.050> we

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
linkage and like I said earlier we

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.050 
linkage and like I said earlier we
loosen<00:04:30.530> up<00:04:30.620> our<00:04:30.740> jam<00:04:30.950> nuts<00:04:31.190> on<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.430> rod<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:31.970> we

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
loosen up our jam nuts on the rod so we

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.120 
loosen up our jam nuts on the rod so we
can<00:04:32.210> adjust<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.570> broad<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.620> purpose<00:04:33.950> of

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
can adjust the broad the purpose of

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.250 
can adjust the broad the purpose of
adjusting<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.790> is<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.630> they<00:04:35.720> both<00:04:35.870> will<00:04:36.050> open

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
adjusting this is so they both will open

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.810 
adjusting this is so they both will open
at<00:04:36.380> exactly<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.830> same<00:04:36.980> time<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.490> want<00:04:37.670> to

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
at exactly the same time you want to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.900 
at exactly the same time you want to
this<00:04:38.150> one<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.540> match<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.990> one<00:04:39.170> as<00:04:39.530> as<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.670> turn

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
this one to match that one as as I turn

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.340 
this one to match that one as as I turn
it<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.150> can<00:04:41.180> feel<00:04:41.480> when<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.660> gets<00:04:41.810> tight<00:04:42.020> and
