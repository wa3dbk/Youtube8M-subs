00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:09.710
 Well I'm here I found 31.6 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.440
 today I bring you a tutorial and 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.689
 it would be like girls look at it 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:25.610
 of the counter strike and how to put so that 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:28.570
 be the command that can not be very 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.570
 all right 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.370
 what we have to do is by command 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.050
 I'll leave the description but 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.809
 can see the same if they want 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.540
 the tea for options and they come out 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.780
 back the translucent is the first thing that 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.780
 make 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.930
 and then they put this in the case that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.670
 sean steam is more is more useful this 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.670
 and they put a space after 0 not 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.920
 forget the space after 0 and there 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 is going to shrink a little bit but 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.320
 then you put l and a low crossfire 6 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.220
 and they put him small and that girl more 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 even in one more color 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.470
 as not for being a black that sells 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.370
 doing the only active control of a 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.860
 eye crossfire color and you put 0 00 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.040
 and d 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 that his life is a script 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.540
 and good memories 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:47.950
 good in the case that they are mastiff like 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.950
 I have this medium with steam terno 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.330
 the commands are more but it is very useful 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.340
 notice first, always be options and 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.780
 they put them they remove that the selection 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.690
 under lw 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.400
 one more I leave the description and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.680
 that's why I do not tell them I'm there and I look 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.310
 it looks smaller but it 's almost the same 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.310
 that January 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.260
 It fills the feast but they are more 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.260
 a 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.420
 more commands and if they fix their gaze and 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.500
 to have a better dynamic pickup 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.500
 fire 0 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.830
 do not forget the space at the end this is 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.140
 for the record is going to expand a 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.450
 little yes they put the dynamic cross 60 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.450
 but if you want to put the 1 but 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.090
 after they put the color comes doing 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.390
 the 0 0 0 if you want the black 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.030
 because no other colors you will 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.600
 they put with you are no longer 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.600
 and there 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.030
 a good memory of the mountains 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:22.260
 and a good look not as big as what 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.260
 common that would be 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 more or less like that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.400
 and now 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.859
 but who liked the video of the law if 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.599
 they liked and suspense millionaires and the 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.599
 first time one of my children
