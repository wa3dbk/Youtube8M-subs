00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.389
 manganese and need paper persons about 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.530
 something called securities flowers 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.180
 cook cheese conditions 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.250
 Let's start with the most important sauce I really 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.260
 liked McDonalds cranberry sauce 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.199
 I personally cook home too 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.630
 conditions for this I took a glass you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.300
 frozen half a glass of grape juice 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.840
 3 4 tablespoons of sugar I make in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.149
 pan throw there glasses onion 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.820
 blender mix filling up half the glass 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.010
 grape juice t400 2 tablespoons 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.190
 sugar and slow fire and boil down 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.879
 our resulting sauce 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.800
 20-30 minutes the channel will be so thick 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.020
 poured into a jar cool and it will 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 great sauce for our whole weights 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.110
 now we will start the hun himself to the faces and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.680
 arrange the preparation of our valuable 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.729
 like so look take cheese i 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.030
 the lobules are not necessarily what it will be 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.240
 scolded like mcdonalds 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.350
 breadcrumbs then face again 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.670
 again breadcrumbs and so about 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 black pepper 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.939
 walnuts can also be such other 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.090

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.800

 the crust then again a little bit again to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.960
 the crust could carry by the way not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.330

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.690

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.490
 breaded 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.030
 but 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.319
 the prince somehow and here I am 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.319
 the remaining cheese business minus the 3rd 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.720
 That's how I planned to snowboard link 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.870

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.410
 fortress barbarity we'll see and so 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.410
 throw and pan 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.550

 teenagers seeded in this business not 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.200

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.259
 Diment more than this I advise 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.630
 arguing to this is easier than childhood. 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.240
 chocolate or color from a blue field 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.220
