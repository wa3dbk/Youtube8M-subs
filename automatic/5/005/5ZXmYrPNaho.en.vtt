this do it so this is you you pour the
wheat<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.120> top<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.709> he<00:03:09.709> knows<00:03:09.889> it<00:03:10.040> up<00:03:10.160> okay

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.390 

okay<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:22.000> big<00:03:22.150> capacity<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:23.650> instead<00:03:23.890> of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.370 

really<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:28.240> we<00:03:28.390> have<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.600> little<00:03:29.020> it's<00:03:29.260> an

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
really so we have a little it's an

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.710 
really so we have a little it's an
electric<00:03:29.800> mill<00:03:30.040> but<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:31.060> probably<00:03:31.300> have<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.600> do

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
electric mill but I probably have to do

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.980 
electric mill but I probably have to do
multiple<00:03:32.650> passes<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.370> get<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.670> okay<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:34.870> this

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
multiple passes to get that okay so this

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.660 
multiple passes to get that okay so this
has<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.200> big<00:03:35.410> hopper<00:03:35.920> on<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.160> top<00:03:36.370> where<00:03:36.580> you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
has a big hopper on the top where you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
has a big hopper on the top where you
can<00:03:36.700> pour<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.120> lot<00:03:38.160> that's<00:03:39.160> great

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
