00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
received for a review and the reason

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
received for a review and the reason
that<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> say<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> healthy<00:00:56.699> is

that I say that this here is healthy is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.110 
that I say that this here is healthy is
it<00:00:56.910> super<00:00:57.780> thick<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.980> roots<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> way

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it super thick from roots all the way

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.689 
it super thick from roots all the way
down<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> ends<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> hair<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.739> super<00:01:02.190> thick

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
down to the ends the hair is super thick

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.780 
down to the ends the hair is super thick
it's<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.570> silky<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it's very silky so if you're going for a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
it's very silky so if you're going for a
more<00:01:06.000> natural<00:01:06.030> look<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:06.990> probably<00:01:07.229> not

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
more natural look you're probably not

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
more natural look you're probably not
gonna<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.340> texture<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
gonna like this texture because it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.440 
gonna like this texture because it
doesn't<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.619> any<00:01:10.650> coarseness<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.119> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
doesn't have any coarseness to it it is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770 
doesn't have any coarseness to it it is
very<00:01:12.930> silky<00:01:13.619> straight<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> strands

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
very silky straight but the strands

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.070 
very silky straight but the strands
itself<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.530> pretty<00:01:16.920> thick<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.390> more<00:01:18.840> on

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
itself are pretty thick so it's more on

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.859 
itself are pretty thick so it's more on
the<00:01:19.110> heavier<00:01:19.799> side<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.430> well<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.240> did<00:01:21.689> dye

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the heavier side as well so I did dye

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
the heavier side as well so I did dye
this<00:01:21.930> hair<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> nice<00:01:22.619> blue<00:01:23.070> black<00:01:23.369> color<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.090> it

this hair a nice blue black color and it
looks<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.860> blue<00:01:26.159> under<00:01:26.970> natural<00:01:27.479> lighting

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
looks very blue under natural lighting

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
looks very blue under natural lighting
like<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.680> outside<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.579> under<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.210> studio

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
like if I'm outside or under my studio

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.200 
like if I'm outside or under my studio
lights<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:32.400> Dirk<00:01:32.759> setting

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
lights but if it's a more Dirk setting

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.690 
lights but if it's a more Dirk setting
it<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.659> looks<00:01:33.869> black<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.700> exactly

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it just looks black which is exactly

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
it just looks black which is exactly
what<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:37.229> first<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> wanted

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
what I was going for at first I wanted

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
what I was going for at first I wanted
to<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.280> light<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.000> hair<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.570> because

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to go light with this hair just because

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.950 
to go light with this hair just because
it's<00:01:40.290> spring<00:01:40.619> time<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.689> here

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it's spring time but because this here

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's spring time but because this here
is<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.470> healthy<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.880> texture<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
is so healthy and the texture of this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
is so healthy and the texture of this
hair<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.140> thought<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.130> look<00:01:47.310> really

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
hair I thought that it would look really

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.999 
hair I thought that it would look really
great<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.299> its<00:01:48.509> dark<00:01:48.930> State<00:01:49.290> rather<00:01:49.680> than

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
great in its dark State rather than

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
great in its dark State rather than
lightening<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.729> hair<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.360> when<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> first

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
lightening my hair so when you first

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.380 
lightening my hair so when you first
receive<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.590> hair<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.790> come<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
receive the hair it is going to come and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.420 
scrunching it up on a regular basis just
because<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.140> texture<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.040> straight

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
because the texture of it is straight

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.850 
because the texture of it is straight
you<00:03:56.970> can<00:03:57.150> pretty<00:03:57.330> much<00:03:57.420> blow-dry<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.260> or<00:03:58.620> just

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
you can pretty much blow-dry it or just

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.920 
you can pretty much blow-dry it or just
run<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.130> straightener<00:03:59.640> through<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.420> it's

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
run a straightener through it and it's

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.470 
run a straightener through it and it's
good<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.410> go<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.860> did<00:04:02.340> dye<00:04:02.550> this<00:04:02.790> hair<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
good to go I did dye this hair so the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.590 
good to go I did dye this hair so the
lustre<00:04:03.900> maybe<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.350> bit<00:04:04.740> shinier<00:04:05.490> but<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.300> does

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
lustre maybe a bit shinier but it does

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.590 
lustre maybe a bit shinier but it does
have<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.170> nice<00:04:07.500> sheen<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.730> would<00:04:09.150> say<00:04:09.360> it's

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
have a nice sheen to it I would say it's

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.930 
have a nice sheen to it I would say it's
a<00:04:09.750> medium<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.470> high<00:04:10.500> luster<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:11.730> have

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
a medium to high luster I do not have

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.050 
a medium to high luster I do not have
any<00:04:12.270> product<00:04:12.959> in<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.200> hair<00:04:13.530> no<00:04:14.100> oils<00:04:14.610> at<00:04:14.850> all

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
any product in this hair no oils at all

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.630 
any product in this hair no oils at all
but<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.450> does<00:04:15.480> have<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.959> nice<00:04:16.230> sheen<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:17.250> again

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
but it does have a nice sheen so again

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.810 
but it does have a nice sheen so again
it<00:04:17.910> could<00:04:18.150> be<00:04:18.209> because<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.020> dyed<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.650> or<00:04:20.070> it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
it could be because I dyed it or it

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.099 
it could be because I dyed it or it
could<00:04:21.030> be<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.630> hair<00:04:21.840> has

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
could be that the hair has

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.529 
could be that the hair has
a<00:04:22.139> nice<00:04:22.500> natural<00:04:22.919> Sheen<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.000> when<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.210> first

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
a nice natural Sheen but when I first

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.510 
a nice natural Sheen but when I first
received<00:04:24.719> this<00:04:25.110> hair<00:04:25.379> it<00:04:25.560> did<00:04:25.770> have<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.009> natural

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
received this hair it did have a natural

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.149 
received this hair it did have a natural
Sheen<00:04:26.849> but<00:04:27.509> I<00:04:27.569> don't<00:04:27.840> think<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.229> was<00:04:28.379> as<00:04:28.620> shiny

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
Sheen but I don't think it was as shiny

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.520 
Sheen but I don't think it was as shiny
as<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.669> is<00:04:29.789> right<00:04:30.180> now<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.539> I<00:04:30.569> decided<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.229> go

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
as it is right now so I decided to go

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.700 
as it is right now so I decided to go
for<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.830> middle<00:04:32.129> part<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.789> did<00:04:33.509> leave<00:04:34.050> out<00:04:34.319> just

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
for a middle part I did leave out just

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.980 
for a middle part I did leave out just
that's<00:04:34.889> had<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> bit<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:35.849> my<00:04:36.120> hair<00:04:36.389> in<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:36.719> front

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
that's had a bit of my hair in the front

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.929 
that's had a bit of my hair in the front
just<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.740> make<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.009> look<00:04:38.129> a<00:04:38.400> little<00:04:38.550> bit<00:04:38.759> more

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:38.939 
just to make it look a little bit more

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.110 
just to make it look a little bit more
natural<00:04:39.150> but<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.289> blends<00:04:40.800> in<00:04:40.919> very<00:04:41.280> nice<00:04:41.789> with

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
natural but it blends in very nice with

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.589 
natural but it blends in very nice with
my<00:04:42.270> natural<00:04:42.750> hair<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.289> would<00:04:43.710> say<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.879> if<00:04:45.330> your

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
my natural hair I would say that if your

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.279 
my natural hair I would say that if your
natural<00:04:46.169> you<00:04:46.469> do<00:04:47.099> need<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.639> closure<00:04:48.090> with<00:04:48.930> this

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
natural you do need a closure with this

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.429 
natural you do need a closure with this
hair<00:04:49.620> because<00:04:50.099> it<00:04:50.219> is<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.639> silky<00:04:51.000> but<00:04:51.960> if<00:04:52.229> your

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
hair because it is so silky but if your

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.769 
hair because it is so silky but if your
hair<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.740> relaxed<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.669> could<00:04:54.060> probably<00:04:54.300> get

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:54.779 
hair is relaxed you could probably get

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.200 
hair is relaxed you could probably get
away<00:04:54.900> with<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.800> texture<00:04:56.250> without<00:04:56.819> a<00:04:56.849> closure

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
away with this texture without a closure

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.179 
away with this texture without a closure
