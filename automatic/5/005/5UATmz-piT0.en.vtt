00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.029
 johnny knicks winner sergio sanabria 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.160
 who could white monkey and now we are going to 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.400
 tell a little how was his scholarship that 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.080
 congratulations are from all thanks 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.250
 tell us how your business works 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.110
 you played good this first 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.860
 had to know what it was to be the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.800
 today and that was the heretic 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.939
 so I wanted the letters strong 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.939
 like the zombie 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.100
 to kill it 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.560
 is the 24 the evasion 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 and also always wanted the two to 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.720
 break your hand to make your beginnings 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.530
 unstable 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.880
 then let's try the world but 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.630
 so I like the white monkey a lot 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:18.340
 because that makes it very slow 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:19.860
 then it is something different with 31 the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:28.720
 changes 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:31.210
 3 dragons basically obviously this 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.470
 letter was the first letters that I 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.960
 calls attention for its gameplay 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.960
 after 3 or 5 and that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.230
 well the rest you do not know which one 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.020
 like wine but the world talks about the 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.310
 oars to get rid of them 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.310
 Benefits that are comfortable 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.220
 were the four parts also in the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.620
 work 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.060
 singing the jar are not right now 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.670
 hour of some cards to play 4 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.980
 because counting less 3 - 3 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.870
 how often do you comment very strongly that 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:15.940
 We ask for them because 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.500
 begins to reproduce or suddenly of 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.500
 aggressive start with the rat but 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.819
 well it 's basically 20 and the drink 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.650
 this as you will see what I do not have in mind 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:36.349
 because if we say the juice 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.230
 for example mount the heretic the bugs 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:45.650
 of everything from cost attack a Somali 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:53.769
 I put the two of them to vote for them 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.769
 deadly vices to kill the bus 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.920
 because cultural of those of chrome do 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.920
 in the face of anger we have a lot of human 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.760
 against December control or that 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.760
 have many mayors 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.330
 terrific just an early end to 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.100
 won the pp you're going to go the tour and the most 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.350
 important is that you just want it 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.360
 shortly after going to the wood prix 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.860
 buenos aires I already have the 100 the vice 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.090
 luckily you gain a thousand points and let's hope 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.530
 that have 23 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.020
 I think for the look in Buenos Aires 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.030
 that seems a good option better is 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.980
 I live only out there aside 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.810
 adaptations because the goal changes every 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.580
 week depending on what it is to get to 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.580
 13 days and then the changes 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.760
 great good some final words 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.390
 acknowledgments at the end of knowing what 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.390
 expectations 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.040
 my friends from the rs plan 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.430
 and now last, I was not 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.000
 suffocating in politics of life 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.000
 got together
