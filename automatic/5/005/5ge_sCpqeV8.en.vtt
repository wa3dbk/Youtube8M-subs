00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.999
 One in place in this 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.549
 What we are doing is unfolding the ball 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.370
 Open or help 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.450
 Human of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.370
 Is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.880
 If you have a ball with a side ball 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:29.779
 And let out a pair minute foot 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.779
 I tell you how to say This is parallel to why 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 If you align your feet parallel to the line of this ball and Markman 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.460
 What happened when you come to cut into or ball side comes to flash to the ball side 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.430
 But if you have your feet 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.850
 Even with the ball I will be late 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:01:00.230
 I will go to a little live I hit a bit and I was a little late 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 It can not be bumped or it will be very often the worst case. 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:11.560
 And in this case the right foot is right in this case, so long as you have the right foot firmly 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.560
 You can still bump against the flash as it is 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:20.180
 If we add these small things 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:24.100
 It becomes possible to prevent the ball side cut flush 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.100
 I will try again based on that point 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.570
 ball 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.320

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.900
 bus 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.710
 If this bus is done it is with layup 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.060
 Color help &amp; cover bullets to prevent this with etc 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.850
 In order to cover 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.420
 Moderator 2nd Day Kan 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.840
 Protect from near the goal as a priority 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.720
 Other defenders will rotate here again
