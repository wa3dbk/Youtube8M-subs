00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hey viewers today I'm continuing work on

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey viewers today I'm continuing work on
my<00:00:02.520> Trek<00:00:02.790> BMX<00:00:03.210> bike<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.750> when<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.680> bought<00:00:04.980> this

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
my Trek BMX bike and when I bought this

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.700 
my Trek BMX bike and when I bought this
it<00:00:05.580> did<00:00:05.910> not<00:00:06.089> have<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> chain<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.629> it<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.319> what

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
it did not have a chain on it so what

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.620 
it did not have a chain on it so what
I'm<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.950> do<00:00:08.069> today<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.760> install<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> chain

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
I'm going to do today is install a chain

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.730 
I'm going to do today is install a chain
on<00:00:09.660> there<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.260> I'm<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.469> show<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
on there and I'm going to show you the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.220 
on there and I'm going to show you the
whole<00:00:10.980> process<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.849> sizing<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.660> chain<00:00:12.929> figure

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
whole process of sizing the chain figure

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.900 
whole process of sizing the chain figure
out<00:00:13.349> what<00:00:13.530> size<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.920> chain<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> need<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.610> then

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
out what size of chain you need and then

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.689 
out what size of chain you need and then
also<00:00:15.210> cutting<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.750> life<00:00:16.220> now<00:00:17.220> before<00:00:17.430> you

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
also cutting it to life now before you

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.099 
also cutting it to life now before you
get<00:00:17.789> started<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.150> need<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.510> figure<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:18.900> what

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
get started you need to figure out what

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
get started you need to figure out what
size<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.590> chain<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.070> need<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> buy<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570

bike with a multi speed freewheel
you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.700> where<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> derailleur<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:43.050> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you know where the derailleur now this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.190 
you know where the derailleur now this
is<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> bit<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> chain<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:45.270> designed<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
is a bit of chain that is designed for a

is a bit of chain that is designed for a
multi<00:00:46.860> speed<00:00:47.100> bike<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.590> it<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.829> physically

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
multi speed bike and it just physically

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.840 
multi speed bike and it just physically
won't<00:00:50.730> fit<00:00:51.559> over<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> teeth<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> cogs

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
won't fit over the teeth of the cogs

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
won't fit over the teeth of the cogs
here<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.840> reason<00:00:55.170> being<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.039> gap

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
here the reason being is this gap

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
here the reason being is this gap
between<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.850> inner<00:00:57.149> plates<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.930> just

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
between the inner plates here is just

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279 
between the inner plates here is just
too<00:00:58.530> narrow<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.489> fit<00:00:59.520> over<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:00.600> tip<00:01:00.960> teeth

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
too narrow to fit over these tip teeth

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
too narrow to fit over these tip teeth
which<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:01.829> fatter<00:01:02.370> than<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.820> you'd<00:01:02.940> find<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
which are fatter than what you'd find on

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.260 
which are fatter than what you'd find on
the<00:01:03.420> freewheel<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.320> multi<00:01:04.619> speed<00:01:04.860> bike<00:01:05.270> now

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the freewheel of a multi speed bike now

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
the freewheel of a multi speed bike now
this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> 1/2<00:01:07.290> inch<00:01:07.500> by<00:01:07.740> 1/8<00:01:08.070> inch<00:01:08.310> chain

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this is the 1/2 inch by 1/8 inch chain

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.870 
this is the 1/2 inch by 1/8 inch chain
and<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.530> cleanly<00:01:11.250> over<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.640> teeth<00:01:11.850> like

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and if it's cleanly over the teeth like

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
and if it's cleanly over the teeth like
that<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.830> size<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.220> chain<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that and so this is the size of chain I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.050 
that and so this is the size of chain I
need<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> use<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.159> lucky<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.580> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
need to use now I was lucky and this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.030 
need to use now I was lucky and this
freewheel<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.869> marked<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:19.590> type<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
freewheel is marked with what type of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920 
freewheel is marked with what type of
chain<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> use<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.630> might<00:01:21.780> not

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
chain to use on it but that might not

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.660 
chain to use on it but that might not
always<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> case<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.280> let<00:01:23.400> me<00:01:23.460> show<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
always be the case so let me show you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
always be the case so let me show you
the<00:01:23.909> difference<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.360> thickness<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the difference of thickness of the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.539 
the difference of thickness of the
different<00:01:25.650> types<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.920> cogs<00:01:26.130> here

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
different types of cogs here

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.390 
different types of cogs here
so<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.240> cog<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.560> which<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> 1/2

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so this cog here which is for the 1/2

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
so this cog here which is for the 1/2
inch<00:01:29.670> by<00:01:29.820> 1/8<00:01:30.210> inch<00:01:30.509> chain<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.290> measure<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
inch by 1/8 inch chain if I measure the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.960 
inch by 1/8 inch chain if I measure the
thickness<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.520> teeth<00:01:32.960> they're<00:01:33.960> about

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
thickness of the teeth they're about

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.749 
thickness of the teeth they're about
three<00:01:35.970> millimeters<00:01:36.659> thick

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
three millimeters thick

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.609 
three millimeters thick
now<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.030> cog<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
now this cog here this is from a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.789 
now this cog here this is from a
cassette<00:01:41.100> designed<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> thinner<00:01:43.110> chain<00:01:43.530> if

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
cassette designed for a thinner chain if

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460 
cassette designed for a thinner chain if
I<00:01:44.189> measure<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> thickness<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:46.020> teeth

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
I measure the thickness of the teeth

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.920 
I measure the thickness of the teeth
here<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:48.079> about<00:01:49.430> two<00:01:50.430> millimeters<00:01:51.030> thick

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
here it's about two millimeters thick

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.530 
here it's about two millimeters thick
depending<00:01:52.140> where<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> measure<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
depending where I measure it here and so

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.920 
depending where I measure it here and so
this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.960> designed<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.070> 1/2<00:01:56.340> inch<00:01:56.549> by<00:01:56.930> 3/32

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this is designed for a 1/2 inch by 3/32

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.289 
this is designed for a 1/2 inch by 3/32
inch<00:01:58.110> chain<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.430> way<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.090> not

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
inch chain so that way if it's not

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.209 
inch chain so that way if it's not
marked<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.990> closer<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> 3<00:02:02.040> millimeters

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.100 
marked if it's closer to 3 millimeters
thick<00:02:02.820> then<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.420> probably<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> 1/2

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
thick then you probably want the 1/2

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
thick then you probably want the 1/2
inch<00:02:04.350> by<00:02:04.530> 1/8<00:02:04.890> inch<00:02:05.130> chain<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.240> about

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
inch by 1/8 inch chain and if it's about

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
inch by 1/8 inch chain and if it's about
2<00:02:06.600> millimeters<00:02:06.810> thick<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.799> probably

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
2 millimeters thick then you probably

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660 
2 millimeters thick then you probably
want<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.209> 1/2<00:02:09.989> inch<00:02:10.259> by<00:02:10.640> 3/32<00:02:11.640> inch<00:02:11.819> chain

really an outside and inside some chains

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.800 
really an outside and inside some chains
have<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.250> side<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.090> meant<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.480> be<00:02:41.569> facing

on<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.600> but<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.680> chain<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.130> go<00:02:46.220> either

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
on it but this this chain can go either

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.440 
on it but this this chain can go either
way

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
way

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.330

and<00:02:47.720> what<00:02:48.200> I'm<00:02:48.290> going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.440> be<00:02:48.680> using<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.310> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
and what I'm going to be using is a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.850 
and what I'm going to be using is a
simple<00:02:49.970> little<00:02:50.090> tool<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.750> made<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.650> just

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
simple little tool that I made it's just

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.759 
simple little tool that I made it's just
a<00:02:51.950> piece<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.430> wire<00:02:52.940> coat<00:02:53.330> hanger<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.320> bent

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
a piece of wire coat hanger that I bent

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.940 
a piece of wire coat hanger that I bent
at<00:02:54.980> two<00:02:55.880> inches<00:02:56.180> apart<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.959> what<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.769> is

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
at two inches apart and what this is

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.850 
at two inches apart and what this is
used<00:02:58.190> for<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.760> kind<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.450> test<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.319> testing<00:03:00.739> the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
used for is kind of test the testing the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.229 
used for is kind of test the testing the
length<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.430> chain<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.730> kind<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:01.940> join<00:03:02.120> it

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
length of the chain to kind of join it

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.640 
length of the chain to kind of join it
together<00:03:02.330> what<00:03:03.140> I'm<00:03:03.200> going<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.350> do<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.530> I'm

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
together what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.740 
together what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.800> stick<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.100> through<00:03:04.360> one<00:03:05.360> side

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
going to stick it through one side

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.920 
going to stick it through one side
through<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.459> gap<00:03:07.640> between<00:03:07.970> two<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.810> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
through in the gap between two of the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.610 
through in the gap between two of the
outer<00:03:09.080> plates<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.010> then<00:03:11.140> push<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.230> wheel<00:03:12.380> in

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
outer plates and then push the wheel in

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.530 
outer plates and then push the wheel in
and<00:03:12.920> I'm<00:03:13.370> going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.519> stick<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.819> through<00:03:13.850> I

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
and I'm going to stick it through I

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.610 
and I'm going to stick it through I
can't<00:03:15.500> quite<00:03:15.709> reach<00:03:16.480> there<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.290> I'm<00:03:18.530> gonna

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
can't quite reach there so I'm gonna

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.289 
can't quite reach there so I'm gonna
stick<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:18.950> through<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:19.760> see<00:03:20.060> how<00:03:20.239> that

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
stick it through here and see how that

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.210 
stick it through here and see how that
is<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.110> have<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.560> on<00:03:21.620> through<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> outer

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
is so I have it on through the outer

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.880 
is so I have it on through the outer
plates<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.820> side<00:03:23.030> as<00:03:23.299> well<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.049> now<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.739> do

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
plates on this side as well so now I do

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.520 
plates on this side as well so now I do
is<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.489> pull<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.810> wheel<00:03:27.079> back<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:30.019> doesn't

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
is I pull the wheel back and it doesn't

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.120 
is I pull the wheel back and it doesn't
come<00:03:31.280> out<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.519> dropouts<00:03:31.880> in<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> back<00:03:32.299> and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
come out of the dropouts in the back and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.039 
come out of the dropouts in the back and
if<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.250> push<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.610> forward<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.360> want<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.870> make<00:03:36.019> sure

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
if I push it forward I want to make sure

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.680 
if I push it forward I want to make sure
that<00:03:36.410> there's<00:03:36.620> enough<00:03:37.120> chain<00:03:38.120> there<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.600> go

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
that there's enough chain there to go

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.930 
that there's enough chain there to go
ahead<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.170> be<00:03:39.290> able<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.709> pull<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.250> off<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.820> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
ahead and be able to pull it off of the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.530 
ahead and be able to pull it off of the
chain<00:03:41.180> ring<00:03:41.359> in<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.570> front<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:42.799> there<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.790> so

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
chain ring in the front so there is so

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.039 
chain ring in the front so there is so
this<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.650> about<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.950> right<00:03:46.130> length<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.810> here's

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
this is about the right length so here's

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.349 
this is about the right length so here's
a<00:03:48.109> close-up<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.769> my<00:03:48.890> little<00:03:49.280> jointer<00:03:49.579> tool<00:03:49.820> so

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
a close-up of my little jointer tool so

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.090 
a close-up of my little jointer tool so
if<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.510> kind<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.690> push<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.019> chain<00:03:51.260> up<00:03:51.380> there<00:03:51.620> you

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
if I kind of push the chain up there you

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.920 
if I kind of push the chain up there you
can<00:03:52.220> kind<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.459> see<00:03:52.700> how<00:03:53.000> this<00:03:53.359> outer<00:03:53.600> plate

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
can kind of see how this outer plate

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.360 
can kind of see how this outer plate
section<00:03:54.200> here<00:03:54.560> would<00:03:54.709> join<00:03:54.950> right<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.280> that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
section here would join right to that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.890 
section here would join right to that
inner<00:03:55.579> plate<00:03:55.850> section<00:03:56.120> right<00:03:56.480> there

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
inner plate section right there

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.979 
inner plate section right there
so<00:03:57.739> this<00:03:58.489> chain<00:03:58.850> comes<00:03:59.090> with<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.299> master<00:03:59.780> link

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
so this chain comes with a master link

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.819 
so this chain comes with a master link
that<00:04:00.560> replaces<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.910> outer<00:04:02.690> plate<00:04:03.200> section

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
that replaces this outer plate section

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.970 
that replaces this outer plate section
so<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.549> want<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:04.970> break<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.600> chain<00:04:05.900> right<00:04:06.410> here

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
so I want to break the chain right here

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.190 
so I want to break the chain right here
so<00:04:07.489> I'm<00:04:07.549> going<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.730> mark<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.180> right<00:04:08.480> here<00:04:09.019> so

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
so I'm going to mark this right here so

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.479 
so I'm going to mark this right here so
I<00:04:09.230> know<00:04:10.450> where<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.750> break<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.470> chain<00:04:12.769> at<00:04:13.040> and

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
I know where to break the chain at and

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.610 
I know where to break the chain at and
you<00:04:13.820> want<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.030> be<00:04:14.690> real<00:04:14.870> careful<00:04:15.109> because<00:04:15.440> you

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
you want to be real careful because you

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.099 
you want to be real careful because you
want<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.829> break<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.100> chain<00:04:16.720> at<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.930> right

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
want to break the chain at the right

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.319 
want to break the chain at the right
place<00:04:18.380> because<00:04:19.130> if<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.549> break<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.910> chain<00:04:19.940> in

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
place because if you break the chain in

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.060 
place because if you break the chain in
the<00:04:20.359> wrong<00:04:20.570> place<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.620> thing<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:21.890> too

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
the wrong place and the thing is too

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.120 
the wrong place and the thing is too
short

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
short

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.500 
short
then<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.910> can't<00:04:24.120> really<00:04:24.270> make<00:04:24.390> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
then it's you can't really make the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.160 
then it's you can't really make the
chain<00:04:24.720> longer<00:04:25.170> so<00:04:26.180> mark<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.330> chain<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.900> so

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
chain longer so mark the chain and so

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.770 
chain longer so mark the chain and so
that's<00:04:28.350> right<00:04:28.530> where<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.770> want<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:28.980> break<00:04:29.220> that

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
that's right where I want to break that

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.510 
that's right where I want to break that
so<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.810> have<00:04:30.960> my<00:04:31.050> chain<00:04:31.320> break<00:04:31.500> tool<00:04:31.740> here<00:04:32.430> and

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
so I have my chain break tool here and

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.280 
so I have my chain break tool here and
I'm<00:04:33.030> going<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.240> line<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.540> like<00:04:33.660> right<00:04:34.050> up<00:04:34.170> with

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
I'm going to line it like right up with

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.170 
I'm going to line it like right up with
that<00:04:34.470> mark<00:04:34.770> there<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.850> that's<00:04:35.970> right

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
that mark there and so that's right

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.510 
that mark there and so that's right
where<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.360> want<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.540> break<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:38.340> kind<00:04:38.490> of

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
where I want to break it so just kind of

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.270 
where I want to break it so just kind of
you<00:04:38.700> know<00:04:38.730> push<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.270> pin<00:04:39.540> out<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:43.280> like

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
you know push that pin out there like

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.540 
you know push that pin out there like
that

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
that

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.470 
that
and<00:04:44.760> then<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.180> can<00:04:45.330> remove<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:47.720> breaker<00:04:48.720> tool

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
and then I can remove the breaker tool

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.320 
and then I can remove the breaker tool
like<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:52.160> okay<00:04:53.160> now<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.370> install<00:04:53.730> this<00:04:54.120> type

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
like that okay now to install this type

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.450 
like that okay now to install this type
of<00:04:54.360> master<00:04:54.900> link<00:04:55.500> here<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:56.130> came<00:04:56.250> with<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
of master link here that came with the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.880 
of master link here that came with the
chain<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.170> got<00:04:58.320> this<00:04:58.440> little<00:04:58.590> part<00:04:58.830> here

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
chain so it's got this little part here

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.970 
chain so it's got this little part here
I'm<00:04:59.610> going<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.790> stick<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.000> through<00:05:00.450> both<00:05:01.290> ends

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
I'm going to stick it through both ends

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.340 
I'm going to stick it through both ends
of<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.700> chain<00:05:02.840> just<00:05:03.840> like<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.640> there's<00:05:05.640> a

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
of the chain just like this there's a

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.010 
of the chain just like this there's a
plate<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:08.220> fits<00:05:08.280> over<00:05:09.710> here<00:05:10.710> like<00:05:10.920> this<00:05:11.370> and

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
plate that fits over here like this and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.000 
plate that fits over here like this and
then<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.170> master<00:05:13.470> link<00:05:13.590> came<00:05:13.770> with<00:05:13.920> this

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
then the master link came with this

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.250 
then the master link came with this
little<00:05:14.280> clip<00:05:14.490> here<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:15.390> open<00:05:15.720> on<00:05:15.840> one<00:05:16.050> end

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
little clip here so it's open on one end

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.080 
little clip here so it's open on one end
and<00:05:16.410> closing<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.800> other<00:05:16.980> so<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.700> want<00:05:18.030> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
and closing the other so that I want the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.540 
and closing the other so that I want the
closed-in<00:05:18.750> pointing<00:05:19.740> in<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.040> direction<00:05:20.070> that

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
closed-in pointing in the direction that

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.820 
closed-in pointing in the direction that
the<00:05:20.820> chain<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.330> going<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.840> move<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.590> as<00:05:22.710> I

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
the chain is going to move so as I

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.100 
the chain is going to move so as I
paddling<00:05:23.340> around<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:24.630> chain<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:24.930> going<00:05:25.020> to

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
paddling around the chain is going to

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.580 
paddling around the chain is going to
move<00:05:25.200> this<00:05:25.410> way<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:26.160> I<00:05:26.190> want<00:05:26.820> this<00:05:27.540> pointed<00:05:28.410> in

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
move this way so I want this pointed in

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.980 
move this way so I want this pointed in
that<00:05:29.250> direction<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:30.120> I'm<00:05:30.360> going<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.630> slide

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
that direction so I'm going to slide

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.520 
that direction so I'm going to slide
this<00:05:31.020> on<00:05:31.410> here<00:05:31.950> like<00:05:31.980> this<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:33.080> then<00:05:34.080> using<00:05:34.440> a

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
this on here like this and then using a

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.710 
this on here like this and then using a
pair<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:34.800> pliers<00:05:35.130> just<00:05:36.060> get<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.330> all<00:05:36.480> like

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
pair of pliers just get this all like

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.030 
pair of pliers just get this all like
lined<00:05:37.020> up<00:05:37.200> with<00:05:37.410> the<00:05:37.500> two<00:05:37.710> little<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:40.680> slots

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040
