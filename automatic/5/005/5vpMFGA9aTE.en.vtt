region and I cranked it all the way up
because<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:19.230> me<00:00:20.449> whoa<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.900> too<00:00:22.109> high<00:00:22.260> just

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.620 

curious<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> reduce<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.510> by

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
curious so I'm going to reduce it by

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.250 
curious so I'm going to reduce it by
about<00:00:27.840> half<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.710> if<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.010> helps<00:00:30.260> I'm

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
about half and see if that helps I'm

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.119 
about half and see if that helps I'm
still<00:00:31.560> feeling<00:00:32.960> kind<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> lot<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.440> current

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.709 

and<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> radiates<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.149> scalp<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and when it radiates up my scalp like

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.750 
and when it radiates up my scalp like
that<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> wonder<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.649> true<00:00:40.920> microcurrent

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that I wonder if it's true microcurrent

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
that I wonder if it's true microcurrent
because<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.090> never<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.629> sensation<00:00:43.050> with

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
because I never get that sensation with

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.510 
because I never get that sensation with
my<00:00:43.829> Jade<00:00:44.160> microcurrent<00:00:45.110> but<00:00:46.110> let's<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
my Jade microcurrent but let's see and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.299 
my Jade microcurrent but let's see and
then<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.600> me<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> proof<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
then for me the proof is you know it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.900 
then for me the proof is you know it
happens<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> next<00:00:51.000> day<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.660> how<00:00:52.020> um

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
happens the next day it's like how um

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.830 
happens the next day it's like how um
how<00:00:54.500> does<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:55.680> skin<00:00:56.010> look<00:00:56.070> although<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.719> know

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
how does my skin look although you know

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.270 
how does my skin look although you know
I<00:00:57.899> woke<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.289> morning<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.710> washed<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.129> my

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I woke up this morning I washed off my

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
I woke up this morning I washed off my
Nerium<00:00:59.730> ad<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:01.910> my<00:01:02.910> skin's<00:01:03.210> looking<00:01:03.359> better<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
Nerium ad and my skin's looking better I

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.140 
Nerium ad and my skin's looking better I
think<00:01:03.930> than<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:05.010> my<00:01:05.549> entire<00:01:05.820> adult

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
think than it has in my entire adult

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
think than it has in my entire adult
life<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:08.510> what<00:01:09.510> happens<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.049> microcurrent

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
life but what happens with microcurrent

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.570 
life but what happens with microcurrent
is<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.850> too<00:01:12.860> high<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.520> actually

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
is if it is too high it actually

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.370 
is if it is too high it actually
depletes<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.780> skin<00:01:16.430> anything<00:01:17.430> over<00:01:17.640> 500

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
depletes the skin anything over 500

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.609 
depletes the skin anything over 500
microamps<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> skin<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
microamps is going to put the skin in to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.830 
microamps is going to put the skin in to
fight<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.220> modes<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.210> basically<00:01:24.540> trying

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
fight off modes so it's basically trying

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200 
fight off modes so it's basically trying
to<00:01:25.049> it'll<00:01:25.979> accept<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> current<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to it'll accept the current and the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
to it'll accept the current and the
muscle<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.689> lift<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> won't<00:01:29.189> be

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
muscle will lift but it won't be

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
muscle will lift but it won't be
producing<00:01:29.850> anymore<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.689> collagen

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
producing anymore like collagen

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.030 
producing anymore like collagen
production<00:01:32.570> starts<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> plummet<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:34.680> sorry

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
production starts to plummet I'm sorry

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.380 
production starts to plummet I'm sorry
