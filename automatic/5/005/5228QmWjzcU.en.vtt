00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.250

 Today I want to make a video about my 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.720
 favorite hamburger year 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.020
 social gas I dedicate this video 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.240
 because it is a delicious hamburger 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.730
 it is called 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.890
 I do nâ€™t really know birds burger but here 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.670
 many varieties of them called he 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.840
 in-n-out burger i don't have yekaterinburg 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.600
 I saw him but maybe Moscow has it 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.379
 same hamburger system as 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.190
 could maxi 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.129
 but it's much tastier I only them him 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.949
 now just show around built here 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.960
 always a lot of people need on the street 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.190
 Of course you can eat from the side here 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.150
 book now will leave 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.159
 car, everything is the same as 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.159
 mcdonalds made even a system 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.410
 ordered arrived bought you can inside 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.010
 to eat 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.290
 everything is completely normal weather at all 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.630
 super 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.620
 so here is this parking lot now 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.740
 I'll go put 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.650
 I want to say my bike here 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.720
 In America , each store has each 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.070
 the cafe is only where you can 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.430
 comprehend your bike 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.830
 sometimes you will even drive up and seemingly not 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.250
 can not find anything but if you go around 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.460
 buildings then it will all be calm 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.360
 we can put the bike to hook it 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.370
 and calmly go to eat here show 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.580
 that's how much 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:46.560
 here it is now and here I am the limits 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.560
 and let's go inside 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.550
 just show how about 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.020
 radically 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.020
 waiting for the number we need to rub 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:11.480
 so continuing the video about my favorite 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.860
 hamburgers this cheeseburger is called 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.930
 fried potatoes on want to say that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.060
 here the potatoes are certainly not comparatively 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.510
 the city of ski is given to us by all much 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 tastier but I went to the couch with a set of things 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.230
 worth it 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.990
 I changed my mind a little shorter 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:39.160
 autofocus for costs 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.160
 so that's easier for him and in the opinion and sing and 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.670
 or monad myself without taking lemonade and 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.830
 wet 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.569
 that's what i want to say burger sites 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.549
 entering not likely 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.530
 and then somehow not fried overall shorter 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.599
 saying i just do it so that 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.760
 it will be in america this may be Moscow 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.959
 be it is here remember in-n-out 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.099
 burger is just delicious and it's 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.139
 Much tastier than I can Knox that's all 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.950
 what i wanted to tell about my friend ivan 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:21.609
 long -armed cheeseburger 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.609
 years middle class 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.799
 specially went straight to make about 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.799
 this report 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.340
 Jonathan used to buy this for me 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:39.920
 reporting a half bicycle 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:46.750
 he brought it all the time to all 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:56.980
 I will eat so I ate it all 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:04:04.209
 my cheeseburger what I want to say is that 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:08.030
 This proved Dina simply incredible 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.010
 Naturally there is something crammed not 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.170
 quite healthy and not at all helpful and 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.650
 because all the food that she is very 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.490
 delicious she with some additives 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.970
 for sure, but the food is not tasty 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.970
 always 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.660
 useful so i ate bullshit 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.380
 some kind of supernatural and 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.300
 put a great make 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.710
 here they were wilderness already passing 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.740
 yesterday 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.810
 what 200 to us is interesting 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.030
 there are so many flowers of it not already of course 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.530
 Such were successively neck slightly but all 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.440
 equally beautiful and that's probably yesterday 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.340
 already put new make 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.940
 beautiful 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 eyes 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.700
 okay bye everyone 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.480
 I went to the library if every day 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.330
 of course there is such a cheeseburger 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.620
 nothing good from the figure will be possible 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:27.970
 afford once in two months 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:30.980
 what I do maybe even less 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.400
 well, good bye everyone 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.460

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.650

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.650

 the road that we go to him is simple 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.470
 intersection here two over 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:08.110
 for shops 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:12.520
 here's some food and take someone to the cafe 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.540
 then all sorts of module of the foot and everything in it 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.980
 and everything like that is shorter 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.950

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.400

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.170
 America with the gods 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:33.870
