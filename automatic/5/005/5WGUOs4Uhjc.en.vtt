00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi all the boys are z uil x16 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 I'm here with a new video of girona in 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.809
 I shine two clicks to level 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.340
 quickly before starting there 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 I remember leaving me like because of me 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.700
 you really need a lot 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.830
 only two seconds to click that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.199
 button of which I do n't know color e 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 let's start right away. First you have to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.100
 go around the fort zanchu base 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.689
 do you can not find the location 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.849
 start video then once done that 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.560
 you have to find any vehicle whatsoever 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.570
 be able to skip this ramp that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 you have just seen in the video and then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.890
 once you've done that, you have to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.770
 take this ramp you just have 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.899
 seen in the video to enter the base 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.180
 of fort zanchu do once entered a 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 shield strength with any vehicle 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 even a civilian vehicle you have to do 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 the road you see in the video 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.730
 so once that's done you have to be 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 stop and you have to practically stop one 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 time you see that your level 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.300
 from the tried is disappearing therefore 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.120
 wait for that wanted level 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.910
 disappears and once disappeared 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.100
 back from where you just entered e 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 therefore as soon as there will be re-appearances 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.799
 four stars come back again 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.080
 back until just the game does not 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.479
 will tell you that the stars you have 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.479
 earned from being sought 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.040
 disappearing, repeat this operation 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.210
 up to how many times you think you will make a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.280
 lot of rp always doing this species 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.810
 forward back if you happen to be that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 however the stars are not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.650
 disappearing just wait a few 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.320
 second or at most just go 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.420
 a few meters ahead of where 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.490
 you stopped and you will notice that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280
 Wanted stars will disappear anyway 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.390
 the second method instead I believe it is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.310
 even the most effective one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.079
 it is an activity that you can 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.210
 find in description both for the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.540
 version of the playstation 3 for both 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.610
 xbox 60 and to start this activity 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.860
 simply press online then 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.820
 activity then hosts activities then 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.530
 favorite 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.780
 and then just go on capture and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.899
 you will find this activity yes 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.820
 will call it the fastest herbie method started 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.160
 this activity then once done 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.590
 what a must that you invite even one 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.310
 person and you will have to set up the activity 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.770
 so that is 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.739
 on condition for the end the limit of 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.959
 time and then lock up more owned 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.340
 collect them so you can too 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.890
 use your weapons then the rest 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.349
 you can leave it as is invited 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.010
 how many people do you want anyway? 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.370
 you are two 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.280
 the same goes very well indeed you do more rp 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.810
 staying in two who are not the most people e 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.830
 so once done that close the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.959
 waiting room 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.910
 wait for your friend person 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.069
 that you invited entry and then one 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.040
 once done, start the activity 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.140
 when you have started the business for 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.630
 first thing I advise you to shoot at 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.090
 these containers of gas that is precisely 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.580
 they will explode and you will do a lot of rp e 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.790
 you will notice that the sack of gods will arrive 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.160
 enemies with the white tank top with a 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.840
 knife that they will try to attack you for 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.549
 every enemy you kill will earn you 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 25 rp and ness pauner really have 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.480
 lots of really many so shoot 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.180
 to these enemies until they do 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.670
 stop earning the rp 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.489
 you will put that once practically 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.780
 written 25 rp will not appear again when 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.370

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.019
 of 25 rb 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.660

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.940
