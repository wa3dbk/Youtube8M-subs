00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.709 

I'm<00:00:06.029> gonna<00:00:06.210> make<00:00:06.420> some<00:00:06.980> featured<00:00:07.980> caviar

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
I'm gonna make some featured caviar

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.749 
I'm gonna make some featured caviar
using<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.809> verification<00:00:10.290> technique<00:00:11.070> I've

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
using this verification technique I've

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.470 
using this verification technique I've
got<00:00:12.559> one<00:00:13.559> percent<00:00:14.009> sodium<00:00:14.759> alginate

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
got one percent sodium alginate

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.710 
got one percent sodium alginate
which<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:15.870> dispersing<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:17.359> so<00:00:18.359> sugar

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
which I'm just dispersing in so sugar

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.019 
which I'm just dispersing in so sugar
just<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.590> prevents<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.340> sodium<00:00:20.850> alginate

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
just just prevents the sodium alginate

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
just just prevents the sodium alginate
from<00:00:21.869> clumping<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.810> thing<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:26.039> added

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
from clumping and one thing when added

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.460 
from clumping and one thing when added
to<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> liquid<00:00:28.189> using<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.429> nice<00:00:29.810> thin<00:00:30.810> liquid

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to the liquid using a nice thin liquid

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.290 
to the liquid using a nice thin liquid
something<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> fans<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.059> viscosity

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
something with the fans or the viscosity

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.950 
something with the fans or the viscosity
of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> truth<00:00:34.410> juice<00:00:34.649> or<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> vegetable<00:00:35.430> juice

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
of the truth juice or a vegetable juice

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
of the truth juice or a vegetable juice
there's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> property<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.559> water<00:00:37.770> we're<00:00:38.399> not

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
there's a property of water we're not

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
there's a property of water we're not
going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> use<00:00:38.879> something<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
going to use something like a like a

going to use something like a like a
fruit<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.950> vegetable<00:00:41.129> puree<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:42.750> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
fruit or vegetable puree because it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.459 
fruit or vegetable puree because it's
too<00:00:43.860> thick<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.660> will<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.780> difficult<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
too thick and then will be difficult to

draw into the caviar box or neat syringe
we'll<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.629> let<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.870> stand<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:53.129> or

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
we'll just let that stand for two or

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.220 
we'll just let that stand for two or
three<00:00:53.399> minutes<00:00:54.230> storing<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> regularly<00:00:57.199> okay

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
three minutes storing it regularly okay

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.209 
three minutes storing it regularly okay

five<00:01:02.489> minutes<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.719> mixture<00:01:04.080> will<00:01:04.260> have

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
five minutes the mixture will have
