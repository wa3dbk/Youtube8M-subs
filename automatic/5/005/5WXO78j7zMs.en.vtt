00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.140
Somewhere in 2008, EVO magazine grabbed an BMW M3 (E36) with 286cv

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.540
and set itself to beat an 8min laptime around the Nordschleife.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.740
With the car in its original condition, laptimes weren't any better than 8:22...

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.940
and only after extensive mods on chassis reinforcements, suspensions, brakes, and track suited tires

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.200
got close to their goal with.... 8:02!

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.360
In 2014, Renault grabbed an RS265

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.180
gave it 10 more ponnies, a titanium Akrapovic exhaust,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.100
Ohlins supensions, specific Michelin tires

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.460
and did it...in less than 8 mins!

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.960
And if you think that this sport version... 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.740
of the sport version of the Renault Mégane is the 'créme de la créme',

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.420
be advised that there's also a 275 Trophy R,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.760
which weights 100kg less, has no back seats

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.660
and it recently set the world record for FWD production vehicles in nurburgring with .... 7:54:36!!

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.120
If the 'normal' yellow Mégane RS we reviewd a couple of months ago

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.780
already holds a considerable 'everyone please look at me' factor,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.240
this Trophy is like going down to the casino wearing a tuxedo... and slippers!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.320
Yes, eeeeeeveryone will stare!

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.380
But i can assure you, not even that nor the 44.150€ (in Portugal) price tag,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.440
while diminish its interest to potential buyers!

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.100
That same 'panache' is also present in its interior... 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.940
red safety belts,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.780
alcantara details everywhere

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.220
and a pair of fabulous Recaro seats....

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.280
with the name written in red... just to make sure it doesn't go unnoticed...

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.320
You certainly recall that i really enjoyed the RS265...

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380
and here, there's not why to enjoy it less... 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.840
specially because with the 'sport' mode activated,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.480
 we get to enjoy a very special sound from the titanium Akrapovic

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.640
The Ohlins suspension upgrade emphasizes the sensation of control

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.200
not only at high speeds, but also under load, 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.220
although i have to admit that if i looked at the 265 as a car that one could use on a daily basis,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.600
here... well, maybe it's better to stay away of rougher tarmac.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.640
Braking system is the exact same one from its predecessor

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.120
and for me, i still criticize the way the pedals are put together

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.060
that somehow complicate the execution of the 'heal&amp;toe'

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.900
Steering is very precise

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.500
and needless to say that this alcantara lining transports us directly to a competition environment!

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.560
Everything is like an invitation to achieve rapid paces

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.480
and i have to be honest, this Trophy wasn't designed for cruising... 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.100
Clutch has a certain 'weight',

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.660
gearbox has a 'manly' feel

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.760
and throttle response is very sharp..

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.240
but everything comes alive in a perfect way

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.260
when the time comes to attack 'that' special bit of raod!

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.500
That said...

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.360
Renault...

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.300
could we please make a Trophy..

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.860
but without the whole sticker thing..

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.740
and in a colour less...

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.060
..less...

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.040
...Less!?

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.360
This car is fabulous...

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.640
...very good!
