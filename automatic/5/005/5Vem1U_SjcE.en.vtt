00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
I learned two things one is how

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.920 
I learned two things one is how
satisfying<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:17.150> community<00:02:17.780> work

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
because it really was various and the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.220 
because it really was various and the
second<00:02:21.349> is<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.709> can't<00:02:22.010> stop<00:02:22.489> at<00:02:22.849> just<00:02:23.599> doing

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
second is you can't stop at just doing

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.500
