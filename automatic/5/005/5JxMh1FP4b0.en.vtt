00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040

trampling<00:02:49.040> over<00:02:49.130> some<00:02:49.489> country's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
trampling over some country's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.190 
trampling over some country's
sovereignty<00:02:50.390> but<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:52.040> think<00:02:52.970> we<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.239> all<00:02:53.570> do<00:02:54.170> a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
sovereignty but I think we can all do a

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.960 
sovereignty but I think we can all do a
little<00:02:54.410> bit<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:55.340> save<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> world

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
little bit of that to save the world

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.600 
little bit of that to save the world
that's<00:02:56.390> that's<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.350> idea<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.040> most<00:02:58.400> people

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
that's that's the idea so most people

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.920 
that's that's the idea so most people
not<00:02:59.090> going<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.269> have<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.420> problem<00:02:59.750> with<00:02:59.840> the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
not going to have a problem with the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.530 
not going to have a problem with the
game<00:03:00.080> if<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.190> don't<00:03:01.220> really<00:03:01.519> like<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.510> idea

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
game if you don't really like the idea

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.600 
game if you don't really like the idea
of<00:03:03.489> just<00:03:04.900> posing<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.260> will<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.830> different

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
of just posing the will on different

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.110 
of just posing the will on different
countries<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.030> accepting<00:03:09.019> kieres<00:03:09.910> then<00:03:10.910> that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
countries and accepting kieres then that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.120 
countries and accepting kieres then that
might<00:03:11.239> be<00:03:11.390> an<00:03:11.450> issue<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.260> think<00:03:12.500> most

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
might be an issue but I think most

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.380 
might be an issue but I think most
people<00:03:13.489> aren't<00:03:13.820> going<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.060> have<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.239> problem

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
game in that there's different roles

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.100 
game in that there's different roles
each<00:04:18.310> person<00:04:19.270> can<00:04:19.300> play<00:04:19.600> there's<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
each person can play there's the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.590 
each person can play there's the
dispatcher<00:04:20.680> there's<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.459> medic<00:04:21.850> the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
dispatcher there's the medic the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.540 
dispatcher there's the medic the
operations<00:04:23.140> expert<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.830> they're<00:04:24.250> all<00:04:24.340> pretty

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
operations expert and they're all pretty

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.710 
operations expert and they're all pretty
well<00:04:24.790> balanced<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:27.610> operations<00:04:28.270> experts

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
well balanced the operations experts

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.470 
well balanced the operations experts
takes<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.650> lot<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.800> heat<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:30.790> no<00:04:31.090> one<00:04:31.270> kind<00:04:31.420> of

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
takes a lot of heat and no one kind of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.590 
takes a lot of heat and no one kind of
wants<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.750> be<00:04:31.870> in<00:04:31.960> because<00:04:32.080> it's<00:04:32.350> kind<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.680> weak

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
wants to be in because it's kind of weak

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.360 
wants to be in because it's kind of weak
he<00:04:34.600> can<00:04:34.750> just<00:04:34.900> build<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:35.350> research<00:04:35.710> center<00:04:36.100> for

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
he can just build a research center for

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.060 
he can just build a research center for
free<00:04:36.610> but<00:04:37.600> maybe<00:04:37.990> if<00:04:38.170> you<00:04:38.260> want<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.500> play<00:04:38.740> a

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
free but maybe if you want to play a

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.070 
free but maybe if you want to play a
little<00:04:39.550> more<00:04:39.820> challenging<00:04:40.330> game<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.960> might

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
little more challenging game you might

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.070 
little more challenging game you might
want<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.350> use<00:04:41.470> him<00:04:41.530> because<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:43.600> can<00:04:43.720> make<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
want to use him because you can make the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.810 
want to use him because you can make the
game<00:04:44.290> more<00:04:44.320> difficult<00:04:45.070> by<00:04:45.280> adding<00:04:45.640> more

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
game more difficult by adding more

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.360 
game more difficult by adding more
epidemics<00:04:46.600> into<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> deck<00:04:47.290> which<00:04:47.920> increased

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
epidemics into the deck which increased

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.730 
epidemics into the deck which increased
the city's<00:04:48.940> disease<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.840> increase<00:04:50.260> how

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
the city's disease and increase how

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.250 
the city's disease and increase how
often<00:04:51.010> disease<00:04:51.550> spreads<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:54.750> but<00:04:55.750> there's

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
often disease spreads so but there's

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.290 
often disease spreads so but there's
three<00:04:56.650> different<00:04:56.850> difficulties<00:04:57.850> can<00:04:58.030> play<00:04:58.180> on

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
three different difficulties can play on

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.300 
three different difficulties can play on
you<00:04:58.390> can<00:04:58.540> play<00:04:58.660> with<00:04:58.750> four<00:04:59.110> epidemics<00:04:59.830> five

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
you can play with four epidemics five

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.330 
you can play with four epidemics five
epidemics<00:05:00.970> or<00:05:01.090> six<00:05:01.360> epidemics<00:05:01.900> let's<00:05:02.590> say<00:05:02.860> you

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
epidemics or six epidemics let's say you

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.520 
epidemics or six epidemics let's say you
know<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:03.700> can't<00:05:04.120> win<00:05:04.330> on<00:05:04.480> sixth<00:05:05.050> what<00:05:05.410> you're

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
know you can't win on sixth what you're

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.040 
know you can't win on sixth what you're
finding<00:05:05.740> it's<00:05:06.190> really<00:05:06.400> easy<00:05:06.580> on<00:05:06.820> five<00:05:07.150> well

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
finding it's really easy on five well

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.530 
finding it's really easy on five well
then<00:05:08.170> you<00:05:08.350> know<00:05:08.470> maybe<00:05:08.770> use<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.910> operation<00:05:10.390> to

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
then you know maybe use the operation to

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.230 
then you know maybe use the operation to
expert<00:05:10.840> all<00:05:11.020> this<00:05:11.200> indicating<00:05:11.980> to<00:05:12.130> just<00:05:12.580> make

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
expert all this indicating to just make

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.660 
expert all this indicating to just make
it<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.390> little<00:05:13.510> bit<00:05:13.660> harder<00:05:13.990> or<00:05:14.490> usually<00:05:15.490> it's

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
it a little bit harder or usually it's

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.460 
it a little bit harder or usually it's
just<00:05:15.910> we<00:05:16.300> just<00:05:16.480> met<00:05:16.690> me<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.960> sign<00:05:17.230> it<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.900> each

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
just we just met me a sign it so each

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.420 
just we just met me a sign it so each
turn<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.970> get<00:05:22.300> four<00:05:22.630> actions<00:05:23.140> to<00:05:23.920> try<00:05:24.190> and

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
turn you get four actions to try and

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.380 
turn you get four actions to try and
move<00:05:25.120> around<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:26.160> prevent<00:05:27.160> these<00:05:27.730> cubes<00:05:28.240> from

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
move around and prevent these cubes from

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.540 
move around and prevent these cubes from
overloading<00:05:28.810> when<00:05:29.170> a<00:05:29.200> fourth<00:05:29.590> disease<00:05:30.190> cube

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
overloading when a fourth disease cube

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.400 
overloading when a fourth disease cube
hits<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.090> city<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.450> outbreaks<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.200> all

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
hits the city of outbreaks and all

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.110 
hits the city of outbreaks and all
surrounding<00:05:32.650> areas<00:05:33.250> if<00:05:33.430> you<00:05:33.790> have<00:05:33.880> eight

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
surrounding areas if you have eight

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.080 
surrounding areas if you have eight
outbreaks<00:05:34.600> you<00:05:34.780> can<00:05:34.960> lose<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.320> game<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.970> can

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
outbreaks you can lose the game you can

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.730 
outbreaks you can lose the game you can
also<00:05:37.240> lose<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.660> game<00:05:37.960> by<00:05:38.260> running<00:05:38.500> out<00:05:38.710> of

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
also lose the game by running out of

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.890 
also lose the game by running out of
action<00:05:39.130> cards<00:05:39.460> if<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.730> entire<00:05:40.000> pile<00:05:40.390> is<00:05:40.630> drawn

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
action cards if the entire pile is drawn

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.620 
action cards if the entire pile is drawn
or<00:05:41.290> if<00:05:42.040> you<00:05:42.190> round<00:05:42.340> up<00:05:42.520> all<00:05:42.670> the<00:05:42.700> cubes<00:05:43.150> for<00:05:43.480> one

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
or if you round up all the cubes for one

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.420 
or if you round up all the cubes for one
color<00:05:43.930> so<00:05:44.260> there's<00:05:44.410> three<00:05:44.620> ways<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.860> lose<00:05:45.250> the

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
color so there's three ways to lose the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.860 
color so there's three ways to lose the
game<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.850> only<00:05:46.330> one<00:05:46.570> way<00:05:46.720> a<00:05:46.750> win<00:05:47.250> so<00:05:48.810> it's<00:05:49.810> a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
game and only one way a win so it's a

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.980 
game and only one way a win so it's a
little<00:05:50.020> tough<00:05:50.320> that<00:05:50.890> way<00:05:51.510> but<00:05:52.510> I<00:05:52.570> just<00:05:52.870> I

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
little tough that way but I just I

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.260 
little tough that way but I just I
really<00:05:53.230> like<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.770> dynamics<00:05:54.640> because<00:05:54.790> you're

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
really like the dynamics because you're

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.740 
really like the dynamics because you're
