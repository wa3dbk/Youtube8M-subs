developer themselves about the firmware
2.80<00:05:22.290> it<00:05:22.830> seems<00:05:23.790> we<00:05:24.090> finally<00:05:24.420> found<00:05:24.600> out<00:05:24.780> what

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
2.80 it seems we finally found out what

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.770 
2.80 it seems we finally found out what
it's<00:05:25.260> about<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:25.980> actually<00:05:26.700> gives<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.180> ps3

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
it's about it actually gives the ps3

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.430 
it's about it actually gives the ps3
more<00:05:28.470> RAM<00:05:29.040> believe<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.210> now<00:05:31.200> it's<00:05:31.320> not

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
more RAM believe in that now it's not

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.680 
more RAM believe in that now it's not
that<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.710> gives<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.010> more<00:05:32.250> RAM<00:05:32.640> let<00:05:33.450> you<00:05:33.600> know

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
that it gives it more RAM let you know

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.260 
that it gives it more RAM let you know
if<00:05:33.870> I<00:05:34.020> elaborate<00:05:34.560> on<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.710> it<00:05:35.010> actually<00:05:35.580> allows

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
if I elaborate on it it actually allows

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.380 
if I elaborate on it it actually allows
the<00:05:36.840> ps3<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.380> use<00:05:37.770> more<00:05:38.130> of<00:05:38.340> its<00:05:38.520> ramp<00:05:38.760> you<00:05:39.210> see

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
the ps3 to use more of its ramp you see

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.130 
the ps3 to use more of its ramp you see
the<00:05:39.540> the<00:05:39.780> 2.80<00:05:40.410> update<00:05:41.600> lowered<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.750> memory

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
the the 2.80 update lowered the memory

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.530 
the the 2.80 update lowered the memory
footprint<00:05:43.650> for<00:05:43.980> the<00:05:44.070> operating<00:05:44.430> system<00:05:44.880> so

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
footprint for the operating system so

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.960 
footprint for the operating system so
it's<00:05:45.750> able<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.200> use<00:05:46.440> which<00:05:46.890> that<00:05:47.490> memory

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
it's able to use which that memory

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.460 
it's able to use which that memory
footprint<00:05:48.330> being<00:05:48.570> lowered<00:05:48.870> allows<00:05:49.260> the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
footprint being lowered allows the

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.470 
footprint being lowered allows the
operating<00:05:49.800> system<00:05:50.040> run<00:05:50.220> faster<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.760> on<00:05:51.240> top

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
operating system run faster and on top

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.050 
operating system run faster and on top
of<00:05:51.510> that<00:05:51.660> it<00:05:52.230> allows<00:05:52.860> more<00:05:53.160> RAM<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.730> be<00:05:53.850> used

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
of that it allows more RAM to be used

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.200 
of that it allows more RAM to be used
for<00:05:54.360> video<00:05:54.840> games<00:05:54.870> and<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.920> first<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.790> video

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
for video games and the first the video

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.140 
for video games and the first the video
game<00:05:57.360> it's<00:05:57.480> really<00:05:57.750> going<00:05:57.900> to<00:05:57.960> utilize<00:05:58.260> that

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
game it's really going to utilize that

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.940 
game it's really going to utilize that
extra<00:06:00.150> ram<00:06:00.390> is<00:06:00.690> going<00:06:01.170> to<00:06:01.230> be<00:06:01.290> uncharted<00:06:01.800> 2

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
extra ram is going to be uncharted 2

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.920 
extra ram is going to be uncharted 2
they<00:06:02.670> said<00:06:02.940> that's<00:06:03.090> why<00:06:03.300> they<00:06:03.480> were<00:06:03.540> able<00:06:03.750> to

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
they said that's why they were able to

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.500 
they said that's why they were able to
get<00:06:04.230> so<00:06:04.710> much<00:06:04.890> more<00:06:05.400> textures<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:06.240> so<00:06:06.360> much

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
get so much more textures and so much

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.260 
get so much more textures and so much
more<00:06:06.540> particle<00:06:07.350> effects<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:07.800> so<00:06:07.890> much<00:06:08.040> more

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
more particle effects and so much more

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.600 
more particle effects and so much more
you<00:06:09.270> know<00:06:09.360> uh<00:06:09.890> stuff<00:06:10.890> happening<00:06:11.400> on<00:06:11.490> the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
you know uh stuff happening on the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.830 
you know uh stuff happening on the
screen<00:06:11.700> at<00:06:11.940> once<00:06:12.120> they<00:06:12.360> said<00:06:12.570> they<00:06:12.660> were<00:06:12.720> able

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
screen at once they said they were able

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.750 
screen at once they said they were able
to<00:06:12.990> do<00:06:13.170> so<00:06:13.320> much<00:06:13.440> more<00:06:13.500> with<00:06:13.740> uncharted<00:06:14.100> 2<00:06:14.520> than

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
to do so much more with uncharted 2 than

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.550 
to do so much more with uncharted 2 than
the<00:06:14.850> first<00:06:15.060> one<00:06:15.270> because<00:06:15.750> of<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.080> extra<00:06:16.380> RAM

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
the first one because of the extra RAM

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.400 
the first one because of the extra RAM
and<00:06:16.790> we<00:06:17.790> all<00:06:17.940> know<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.150> they<00:06:18.510> you<00:06:18.750> know<00:06:19.050> can

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
and we all know that they you know can

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.660 
and we all know that they you know can
lower<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:19.950> memory<00:06:20.190> footprint<00:06:20.520> of<00:06:20.640> the

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
lower the memory footprint of the

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.070 
lower the memory footprint of the
operating<00:06:20.970> system<00:06:21.270> over<00:06:21.480> time<00:06:21.510> like<00:06:21.720> they

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
operating system over time like they

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.560 
operating system over time like they
just<00:06:22.290> did<00:06:22.440> recently<00:06:22.740> so<00:06:23.730> games<00:06:24.060> just<00:06:24.360> going<00:06:24.510> to

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
just did recently so games just going to

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.180 
just did recently so games just going to
keep<00:06:24.660> getting<00:06:24.930> better<00:06:25.110> with<00:06:25.500> more<00:06:25.710> available

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
keep getting better with more available

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.550 
keep getting better with more available
RAM<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.670> there's<00:06:27.540> going<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.810> be<00:06:27.840> less<00:06:28.110> you

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
RAM and there's going to be less you

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.010 
RAM and there's going to be less you
know<00:06:28.680> bitching<00:06:29.670> from<00:06:29.850> developers<00:06:30.240> about<00:06:30.420> not

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
know bitching from developers about not

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.570 
know bitching from developers about not
enough<00:06:31.230> RAM<00:06:31.440> on<00:06:31.470> a<00:06:31.620> ps3<00:06:31.920> or<00:06:32.070> some<00:06:32.280> bullshit

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
enough RAM on a ps3 or some bullshit

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.740 
enough RAM on a ps3 or some bullshit
like<00:06:32.760> that<00:06:32.990> so<00:06:34.280> update<00:06:35.280> to<00:06:35.460> 2.0<00:06:36.210> if<00:06:36.360> you<00:06:36.540> have

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
like that so update to 2.0 if you have

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.140 
like that so update to 2.0 if you have
not<00:06:37.220> that's<00:06:38.220> some<00:06:38.340> pretty<00:06:38.460> sweet<00:06:38.670> news<00:06:38.910> we

not that's some pretty sweet news we
actually<00:06:39.390> got<00:06:39.480> more<00:06:39.630> ram<00:06:39.810> and<00:06:40.280> 4<00:06:41.280> that's

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
actually got more ram and 4 that's

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.490 
actually got more ram and 4 that's
pretty<00:06:42.360> much<00:06:42.450> been<00:06:42.660> going<00:06:42.900> on<00:06:42.960> this<00:06:43.080> week<00:06:43.260> and
