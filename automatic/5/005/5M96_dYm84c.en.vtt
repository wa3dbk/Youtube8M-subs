00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.249
 the goal is to continue playing 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.209
 also occasionally 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.209

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.150
 they wrote artistic pacts 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.160

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 any of those sailing in the thousands of homes 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.180
 so you do not know what you're talking about, right? 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 well, well 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.939

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.550
 miserable 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.580
 an ambulance like that said morals 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.480

 yes but for how long the organs searched all over the island 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:15.920
 while I was here 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 and that would have to do is cheat society none of them have until the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.760
 August 15 has also been noticed as best as possible 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.589
 p durango where they go 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.799

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.310
 they will also be in their time and in the second in second place to hide us 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.049
 we have to face the orders of the new a6 and it will be better than nothing else 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.969
 like sweet micky 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.969
 visit 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.499
 take of these walls 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.219
 one 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.449
 Díaz Pérez also have their activities and 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.569
 the data are from monsoon of christ order 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.339
 he worked twelve 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.779
 since then 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.559
 yes the bright 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.439
 nothing is resolved 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.519
 complies completely with caution 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:19.909
 once arrived at 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.009
 to happen 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.540
 We search the whole island for the text of Vido and here there is no one else 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.240
 That means that if Colombia does not exist 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.410
 and with his men captured after seven days of the national holiday 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.079
 one year 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.289
 less 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.869
 that is what allows you to discover 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.279
 those are courageous capital words but you mean them 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.629
 that is to say if you want my name of the xinhua poet 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.239
 what matters is this 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.309
 to save his men behind they were so 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.419
 of accepting this challenge 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.669
 I do not understand why you're doing this the Civil Traffic Guard 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.959
 just fighting against him and he will be able to save two men to accept this 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.009
 challenge 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.339
 Look at the interests of the US because it is doing that but if what you want is 

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:25.339
 a fight then that's what's going to come 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.120

 two boots of seven capital leagues 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 With them you can fight long distances 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.340
 twenty-one 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.909

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.409
 It will be very impressive amount 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:53.029
 in a few words in the vicinity for anzoátegui 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.059
 and when my back comes back up 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.900

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.849

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.689
 be withdrawn 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.009
 then tested 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.129
 for that reason of the civic pact the sea 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.129
 although transportation is the sector 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.889
 already in the twenty-first century he said 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.889
 but that there was one last offer 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.220
 tamayo leave the country 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.650
 forever 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.650
 this is my last quick turn what you say 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:07.270
 my men I wanted to give them a hope of rescuing 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.529

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.580
 falcon like that has been 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:36.180
 I offer you apologies for this little fight 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.960
