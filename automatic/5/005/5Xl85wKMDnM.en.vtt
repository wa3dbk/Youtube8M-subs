overhead press do you lean back what we
might<00:00:26.340> say<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:27.000> due<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.570> having<00:00:27.869> an

might say that it's due to having an

might say that it's due to having an

muscle<00:00:30.539> groups<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.260> weak<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.859> being

from bad patterning that develops over

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.950 
from bad patterning that develops over
time<00:00:37.290> here's<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> mean<00:00:38.870> movements<00:00:39.870> are

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
time here's what I mean movements are

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.290 
time here's what I mean movements are
skill<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> they're<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.399> skill<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> needs<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
skill and they're a skill that needs to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
skill and they're a skill that needs to
be<00:00:42.329> developed<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:43.379> you're<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:43.950> properly

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
be developed if you're not properly

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.549 
be developed if you're not properly
coordinating<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.629> body<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> regular

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
coordinating your body on a regular

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
coordinating your body on a regular
basis<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.579> those<00:00:47.789> movements<00:00:48.090> properly

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
basis to do those movements properly

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.680 
basis to do those movements properly
what<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.559> inevitably<00:00:49.860> happen<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
what will inevitably happen is if as the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.299 
what will inevitably happen is if as the
weight<00:00:51.840> gets<00:00:52.050> heavy<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.770> form<00:00:52.980> will<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
weight gets heavy your form will go to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.900 
weight gets heavy your form will go to
 and<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.960> becomes<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> problem<00:00:55.910> because

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
 and this becomes a problem because

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
 and this becomes a problem because
if<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.780> correct<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.890> get

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
if you don't correct this don't get

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.729 
if you don't correct this don't get
worse<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.789> worse<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.030> time<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> why<00:01:01.530> we

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
worse and worse the time this is why we

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.789 
worse and worse the time this is why we
see<00:01:02.070> guys<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.510> achieve<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.170> 500-pound

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
see guys that will achieve the 500-pound

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
see guys that will achieve the 500-pound
yellow<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.729> fantastic

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
yellow up that's fantastic

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.230 
yellow up that's fantastic
what<00:01:06.990> their<00:01:07.140> form<00:01:07.409> looks<00:01:07.650> like

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
what their form looks like

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
what their form looks like
because<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:09.420> 350<00:01:10.229> pounds<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.950> we're<00:01:11.100> not

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because from 350 pounds then we're not

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.179 
because from 350 pounds then we're not
fixing<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:12.030> problems<00:01:12.260> right<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.890> back

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
fixing these problems right that back

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
fixing these problems right that back
rounding<00:01:14.760> we're<00:01:14.909> looking<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.270> scared<00:01:15.540> cat

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
rounding we're looking at scared cat

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
rounding we're looking at scared cat
that<00:01:15.900> hip<00:01:16.110> hinge<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.549> carry

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that hip hinge going on so they carry

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.510 
that hip hinge going on so they carry
these<00:01:18.060> bad<00:01:18.479> patterning<00:01:19.290> problems<00:01:19.770> forward

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
these bad patterning problems forward

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.330 
these bad patterning problems forward
with<00:01:20.970> them<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.200> said<00:01:22.259> before<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:23.220> we

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
with them and like I said before what we

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
with them and like I said before what we
could<00:01:23.520> talk<00:01:23.700> about<00:01:23.909> dynamic<00:01:24.420> mobility<00:01:24.900> I'm

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
could talk about dynamic mobility I'm

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.050 
could talk about dynamic mobility I'm
all<00:01:25.320> about<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.740> learning<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> fire

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
all about that learning how to fire

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
all about that learning how to fire
certain<00:01:27.450> muscle<00:01:27.659> groups<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:28.020> getting<00:01:28.350> tight

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
certain muscle groups not getting tight

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.580 
certain muscle groups not getting tight
I'm<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> big<00:01:29.880> fan<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:31.110> need<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> talk

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
I'm a big fan of that we need to talk

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
I'm a big fan of that we need to talk
about<00:01:31.710> patterning<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.610> here's<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> mean

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
about patterning and here's what I mean

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.620 
about patterning and here's what I mean
when<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> gold<00:01:34.650> gets<00:01:35.009> tough<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.670> when<00:01:36.479> your

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
when the gold gets tough as when your

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.289 
when the gold gets tough as when your
form<00:01:36.840> needs<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.409> even<00:01:37.950> better<00:01:38.299> here's

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
form needs to get even better here's

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
form needs to get even better here's
what<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> mean<00:01:39.930> common<00:01:40.740> problem<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> squad

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
what I mean common problem on the squad

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.490 
what I mean common problem on the squad
right<00:01:42.060> Judy's<00:01:42.420> tend<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> cave<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.320> holes

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
right Judy's tend to cave and your holes

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200 
right Judy's tend to cave and your holes
in<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.740> hips<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> talk

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
in your hips what do we want to talk
