00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.950
 mount a switch 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:24.020
 get the inter 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:25.880
 and a screwdriver and a pair of scissors 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.950
 better if as an electrician with the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.430
 recess on the given blade to strip the wires 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.820
 electrical 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.290
 first put the switch together 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.910
 in the special basket together with the caps 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.559
 then turn off the power 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.170
 by the main switch for 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.399
 connect it to the system by placing it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.399
 in the wall box 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.150
 peel the cables with the scissors 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.280
 of the plant that come out of the wall that 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.180
 connect the wires to the respective terminals 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 of the switch if the switch is 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.190
 unipolar both ends 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.930
 will belong to the brown phase wire 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.790
 or the neutral blue one otherwise 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.770
 the ends of will be present 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.440
 both wires to be connected on four 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.869
 terminals placed two by two at the end 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.850
 of the switch also if 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.369
 switch and to connect a socket 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.619
 placed in the same managing way 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.790
 to decide the activation the passage 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.410
 of current 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.869
 the phase wire and the neutral wire 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.210
 will be placed respectively 1 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.670
 in the switch and the other in the socket 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.090
 with a jumper to connect the two 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.190
 contacts remained empty once tightened 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.920
 the terminal screws fasten the basket 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.050
 in the wall box also serving you 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.970
 in this case the screwdriver 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.830
 at this point re-enter the current 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.110
 and try the operation of the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.130
 switches and if everything works 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.570
 correctly 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.070
 conclude the work by applying the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.070
 plaque outside the break
