00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.860
 we are doing more 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.990
 to one of the masters franchises 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.640
 let's try to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.769
 take out this blow 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.130
 Most hit with a tool 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.130
 special 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.460
 I was looking good 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.770
 let's try to take out 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.350
 Well, we have a special tool 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.239
 here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.239
 in which we are trying to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.650
 much too lethal care can be 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.600
 form the pressure of this 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.660
 machine the very strong one has to put it 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.660
 more or less soft we release the pressure 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.330
 we speak with the tool pulled out the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.400
 half of its 70 percent of the 80 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.710
 we lower the line a little inwards 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.360
 that was outstanding undertaking or the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.070
 saved as they call the country of 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.990
 you now we take out 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.060
 that was sunk we are here to take out 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.590
 a complete line with this that what 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.830
 let's repair now that you can 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.830
 look 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.310
 very carefully 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.410
 when we are trying 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.160
 to take out the metal and try to take out 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.690
 These lines 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.240
 you have to find that the tool does not 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.040
 mark absolutely nothing wrong then 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.830
 we are losing all the work by 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.350
 that reason we use this so that 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.910
 nothing will happen to you two tapes so that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.420
 can one year feed in the part 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.819
 inside 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.750
 that makes it much easier with the 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.750
 depressions and tomorrow 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.410
 as we can see here is already 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.900
 the car completely finished already 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.599
 they got the main blow that was 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.769
 in this area here and a part that 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.769
 outgoing I had on this side 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.690
 ah
