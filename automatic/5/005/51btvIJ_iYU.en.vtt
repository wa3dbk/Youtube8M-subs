here we are on the Missouri today we're
going<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.559> go<00:00:10.650> over<00:00:10.680> some<00:00:10.920> high<00:00:11.070> water<00:00:11.280> things

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
going to go over some high water things

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.940 
going to go over some high water things
how<00:00:11.790> we<00:00:11.850> like<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> rig<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.629> well<00:00:13.139> as<00:00:13.410> kind<00:00:13.920> of

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
how we like to rig as well as kind of

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.650 
how we like to rig as well as kind of
the<00:00:14.040> water<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.400> like<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> fish<00:00:14.910> let's<00:00:15.510> see

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
the water we like to fish let's see

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.689 
the water we like to fish let's see
we're<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:15.930> 10,000<00:00:16.530> CFS<00:00:16.980> we're<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.610> go

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
we're about 10,000 CFS we're going to go

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.000 
we're about 10,000 CFS we're going to go
to<00:00:17.789> much<00:00:18.090> much<00:00:18.330> more<00:00:18.570> possibly<00:00:19.170> 15,000<00:00:19.890> here

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
to much much more possibly 15,000 here

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.130 
to much much more possibly 15,000 here
in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> near<00:00:20.310> future<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.600> warm<00:00:21.750> weather

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
in the near future as it's warm weather

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.780 
in the near future as it's warm weather
melt<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:22.830> snow<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> highlands

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
melt some of the snow in the highlands

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.780 
melt some of the snow in the highlands
so<00:00:24.780> we<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> 10<00:00:26.070> foot<00:00:26.250> 2x

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
so we have here is a 10 foot 2x

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.080 
so we have here is a 10 foot 2x
indicator<00:00:27.450> leader<00:00:27.780> by<00:00:28.020> Rio<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:29.640> conduct<00:00:29.970> with

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
indicator leader by Rio and conduct with

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.420 
indicator leader by Rio and conduct with
the<00:00:30.150> indicator<00:00:30.539> line<00:00:30.780> tapers<00:00:31.650> very<00:00:31.950> rapidly

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the indicator line tapers very rapidly

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.860 
the indicator line tapers very rapidly
for<00:00:32.700> two<00:00:32.850> feet<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.539> then<00:00:33.690> goes<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
for two feet here and then goes to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.590 
for two feet here and then goes to
straight<00:00:34.289> to<00:00:34.530> X<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.219> sinks<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:35.700> very<00:00:36.149> rapidly

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
straight to X it sinks very very rapidly

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.790 
straight to X it sinks very very rapidly
and<00:00:36.870> that's<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.680> we're

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and that's what we want to do and we're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.990 
and that's what we want to do and we're
nipping<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.550> fly<00:00:38.820> there

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
nipping because to get the fly there

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880 
nipping because to get the fly there
very<00:00:39.390> quickly<00:00:39.720> we're<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.650> to<00:00:40.710> loop

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
very quickly we're just going to loop

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.870 
very quickly we're just going to loop
this<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:42.470> it's<00:00:43.470> great<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> 2<00:00:44.190> X<00:00:44.460> 4<00:00:44.610> 8

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
this on it's great about the 2 X 4 8

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.569 
this on it's great about the 2 X 4 8
feet<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.540> leader<00:00:45.989> length<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.460> we

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
feet of the leader length is that if we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.870 
feet of the leader length is that if we
ever<00:00:47.670> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.970> alter<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> lead<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> length

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
ever want to alter the lead the length

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.819 
ever want to alter the lead the length
meters<00:00:50.880> time<00:00:51.060> or<00:00:51.300> two<00:00:51.480> x<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.230> eliminates<00:00:52.710> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
meters time or two x so eliminates you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.010 
meters time or two x so eliminates you
know<00:00:52.950> going<00:00:53.940> down<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.600> 3x

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
know going down and going just this 3x

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
know going down and going just this 3x
or<00:00:55.320> 4x<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:55.950> I<00:00:56.010> need<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> be<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.970> go

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
or 4x what do I need to be just go

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
or 4x what do I need to be just go
straight<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.600> X<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.320> since<00:00:58.559> we're<00:00:58.649> using<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
straight to X and since we're using so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.799 
straight to X and since we're using so
much<00:00:59.130> weight<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.730> like<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> thingamabob

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
much weight I like to use a thingamabob

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.290 
much weight I like to use a thingamabob
er<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> 1<00:01:01.829> inch<00:01:02.180> again<00:01:03.180> I'm

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
er and this is the 1 inch again I'm

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.490 
er and this is the 1 inch again I'm
going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> measure<00:01:03.690> my<00:01:03.840> distance<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.379> my

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
going to measure my distance from my

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
going to measure my distance from my
split<00:01:04.829> shot<00:01:05.009> to<00:01:05.100> my<00:01:05.189> indicator<00:01:05.579> now<00:01:05.759> like<00:01:05.969> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
split shot to my indicator now like I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.800 
split shot to my indicator now like I
said<00:01:06.119> I'd<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.509> go<00:01:06.630> about<00:01:06.719> 9<00:01:07.049> feet<00:01:07.409> today

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
said I'd like to go about 9 feet today

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
said I'd like to go about 9 feet today
so<00:01:09.810> there's<00:01:09.990> six<00:01:10.259> who's<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:11.009> on<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.340> here

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so there's six who's not on right here

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.100 
so there's six who's not on right here
at<00:01:11.639> the<00:01:11.789> fly<00:01:12.749> line<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.619> loop<00:01:13.829> over<00:01:15.109> twist<00:01:16.109> it

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
at the fly line one loop over twist it

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.290 
at the fly line one loop over twist it
and<00:01:18.200> then<00:01:18.800> bring<00:01:19.010> it<00:01:19.160> back<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:19.940> I've<00:01:20.060> looped

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
and then bring it back so I've looped

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.960 
and then bring it back so I've looped
over<00:01:20.480> twisted<00:01:21.110> another<00:01:21.590> loop<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.760> will

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
over twisted another loop and that will

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.440 
over twisted another loop and that will
lock<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:23.360> thing<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:25.000> right<00:01:26.000> there<00:01:26.150> were<00:01:26.240> nine

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
lock that thing in right there were nine

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.560 
lock that thing in right there were nine
