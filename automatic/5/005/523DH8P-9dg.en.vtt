00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
youtube so one of the main reasons to me

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.159 
youtube so one of the main reasons to me
is<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.430> he<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.180> beast<00:03:29.569> call<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.959> duty

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
is that he is a beast call of duty

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.930
