00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.779
 each perry bed dressed in a thin layer of liquid 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.169
 the scoured by white blood cells 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.269
 the favorites 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.929
 who swallowed scholastically move away the particles that are 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.929
 arrive here 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.640
 these together that trap the impurities of the air are removed 

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:25.919
 from the airways through eyelash movements and are thus eliminated 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.689
 from the respiratory system 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.840
 the oxygen present in the air entering the alveoli diffuses into the liquid 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 which covers a surface of these 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.100
 passes through the thin wall of the alveoli 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.290
 and then through the equally thin and flowing capillaries 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.290
 on the alveolar surface 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.610
 this movement of oxygen is called fusion 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.560
 and it works like this 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.600
 when the pressure of a gas on one side of a higher cell membrane than 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.420
 nobody else 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.890
 picasso and will pass through the membrane until the pressure will be 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.890
 same on both sides 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.759
 but if it passes, it is continually removed 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.929
 the pressure will never be balanced continuous courier enigas 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.200
 and this is what happens in the lungs 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.840
 oxygen passing through the alveoli to the capillaries and continuously 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 carried away by blood 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.710
 the oxygen present in the blood is almost entirely linked to hemoglobin 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.230
 Red blood cells 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.350
 Hemoglobin is a complex, iron-containing molecule 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 which turns red when it binds oxygen 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.740
 for this 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.040
 the blood is red 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.790
 the blood flows in a network of dense capillaries carrying his 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.000
 oxygen supply 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.310
 capillaries flow into thin invenients 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.700
 which come together to form the larger ones that carry oxygenated blood 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 to the heart 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.279
 now the heart pumps oxygen-rich blood into the arteries 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.180
 that carry it throughout the body reaching such dimensions 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.289
 small that sometimes in the capillaries 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.289
 only one red blood cell can pass at a time 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.659
 now a pressure difference will promote oxygen again but 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.999
 this time out of the blood 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.139
 text passes through the thin capillary wall in the liquid surrounding the 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:37.709
 cell 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.709
 and then the same cebu 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.829
 and so the first big work of the respiratory system is over 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.979
 the oxygen from the harrehhhhhhhhh air has reached the cells 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.639
 then su participates in the chemical reactions that produce energy starting 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.989
 from nutrients 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.650
 one of the waste products 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.659
 it is carbon dioxide 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.970
 the second great effort to remove it from the organism 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.019
 first, carbon dioxide exits the cells and through the sermon of 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.019
 give passes into the blood 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.119
 a good percentage of this sinisi gas is chemically hemoglobin e 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.599
 found in red blood cells 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.629
 but more than half the accused part of the blood is carried by the plasma 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.669
 the blood recall carbon dioxide to the heart and then through the below ai 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.739
 lungs 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.089
 blood flows into the capillaries around the alveoli that form the lungs 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:54.769
 now carbon dioxide leaves the lungs through the walls the capillaries 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.769
 alveolar cry 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.930
 enter the area contained in the alveoli 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.209
 and then pushed by them 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.369
 in the 250 thousand bronchioles 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.209
 it retraces its path in the opposite direction 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.209
 towards the bronchi and the trachea 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.480
 we milk inspires and the second phase of respiratory work is completed 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.939
 the amount of carbon dioxide present in the blood controls the depth and the 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.389
 frequency of breaths 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.180
 because some nerve cells located deeply in the brain 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.990
 they are sensitive to the blood concentration of carbon dioxide 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.970
 when this increases 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.840
 and impulses are sent to the intercostal muscles 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.770
 why annie plot 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.349
 the frequency and depth of the breaths increase increasing the 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.509
 speed at which carbon dioxide is eliminated from the body 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.120
 the blood levels of this gas and also control the heart rate 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.590
 and even the speed with which blood flows through the circulatory system 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.930
 when the increased activity of the heart and lungs is successful 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.430
 sufficiently lower the level of carbon dioxide 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.750
 immediately decrease the nerve impulses 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.750
 and so also the heart and lungs slow down the pace 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.819
 just before leaving the trachea the air is touching the vocal cords 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.130
 2 fibrous folds of the larynx that are hung in its passage 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.349
 they can be put into vibration 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.479
 and can produce sounds 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.400
 the hanging muscles release the strings can change the height of the 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.219
 sound produced 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.969
 his man can change even more by moving his tongue to his lips and the 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:42.630
 jaw 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.630
 and to you by giving her mouth in different ways 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.180
 the carbon dioxide we put in the terry air used by the plants 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.080
 the continuous cycle 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.479
 we breathe we talk hey we sing 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.479
 the work of the respiratory system 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.830
 no no no no no no 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.430
 common
