00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.140
 so for my knitted in circles with 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.500
 double pointed needles you need 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.620
 some double pointed needles 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.289
 minimum 4 because with four needles 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 we will be able to make a circle not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.630
 really like a triangle like that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 we will have stitches all around and the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.230
 fourth is the fourth needles which 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.939
 will you be knitting so we 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 will knit the stitches of this night 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.730
 then the stitches of this needle then 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.270
 the stitches of this needle so that's 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.910
 minimum 4 you can go up to 6 if 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
 you want if you have 6 needles 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.510
 so there is one that is always used to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.329
 side and the other five that will form 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.050
 not a triangle but something 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.379
 a little bit more art is what a little more 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.050
 soft to bonal 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.430
 so I got some mesh and I'm going 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.670
 show you the beginning how are we going 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.189
 do we'll do thirty 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.290
 transfer of the stitches on three 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.390
 points 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.460
 so I take my double needles 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.430
 tip and I'm going to transfer it I 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.310
 counted of what to do me my fear by 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.310
 needle of 30 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.180
 if you do not have the same number of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.290
 miles by needle it happens this is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.790
 not very serious what to avoid 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.579
 it's to have two stitches on one 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.450
 needle and then 10 miles on another 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.079
 in terms of in terms of equilibrium 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.040
 it's not top 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.280
 so there one is very young but 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.610
 transferred 8 on a first needle and 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.670
 I'm going to transfer eight more on a 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.670
 third line 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.439
 I think it's easier to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.350
 get up to have all the stitches and 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.350
 then after to transfer them 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.859
 on the needles rather than the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.100
 get on the needles live it's 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.350
 not terrible in terms of stability so 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.329
 here before starting some 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.440
 explanations of what to do 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:16.349
 attention and that's when there is a problem 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.599
 well known in the circular knit that 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.360
 is not to pay attention to how 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.760
 whose meshes are made 200 iron 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.040
 extracts the tours typically name by 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 example of knitting this one like that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.590
 you see I did a rotation without 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.660
 to notice 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.280
 and suddenly do not get in a circle and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.860
 it's not recoverable so done 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.989
 be careful that all stitches 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.299
 well all oriented in the same 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:45.090
 meaning ie the mounting rank of the 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.290
 down here without having twisted here the enamel that 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.870
 you will make sure that you 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.010
 will have a circle and not a 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.629
 moebius circle as we can see on 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.889
 some bosses or voluntarily 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:03.000
 twisted so that's the principle it's from 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:04.470
 join the evil circle here gmac I 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.850
 did not use and there I have my son 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.230
 main 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.810
 so we can see that it's good 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.790
 June in all places except here 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.609
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.620
 gather from the first my circle 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.130
 so always make sure that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.590
 your son of pelota he is right and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.900
 that you pity in the very first my 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.730
 that you had to climb to the beginning story 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.150
 to collect and close the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.489
 circle 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.739
 so I take my fourth needles and 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.269
 that's where we start a little bit 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.660
 gymnastics that is not obvious from 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.810
 climb the front rows so I take 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.260
 everything in my left hand 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.290
 I have my son here I'm going to stitch 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.200
 first watch of the first hand 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:53.790
 and I'm going tight to close well 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.829
 the circle up and I'm going to knit all 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.329
 meshes 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.100
 I have a tight grip when I have a 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.010
 game is a bit difficult 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.760
 I knitted all the stitches 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.760
 the first needle 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.129
 here I finished my first hand 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.500
 blow I have a new one that releases 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.620
 it's this news that I'm going 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.160
 use to knit the next my 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.530
 there a needle that I used you 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.880
 to knit now 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.300
 that I knitted so I have a new 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.270
 needle that is released I'm going to turn 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:39.210
 slightly work to be able to 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.650
 start knitting the next enamel 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.510
 so what's to be done is to 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.710
 think about pushing the stitches 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.720
 the bordelais grid to be able 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.500
 start attacking them they were going 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.030
 knit see it seems a little bit 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.930
 as I told you the editing 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.130
 at the beginning it's not what's more fun 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.830
 it strolls a little in every sense 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.349
 it's not really stable so you have to 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.750
 be careful now to 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:09.250
 knitting stitches as they are 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.800
 presented to not distort the work nor 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.400
 knitting here I finished my second 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.729
 needle and I'm going to knit the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.130
 third I push the males towards the 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:27.159
 edge of the peg I take my needle 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:31.649
 free and I knit the third 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:36.809
 needles attention here I have the thread 

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:39.489
 the tail of stitching the stitches 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:43.179
 So here I did a first 

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:45.039
 round round yes and parents since I do not 

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:46.919
 know what more per year I knit in 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.999
 round so that's their have a 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.119
 in any case that's how 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:54.369
 English describe it in their bosses 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:57.429
 will have 1 and year to be able to well 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:59.259
 to make the difference between knitting 

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:02.739
 flat and knit in circle i'm going 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:05.339
 do a second round this time I 

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:05.339
 I'll go a little faster 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.889
 So as you can see what 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.529
 is not obvious is that the first 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.559
 ranks the needles walk a little 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:22.929
 in every sense this threshold is enough 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:26.259
 annoying boring annoying it's the 

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:31.029
 time that there is and magne whatever 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:32.979
 well linked well stable of the blow in 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:36.279
 Waiting is the first we walk 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:38.079
 everywhere in all directions but 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.119
 it does not matter as long as you continue 

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:42.759
 to take the stitches as she 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.599
 present and she is knitted one 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.849
 after others 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.849
 everything should be fine 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.490
 and here I am done in front of back round so 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.810
 there we see well 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:09.370
 good here that we push it we can see 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:12.230
 upside down here that I joined in circle 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:15.140
 here it's a little looser it's normal 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.840
 these are the first my canton that 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.330
 fricote in round the first but they 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.040
 are often a little separate the 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.940
 one of the others it is a nice tighten 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.530
 very hard it's often that so what 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.870
 I will show you in the tips section 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.610
 eventually how to catch up with that at the 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.520
 end when you go in the thread 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.890
 it is quite catching but in 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.120
 outside of that we did our first 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:43.510
 circle and so we will continue as well 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.510
 to get the height Brazil
