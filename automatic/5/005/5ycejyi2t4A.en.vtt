the<00:00:01.350> nest<00:00:02.120> was<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.179> really<00:00:03.780> complex<00:00:04.290> structure

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
the nest was a really complex structure

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.120 
the nest was a really complex structure
it<00:00:05.759> was<00:00:05.940> tightly<00:00:06.600> woven<00:00:07.049> leaves<00:00:07.620> wrapped

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
it was tightly woven leaves wrapped

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.720 
it was tightly woven leaves wrapped
around<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.790> sticks<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.389> roots<00:00:10.099> it<00:00:11.099> was<00:00:11.280> even

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
around with sticks and roots it was even

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.380 
around with sticks and roots it was even
some<00:00:11.969> green<00:00:12.269> plastic<00:00:12.799> in<00:00:13.799> amongst<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> leaves

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.839 

that's<00:00:21.050> when<00:00:21.320> our<00:00:21.400> frustrations<00:00:22.400> really

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
that's when our frustrations really

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.310 
that's when our frustrations really
began<00:00:24.189> over<00:00:25.189> a<00:00:25.220> period<00:00:25.519> of<00:00:25.730> 17<00:00:26.390> days<00:00:26.689> we<00:00:27.079> went

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
began over a period of 17 days we went

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.339 
began over a period of 17 days we went
in<00:00:27.529> six<00:00:27.949> times<00:00:28.310> into<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.119> borough<00:00:29.449> but<00:00:30.169> we

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
in six times into the borough but we

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.029 
in six times into the borough but we
just<00:00:30.529> couldn't<00:00:30.919> penetrate<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.849> nest

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.419 

and<00:00:36.340> then<00:00:37.120> at<00:00:37.269> last<00:00:37.480> we<00:00:38.260> got<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:38.800> endoscope

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
and then at last we got the endoscope

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.260 
and then at last we got the endoscope
through<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.329> nest<00:00:40.570> wall

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.710 

we<00:00:44.020> first<00:00:44.290> glimpsed<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.220> tiny<00:00:45.610> bit<00:00:45.970> of<00:00:46.120> flesh

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
we first glimpsed a tiny bit of flesh

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.560 
we first glimpsed a tiny bit of flesh
through<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.590> leaves

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.810 

and<00:00:53.570> then<00:00:53.870> another<00:00:54.350> period<00:00:54.770> of<00:00:54.950> frustration

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
and then another period of frustration

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.200 
and then another period of frustration
half<00:00:56.420> an<00:00:56.660> hour<00:00:56.809> trying<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.620> get<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.460> glimpse<00:00:58.970> of

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
half an hour trying to get a glimpse of

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.640 
half an hour trying to get a glimpse of
the<00:00:59.600> bill

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.389 

yes<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:09.020> bill<00:01:09.229> looked<00:01:09.560> huge<00:01:09.920> through<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
yes the bill looked huge through the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.700 
yes the bill looked huge through the
Indus<00:01:10.700> code<00:01:10.939> but<00:01:11.780> was<00:01:12.049> really<00:01:12.320> only<00:01:12.560> a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
Indus code but was really only a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.249 
Indus code but was really only a
centimeter<00:01:13.280> long

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.850 

the<00:01:18.070> front<00:01:18.340> feet<00:01:18.579> already<00:01:18.880> had<00:01:19.360> claws<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the front feet already had claws and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.100 
the front feet already had claws and
then<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.340> our<00:01:24.369> amazement<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.630> saw<00:01:25.840> there<00:01:26.020> were

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
then to our amazement we saw there were

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.850 
then to our amazement we saw there were
two<00:01:26.350> babies

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
two babies

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:35.880
