00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.299
 do not 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.910
 hello welcome to a new video of 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.089
 immediate on how to climb faster than 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.490
 level at which the last ones are coming 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.949
 lots of videos about how to upload 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.340
 level recommend us to use the mode 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.800
 krankl or frantic or I am here ground 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.109
 staff and like fire does not just kill 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.900
 many usually kill me quite and very 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:29.769
 He rarely managed to double the points 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.230
 or kill more than two or three in a life is 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.670
 that as the frantic mode says it 's all 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.830
 the time all move kill kill 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.530
 kill die die die is a very 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.460
 frantic as the name says and only 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 which I recommend for worse players 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.850
 so to speak 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 use the domination mode in the mode of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.739
 domination of the 150 points of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.489
 experience by capturing each zone and there 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.350
 three areas in those three zones are you going to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 capture in a lot of times during the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
 I just played a game 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.410
 split in this mode of domination and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.210
 I did 14 of 1,564 experience points 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.430
 however although this mode lasts 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.610
 enough time more than other games 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.619
 they can even exceed 15 minutes is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.050
 a perfect way to get a lot of 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.820
 Streaks and kill a lot of enemies there 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.770
 people who even win to kill more 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.810
 of 50 I can not imagine the points of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.810
 experience that they are carrying in achieved 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.850
 Another advice is when creating a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.310
 class in the part of pierce or 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.560
 advantage skills I do not know well how it will be 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.320
 the name in Spanish have to 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.170
 select hard line or hard line 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.560
 then in the part where they are selected 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.840
 the packages put in specialist 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.450
 and select any of the first 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.579
 because the first ones because nothing else for 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.140
 get them you have to kill two or 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.140
 make at least 200 points 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.130
 what does that mean that as 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.460
 we have the hard line with 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.040
 just kill one and we'll have him 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.460
 where will we get the skill and this 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 will give us points so instead of winning 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.040
 50 for killing one in we will win 200 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.200
 now with this we can continue playing 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.550
 more games and keep winning a big 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.410
 quantity 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.500
 the experience I hope you have 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.370
 liked the video in regret not upload 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.370

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.080
