00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.210
 This is a new channel series I 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.380
 I separated three games that are sing me 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.380
 light and certainly deserve your vote 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 calm cabaret galley on youtube cabungula 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.380
 speaking here knows the new series that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.109
 I want to start here on channel top 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.599
 three games that are swallowing us Haiti and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.540
 deserve you to take a look at them 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.239
 because it really does not have much game it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 that deserves to arrive in style 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.110
 consequently more ease of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.770
 access is for us even more because the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.469
 most simulators to decade of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.480
 bus traffic regulators some 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.899
 regulators that I play a lot 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.059
 personal channel than give a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.190
 look at the views one time 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.940
 little bigger than the videos, that is the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.149
 I like the staff here on the channel too. 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.949
 are too many in German or too complicated 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.590
 to buy some you buy separately 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.810
 for example if you stay drive 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.760
 You can only buy the official website. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.560
 I am thinking about it 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.880
 Let's make this series for anyone who knows 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 help bring these games closer 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 consequently helping people to have 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 greater ease of access to them beauty 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 and if the first video zinho separated three 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.710
 games 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 just remembering for example that the euro 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.930
 truck simulator 2 left destroying night 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.740
 or is it worth to take a look 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.159
 Let's start our count is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.680
 beron the number 1 to lower the volume 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.460
 here is the number that is seen in the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.180
 opening of the video is clash time 5 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 he is kind of need for speed 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.729
 without official cars we for speed 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.250
 and with many blows from the banana boat 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.740
 for 10 however it is made by a Russian 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.899
 independent guy and I played one 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.049
 a little he's actually quite here 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.179
 playing it, you just see what 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.819
 if you saw before it was the gameplay of 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.770
 first time I played so much that enjoy 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.310
 I did something to play a little more 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.960
 here and I ended up wasting good time two 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.300
 Times of the day I played this game 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.200
 it's worth giving the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.110
 clash time 5 does not have all the sophistication 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.140
 do need for speed but it certainly has a 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.570
 A bit of fun that is missing in the limit 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:41.220
 for speed 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.150
 a number 2 to 2 in play here ó lower the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.970
 volume 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:51.450
 the number 10 is the bam simulator 2012 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.170
 For those who do not know Brazilian, he's a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.770
 of the main competitors of oms has 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.290
 many real gold functions you 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.770
 interacts a lot with the bus. 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.980
 Open the bottle, he also needs you. 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.550
 you even charge the passengers in the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.250
 At the end of the game is the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.970
 very competent bus in what he 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.920
 promises and fulfills the only one of his is 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.770
 It's hard to get here at 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.370
 brazil most of the versions that you 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.260
 think to buy are German insights or 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.810
 either you need to use a translator there 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.680
 to get him to buy the site 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.020
 officer comes from him in English but 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.970
 I do not know why I could not 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.610
 buy the credit card is giving 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.620
 but it 's a game that deserves 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.680
 also that you took one look still 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.240
 more because other than ms it is with 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.410
 too much time graphics too face on 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.180
 number three the number 3 is already a known 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.780
 here but we did not have his 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.660
 chance in the style the left and switch 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.920
 drive in simulator les or simulator 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:16.140
 civil airplane aerotruck simulator of the same 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.510
 producer of scs software but he has 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.060
 different purpose you are seeing in this 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.919
 trailer end of background i passing on the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.790
 truck passing in the middle of a lot of 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.400
 Colors 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.450
 it is more geared towards competitions or 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.060
 be 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.930
 you need to do many maneuvers with the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.380
 truck 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.490
 It's easy, man. I did not see it. 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:42.600
 has given a lot of maneuvers there that 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.450
 speaking I have put this picture really 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.040
 it's worth checking the choice 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.620
 of draft driving mainly 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.680
 people who like challenges 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.310
 it is full of fleshed 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.820
 if you make beauty that was the first top 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.170
 3 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.820
 I think he looks so cool this way. 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.600
 just to get an idea of ​​how the 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.180
 series 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.640
 I brought three little games that deserve you. 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.530
 that you take a look at it come back to 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.780
 help them get out of a squirrel 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.510
 I left the link to vote and everyone here 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.860
 under the description beauty do not forget 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.200
 I like to be favorites 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.170
 to publicize this series help these 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.330
 games consequently help us 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.800
 players only have access to them all 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:28.220
 the days at lunchtime new videozinho 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.220
 cable saying goodbye ok I said in a
