Kickstarter's gave oculus money to be

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.869 
Kickstarter's gave oculus money to be
used<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> gaming<00:00:38.250> device<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.820> were

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
used as a gaming device and they were

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.369 
used as a gaming device and they were
concerned<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.480> Facebook<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.110> take<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
concerned that Facebook would take it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.319 
concerned that Facebook would take it
over<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.770> somehow<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> social

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
over and somehow use it as a social

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.799 
over and somehow use it as a social
media<00:00:42.570> device<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.410> far<00:00:43.590> oculus<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
media device but so far oculus is

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
media device but so far oculus is
proceeding<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.989> planned<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.680> facebook

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
proceeding as planned because facebook

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
proceeding as planned because facebook
seems<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.700> taken<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.149> fairly<00:00:48.570> hands-off

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
seems to have taken a fairly hands-off

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.130 
seems to have taken a fairly hands-off
approach<00:00:49.489> presumably<00:00:50.489> oculus<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.780> using

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
approach presumably oculus is just using

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
approach presumably oculus is just using
Facebook's<00:00:52.559> resources<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> make<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> better

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
Facebook's resources to make a better

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
Facebook's resources to make a better
product<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.180> course<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> better<00:00:54.600> product<00:00:54.809> means

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
product of course a better product means

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
product of course a better product means
more<00:00:55.379> sales<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.890> more<00:00:55.980> sales<00:00:56.670> means<00:00:56.969> more

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
more sales and more sales means more

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
more sales and more sales means more
money<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.809> owner<00:00:57.960> Facebook<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> can

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
money for the owner Facebook so you can

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
money for the owner Facebook so you can
see<00:00:59.399> why<00:00:59.640> they're<00:00:59.820> taking<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.210> approach<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
see why they're taking this approach and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.760 
see why they're taking this approach and
that's<00:01:01.050> hopefully<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.379> we'll<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.739> here

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that's hopefully what we'll see here

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
that's hopefully what we'll see here
this<00:01:02.579> isn't<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> same<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.510> Facebook

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this isn't the same as the Facebook

this isn't the same as the Facebook
