 from where the guys cenac hayes I hope that

 you're going to listen to me okay 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.000
 quiet we meet again today 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.400
 for a new video with a little 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.920
 gameplay this time on mw3 for a 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.239
 maybe double month with the cac 40 7 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.500
 I really let you discover this 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.580
 gameplay know that this gameplay I 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.110
 realized there is still 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.430
 now a lot of time we're going 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.170
 listen also I invited 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.399
 subscribers so I know they enormously 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.660
 of people over others about 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.309
 social networks who asked me this is 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.539
 when you added all the guys 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.680
 frankly I can not get me finally I can 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.110
 not add everyone at the same time 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.190
 I play times with subscribers it's 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.480
 true that currently we will listen I 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.580
 a little let go the cluster of call of duty 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.930
 it's true that I expect will greatly 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.070
 listen to the next call of duty that is 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.320
 make it a little bit more 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.490
 week to laquer so be vain evening 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.050
 per year for those who are not yet 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.220
 current but hey it would surprise me that 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.360
 you are not aware finally brief and 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.160
 besides, it's going to be one of the topics 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.300
 today because it is true that there 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.649
 of that now we will say little 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.030
 almost a month and a half two months ago I you 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.590
 had already done a video on the neck 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.360
 seems to be vain comes out strong so 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.770
 it was a little bit of info from 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.630
 the intox we were not yet all to 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.069
 made sure but there yesterday and ben listen he 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.050
 there was just the revelation 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.610
 Well here are two bombs 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.020
 nuclear end a nuclear bomb a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 little bit peculiarly just about 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.440
 advanced warfare and the other here is a 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.060
 nuclear title finally short so I'm going 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.440
 a little bit introduce you to this so 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.729
 it's true that I saw that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.569
 today on social networks so 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.160
 it's true that it's really 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.840
 important to create two here by 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.789
 example a twitter or a facebook here 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.349
 of cotton simply for a 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.700
 to be able to follow your youtuber here is your 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.319
 favorite or rather I do not know if I 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.250
 be part of it but that's it if you want me 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.660
 to follow a little bit in my daily life 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.190
 do not hesitate to create yourself 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.119
 a twitter account is also ben 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.429
 here to follow a little bit 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.479
 the current game developers it 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.739
 I'm often going to say here are some 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.819
 classifieds like that so here we go 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.739
 it's true that it's really great 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.729
 pleasure we'll just say that 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.679
 I can today make you a 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.360
 video on it so that's it's true 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.619
 I take myself we will say one day 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.970
 after since that's it then I make you 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.230
 this comment we are simply the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.970
 Sunday and I'll have it posted to you on 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.629
 Monday since I already have a video planned 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.129
 for today 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.599
 so maybe there will be 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.980
 some youtuber who will already have it 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.239
 done and me honestly it's me 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.530
 completely equal I really have 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.150
 to say want to give you my opinion on 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.440
 the nuclear also to introduce you 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.440
 some things that others youtube 1 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.700
 we may not introduce you 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.870
 and then that's how I said good 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.180
 Here I will introduce a little 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.520
 little gameplay a little double to the web 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.840
 maybe we'll see maybe that's going 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.580
 I did you have a maybe that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.470
 I had them we'll see well so here we go 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.640
 including a mobile pretending to me 150 seconds 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.110
 so here we are going to say that is when 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.460
 not bad and especially it was 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.190
 no support because I remember 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.480
 and so we're gone now with the 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.640
 about the video as I tell him he 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.290
 so go on advanced warfare so 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.150
 this one coming at last rather 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.770
 next call of duty excuse me who 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.420
 go out as I say before for a 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.490
 little more than a week and so it's going 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.110
 to be official low the revelation of 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.190
 nuclear and another bomb titles 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.290
 nuclear so it's true that it makes 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.610
 really great fun we can notice 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.630
 from year to year that there are standards and 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.370
 finally rather than there is a lot 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.870
 investments at the level of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.130
 community performance just as well 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.440
 at the community level I do not know 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.210
 could Harvester sic level detector 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.470
 we are always served 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.460
 level of competition it's true 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.810
 that there is a little bit for everyone 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.190
 world for some years we 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.140
 really notice that the developers 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.580
 there are some people 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.290
 who will say they are not at the listened to the 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.550
 community but I think of year in 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.780
 year they still make some 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.680
 things we will say to be able to improve 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.900
 games etc 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.630
 so that's it's true that before we 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.980
 had rather voice the tendency to be a 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.840
 little more in the ease in the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.220
 meaning where on mw2 we can notice that 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.840
 can unlock nuclear power with 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.120
 kills trek and from year to year we go 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.950
 to say that there is a little bit of 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.910
 innovation is also going to be saying 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.290
 these are some things that change 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.489
 like for example here on black of the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.959
 it was the first time in with a 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.850
 nuclear title unlocked so there was 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.470
 not necessarily assets that could us 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.730
 help make it earlier we're going to say we 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.890
 could only rely on our style 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.239
 also here on mw3 and on ghost on 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.130
 just had the killstreaks 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.540
 specialist so here it's true that here 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.100
 it still helps us a lot since 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.630
 we became more and more powerful at 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.130
 every time we select them and 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.450
 so now we're going to listen in ben 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.950
 precisely the next call of duty the 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.390
 next opus advance warfare they have 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.220
 decided to put a little bit we'll say 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.930
 a mixture we will say of his words in 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.430
 two is different we will say excuse 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.170
 me a way to unlock the nuclear 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.190
 I 'll tell you a little bit about that 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.140
 it's true that on social networks 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.070
 it was marked in English since there 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.049
 the accounts are simply 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.580
 American so I'm trying to decipher that 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.750
 if you are a little bit more thinking 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.430
 only and that I was wrong 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.780
 Well, here you go, do not hesitate to tell me 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.919
 to say and that's it if I just also 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.840
 do not hesitate to tell me 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.669
 so also to what I understood he 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.530
 there will be two nuclear bombs of which there will be 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.750
 will have a title that we can unlock at 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.220
 quiet without it would be so we 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 can only rely on our weapon 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.880
 maybe here is there will be 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.990
 some ways to unlock them a 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.040
 little bit faster like 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.000
 microstations at its level 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.380
 frankly I'm not too 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.120
 to inform it is true that here at 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.890
 level of assets is rather at 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.060
 advantages of series of points etc 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.800
 I did not get too much information 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.180
 that I know is that nuclear yann a 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.890
 little bit like the title of black ops 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.240
 which four years he feels 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.440
 killstreaks to help you so here 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.310
 the assault killstreaks so the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.080
 helicopters etc 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.460
 so yes counted only one will say 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.990
 on your weapon on your equipment and 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.910
 so it's also like on black ops 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.990
 2 will be exactly so it will be 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.610
 completely identical 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.500
 there will also be a novelty 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.730
 it is true that there is every time 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.990
 we will say a little novelty in the 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.550
 call of duty it's true that there is 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.670
 had the nuclear bomb so the bomb 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.320
 tactical on mw2 the moab on mw3 the 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.730
 cabin on ghost and now that 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.280
 will be called the dna bomb 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.390
 so the DNA bomb in French that goes 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.160
 simply unblock at 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.210
 quiet without dying but with the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.860
 killstreaks so that is to say that the 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.730
 killstreaks will be included knew that 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.990
 here we are going to say that it can leave 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.460
 still a little bit of choice all the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.930
 world given that there is there 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.340
 some people who on black ops 2 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.870
 did not necessarily get too much 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.830
 unlock the nuclear title due to its 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.690
 difficulty I think 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.590
 bah now here we will say that any 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.580
 the world is served it's true that 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.230
 now there will be some people 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.180
 who will be helped by the support 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.990
 just killstreaks assault so 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.830
 that's true it can still 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.600
 to be not bad so 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.100
 it is true that here in the old 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 call of duty so I think practically 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.680
 at the moa ballack am etc 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.419
 there was always we will say a little 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.770
 change that we saw this bomb 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.110
 nuclear their little peculiarity 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.910
 of the dnf compared to the nuclear 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.050
 without finally it's nuclear without it 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.090
 would be that of advance adjustments 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.860
 warfare we can send the dna 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.180
 unlike the nuclear title that we 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.590
 will only unlock so well 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.090
 obviously in advance warfare and so 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.620
 what is it going to do it's true that 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.690
 in every call of duty louis we can 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.790
 just launched here is one who would have 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.050
 hidden but still we'll say a 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.090
 little surprise and this time the 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.680
 guy will not be like on mw3 is sure 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.480
 that the goal i ghost the screen will not be 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.930
 brown but it will be green for a 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.220
 minute 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.630
 so now that by wanting verheyde to 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.919
 listen to the map it will be green during 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.060
 a minute so that's right 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.080
 it's still quite special but 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.970
 I can not wait to say 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.350
 discover that since that's true 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.460
 that it can still be said 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.810
 change a little bit before we had 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.400
 always we will say a little color 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.630
 orange-brown like that now it's going 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.490
 to be green i'm really expecting will say of 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.690
 see what's going to give also bah 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.280
 listen I will make you discover the 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.570
 logo so how did I find 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.919
 I just found that 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.490
 also on social networks so 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.320
 on the site 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.120
 call of duty series this point of them so 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.380
 it was a German thing so here 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.330
 I'll just show you the 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.080
 screen so you can see we'll say 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.340
 the bonde camp 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.379
 we simply develop it we can 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.550
 to see gray and green here is a species 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.960
 small bomb no I'm waiting 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.639
 really gonna say to see what that does 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.500
 when it is thrown unfortunately good there 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.699
 I could not find we're going to say the 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.930
 when the screen was completely 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.370
 to if I can find it between 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.870
 time I will show you a small screen 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.039
 but here I think it can really 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.080
 we will say our intruder precisely 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.599
 to have just two 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.069
 nuclear a hidden bomb and another 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.879
 times earlier another nuclear title 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:12.240
 which I think everyone is 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.740
 served 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.939
 the good players like the bad ones it's 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.710
 to say that in fact we can unlock 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:17.729
 two nuclear titles in a lifetime 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.800
 frankly it could really be 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.419
 super g really we'll say hurry to 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.039
