opinion about the stylus and well first

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
opinion about the stylus and well first
of<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.020> great<00:00:43.309> piece<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
of all I think it's a great piece of

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.090 
of all I think it's a great piece of
engineering<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.770> unique<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
engineering it's a really unique and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
engineering it's a really unique and
intelligent<00:00:50.100> design<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:52.070> because<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:54.020> they

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
intelligent design and because like they

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
intelligent design and because like they
say<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> video<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.309> feels<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> regular

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
say in the video it feels like a regular

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
say in the video it feels like a regular
pen<00:00:57.690> you've<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.399> this<00:01:00.020> huge<00:01:01.020> grip<00:01:01.590> area<00:01:01.949> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
pen you've got this huge grip area in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.960 
pen you've got this huge grip area in
comparison<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.899> before<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:05.580> me<00:01:05.700> that's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
comparison to before and to me that's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760 
comparison to before and to me that's
the<00:01:06.180> biggest<00:01:06.360> selling<00:01:06.750> point<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.320> you've

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the biggest selling point because you've

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
the biggest selling point because you've
got<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.540> space<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.229> your

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
got just so much more space for your

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.370 
got just so much more space for your
fingers<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> rest<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.170> feels

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
fingers to rest on and it just feels

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.219 
fingers to rest on and it just feels
right<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.299> doesn't<00:01:15.299> feel<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> pen<00:01:16.080> any

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
right it doesn't feel and like a pen any

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.080 
right it doesn't feel and like a pen any
more<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> touch<00:01:17.729> pen<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:19.700> also<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.880> use

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
more like a touch pen and also they use

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.140 
more like a touch pen and also they use
a<00:01:21.299> great<00:01:21.689> material<00:01:22.290> its<00:01:22.530> bendable<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a great material its bendable it's I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.990 
a great material its bendable it's I
think<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.439> durable<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.580> flipped<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
think it's very durable I flipped it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.859 
think it's very durable I flipped it
around<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.420> couple<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.780> times<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:29.869> just

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
around a couple of times and it just

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.069 
around a couple of times and it just
won't<00:01:31.409> break<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.420> got<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> nice

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
won't break and and it also got a nice

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.490 
won't break and and it also got a nice
that<00:01:37.530> sound<00:01:37.770> feeling<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.430> flip<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.119> in

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
that sound feeling when you flip it in

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.639 
that sound feeling when you flip it in
clicks<00:01:40.500> nicely<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.570> very<00:01:42.899> firm<00:01:43.290> after

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
clicks nicely and it's very firm after

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.230 
clicks nicely and it's very firm after
that<00:01:43.950> before<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:46.259> firm

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
that before it's a little bit on firm

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.410 
that before it's a little bit on firm
this<00:01:48.240> flaps<00:01:48.990> around<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.970> but<00:01:50.970> after<00:01:51.299> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
this flaps around a bit but after that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.710 
this flaps around a bit but after that
it<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.640> won't<00:01:53.640> Bend<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.450> anymore

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it just won't Bend that much anymore

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
it just won't Bend that much anymore
before<00:01:55.140> you've<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.490> big<00:01:56.640> piece<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
before you've got the big piece of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.429 
before you've got the big piece of
plastic<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:59.450> it<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.509> feels<00:02:01.200> right

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
plastic in here and it just feels right

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.340 
plastic in here and it just feels right
i<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.040> worth<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.579> money<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.350> it

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
i think it's worth the money and it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
i think it's worth the money and it
would<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.530> great<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:06.049> in<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:08.789> be

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
would be great to see this in the to be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.080 
would be great to see this in the to be
produced<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.640> major<00:02:11.940> problem

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
produced and that's the major problem

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.309 
produced and that's the major problem
right<00:02:12.690> now<00:02:12.720> because

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
right now because

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.429 
right now because
was<00:02:13.409> like<00:02:14.159> you've<00:02:14.430> already<00:02:15.170> seen<00:02:16.170> with<00:02:16.349> the

yourself well you can't easily get a

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.209 
yourself well you can't easily get a
prototype<00:03:05.219> like<00:03:05.400> me<00:03:05.609> but<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:07.949> do<00:03:08.189> a
