00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 belts a super cool accessory for 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.410
 Introduce yourself in your look 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 Only you always chose to feel right to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.670
 I see you around, but people who use it 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.309
 belt in any way place any 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.360
 I feel in any physical type there was a 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.250
 conclusion 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:31.380
 Let's talk a little better 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 choice for you of k1 and wide belts 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.450
 feel very wide to be used well in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 future but be careful that I'm sorry 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.640
 light - colored side and still full of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.610
 details are the main ones that give 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 volume on the waist or who does not have 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.050
 a lot of waist or have a belly 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.260
 but this is not the best option if you 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.039
 has little waist and wants to wear a belt 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.559
 long 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.030
 choose a darker color without so many 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.480
 details like this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.480
 fine 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.479
 dk two more children's belts is the belt that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.190
 It looks good, everyone is the belt that you 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.900
 It is with a basic outfit you put 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.280
 it gives a personal touch 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.440
 this is for those who have a little more 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 belly because the belly but waist - 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.420
 everyone's waist will look good the belt 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 I do not give a damn, it does not change the type 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.960
 risk it does not change the body that is what 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960
 everybody looks good 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.270
 tip 3 is that I feel it is the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.850
 basic is the most common is this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 two fingers that I speak and feel the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 two fingers he is cool because he is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.880
 black goes however only that you have a 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.030
 attention in detail is seeing how he 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.740
 There are billions in all of it. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.740
 who does not have a lot of waist and is not so 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.080
 Cool that gives volume where I no longer have 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
 much there you have to make choices 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.820
 suddenly a two- finger belt that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 not have as much volume on the side only 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:10.920
 concentrated here in the middle of every four 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.900
 It's the elastic belt, this belt from here is 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.660
 the one who leaves the woman's silhouette 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 balanced seat that he makes at the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.320
 waist in the right place 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.750
 Undo who has a little belly 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.299
 because first it is dark throughout 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.269
 extension or brown black always a color 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.850
 dark and the other tip 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.890
 the look of him calls attention to the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.079
 center of the body that is here 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.250
 so for those who have little waist he is 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.110
 great for anyone who has a little bit of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.690
 tummy does not have any problem with 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.690
 they 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.700
 pure or that is the belt of the season 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.700
 It's all well and good, just the simple 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.950
 These waistlines increase so 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.310
 if you wear a belt afternoon increasing 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.010
 waist puts it on the waistband of the pants or 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.710
 here at the waist and uses his back 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.230
 of the clothes half out you put him 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.360
 only in evidence a center of it that the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.020
 butterfly in this case has one more daughter 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.020
 flashy 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.140
 I hope you have enjoyed all the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.450
 tips from the belts and now the next time 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.280
 you will choose your this new 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.830
 station that summer is coming 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.830
