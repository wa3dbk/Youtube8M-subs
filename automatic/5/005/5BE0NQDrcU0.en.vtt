00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
fold all four corners to the fault

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:34.840 
fold all four corners to the fault
you've<00:01:03.400> just<00:01:03.760> created

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:47.850 

you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860 

now<00:01:48.860> give<00:01:49.730> the<00:01:49.760> paper<00:01:50.120> in<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.480> middle<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.810> a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
now give the paper in the middle of a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.770 
now give the paper in the middle of a
gentle<00:01:51.350> squeeze<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:52.070> create<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:52.910> fault<00:01:53.300> just

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
gentle squeeze and create a fault just

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:04.660 
gentle squeeze and create a fault just
like<00:01:54.050> in<00:01:54.260> a<00:01:54.350> water<00:01:54.530> bomb<00:01:54.860> base<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:02.630> see<00:02:03.670> same

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
like in a water bomb base you see same

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:17.610 
like in a water bomb base you see same
on<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.940> other<00:02:04.970> side

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.240 

you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.850 

don't<00:02:22.250> appear<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:22.790> 90<00:02:23.180> degrees<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.840> fold<00:02:24.650> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
don't appear for 90 degrees and fold the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.630 
don't appear for 90 degrees and fold the
top<00:02:25.129> layer<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.090> makes<00:02:26.329> a<00:02:26.480> small<00:02:26.720> triangle

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
top layer so it makes a small triangle

00:02:27.640 --> 00:03:00.020 
top layer so it makes a small triangle
do<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.849> four<00:02:29.150> times

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.450 

now<00:03:01.030> make<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> small<00:03:01.690> fold<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.190> same

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
now make a small fold with the same

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.030 
now make a small fold with the same
layers<00:03:03.820> as<00:03:04.120> before<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:05.200> now<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.680> opposite

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
layers as before but now in the opposite

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.600 
layers as before but now in the opposite
direction<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.190> small<00:03:09.430> one<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.850> see<00:03:11.610> by

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
direction just a small one you see by

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.440 
direction just a small one you see by
doing<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.240> will<00:03:13.570> make<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> jump<00:03:14.110> your<00:03:14.320> leg

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
doing this you will make a jump your leg

00:03:15.450 --> 00:04:03.490 
doing this you will make a jump your leg
he<00:03:16.450> needs<00:03:16.690> for<00:03:16.960> so<00:03:17.290> do<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:17.980> all<00:03:18.130> four<00:03:18.430> sides

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.820 

turn<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.310> paper<00:04:04.490> upside<00:04:05.000> down<00:04:05.380> now<00:04:06.380> it's<00:04:06.620> time

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
turn the paper upside down now it's time

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.730

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.970 

now<00:04:32.230> i<00:04:32.260> will<00:04:32.710> fold<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.250> back<00:04:33.430> end<00:04:33.730> of<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.090> frog

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.990 

join<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.160> legs<00:04:41.400> don't<00:04:41.700> Aaron<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.700> now<00:04:44.940> you

join the legs don't Aaron and now you

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.559 
join the legs don't Aaron and now you
have<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.420> tuck<00:04:45.660> in<00:04:45.840> both<00:04:46.200> ends

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:21.350 

it<00:04:54.629> has<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.289> go<00:04:55.469> in<00:04:55.740> between<00:04:55.949> two<00:04:56.669> layers

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.909 

almost<00:05:22.229> ready<00:05:23.120> fold<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.300> paper<00:05:24.560> from<00:05:25.560> blacks

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
almost ready fold the paper from blacks

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.159 
almost ready fold the paper from blacks
on<00:05:26.219> hind<00:05:27.000> legs<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:29.120> now<00:05:30.120> make<00:05:30.419> an<00:05:30.599> opposite

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
on hind legs and now make an opposite

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:43.990 
on hind legs and now make an opposite
fold<00:05:31.469> to<00:05:32.430> default<00:05:32.819> you<00:05:32.969> just<00:05:33.210> made<00:05:34.550> half<00:05:35.550> way

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.360 

now<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.690> Frog<00:05:45.140> will<00:05:45.350> be<00:05:45.500> able<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.830> jump

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.990 

I<00:05:53.410> think<00:05:54.410> the<00:05:54.530> front<00:05:54.800> legs<00:05:55.040> are<00:05:55.280> a<00:05:55.310> bit<00:05:55.400> too<00:05:55.760> big

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
I think the front legs are a bit too big

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:10.659 
I think the front legs are a bit too big
so<00:05:56.930> I<00:05:57.139> will<00:05:57.410> fold<00:05:57.650> them<00:05:57.830> in<00:05:57.949> half<00:06:05.680> and<00:06:06.680> now<00:06:09.669> make

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
so I will fold them in half and now make

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:22.939 
so I will fold them in half and now make
a<00:06:10.699> big<00:06:10.850> jump

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.950 

as<00:06:23.949> I<00:06:24.520> said<00:06:24.580> before<00:06:24.759> you<00:06:25.270> can<00:06:25.300> make<00:06:25.569> it<00:06:25.720> out<00:06:25.810> of

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
as I said before you can make it out of

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.850 
as I said before you can make it out of
money<00:06:26.400> those<00:06:27.400> frogs<00:06:27.759> will<00:06:28.030> jump<00:06:28.660> very<00:06:28.930> well<00:06:29.259> or

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
money those frogs will jump very well or

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.930
