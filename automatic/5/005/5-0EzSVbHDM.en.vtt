00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 chic 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.289
 one of these 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.769
 after all a new information channel 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.809
 association of its delegates to its 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.359
 way to generate 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.550
 through this channel we will take some formations some news 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.210
 we hope it works 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.150
 is one of our colleagues a bit of a little more encouragement of proximity 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.640
 between our succession 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.310
 and I associate 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.160
 and the other police delegates also clear 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.980
 I would like to say that the negotiations with the government are 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.289
 Paul continued 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.670
 in a very satisfactory way 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.020
 not as markedly as we would all like to be a big city in 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.100
 whole class 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.500
 including mine 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.040
 but we are negotiating elite that's how trading works 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.989
 with the benfica always a little more 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:57.860
 to delay 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.920
 but we are in a very interesting process hoping to bring 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.510
 previously with the results 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.520
 For the second question that we would like to contribute 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.630
 is our ordinary shareholders' meeting that is already scheduled for the 17th of 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.810
 June at 6 pm on the first call and 6:30 pm on the second call 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.800
 this general assembly will treat 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.090
 is mainly the issue of the new status 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.250
 and in the financial report of our columns that said 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 her colleague was not unprepared without knowledge of the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.920
 we are sending this booklet all colleagues will receive in their 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.700
 houses 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.050
 so I beg you to take a careful look at it 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.700
 because our new status will provide us with 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.500
 ambiguity, professionally politically and even 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.090
 due to the attributions of the association itself 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.350
 and subsections in colonies is the patrimony of the associate 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.990
 then also each associate in the goals 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.430
 determine the destination 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.260
 that we will give how we will solve our problems here with our 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.750
 patrimony 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.210
 you also tell colleagues that due to an incident 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:13.719
 keividy obviously expected at that time in our refurbished 'restaurant 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.379
 Our inauguration date was postponed to June 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.849
 but precisely on June 3 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.560
 for a system problem 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.050
 and I can agree with the pl ethical that the work is always so we do a planning 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.920
 then unfortunately for us will check on the continuity of the work 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.809
 I discovered some things that were covered by the 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.329
 puppo plaster at last 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.050
 this type of setback finally happens 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.310
 so I'm already apologizing for the fact that this disorder 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.669
 was an unexpected fact - we expected this 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.910
 happened but unfortunately 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.629
 he really 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.949
 determinant for the continuity of the world of our steel kourou reform 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:57.829
 thank you 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.719
 and in 15 days or exceptionally 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.719
 We'll talk again a big hug to everyone. 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:07.779
