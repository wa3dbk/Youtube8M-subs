00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.540
 new version of minecraft 1.4.5 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.940
 new mode and so new map of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hello to all of you 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.690
 fuchs is today I would like you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.660
 talk about the new thermo ex 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.970
 boarders then the big novelty 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.630
 it's wearing it in the tank 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 so how does that thing stuff then 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 we will come back to two machines that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.599
 I already spoke last time on 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.490
 sprayer because we're going to have 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.050
 need to spray obsidian 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.320
 to get obsidian sprayed 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 and with the more obsidian sprayed 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.420
 from the d 1 go of the ide in an induction 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.989
 nine smelter of course so I tested 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.910
 with the three kinds of lead in dot 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.059
 available in ftb so it works from 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.660
 leading lot with spraying help 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:02.670
 obsidian we will get ice cream so 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.159
 very hard glass reinforce and kraft 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.430
 in four of these ice gear with some 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 tyne so we get carry ball as long as 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.260
 so the advantage as they perform 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.360
 get stronger and already creepers 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.360
 resistant 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.590
 this is what is said in the cid ans 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.299
 in the website of the creator must check 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.619
 so what's the point of wearing bowl like 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.090
 his name says the laptops so 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 you go in go down in your 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960
 mine especially early in the game you 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.400
 put your door and want as long as 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.530
 you fill seals with the bay at 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.170
 as you want to empty into the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.060
 time you can put it like this 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.110
 cyprus where I am at eight or nine here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.030
 and then carefully the red bull crashed 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.040
 since this mode is considered a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.799
 add-on kraft or amr amr thermo 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.990
 expansion shift the rights you 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.409
 recover your tank but with his 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.140
 contents 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.729
 oh that's new and that's not bad 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.049
 and you can go back to the base for the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.350
 empty and where you want something else on 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.229
 to be carried in the tank tank 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.550
 portable makes it one can decide where 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.910
 and the entrance or exit 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.230
 whereas in fact it comes out from underneath it 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.920
 come back from above but not over 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.290
 sides and less than pipes so hold 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.590
 my stuff that changes places all 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.680
 only 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.330
 short so if I place a time that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.650
 above it allows to make a column and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.819
 we see that this pass in orange because 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.920
 that it becomes the exit and as 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.489
 the blue entrance on the tank from below 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.180
 that's if we put water here it will go in 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.220
 below one if I turn this for example 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.220
 demanding but a vacuum underneath 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.300
 that's filling in and it works 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.349
 I will take another 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:59.650
 with the machines for example here I 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:03.459
 I'm going to empty it moans 1 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.950
 nihous ex trader so I settled the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.980
 above and the input side so on the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.670
 blue each side and on the left side 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.069
 orange the exit to the trunk if I 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.870
 right click on the tank 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.739
 it goes orange below that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.590
 enter the lava in the news extruder 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.750
 the same for the water but there will enter 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.220
 the laurel pipe a small beach of 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.459
 connection but in fact it works very 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.620
 well 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.810
 here and the machine is on the way 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.980
 and that will make me cocoben you 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.859
 see it a little while I had 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.510
 tested games 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.930
 so it's interesting as pipes 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.849
 as a reservoir also like 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.920
 novelty the helicopter and docks 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.239
 in fact it's liquid hoses but 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.620
 which are also done with ice janet 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.030
 so they are supposed to be creepers 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.400
 resistance so with friends of 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.430
 copper ingots and breasts of the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.950
 ice cream we get 4 liquid hoc 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.510
 so I put it there so I have a 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.150
 little surprise trying to 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.829
 then place here we have a shot at 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.379
 accumulators of which I put a pipe 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.879
 on it and it fills up right away 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.169
 of water so that seems to work I'm 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.530
 say I will continue I place a 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:17.169
 second pipe but it fills part 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.030
 so in fact with a shift like this click 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.330
 right it can be removed but if it is 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.699
 place after not worry it fills 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.570
 and there I can put an empty time in 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.430
 underneath and fill my tank 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.409
 that's not so bad anyway 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.669
 with a right click on the pipe there we 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.550
 can make arrows like pipes 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.650
 electric to know in what way that 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.449
 will obviously not drop anything 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.889
 works 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.340
 the arrow is not very clear 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.689
 the story of the arrow 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.759
 Anyway 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.799
 to one last thing I had forgotten 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.080
 to speak the last time we go 

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:54.969
 look together 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.269
 induction smelter so it works 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:01.029
 with sand and electricity for 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:02.589
 melt finally to cook things you 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:06.969
 see by the way that I had fun at 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:08.709
 the guy just like that it did it to me and 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.079
 I do not know what makes this the pipes 

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.879
 electric explodes big novelty 

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:14.849
 I feel like it's when we 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.409
 leave an electric delectable arrival 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.469
 on a machine that does not work 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.300
 the pipes explodes I do not know if 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.309
 it's a bug it's a wanted behavior 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.439
 or not, it's been many times 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:28.569
 startle 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:30.789
 it is to dig I recheck rsa more 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.649
 late is a danger is to follow the 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.099
 forums closely to see why but 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:39.429
 electric pipe explodes so when we 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:42.489
 puts sand is that electricity and 

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:44.019
 ore we get 2 ore 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:47.799
 so that's what I said 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:49.809
 last time if we put then with two 

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:53.370
 minerals and occasionally we had to 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:55.500
 rich slag and if instead of the 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.979
 sand game but the rich lag I want 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.729
 get three ingots for an ore 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:06.060
 so that's so interesting three 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:11.540
 ingots for a ore more 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.540
 cie electricity yet I factory 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.810
 good still a big feld anon we can 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.810
 cook 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.630
 but how much 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.259
 ah on optical there is even better than 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.870
 I believed with 3 powder so three 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.210
 ingots by powder 1 would have lived by 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.779
 three that's it so that's when 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.840
 even interesting 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:41.490
 finally here and when we cook or 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.529
 ores or ingots that it does not hold 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.949
 also slide is the only access that 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:48.449
 I had forgotten to talk basically 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:51.749
 when cooked it gets some 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:54.120
 rock school rock wool and the 

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:55.800
 rock wool alagna advantage she does not 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.229
 do not burn then sometimes with gray 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.849
 not just the color by putting them by 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.590
 eight with dye middle one can the 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.180
 colored as we want a bit like in 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.909
 the kraft rail we liked it by eight and then 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.159
 we put the middle dye so for 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:11.279
 test here of arkoon here wool 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.680
 normal exactly the same head 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:15.779
 except that normal wool she goes 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.669
 disappear very quickly 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:21.150
 in addition to the fire being it is a 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:24.349
 disaster while cool art down the 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.729
 fire will burn and not expand 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:29.550
 that was all for the novelties 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:32.460
 so especially tanks and hoses 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.580
 Tamil fleet are therefore created little 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.310
 resistant and its flat screens more 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:40.169
 worn bolton on everything and that's I 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.629
 talked about what I had forgotten I'm going 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:46.229
 investigate these untimely explosions 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:50.060
 of pipes and then my faith I tell you to 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:50.060
 the next go to see you soon
