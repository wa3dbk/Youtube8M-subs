 and hurting milk and sugar 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.360
 I recommend you use a wooden shovel 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.379
 and be very careful when boiling 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.239

 and set aside to then mix with the other ingredients 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780

 to later take the norm 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.029
