most of the designs on the outside but I

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.399 
most of the designs on the outside but I
still<00:04:43.999> think<00:04:44.240> that<00:04:44.270> looks<00:04:44.569> really<00:04:44.719> cool<00:04:45.020> in

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.040 
still think that looks really cool in
the<00:04:45.560> arrow<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.279> the<00:04:47.210> cool<00:04:47.389> little<00:04:47.539> pieces<00:04:47.840> and

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
the arrow and the cool little pieces and

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.529 
the arrow and the cool little pieces and
I<00:04:48.379> made<00:04:48.590> there<00:04:48.860> in<00:04:49.249> chrome<00:04:49.550> just<00:04:50.330> because

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
I made there in chrome just because
