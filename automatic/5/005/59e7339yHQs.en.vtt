actually<00:00:42.030> figure<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.480> how<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:43.100> actually<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
actually figure out how to do actually a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
actually figure out how to do actually a
lot<00:00:44.969> simpler<00:00:45.300> than<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> thought<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:47.360> I'll

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
lot simpler than what I thought so I'll

lot simpler than what I thought so I'll
show<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> combo<00:00:49.170> before<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:49.800> do

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
show you the combo before I actually do

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.400 
show you the combo before I actually do
it<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> skill<00:00:50.940> tree<00:00:52.129> that<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.489> see

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.720 
it in the skill tree that we can see
what<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:56.219> you've<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> find

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
the fourth one I'm still trying to get

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.340 
the fourth one I'm still trying to get
the<00:01:46.150> timing<00:01:46.390> out<00:01:46.570> sometimes<00:01:47.050> it<00:01:47.200> works

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
the timing out sometimes it works

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:57.330 
the timing out sometimes it works
sometimes<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.950> doesn't<00:01:55.710> anyway<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.920> showed<00:01:57.220> you

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
sometimes it doesn't anyway I showed you

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.680 
sometimes it doesn't anyway I showed you
that<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.520> want<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.760> see<00:01:57.970> what<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.270> next<00:01:58.420> one<00:01:58.660> is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
that I want to see what the next one is

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.250 
that I want to see what the next one is
see<00:01:59.560> if<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.710> can<00:01:59.860> do<00:01:59.980> it<00:02:00.510> cannot<00:02:01.510> do<00:02:01.690> this<00:02:01.960> one

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
see if I can do it cannot do this one

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.550 
see if I can do it cannot do this one
because<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.890> requires<00:02:03.730> a<00:02:03.880> whip<00:02:04.210> fresh<00:02:04.720> and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
because it requires a whip fresh and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.710 
because it requires a whip fresh and
that<00:02:06.010> is<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.670> one<00:02:06.820> right<00:02:06.850> here<00:02:07.000> whip<00:02:07.660> thrash

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that is this one right here whip thrash

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.300 
that is this one right here whip thrash
so<00:02:10.720> this<00:02:10.899> one<00:02:11.080> requires<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.500> tus<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:11.950> can't<00:02:12.190> do

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
so this one requires a tus I can't do

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.430 
so this one requires a tus I can't do
that<00:02:12.630> go<00:02:13.630> back<00:02:13.870> I'm<00:02:14.080> going<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.260> go<00:02:14.320> into

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that go back I'm going to go into

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.990 
that go back I'm going to go into
support<00:02:14.890> cuz<00:02:15.040> i<00:02:15.100> actually<00:02:15.400> found<00:02:15.550> out<00:02:15.790> that
