00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.880
 it does not have good before we all go to 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.450
 start like this for the beginning in the 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.470
 end of the deaths says that trump goes 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.770
 abandoned the game the game of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.130
 normal game we go 48 25 already we go 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.100
 ahead of the half since they are 75 for 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.440
 this end the game to win the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.600
 true then since I know that and there they go 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.360
 to see the following where is it 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.790
 person who left now as you can see 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.670
 here in what is this screen check 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.590
 the same drum woods that had come out 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.789
 the game says it has changed from 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.829
 first name 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.090
 let's clarify something gentlemen this I 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.800
 I always see this type of ads that 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.390
 when the person leaves the game 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.090
 another one says that the change of 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.440
 name and awkward or I'm not 100% sure if 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.660
 It's some kind of trap 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.789
 simply some message that shows the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.240
 system for the players that we are 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.130
 in pc be drum like it came out simply 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.580
 someone new enters 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.810
 I'm not 100% sure if it means that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.700
 someone can change his name what 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.190
 which I do not think this is like little 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.520
 probable or simply means 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.960
 of a crossing came out and a neymar player or 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.740
 nameless player just got into 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.390
 then the game will look 52 to 28 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.570
 I have a click on that is simply 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.830
 incredible and without realizing where it is 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.100
 cheating this person tell me 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.350
 you if that is this input or what other 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.320
 kind of trap remember that this 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.940
 or machinima creators of this 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.770
 game have said that it will not be allowed 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.810
 no type of game that shows 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.610
 traps or the one that teaches people to 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.830
 cheating I'm just 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.410
 showing him a trap that we have been made 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.570
 race I know nothing more and witness 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.810
 the way this image got into 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.490
 cheating as you can see this there 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.670
 appears in the part of an mplayer that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.740
 has connected and out of nowhere starts this 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.899
 man to kill kill kill kill a 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.620
 impressive way that is can kill 34 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.660
 people in a fraction of a second two 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.610
 seconds an awesome way and 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.320
 I have the click on it that shows it in the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.430
 way that this image I think he did 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.079
 trap 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.120
 and in front simply looks just 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.680
 deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.239
 and from this man there was going to be a 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.849
 description that I'm going to put right now 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.319
 like grabbing kill I do not know how it goes and 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.500
 the truth that is simply 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:40.019
 awesome how this evil cheat 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.019
 but there is an inexplicable double 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.170
 Lakhi Kant turned out to be too 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.359
 too much that I was there when sun and 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.799
 also to listen to my surprise race 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.629
 that is simply playing and 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.200
 I suddenly see this seller that start 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.200
 a death boy 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.859
 is not cheating the man follows the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.030
 feed 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.680
 all the deaths where he all the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.780
 deaths where he with death where he 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.260
 He took a paladin in question as an infringement 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.810
 of 20 seconds and I put on and like that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.030
 want to report all the mom which 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.060
 I do not know if it will have some kind of like 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.790
 I tell you one of results I think it's going to 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.949
 to be like the empty sack nobody goes to 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.440
 do nothing to anyone will matter and comes 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.549
 of check mail the kicker crazy or be I believe 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.139
 that it would have been better if 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.150
 let see all the kilos of this 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.709
 image so that you could simply see the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.530
 lie how he grabbed too many 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.890
 deaths 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.630
 and there's the race test this video does not 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:50.090
 is to teach them to cheat this 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:54.900
 video just to see how 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:04:00.800
 this hate this class is zero test with 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:03.420
 little skills this little honor that 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.530
 there will be a million of this more than 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.310
 you need to cheat because 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.970
 just do not arm it legally 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.610
 that's the only thing I think about this class 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.500
 of people can not play legal 0 before 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.000
 that a complete check you set out to do 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.890
 cheat because legally you do not win or 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.630
 even a zero time cockroach 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.250
 but at the end of the game they finish it 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.690
 winning but put me called a lot the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.120
 attention the way that themes made 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.560
 cheat you like it if you think you're 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.890
 cheating leave your comment if 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.540
