00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.410 
it's a safe by liberty it's turned out
to<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> pretty<00:00:22.740> good<00:00:22.920> deal<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.850> last<00:00:24.090> video

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to be a pretty good deal my last video

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.210 
to be a pretty good deal my last video
was<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.840> ammo<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.890> big<00:00:26.039> enough<00:00:26.510> well

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
was the ammo can is it big enough well

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.020 
was the ammo can is it big enough well
for<00:00:29.220> me<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:30.150> wasn't<00:00:30.359> big<00:00:30.660> enough<00:00:31.880> but<00:00:32.880> that's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
for me it wasn't big enough but that's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.440 
for me it wasn't big enough but that's
okay<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:34.079> freed<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> lot<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> room<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.270> my

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
okay it freed a lot of room up and my

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.619 
okay it freed a lot of room up and my
other<00:00:37.020> safe<00:00:38.180> but<00:00:40.879> here's<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.390> fit

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
other safe but here's what you can fit

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.330 
other safe but here's what you can fit
into<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.700> far<00:00:45.800> on<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.070> side<00:00:47.340> I've<00:00:48.329> got

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
into one so far on this side I've got

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
into one so far on this side I've got
nothing<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.460> 22<00:00:50.820> mags<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.500> this

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
nothing but 22 mags and then on this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.360 
nothing but 22 mags and then on this
side<00:00:52.739> I've<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.989> call<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.739> good<00:00:55.920> ammo

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
side I've got what I call the good ammo

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.430 
side I've got what I call the good ammo
that<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.449> ammo<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.559> sent<00:00:58.890> back<00:00:59.300> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
that is my ammo that I sent back and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.799 
that is my ammo that I sent back and
probably<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.850> won't<00:01:02.850> say<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> won't<00:01:03.210> shoot<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
probably I won't say I won't shoot it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.670 
probably I won't say I won't shoot it
but<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.250> will<00:01:05.250> eventually<00:01:06.260> keep<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.439> building

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
but I will eventually keep on building

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
but I will eventually keep on building
that<00:01:07.890> stock<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.890> next<00:01:11.490> shelf<00:01:11.689> got

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that stock and then the next shelf got

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
that stock and then the next shelf got
what<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> called<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:13.290> clinking<00:01:13.740> rounds<00:01:14.299> that's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
what I called my clinking rounds that's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.510 
what I called my clinking rounds that's
what<00:01:15.540> I'll<00:01:15.689> take<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> shoot<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.250> not

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
what I'll take out and shoot it's not

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
what I'll take out and shoot it's not
that<00:01:17.729> big<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.090> deal<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.509> doesn't<00:01:18.689> cost<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that big of a deal it doesn't cost that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
that big of a deal it doesn't cost that
much<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.680> made<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> is

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
much and it's just made for what it is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.460 
much and it's just made for what it is
and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:24.530> we've<00:01:25.530> got<00:01:26.840> 6,000<00:01:27.840> rounds<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.350> the

probably won't be shooting the 22 TCM
very<00:05:30.760> much<00:05:30.970> versus<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.870> 9<00:05:32.050> millimeter

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
very much versus the 9 millimeter

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.800 
very much versus the 9 millimeter

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:53.169 
having to worry about it
I'm<00:07:51.949> not<00:07:52.159> saying<00:07:52.399> these<00:07:52.550> things<00:07:52.759> can't<00:07:53.059> be

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:53.179 
I'm not saying these things can't be

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.869 
I'm not saying these things can't be
broken<00:07:53.479> into<00:07:53.689> because<00:07:54.139> I<00:07:54.169> can<00:07:54.499> they're<00:07:55.489> not<00:07:55.699> as

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 
broken into because I can they're not as

00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:00.309 
broken into because I can they're not as
safe<00:07:56.409> nor<00:07:57.409> sturdy<00:07:57.800> as<00:07:58.039> the<00:07:58.699> other<00:07:58.939> ones<00:07:59.179> but<00:08:00.019> it

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 
safe nor sturdy as the other ones but it

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.719 
safe nor sturdy as the other ones but it
sure<00:08:00.649> beats<00:08:00.709> the<00:08:01.069> alternative

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:01.729 
sure beats the alternative

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:04.299 
sure beats the alternative
when<00:08:02.119> you<00:08:02.209> get<00:08:02.360> right<00:08:02.509> down<00:08:02.569> to<00:08:02.749> it<00:08:02.959> so<00:08:03.409> you

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:04.309 
when you get right down to it so you

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:06.669 
when you get right down to it so you
guys<00:08:04.489> take<00:08:04.789> care<00:08:05.089> shoot<00:08:05.839> straight<00:08:05.989> and<00:08:06.439> hope

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:06.679 
guys take care shoot straight and hope

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:08.980 
guys take care shoot straight and hope
you<00:08:06.800> find<00:08:07.009> the<00:08:07.219> ammo<00:08:07.369> that<00:08:07.489> you<00:08:07.729> need<00:08:07.939> if<00:08:08.240> not

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:08.990 
you find the ammo that you need if not

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.499 
you find the ammo that you need if not
keep<00:08:09.319> looking<00:08:09.769> because<00:08:09.860> it<00:08:10.129> will<00:08:10.219> come<00:08:10.369> up

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:10.509 
keep looking because it will come up

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:13.509 
keep looking because it will come up
later
