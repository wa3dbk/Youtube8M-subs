00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.680
 hello girls here as you see I already have 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.100
 prepared my hand and the way to 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.100
 sculpture 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.990
 we start preparing always almond 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 well first of all always prepare the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.500
 nail prime the remove cuticle good and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500
 you know 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.670
 I'm making a union in the form 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.370
 of prism or pyramid 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.629
 it's like a kind of way that does the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.440
 nail that is kind of like 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.430
 triangulito and that ends as a point 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.430
 or triangular 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.980
 here we will be careful not to touch the 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.980
 skin 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.550
 or the area of ​​the nail of the hand even though 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.320
 is teaching the drop of art 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.530
 and I made them with coloring 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.240
 You can also make food 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.240
 with nail polishes of some colors 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 and by the way always clean well the 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.979
 brush after using art drops 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.280
 and here I proceed to perform all the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.280
 cooking pot 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.470
 I will do practically all the design 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.470
 with art boots 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.630
 and I'm going to fill in all the form to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.530
 sculptures to the point marking 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.530
 always the pyramidal shape 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.000
 and here always be very careful 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 not to leave it too finite 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.790
 because it can always be too 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.720
 too little marked the color in this 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.220
 I put on enough coloring 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.220
 so that it was not too 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.000
 transparent let's say 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.590
 although I'm finishing stuffings the 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.720
 so that it is a bit chubby 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.250
 and good here I show you the sticks that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.250
 they serve to make the curve c 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.290
 and I'm going to take the smallest one for 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.290
 make some little circles 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.070
 we always put it in acrylic powder 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.460
 to be transparent 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.880
 Even if it's from the nail bed, 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.880
 nothing happens 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.640
 we press lightly taking care 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.140
 not to trespass too much 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.180
 the base that we have already prepared 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.540
 and there you are seeing how the dust is 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.540
 inside 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.500
 and so it also prevents it from taking off 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.380
 the stick 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.370
 to the acrylic that is half dry and 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.370
 destroy jce the design 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.910
 As you can see, I have finished with the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.210
 circulitos and now we wait for it 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.210
 I know that 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.120
 and now I'm going to use three colors on 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.120
 green yellow and red 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.320
 I've used them a little bit randomly 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.840
 the first ones that I've caught in the drawer 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.810
 of the colors 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.120
 we take a very small and wet brush 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.890
 and we proceed to fly it over the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.200
 circles 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.000
 we place them indiscriminately even 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.130
 You can also place the same drawing 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.670
 the same different color in it 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.670
 circle 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.500
 to create different effects 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.620
 then they also have the possibility of 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.130
 Striped with the cuticle pusher 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.669
 goes with any stick that is not already the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.669
 imagination 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.980
 so I would finish placing them 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.050
 always remember that the pearls have 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.509
 to be quite wet 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.940
 because otherwise it will not mark well the 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.940
 little circle or the way you put 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.259
 now we let it dry and start filing 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.090
 being very careful not to 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.090
 take us the drop of art 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.409
 you have to keep in mind that you are not 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.409
 still encapsulated and it's a finite layer 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.910
 and its environment is used like me 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.910
 It may come to the case that you pass 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.330
 here it is finished and we started 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.330
 encapsulate 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.040
 I always capsule with a very 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.300
 chubby 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.300
 this is from collins key 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.890
 and I think it's number 12 or ten, not what 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.890
 I know very well 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.889
 It encapsulates the nail well taking into account 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.020
 the shapes and structure of it 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.849
 so you do not have to file too much 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.240
 having to re -form again the 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.240
 pyramidal shape 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.680
 here is already animated and polished 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.800
 As you can see, the lines of 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.930
 the little circles and the transparency of 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.660
 art boot 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.660
 I'm using a shine of s 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.140
 because he was the one who did not have too 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.140
 I usually use another type of 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.140
 enamel 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.530
 now we place the decoration that in 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.230
 this case I will decorate it with rick 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.660
 stones and I'm going to place 3 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.290
 in pyramid form also continues to form 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.290
 a kind of triangle 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.750
 and now as terms I'll put the photo of 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.750
 finished 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.229
 good girls a kiss and see you next time 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.229
 I leave you watching the photos
