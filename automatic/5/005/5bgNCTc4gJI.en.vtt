00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.640
 hi to all and welcome to this 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.410
 new video games always 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.540
 dedicated to the e3 2014 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.520
 maxim is always next to me and he 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.410
 is a game we were looking forward to 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.869
 to put your hands is yves holmes so 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.990
 the fps of the creators of left for dead 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.490
 so is total rock studio maximum on 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.379
 was eager to play your first 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.059
 impressions about the game ben listens very 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.620
 positive actually this is one of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.370
 games I was expecting a lot from 7.3 to 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.230
 2014 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.000
 we played together more not necessarily 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.390
 in the same part now you knew 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.860
 that I was going then both of us 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.050
 played on the side of humans 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.280
 we did not have the monster in hand so that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.360
 may be the subject of another video 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.760
 a little bit later because as 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.149
 you know they want me to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.969
 to play 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.039
 so it's a game of 4 against 1 4 of 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.950
 hand who team up to fight a 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.469
 huge monster that will be able to evolve to 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.479
 thread over the exact part 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.399
 and in fact the goal is here so the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.990
 humans gets to four so four 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.770
 different characters these four 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.610
 different classes 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 we have the medic the medic we support it 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.350
 we have the solution too and we also 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 I forgot the name finally another 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.479
 character who is there too for good 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.510
 dezero and together they must therefore to 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.580
 both found the monster trapping him and 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.200
 then kill him knowing that the map 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.909
 is already big enough 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.229
 because she 's the size of the monster 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.880
 so already for their father and that's 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.229
 complicated and then must not forget 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.090
 especially since there are other small 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.799
 monsters before coming in here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 fuck a little brothel and prevent 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.159
 precisely reach that big monsters there 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.079
 but it's true that the work of equipped 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.220
 really important so it takes a 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.110
 some coordination 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.820
 I can experience it with 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.380
 the bath a monster that did a little 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.970
 nagging and that did a little bit matter 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.430
 what in two minutes the game 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.770
 was folded but otherwise by the very blow of 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.149
 side of the monster that he too he does 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.649
 call to these different abilities 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.210
 for precisely evolved and then expectations 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.000
 finally his phase iii which actually beats 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.590
 once he reaches phase 3 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.210
 I think he won the party becomes 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.010
 destructible there is the party and 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.140
 actually we see on the screen that has 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.400
 an energy gauge of the monster that is 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.310
 fairly large fairly consistent 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.290
 which means that he can really 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.260
 protect them we take the punches vallat 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.150
 quietly but here it is necessary 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.709
 that he must try for their escape 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.300
 who precisely he goes to hide 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.470
 to evolve because any 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.780
 this phase where they evolve it is 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.250
 vulnerable low cost and no no it's 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.470
 really it's really a next-gen game 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.020
 two parts graphically it's very 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.850
 very beautiful it is a perfect sharpness 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.310
 yeah we played on pc too 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.709
 qualities must be said but no 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.970
 graphically it's very beautiful and then 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.850
 has the game in hand so we can really 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.870
 see how he looks so so voices 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.970
 plus it's a game that will come to 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.590
 october 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.630
 it's pretty fast so they want 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.160
 new licenses for creators of 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.570
 the dead effort with the gameplay a little 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.010
 little asymmetry in the tricolor 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.800
 that's kind of the buzzword in this 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.209
 moment so the wolf coming a game to 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.220
 monitor in my opinion he's likely to do 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.080
 loud noise and in my opinion we risk 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.410
 see it evolve in in the next 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.510
 years 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.060
 the series will not stop I contribute 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.160
 just see all of them 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.690
 rewards that part of the press the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.250
 wall was covered with stick 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.350
 yeah that was it really 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.970
 impressive as so here is flying 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.380
 will monitor closely and then there we 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.540
 will continue to offer you more 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.930
 always live videos from los angeles 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.930
 shout 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.750
 the game 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
