 right now we're going to first 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:59.030
 prepare a a citrus recipe 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.730
 crystallized that valued the shell of 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.920
 citrus fruits crystallized normally 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.840
 we always throw the peels and in 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.620
 this time we are going to occupy them for 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.440
 make a module 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.650
 delicious for this christmas how delicious 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.020
 thank you what we will need first 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.770
 it's going to be a grapefruit 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.350
 two oranges two lemons meet 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.549
 of these yellows better but if not 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.430
 also does not serve green lemons 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.710
 we are going to need 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.920
 a cup with three quarts of sugar 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.130
 white 70 grams of gelatin this is from 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.140
 We can also make strawberry flavor 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.140
 with lemon flavor and that way we 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.150
 are left with the strawberry we are going to 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.010
 get red and if you make it with lemon you 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.650
 they will be green 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.260
 for Christmas, parents can see 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.350
 two in is right now at this moment what 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.680
 let's do with the red ones we're going to 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.510
 occupy a cup and a half of average water 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.060
 cup of corn honey and it's all to see 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.490
 how easy first we are going to remove the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.100
 citrus peel and cut it into 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.830
 strips in a pot we empty the shells 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.350
 and cover with water at high heat 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.900
 we boiled for 5 minutes after 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.450
 we drain we put fresh water back 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.670
 and we serve it for five more minutes 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.220
 we return to drain in a pot part 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.980
 let's combine sugar honey and 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.990
 water and let's bake for three minutes at 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.650
 high heat until sugar 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.380
 dissolve 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.110
 then add the shells and the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.140
 let's cook for 25 minutes until 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.120
 most of the honey has been absorbed 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.270
 wagging constantly we took it out of the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.940
 fire and we added the gelatin and we had 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.100
 until it dissolves let cool 5 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.830
 minutes in a tray with paper 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.230
 waxed we spread sugar 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.030
 and we also put the husks the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.490
 we turn to make them stick 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.310
 the sugar and let it dry good 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.650

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.200
 Crystallized citrus peels go to 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.840
