00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
play with the acoustic sound you also

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.420 
play with the acoustic sound you also
have<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:51.980> stereo<00:00:52.640> plug<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:54.170> go<00:00:54.350> with<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.949> dimarzio

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
have a stereo plug to go with a dimarzio

in<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.210> guitar<00:00:56.540> HAMP<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.019> with<00:00:57.769> a<00:00:57.800> piezo<00:00:58.400> in<00:00:58.610> a

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
in a guitar HAMP and with a piezo in a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.649 
in a guitar HAMP and with a piezo in a
PA<00:00:59.619> but<00:01:00.619> I<00:01:00.860> discover<00:01:01.369> that<00:01:01.580> it's<00:01:01.790> very<00:01:02.299> nice<00:01:02.600> to

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
PA but I discover that it's very nice to

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.880 
PA but I discover that it's very nice to
play<00:01:03.049> also<00:01:03.850> straight<00:01:04.850> with<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.420> mono<00:01:05.720> cable<00:01:06.260> to

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
play also straight with a mono cable to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.520 
play also straight with a mono cable to
the<00:01:06.920> PA<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the PA and this is because of the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.490 
the PA and this is because of the
special<00:01:10.280> circuit<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.150> guitar<00:01:11.600> that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
special circuit of the guitar that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.969 
special circuit of the guitar that
adjusts<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.100> impedance<00:01:13.939> of<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:15.229> hot<00:01:15.500> mini

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
adjusts the impedance of the hot mini

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.820 
adjusts the impedance of the hot mini
bugger<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:17.150> go<00:01:17.299> straight<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.840> PA<00:01:18.110> so

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
bugger to go straight to the PA so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.149 
bugger to go straight to the PA so
here's<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.520> dimarzio<00:01:20.090> alone<00:01:20.450> just<00:01:21.259> straight

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
here's the dimarzio alone just straight

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:47.399 
here's the dimarzio alone just straight
in<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.119> deck

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.840 

and<00:01:48.409> now<00:01:48.560> let's<00:01:48.799> go<00:01:48.979> with<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.250> acoustic<00:01:49.640> so

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
and now let's go with the acoustic so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:02:11.960 
and now let's go with the acoustic so
this<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.479> piezo<00:01:51.020> breach<00:01:51.530> alone

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.280 

impressive<00:02:12.970> isn't<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.680> now<00:02:14.680> both<00:02:15.610> together<00:02:16.290> so

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
impressive isn't it now both together so

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:43.920 
impressive isn't it now both together so
with<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.180> three-way<00:02:19.180> switch

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.350 

this<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.080> an<00:02:45.230> extremely<00:02:45.890> dynamic<00:02:46.360> instrument

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
this is an extremely dynamic instrument

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.990 
this is an extremely dynamic instrument
and<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.570> response<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.070> piezo<00:02:49.370> bridge<00:02:49.700> is

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and the response of the piezo bridge is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.580 
and the response of the piezo bridge is
simply<00:02:50.450> amazing<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.710> can<00:02:51.950> play<00:02:52.190> hard<00:02:52.730> without

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
simply amazing you can play hard without

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:06.280 
simply amazing you can play hard without
distorting<00:02:54.590> it<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.820> at<00:03:05.090> least<00:03:05.240> twice<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
distorting it so at least twice the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.140 
distorting it so at least twice the
dynamic<00:03:06.500> range<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.250> regular<00:03:07.430> wood<00:03:07.790> guitar

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
dynamic range of a regular wood guitar

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.140 
dynamic range of a regular wood guitar
the<00:03:08.960> controls<00:03:09.410> are<00:03:09.560> very<00:03:09.620> simple<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:11.030> a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
the controls are very simple you have a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870 
the controls are very simple you have a
volume<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.960> tone<00:03:12.320> control<00:03:13.010> for<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.340> DeMars<00:03:13.730> a

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
volume and tone control for the DeMars a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.270 
volume and tone control for the DeMars a
pickup<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.870> volume<00:03:15.110> control<00:03:15.260> for<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:16.010> piezo

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
pickup in a volume control for the piezo

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.780 
pickup in a volume control for the piezo
bridge<00:03:16.660> then<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:18.080> can<00:03:18.260> choose<00:03:18.470> between<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
bridge then you can choose between the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.980 
bridge then you can choose between the
pickup's<00:03:20.180> with<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> three-way<00:03:21.440> switch<00:03:22.340> and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
pickup's with a three-way switch and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.850 
pickup's with a three-way switch and
then<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.230> have<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.560> mid<00:03:25.400> boost<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.500> piezo

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
then you have a mid boost for the piezo

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.500 
then you have a mid boost for the piezo
bridge<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:29.210> mid<00:03:29.450> boost<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:30.320> increase<00:03:30.830> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
bridge the mid boost just increase the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.930 
bridge the mid boost just increase the
bottom<00:03:32.510> hand<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.110> sound<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:34.130> here's

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
bottom hand of the sound so here's

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.680 
bottom hand of the sound so here's
without

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.940 

and<00:03:40.690> here<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.590> with

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.970 

you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:00.470 

look<00:03:50.980> again<00:03:51.250> without<00:03:55.260> with

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:12.570 

and<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.260> just<00:04:01.620> add<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.720> dimarzio<00:04:04.290> as<00:04:04.409> well

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:25.980 

just<00:04:13.580> can't<00:04:13.820> stop

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.129 

you

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.870 

another<00:04:33.139> interesting<00:04:33.560> way<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.220> use<00:04:34.610> this

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
another interesting way to use this

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.060 
another interesting way to use this
guitar<00:04:35.330> is<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:37.460> close<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.780> tone<00:04:39.020> control<00:04:39.500> that

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
guitar is to close the tone control that

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.150 
guitar is to close the tone control that
by<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.280> way<00:04:40.580> feature<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:42.259> common<00:04:42.680> Horan's

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
by the way feature the common Horan's

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.390 
by the way feature the common Horan's
drop<00:04:43.520> big<00:04:44.000> capacitor<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.530> basically<00:04:45.800> closed

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
drop big capacitor so I basically closed

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.170 
drop big capacitor so I basically closed
the<00:04:46.940> tone<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:48.530> just<00:04:48.740> add<00:04:48.949> a<00:04:49.400> little<00:04:49.850> bit<00:04:50.120> of

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
the tone and I just add a little bit of

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.750 
the tone and I just add a little bit of
the<00:04:50.570> piezo<00:04:50.870> bridge<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.180> without

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.620 

she<00:04:57.390> uh
