hardware interface now you can see it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
hardware interface now you can see it
sort<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> resembles<00:00:58.890> some<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> beat<00:00:59.460> boxes

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
sort of resembles some of the beat boxes

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
sort of resembles some of the beat boxes
like<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.149> MPC<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.840> something<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
like an MPC or something like that you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
like an MPC or something like that you
might<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.710> seen<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> past<00:01:02.250> obviously

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000

one<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> great<00:01:03.390> things<00:01:03.539> about<00:01:03.600> machine<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
one of the great things about machine is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
one of the great things about machine is
that<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.559> utilizes<00:01:05.220> computer<00:01:05.820> software<00:01:06.240> in

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that it utilizes computer software in

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.750 
that it utilizes computer software in
order<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.380> dogs<00:01:07.890> processing<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.610> you've<00:01:08.729> got

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
order to dogs processing so you've got

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.960 
order to dogs processing so you've got
access<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.210> far<00:01:10.200> greater<00:01:10.229> cpu<00:01:11.010> ram<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> hard

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
access to far greater cpu ram and hard

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.310 
access to far greater cpu ram and hard
drive<00:01:12.210> space<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> would<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.110> an

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
drive space and you would have on an

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.630 
drive space and you would have on an
external<00:01:13.590> piece<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.010> gear<00:01:14.159> everything<00:01:14.580> you

what<00:02:16.860> I've<00:02:16.950> done<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.129> just<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.640> save<00:02:17.819> some<00:02:18.000> time

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
what I've done is just to save some time

what I've done is just to save some time
I've<00:02:18.209> loaded<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:19.500> few<00:02:20.040> sounds<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
I've loaded in a few sounds here and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.180 
I've loaded in a few sounds here and
what<00:02:22.470> we'll<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.739> we'll<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> quick<00:02:23.160> look

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
what we'll do is we'll have a quick look

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.290 
what we'll do is we'll have a quick look
at<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.430> two<00:02:23.550> different<00:02:23.819> ways<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.120> can

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
at the two different ways that you can

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.790 
at the two different ways that you can
sequence<00:02:24.599> with<00:02:24.840> your<00:02:24.989> machine<00:02:25.080> first<00:02:25.650> thing

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
sequence with your machine first thing

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
sequence with your machine first thing
that<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.190> love<00:02:26.459> about<00:02:26.610> machine<00:02:27.060> that

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that I really love about machine that

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.720 
that I really love about machine that
I've<00:02:27.629> missed<00:02:28.170> greatly<00:02:28.349> from<00:02:28.769> my<00:02:29.459> time<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
I've missed greatly from my time is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.880 
I've missed greatly from my time is
working<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.150> hardware<00:02:30.810> units<00:02:31.049> like<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.349> npcs

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
working on hardware units like the npcs

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.890 
working on hardware units like the npcs
is<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.489> ability<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.940> step<00:02:33.150> sequence<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:33.780> so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
is the ability to step sequence and so

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.089 
is the ability to step sequence and so
over<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.319> you've<00:02:34.440> got<00:02:34.500> these<00:02:34.709> two<00:02:34.920> modes

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
over here you've got these two modes

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.280 
over here you've got these two modes
here<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.940> normal<00:02:36.360> mode<00:02:36.480> control<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.019> sort

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
here in normal mode control I can sort

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.020 
here in normal mode control I can sort
of<00:02:37.319> pick<00:02:37.470> these<00:02:37.650> sounds<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.730> select

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
of pick these sounds and I can select

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.339 
of pick these sounds and I can select
any<00:02:39.120> sound<00:02:39.450> whatever<00:02:39.629> sound<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.140> last

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
any sound whatever sound is last

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.470 
any sound whatever sound is last
selected<00:02:40.680> will<00:02:41.250> stay<00:02:41.430> highlighted<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.030> then

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
selected will stay highlighted and then

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.150 
selected will stay highlighted and then
if<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.660> move<00:02:42.840> over<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.470> two-step<00:02:44.010> sequence

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
if I move over here in two-step sequence

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.789 
if I move over here in two-step sequence
mode<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.790> hit<00:02:44.940> play<00:02:45.349> over<00:02:46.349> here<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> can<00:02:46.769> choose

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
mode and hit play over here I can choose

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.620 
mode and hit play over here I can choose
the<00:02:47.040> length<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.730> pattern<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.269> can<00:02:48.420> see

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
the length of a pattern and you can see

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.229 
the length of a pattern and you can see
now<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:49.500> represents<00:02:49.640> your<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:50.940> four

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
now this just represents your for four

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.380 
now this just represents your for four
beats<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.349> if<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.130> go<00:02:53.280> back<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> pick<00:02:54.269> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
beats so if if I go back here I pick the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.270 
beats so if if I go back here I pick the
sound<00:02:54.630> I'm<00:02:54.750> after<00:02:54.930> click<00:02:55.560> under<00:02:55.829> here<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.069> I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
sound I'm after click under here and I

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.250 
sound I'm after click under here and I
can<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:57.000> drop<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.079> kick

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
can just I can just drop in for kick

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.630 
can just I can just drop in for kick
drums<00:02:58.530> now<00:02:58.769> I'm<00:02:58.890> able<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.280> change<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
drums now I'm able to change the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.839 
drums now I'm able to change the
velocity<00:02:59.730> of<00:03:00.180> these<00:03:00.360> kick<00:03:00.599> drums<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.849> if

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
velocity of these kick drums here so if

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.059 
velocity of these kick drums here so if
I<00:03:03.030> wanted<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.450> say<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.140> role<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.470> example

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
I wanted to say to a role for example

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.500 
I wanted to say to a role for example
you<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.310> see<00:03:05.489> over<00:03:05.760> here<00:03:05.790> I've<00:03:06.060> got<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> low

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
you can see over here I've got a low

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.509 
you can see over here I've got a low
velocity<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.230> as<00:03:07.560> I'm<00:03:07.739> putting<00:03:07.950> them<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.280> I'm

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
velocity and as I'm putting them in I'm

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.150 
velocity and as I'm putting them in I'm
just<00:03:08.730> increasing<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.360> velocity<00:03:09.480> level<00:03:10.170> which

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
just increasing the velocity level which

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.520 
just increasing the velocity level which
is<00:03:11.190> giving<00:03:11.670> me<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:12.629> nice<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.829> nice<00:03:15.200> rolling<00:03:16.200> kick

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
is giving me a nice a nice rolling kick

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.080 
is giving me a nice a nice rolling kick
drum<00:03:16.739> now<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.340> can<00:03:17.459> all<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.609> might<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.000> also

drum now you can all you might have also

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.449 
drum now you can all you might have also
heard<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.389> it's<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:18.959> layer<00:03:19.170> machine<00:03:19.530> has<00:03:19.739> an

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
heard that it's one layer machine has an

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.349 
heard that it's one layer machine has an
overall<00:03:21.139> swing<00:03:22.139> control<00:03:22.530> here<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.239> any

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
overall swing control here so for any

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.690 
overall swing control here so for any
sort<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.690> techno<00:03:25.530> electro<00:03:26.069> any<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.310> those<00:03:26.400> kind

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
sort of techno electro any of those kind

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.430 
sort of techno electro any of those kind
of<00:03:26.790> 44<00:03:27.239> musics<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.810> great<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.109> can<00:03:28.230> really

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
of 44 musics it's great you can really

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.839 
of 44 musics it's great you can really
sort<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.739> crank<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.069> up<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.400> about<00:03:29.549> up<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
sort of crank that up so about up to

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.430 
sort of crank that up so about up to
about<00:03:29.970> fifty<00:03:30.329> percent<00:03:30.359> what<00:03:31.049> we'll<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.319> is

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
about fifty percent what we'll do is

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.990 
about fifty percent what we'll do is
we'll<00:03:31.590> we'll<00:03:31.920> start<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.250> throw<00:03:32.639> in<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.819> kick

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
we'll we'll start to throw in a kick

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.839 
we'll we'll start to throw in a kick
drum<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.930> put<00:03:34.319> that<00:03:34.349> in<00:03:34.620> here<00:03:35.190> at<00:03:35.310> probably

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
drum so I put that in here at probably

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.099 
drum so I put that in here at probably
not<00:03:36.000> full<00:03:36.209> velocity<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.720> probably<00:03:36.930> leave<00:03:37.079> a

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
not full velocity you probably leave a

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.509 
not full velocity you probably leave a
little<00:03:37.200> bit<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.500> velocity<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.099> some<00:03:38.250> Headroom

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
little bit of velocity so some Headroom

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.309 
little bit of velocity so some Headroom
if<00:03:38.639> I<00:03:38.730> want<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:38.940> turn<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> up<00:03:39.239> later<00:03:39.480> now<00:03:40.139> if<00:03:40.230> i

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
if I want to turn it up later now if i

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.379 
if I want to turn it up later now if i
want<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.560> make<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:41.609> length<00:03:41.819> of<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> pattern

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
want to make the length of the pattern

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.750 
want to make the length of the pattern
longer<00:03:42.720> than<00:03:42.900> one<00:03:43.829> bar<00:03:44.040> just<00:03:44.340> like<00:03:44.459> an

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
longer than one bar just like an

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.089 
longer than one bar just like an
increase<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.540> any<00:03:46.139> lengths<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.980> can

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
increase this to any lengths and you can

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.949 
increase this to any lengths and you can
see<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.489> increase<00:03:47.669> this<00:03:48.060> over<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:48.840> this

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
see as I increase this over here this

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.690 
see as I increase this over here this
allows<00:03:49.260> me<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.470> select<00:03:49.650> between<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:50.250> two<00:03:50.430> the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
allows me to select between the two the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.580 
allows me to select between the two the
two<00:03:50.730> halves<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> pattern<00:03:51.599> so<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.169> might

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
two halves of the pattern so I might

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.589 
two halves of the pattern so I might
just<00:03:52.769> pop<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.280> pop<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.209> couple<00:03:54.450> of

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
just pop that in there pop a couple of

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.569 
just pop that in there pop a couple of
kicks<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.959> there<00:03:55.200> might<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.130> drop<00:03:56.280> one<00:03:56.459> in

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
kicks in there might just drop one in

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.759 
kicks in there might just drop one in
there<00:03:56.700> like<00:03:56.819> this<00:03:56.970> cool<00:03:57.419> I<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:58.169> back<00:03:58.349> into<00:03:58.530> here

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
there like this cool I go back into here

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.909 
there like this cool I go back into here
I<00:03:58.799> can<00:03:59.040> kick<00:03:59.880> my<00:04:00.090> little<00:04:00.569> clap<00:04:00.750> there<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.260> just

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
I can kick my little clap there and just

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.180 
I can kick my little clap there and just
pop<00:04:02.370> them<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.700> where<00:04:03.060> I'm<00:04:03.180> after<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.590> you'll

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
pop them in where I'm after so you'll

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.030 
pop them in where I'm after so you'll
see<00:04:05.690> that's<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.959> first<00:04:07.200> half<00:04:07.440> there<00:04:07.829> and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
see that's in the first half there and

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.069 
see that's in the first half there and
then<00:04:08.819> it's<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.269> second<00:04:09.630> half<00:04:09.780> they're

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
then it's in the second half they're

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.890 
then it's in the second half they're
cool<00:04:10.530> now<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.370> fun<00:04:12.060> part<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:12.540> begins

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
cool now the fun part really begins

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.720 
cool now the fun part really begins
where<00:04:13.109> we<00:04:13.260> can<00:04:13.410> start<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.769> real<00:04:14.130> time<00:04:14.160> record

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
where we can start to real time record

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.199 
where we can start to real time record
thing<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.329> as<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.470> go<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.769> here<00:04:17.070> you'll<00:04:17.970> see<00:04:18.090> I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
thing so as I go in here you'll see I

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.020 
thing so as I go in here you'll see I
can<00:04:19.160> cycle<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.220> all<00:04:20.310> these<00:04:20.430> different<00:04:20.609> sounds

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
can cycle it all these different sounds

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.459 
can cycle it all these different sounds
here<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.359> campaign<00:04:21.719> and<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.019> real<00:04:22.440> time

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
here that I campaign and to real time

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.320 
here that I campaign and to real time
record<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.070> literally<00:04:23.280> just<00:04:23.490> hit<00:04:23.849> record<00:04:24.240> and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
record you literally just hit record and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.310 
record you literally just hit record and
played<00:04:25.110> in<00:04:25.260> where<00:04:25.409> you're<00:04:25.530> after<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:30.289> cool<00:04:31.289> now

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
played in where you're after so cool now

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.930 
played in where you're after so cool now
you<00:04:31.950> might<00:04:32.099> have<00:04:32.219> a<00:04:32.280> look<00:04:32.400> at<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.550> screen<00:04:32.789> and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
you might have a look at the screen and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.940 
you might have a look at the screen and
see<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.240> I'm<00:04:33.330> not<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> robot<00:04:34.349> so<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.770> haven't

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
see that I'm not a robot so I haven't

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.350 
see that I'm not a robot so I haven't
managed<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.370> play<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.580> perfectly<00:04:35.729> in<00:04:36.150> time

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
managed to play it perfectly in time

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.320 
managed to play it perfectly in time
machine<00:04:36.930> allows<00:04:37.140> for<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:37.770> got<00:04:37.919> a

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
machine allows for that it's got a

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.339 
machine allows for that it's got a
quantized<00:04:39.330> built<00:04:39.599> into<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:39.960> can<00:04:40.080> quantize

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
quantized built into it you can quantize

quantized built into it you can quantize
by<00:04:40.530> fifty<00:04:40.860> percent<00:04:41.010> which<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.640> see<00:04:41.880> it's

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
bringing it Evers ever so slightly back

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.520 
bringing it Evers ever so slightly back
to<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:45.539> where<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:45.900> should<00:04:45.930> be<00:04:46.080> but<00:04:46.320> if<00:04:46.440> you

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
to to where it should be but if you

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.260 
to to where it should be but if you
quantize<00:04:46.979> it'll<00:04:47.280> lock<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.490> right<00:04:47.640> on<00:04:47.760> one<00:04:48.180> of

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
quantize it'll lock it right on one of

quantize it'll lock it right on one of
my<00:04:48.360> favorite<00:04:48.750> things<00:04:48.930> about<00:04:48.990> machine<00:04:49.440> though

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
my favorite things about machine though

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.320 
my favorite things about machine though
is<00:04:49.950> if<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.520> go<00:04:50.669> into<00:04:50.820> here<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.210> actually

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
is if you go into here you can actually

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.450 
is if you go into here you can actually
set<00:04:51.690> quantized<00:04:52.169> automatically<00:04:53.070> always

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
set quantized automatically always

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.890 
set quantized automatically always
quantized<00:04:53.909> which<00:04:54.090> means<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.360> can't<00:04:54.570> play<00:04:54.750> out

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
quantized which means you can't play out

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.510 
quantized which means you can't play out
of<00:04:55.020> time<00:04:55.200> now<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.440> lock<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.919> whatever<00:04:56.310> greed

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
of time now to lock to whatever greed

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:06.940 
of time now to lock to whatever greed
you<00:04:56.610> set<00:04:56.789> up<00:04:56.880> this<00:04:57.060> case<00:04:57.300> sixteenth<00:04:57.750> notes<00:04:58.020> oh

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950
