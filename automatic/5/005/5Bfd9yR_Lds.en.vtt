doesn't like mineral foundation it's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.930 
doesn't like mineral foundation it's
usually<00:03:36.070> because<00:03:36.190> they're<00:03:36.430> not<00:03:36.550> putting<00:03:36.850> it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
usually because they're not putting it

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.480 
usually because they're not putting it
on<00:03:37.000> correctly<00:03:37.240> so<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.260> start<00:03:38.770> in<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.040> outside

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490

area and you swirl it vigorously I mean

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.910 
area and you swirl it vigorously I mean
you<00:03:44.860> gotta<00:03:45.280> rub<00:03:45.490> it<00:03:45.610> because<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> point<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.110> to

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
you gotta rub it because the point is to

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.830 
you gotta rub it because the point is to
heat<00:03:48.370> up<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:49.570> product<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:51.550> really<00:03:52.300> blend<00:03:52.660> it
