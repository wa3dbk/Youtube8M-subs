00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
well and so one thing that I do

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
well and so one thing that I do
recommend<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> either<00:01:57.360> department

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
recommend is going to either department

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.770 
recommend is going to either department
store<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.579> skin<00:01:59.969> care<00:02:00.180> center<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> get

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
store or to a skin care center to get

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.830 
store or to a skin care center to get
color<00:02:01.049> match<00:02:01.290> okay<00:02:01.770> because<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.610> hard<00:02:03.060> very

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
color match okay because it is hard very

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
color match okay because it is hard very
difficult<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.649> match<00:02:04.860> colors<00:02:05.340> yeah<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.729> then

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
difficult to match colors yeah and then

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.920 
difficult to match colors yeah and then
like<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.329> fair<00:02:06.600> skin

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
like if you have fair skin

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.999 
like if you have fair skin
I'm<00:02:07.200> sure<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.590> even<00:02:07.799> more<00:02:07.950> challenging

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
I'm sure it's even more challenging

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.040 
I'm sure it's even more challenging
