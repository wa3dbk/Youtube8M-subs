this<00:00:14.940> model<00:00:15.360> today<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.809> our<00:00:16.410> Spitfire<00:00:17.039> okay<00:00:17.880> we

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this model today is our Spitfire okay we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.480 
this model today is our Spitfire okay we
make<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.020> three<00:00:19.199> flavors<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.920> make<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> cocoa

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
make it in three flavors we make a cocoa

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.929 
make it in three flavors we make a cocoa
bola<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> brass<00:00:21.480> band<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.410> make<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.939> diamond

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
bola with a brass band we make a diamond

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.980 
bola with a brass band we make a diamond
wood<00:00:24.269> blue<00:00:25.430> bean<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.820> both<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> those<00:00:27.689> have

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
wood blue bean and both of those have

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.400 
wood blue bean and both of those have
brass<00:00:28.859> bands<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.779> these<00:00:30.779> calls

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
brass bands and these calls

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
brass bands and these calls
besides<00:00:32.369> being<00:00:32.730> short<00:00:33.120> barrel<00:00:33.480> there's<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
besides being short barrel there's a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.350 
besides being short barrel there's a
reason<00:00:34.350> why<00:00:34.649> these<00:00:35.190> little<00:00:35.610> barrels<00:00:35.910> make<00:00:36.180> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
reason why these little barrels make it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.430 
reason why these little barrels make it
much<00:00:36.870> easier<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.739> every<00:00:38.640> level<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.149> caller<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
much easier for every level of caller to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.619 
much easier for every level of caller to
effectively<00:00:41.129> operate<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.879> call<00:00:42.149> they're<00:00:42.390> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
effectively operate this call they're so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.959 
effectively operate this call they're so
easy<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> operate<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:44.040> small<00:00:44.670> barrel

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
easy to operate because a small barrel

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.080 
easy to operate because a small barrel
less<00:00:45.809> air<00:00:46.110> has<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.010> controlled<00:00:47.340> inside<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
less air has to be controlled inside of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.930 
less air has to be controlled inside of
them<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> call<00:00:48.840> operate<00:00:49.500> properly

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
them to make the call operate properly

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.340 
them to make the call operate properly
okay<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.199> talking

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
okay this one here that we're talking

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.150 
okay this one here that we're talking

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
well it sort of looks like a single read

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
well it sort of looks like a single read
so<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.689> started<00:01:13.020> calling<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> sort<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so we started calling it a sort of
