00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and hi guys very small introduction 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.519
 this is a new series I will call it 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.099
 because their fantasy anyway 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.889
 I will call criticism yms I will not tell 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.640
 no pasta crises but I'll do some gameplay 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.130
 on games we say deriving from the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.519
 krypi for example supermario punto exe 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.730
 tales punto exe and so on 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.250
 I will look for any game on the internet 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.040
 let's say scary because most of the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 sometimes they make me laugh anyway I'll try 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.219
 these games and I'll make videos in this one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 however, the new game today 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.860
 which I will do for you and supermario point exe 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.050
 I don't know if it's a good game, I never have it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.219
 tried but sees go screenshot 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.460
 always a real good bitch anyway 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.460
 vision 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.020
 hi guys this supermario point here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.780
 exe 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.880
 I would call it super abortion point ex 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.560
 however it does nothing 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.570
 We are the gameplay I never have 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 tried however to see already from the menu 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.460
 main always if you can call 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 so it seems like a big bullshit anyway 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 we press enter 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 ok ok better and luigi 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 it is not up to marco on the floor who is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.930
 he then created spa shots and bars that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.590
 shit 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.509
 in passing he also has supermario that 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.509
 it's really bad and now that 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.100
 bathroom is badly taken we run away from 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.380
 mario never ever never why he cries 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.590
 louis no sound nor anything then has 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.900
 badly done but she my mom yes 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.550
 I will be able to send the game 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.100
 decently I and what the fuck I have to do 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:12.739
 send space bar to a few bars 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:15.560
 space that fuck because louis hall 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.540
 I did not understand a female scream 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.510
 and why Mario attracted an umbrella 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.170
 we don't know how we do it anyway 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.930
 guario ok 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.670
 beautiful too he goes very jerky 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.850
 epic music what should I do now though 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.260
 ok what the fuck 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.940
 there is mario there is mario there is mario and that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.230
 fucking fuck i gotta do you hear i 'm 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.230
 crushing everything 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.110
 and daje 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:04.150
 and damn it the game came out ok I'm in 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.099
 for a moment we see each other in the same 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 piece of first 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.120
 ok only is not the same identical 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.310
 point of before but nothing changes I am 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.760
 of one crushing 50 rates I hope that 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.170
 the game doesn't come out bad luck I don't know 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:27.540
 what the fuck to do crush z not not 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.099
 they do nothing wide damn 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.900
 Mammamia is waiting for some time 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.540
 obviously I cut the time I wait 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.579
 then then they always give us here look 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.950
 about 5 minutes 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.230
 ok it's been five minutes have been 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.569
 the most infinite five minutes of the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.959
 my life and the game remains planted here 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.299
 I don't know if by chance the creator has not 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.010
 created the next level but I suppose 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.440
 yes i really am supermario point exe 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.660
 and really a really hummer given 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.569
 they had to call it the super abortion point 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.209
 ex because it's really crap 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.120

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.200

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.319
 filling does not even know how much he holds 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.849
 36 megs seems like that to me anyway 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.310
 it doesn't take much as a game though if 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.859

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.030
