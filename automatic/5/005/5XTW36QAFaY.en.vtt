00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.700 

now<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.090> don't<00:00:15.360> know<00:00:15.510> about<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:16.500> you've

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
now I don't know about you but if you've

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.640 
now I don't know about you but if you've
got<00:00:16.860> big<00:00:17.130> ham<00:00:17.430> fisted<00:00:17.700> hands<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.450> me<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.930> find

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
got big ham fisted hands like me I find

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.470 
got big ham fisted hands like me I find
that<00:00:19.920> too<00:00:20.340> small<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.820> really<00:00:21.029> hold<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.360> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
that too small to really hold on to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.940 
that too small to really hold on to
especially<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:22.020> using<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> bigger

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
especially if using one of the bigger

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.900 
especially if using one of the bigger
lenses<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> 12<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.180> 50<00:00:24.540> mil<00:00:24.720> video<00:00:25.439> lens

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
lenses like the 12 to 50 mil video lens

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.180 
lenses like the 12 to 50 mil video lens
using<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> optional<00:00:27.600> grip<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.170> think<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.770> well

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
using the optional grip I think is well

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.250 
using the optional grip I think is well
for<00:00:29.430> me<00:00:29.520> anyway<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.119> an<00:00:30.240> absolute<00:00:30.660> must

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
for me anyway it's an absolute must

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990 
for me anyway it's an absolute must
it's<00:00:31.680> um<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.340> an<00:00:32.460> interesting<00:00:32.850> design

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's um it's an interesting design

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.720 
it's um it's an interesting design
compared<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:34.020> DSLR<00:00:34.739> type<00:00:35.160> groups<00:00:35.400> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
compared to your DSLR type groups it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
compared to your DSLR type groups it
actually<00:00:36.030> comes<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.449> two<00:00:36.600> pieces<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
actually comes in two pieces so you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.340 
actually comes in two pieces so you
screw<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> bottom<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:39.780> main<00:00:40.140> one

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
screw on to the bottom this main one

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350 
screw on to the bottom this main one
which<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.220> grip<00:00:41.550> part<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.150> not<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
which is the grip part it's not a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
which is the grip part it's not a
battery<00:00:42.629> grip<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> grip<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.339> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
battery grip it's just a grip but it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.890 
battery grip it's just a grip but it
does<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.970> terminals<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.659> gives<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
does have the terminals and it gives you

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.040 
does have the terminals and it gives you
this<00:00:46.050> extra<00:00:46.290> dial<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.640> shutter<00:00:48.570> button<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
this extra dial and shutter button and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.500 
this extra dial and shutter button and
for<00:00:49.920> me<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.280> far<00:00:50.760> far<00:00:51.150> far<00:00:51.479> more

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
for me that's far far far more

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.750 
for me that's far far far more
comfortable<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.470> shoot<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.920> than<00:00:53.430> just

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
comfortable to shoot with than just

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.299 
comfortable to shoot with than just
using<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.269> little<00:00:54.449> ordinary<00:00:55.140> grip<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.769> then

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
using the little ordinary grip and then

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
using the little ordinary grip and then
it<00:00:56.610> comes<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.269> battery<00:00:57.629> compartment

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it comes with the battery compartment

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.590 
it comes with the battery compartment
which<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:58.890> separate<00:00:59.460> item<00:00:59.879> which

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
which is actually a separate item which

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
which is actually a separate item which
then<00:01:00.839> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.530> screw<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:01.979> to<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> bottom<00:01:02.670> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
then you can screw on to the bottom of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.390 
then you can screw on to the bottom of
the<00:01:03.120> grip<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.440> make<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:04.650> screw<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the grip you can make a screw on the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.149 
the grip you can make a screw on the
battery<00:01:05.970> part<00:01:06.240> thereby<00:01:06.720> making<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.530> battery

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
battery part thereby making it a battery

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670 
battery part thereby making it a battery
grip<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.840> some<00:01:10.140> people<00:01:10.290> love<00:01:10.560> to

professional<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.780> personally<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
professional I personally think that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
professional I personally think that
looks<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.979> little<00:01:14.070> bit<00:01:14.280> ridiculous<00:01:14.880> especially

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
looks a little bit ridiculous especially

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.900 
looks a little bit ridiculous especially
for<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> sort<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.050> a<00:01:16.170> camera<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.740> wouldn't<00:01:17.670> use

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
for this sort of a camera I wouldn't use

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.980 
for this sort of a camera I wouldn't use
it<00:01:17.940> I<00:01:19.070> will<00:01:20.070> definitely<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.850> using<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.480> actual

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it I will definitely be using the actual

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
it I will definitely be using the actual
grip<00:01:22.410> part<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> battery<00:01:23.670> grip<00:01:23.910> which

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
grip part but the battery grip which

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
grip part but the battery grip which
takes<00:01:24.420> an<00:01:24.690> additional<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.650> their<00:01:25.920> their

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
takes an additional one of their their

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.850 
takes an additional one of their their
standard<00:01:26.730> batteries<00:01:27.120> in<00:01:27.300> there<00:01:27.510> I<00:01:27.750> am<00:01:28.590> gonna

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
standard batteries in there I am gonna

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
standard batteries in there I am gonna
pass<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.580> it's<00:01:30.090> nice<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.480> have<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> extra

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
pass on it's nice to have the extra

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.480 
pass on it's nice to have the extra
buttons<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.620> shooting<00:01:31.800> in<00:01:32.040> portrait

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
buttons if you're shooting in portrait

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.430 
buttons if you're shooting in portrait
mode<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.300> I<00:01:33.570> don't<00:01:33.870> think<00:01:34.080> it's<00:01:34.200> really

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
mode but I don't think it's really

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.080 
mode but I don't think it's really
necessary<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.490> sort<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.790> camera<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
necessary for this sort of a camera the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.640 
necessary for this sort of a camera the
way<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:36.810> use<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.080> anyway<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.440> if

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
