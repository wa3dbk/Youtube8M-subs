00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
plan which really sort of spirited me

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.190 
plan which really sort of spirited me
that<00:02:15.910> there<00:02:16.090> might<00:02:16.270> really<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.660> something<00:02:16.900> to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
that there might really be something to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.810 
that there might really be something to
this<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.770> reason<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.130> focused<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.610> heart

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
this the reason I focused on heart

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.150 
this the reason I focused on heart
disease<00:02:18.910> was<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.720> said<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.020> thought<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.740> could<00:02:21.010> get

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
disease was I said I thought I could get

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.980 
disease was I said I thought I could get
much<00:02:21.490> more<00:02:22.000> rapid<00:02:22.720> results<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
much more rapid results and here was the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.770 
much more rapid results and here was the
most<00:02:26.230> come<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.820> was<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> disease<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.510> was

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
most come this was a disease that was

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.170 
most come this was a disease that was
actually<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:30.040> number<00:02:30.310> one<00:02:30.460> killer<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.940> women

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
actually the number one killer of women

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.000 
actually the number one killer of women
and<00:02:31.540> men<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.720> Western<00:02:32.170> civilization<00:02:32.500> was

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
and men in Western civilization was

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.710 
and men in Western civilization was
Charlie<00:02:33.700> vascular<00:02:34.120> disease<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:36.720> would

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
Charlie vascular disease and it would

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.540 
Charlie vascular disease and it would
really<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> lot<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.530> bang<00:02:38.860> for<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.160> buck<00:02:39.190> if

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
really be a lot of bang for the buck if

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.390 
really be a lot of bang for the buck if
we<00:02:39.670> could<00:02:39.820> show<00:02:40.060> within<00:02:40.750> maybe<00:02:41.470> 12<00:02:41.830> months<00:02:42.310> or

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
we could show within maybe 12 months or

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.260 
we could show within maybe 12 months or
24<00:02:42.580> months<00:02:42.850> or<00:02:43.750> even<00:02:43.810> shorter<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:45.270> maybe

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
24 months or even shorter that maybe

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.670 
24 months or even shorter that maybe
there<00:02:46.480> was<00:02:46.600> some<00:02:46.780> possibility<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.560> either

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
there was some possibility of either

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.040 
there was some possibility of either
halting<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.850> disease<00:02:49.270> progression<00:02:49.690> or

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
halting this disease progression or

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.850 
halting this disease progression or
perhaps<00:02:51.780> about<00:02:52.780> even<00:02:53.080> reversing<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:55.860> talked

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
perhaps about even reversing it I talked

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.620 
perhaps about even reversing it I talked
with<00:02:56.890> my<00:02:57.100> wife<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.730> after<00:02:58.030> she<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.390> had

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
with my wife and after she and I had

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.490 
with my wife and after she and I had
done<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.960> for<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> year<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.930> felt<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.170> was<00:03:02.290> time

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
done this for a year I felt it was time

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.800 
done this for a year I felt it was time
to<00:03:02.770> go<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.460> cardiology<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.270> see<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.600> could

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
to go to cardiology and see if I could

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.300 
to go to cardiology and see if I could
get<00:03:04.960> maybe<00:03:05.350> 24<00:03:05.920> patients<00:03:06.460> and<00:03:08.310> they

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
get maybe 24 patients and they

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.490 
get maybe 24 patients and they
graciously<00:03:09.820> let<00:03:10.720> me<00:03:10.870> speak<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.380> the

compliance was I sort of grasped the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.360 
compliance was I sort of grasped the
mantra<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:59.440> same<00:03:59.709> mantra<00:03:59.980> for<00:04:00.220> these

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
mantra the same mantra for these

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.890 
mantra the same mantra for these
patients<00:04:00.610> that<00:04:00.940> I'd<00:04:01.030> use<00:04:01.270> for<00:04:01.300> my<00:04:01.630> cancer

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900

patients that I'd use for my cancer
patients<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:03.520> mantra<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.060> had<00:04:04.240> learned

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
patients and that mantra I had learned

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.110 
patients and that mantra I had learned
from<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.810> West<00:04:05.020> Coast<00:04:05.110> surgeon<00:04:05.950> years<00:04:06.610> ago<00:04:06.880> from

whom I had great respect his name was
Bert<00:04:09.550> Dunphy<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.180> Bert<00:04:10.930> used<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.290> say<00:04:11.470> that

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
Bert Dunphy and Bert used to say that

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.320 
Bert Dunphy and Bert used to say that
patients<00:04:12.100> with<00:04:12.250> cancer<00:04:12.670> are<00:04:12.760> not<00:04:12.880> afraid<00:04:13.120> to

so the for the first five years of this
study<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:30.010> asked<00:04:30.669> these<00:04:30.880> patients<00:04:31.449> they<00:04:31.750> were

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
study I asked these patients they were

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
could do this to see me every two weeks

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.670 
could do this to see me every two weeks
in<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.910> office<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.449> I<00:04:37.990> would<00:04:38.139> go<00:04:38.320> over<00:04:38.350> every

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
in the office and I would go over every

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.250 
in the office and I would go over every
morsel<00:04:38.889> they'd<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.580> we<00:04:40.360> would<00:04:40.540> drew<00:04:40.720> there<00:04:40.930> we

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
morsel they'd and we would drew there we

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.110 
morsel they'd and we would drew there we
drew<00:04:41.410> their<00:04:41.560> cholesterol<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.310> we<00:04:42.880> checked

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120

other<00:04:50.530> pretty<00:04:50.710> well<00:04:50.860> then<00:04:51.250> back<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:52.229> five

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
other pretty well then back in five

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.830 
other pretty well then back in five
years<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.740> got<00:04:53.919> bold<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:55.150> stretched<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.720> out

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
years I got bold and I stretched it out

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.529 
years I got bold and I stretched it out
to<00:04:56.080> every<00:04:56.289> month<00:04:56.800> every<00:04:57.610> four<00:04:58.060> weeks<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.479> then

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
to every month every four weeks and then

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.379 
to every month every four weeks and then
at<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.590> end<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.860> a<00:04:59.919> decade<00:05:00.130> they<00:05:00.699> were<00:05:00.760> pretty

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
at the end of a decade they were pretty

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.510 
at the end of a decade they were pretty
well<00:05:01.479> by<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:01.840> time<00:05:01.990> on<00:05:02.350> autopilot<00:05:02.949> so<00:05:03.310> then

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
well by this time on autopilot so then

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.540 
well by this time on autopilot so then
we<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:04.840> stretched<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.590> out<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.919> quarterly<00:05:06.600> but

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
we I stretched it out to quarterly but

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.670 
we I stretched it out to quarterly but
then<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.850> was<00:05:10.000> interesting<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.539> to<00:05:11.350> see<00:05:11.560> how

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
then it was interesting to to see how

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.379 
then it was interesting to to see how
they<00:05:11.860> were<00:05:11.919> doing<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.430> Anna<00:05:12.699> was<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.120> breaks

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
they were doing it Anna was it breaks

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.680 
they were doing it Anna was it breaks
exciting<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.919> see<00:05:15.850> a<00:05:15.880> number<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.300> striking

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
exciting to see a number of striking

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.110 
exciting to see a number of striking
examples<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.590> how<00:05:18.039> not<00:05:18.280> only<00:05:18.310> how<00:05:18.610> they<00:05:18.760> halted

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
examples of how not only how they halted

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.990 
examples of how not only how they halted
their<00:05:19.330> disease<00:05:19.660> but<00:05:19.870> we<00:05:20.650> did<00:05:20.830> some<00:05:21.100> metrics<00:05:21.729> to

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
their disease but we did some metrics to

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.760 
their disease but we did some metrics to
find<00:05:22.870> out<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.199> they<00:05:23.350> were<00:05:23.410> actually

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
find out that they were actually

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.180 
find out that they were actually
reversing<00:05:24.729> their<00:05:24.880> disease
