and<00:01:39.570> hand<00:01:40.200> speed<00:01:40.500> strength<00:01:40.890> control<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and hand speed strength control all that

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.810 
and hand speed strength control all that
is<00:01:42.200> just<00:01:43.200> single<00:01:44.100> strokes<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> hand

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is just single strokes on the hand

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.429 
is just single strokes on the hand
pretty<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.420> any<00:01:45.630> instructor<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.259> going

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
pretty much any instructor that's going

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
pretty much any instructor that's going
to<00:01:46.500> tell<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.740> how<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> develop<00:01:47.070> hand<00:01:47.490> speed<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to tell you how to develop hand speed is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.230 
to tell you how to develop hand speed is
going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> tell<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:50.240> when

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
going to tell you this because a when

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.810 
going to tell you this because a when
you<00:01:51.329> develop<00:01:51.720> single<00:01:52.259> hand<00:01:52.530> at<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> time<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you develop single hand at a time it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.899 
you develop single hand at a time it
helps<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.320> fills<00:01:56.250> later<00:01:56.670> on

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
helps you out with your fills later on

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.020 
helps you out with your fills later on
so<00:01:57.920> however<00:01:58.920> fast<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.490> go<00:01:59.579> with<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.790> single

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so however fast you can go with a single

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
so however fast you can go with a single
hand<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:00.899> pretty<00:02:01.259> much<00:02:01.409> double

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
hand you can just pretty much double

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.200 
hand you can just pretty much double
that<00:02:01.950> speed<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> do<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> other

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

hand and then you've got a really really
fast<00:02:05.009> sounding<00:02:05.369> fill<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.960> mean<00:02:07.320> perfect

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
can do it actually set a timer and see

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.270 
can do it actually set a timer and see
how<00:02:39.209> long<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.079> can<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:40.409> with<00:02:40.620> even<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.010> hand

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
and you have your speed at I don't know

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.890 
and you have your speed at I don't know
80<00:02:47.760> beats<00:02:47.939> per<00:02:48.060> minute<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.569> you're<00:02:48.659> trying<00:02:48.840> to

right fingers are very important in

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.690 
right fingers are very important in
developing<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.139> speed<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.919> then<00:04:20.459> once

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
developing that speed and then once

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.310 
developing that speed and then once
you're<00:04:20.820> done<00:04:20.850> practicing<00:04:21.299> with<00:04:21.480> one<00:04:21.660> hand<00:04:21.930> set

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
you're done practicing with one hand set

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.540 
you're done practicing with one hand set
your<00:04:22.440> clock<00:04:22.650> for<00:04:22.680> another<00:04:22.860> minute<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.370> see

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
your clock for another minute and see

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.140 
your clock for another minute and see
how<00:04:23.610> long<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.240> go<00:04:24.419> with<00:04:24.690> both<00:04:24.900> hands

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.879 

once<00:04:33.150> you've<00:04:33.270> tried<00:04:33.389> that<00:04:33.630> exercise<00:04:34.169> then<00:04:34.770> we

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
once you've tried that exercise then we

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.950 
once you've tried that exercise then we
try<00:04:35.100> doing<00:04:35.430> exercises<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.419> incorporate

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
try doing exercises that incorporate

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.159 
try doing exercises that incorporate
both<00:04:37.440> hands<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:39.150> example<00:04:39.630> try<00:04:39.960> doing

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
both hands so for example try doing

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.760 
both hands so for example try doing
eighth<00:04:40.650> notes<00:04:41.130> into<00:04:42.120> sixteenth<00:04:42.840> notes<00:04:43.139> one

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
eighth notes into sixteenth notes one

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:51.400 
eighth notes into sixteenth notes one
example<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.400> an<00:04:44.520> exercise<00:04:44.970> could<00:04:45.210> be<00:04:45.300> this

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.510 

okay<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.560> they<00:04:52.620> need<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.800> see<00:04:52.949> how<00:04:53.039> fast<00:04:53.340> you

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
okay and they need to see how fast you

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.760 
okay and they need to see how fast you
can<00:04:53.610> get<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.229> gradually<00:04:55.229> with<00:04:55.560> your

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
can get that gradually with your

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.430 
can get that gradually with your
metronome<00:04:56.360> increases<00:04:57.360> feed<00:04:57.600> by<00:04:57.810> ten<00:04:58.139> beats

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
metronome increases feed by ten beats

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.529 
metronome increases feed by ten beats
per<00:04:58.680> minute<00:04:59.009> each<00:04:59.759> time<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.210> get<00:05:00.330> too

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
per minute each time you get too

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.150 
per minute each time you get too
comfortable<00:05:00.840> with<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.229> exercise<00:05:01.740> okay<00:05:02.100> so

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
comfortable with the exercise okay so

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.219 
comfortable with the exercise okay so
you're<00:05:02.400> constantly<00:05:02.820> just<00:05:02.970> pushing<00:05:03.750> that

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
you're constantly just pushing that

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:16.809 
you're constantly just pushing that
limit<00:05:04.650> so

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.729 

okay<00:05:17.819> and<00:05:18.299> just<00:05:18.569> keep<00:05:18.959> moving<00:05:19.079> on<00:05:19.319> from<00:05:19.559> there

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:19.739 
okay and just keep moving on from there

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:22.549 
okay and just keep moving on from there
very<00:05:20.609> important<00:05:21.179> that<00:05:21.959> you<00:05:22.079> also<00:05:22.259> do<00:05:22.529> the

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:22.559 
very important that you also do the
