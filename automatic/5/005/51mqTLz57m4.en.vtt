00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.640 

if<00:00:24.560> you<00:00:24.890> can<00:00:25.070> see<00:00:25.430> it<00:00:25.580> watch<00:00:25.880> Leo's<00:00:26.390> feet<00:00:26.840> they

if you can see it watch Leo's feet they
start<00:00:27.980> out<00:00:28.070> flat<00:00:28.700> and<00:00:29.060> then<00:00:29.990> he<00:00:30.200> flexes<00:00:30.980> and

start out flat and then he flexes and

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.010 
start out flat and then he flexes and
almost<00:00:31.370> goes<00:00:31.610> up<00:00:31.820> one<00:00:31.970> on<00:00:32.360> his<00:00:32.570> little<00:00:32.750> toes

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
almost goes up one on his little toes

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.140 
almost goes up one on his little toes
like<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:36.100> see<00:00:37.100> they're<00:00:37.280> flat<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.670> he<00:00:37.970> goes

like that see they're flat and he goes

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.030 
like that see they're flat and he goes
up<00:00:39.430> flatten<00:00:40.430> goes<00:00:40.790> up<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:41.590> don't<00:00:42.590> know<00:00:42.739> why<00:00:42.890> he

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
up flatten goes up I don't know why he

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.570 
up flatten goes up I don't know why he
does<00:00:43.190> it

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
does it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.430 
does it
Arthur<00:00:44.210> Conyers<00:00:44.690> don't<00:00:44.989> really<00:00:45.350> do<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:47.440> it's

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
Arthur Conyers don't really do that it's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.720 
Arthur Conyers don't really do that it's
like<00:00:48.559> he's<00:00:48.739> ready<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.040> take<00:00:49.370> off<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.970> fly<00:00:54.730> so

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
like he's ready to take off and fly so

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.550 
like he's ready to take off and fly so
I'm<00:00:55.820> guessing<00:00:56.239> that<00:00:56.270> maybe<00:00:56.630> he<00:00:57.050> used<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.410> be

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
I'm guessing that maybe he used to be

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.520 
I'm guessing that maybe he used to be
flighted<00:00:58.070> but<00:00:58.489> when<00:00:58.850> he<00:00:59.150> got<00:00:59.360> brought<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.410> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
flighted but when he got brought to the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.290 
flighted but when he got brought to the
pet<00:01:00.770> store<00:01:00.800> they<00:01:01.280> probably<00:01:01.579> clipped<00:01:02.090> his

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
pet store they probably clipped his

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.740 
pet store they probably clipped his
wings

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
won't crash everywhere and he's pacing

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.180

back<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.530> forth<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:25.190> rowing

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
back and forth right now and rowing

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.360 
back and forth right now and rowing
because<00:01:27.080> he<00:01:28.080> wants<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.620> food<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.400> husband<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:52.780 

right<00:01:41.340> leo

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:01.270

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.440 

he<00:02:02.280> doesn't<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.970> veggies<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> much

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450

and he doesn't really like soap seeds
which<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.990> quite<00:02:13.230> surprising<00:02:13.410> because<00:02:14.100> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
which is quite surprising because the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.590 
which is quite surprising because the
breeder<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:16.550> he<00:02:17.550> came<00:02:17.819> from<00:02:20.240> usually<00:02:21.240> feeds

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
silk seeds to the babies so maybe he

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.810 
silk seeds to the babies so maybe he
forgot<00:02:25.200> what<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.740> tastes<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:28.520> it's<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.610> good

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820
