here first of all you need you have to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
here first of all you need you have to
have<00:00:13.170> sublime<00:00:13.650> text<00:00:13.920> 3<00:00:14.099> if<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.730> don't<00:00:15.059> have

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
have sublime text 3 if you don't have

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.320 
have sublime text 3 if you don't have
downloaded<00:00:15.690> from<00:00:15.960> sublime<00:00:16.580> website<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
downloaded from sublime website and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.140 
downloaded from sublime website and
install<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:19.020> your<00:00:19.770> system<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.310> pretty<00:00:20.820> simple

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
install it your system is pretty simple

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.939 
install it your system is pretty simple
to<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.750> next<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> JDK

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
to do that next you have to have a JDK

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.400 
to do that next you have to have a JDK
there<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> two<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.519> first<00:00:26.910> probably<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
there is a two way first probably you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.169 
there is a two way first probably you
might<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.890> Dudek<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.400> your<00:00:29.519> system<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.119> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
might have Dudek in your system so you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.840 
might have Dudek in your system so you
can<00:00:30.510> check<00:00:30.779> through<00:00:31.590> chrome<00:00:31.949> command<00:00:32.460> prompt

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
can check through chrome command prompt

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.900 
can check through chrome command prompt
you<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.360> there<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.340> check<00:00:35.640> up

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
you just go there and you know check up

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.950 
you just go there and you know check up
like<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> Java<00:00:37.290> -<00:00:37.890> version<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.719> Java

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
like a Java - version you see the Java

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.840 
like a Java - version you see the Java
JDK<00:00:41.059> 1.8<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.270> installed<00:00:42.719> there<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> next<00:00:44.670> what

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
JDK 1.8 is installed there so next what

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.520 
JDK 1.8 is installed there so next what
you<00:00:44.940> want<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.840> check<00:00:46.260> where<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you want to do is you check where the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
you want to do is you check where the
Java<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> say<00:00:47.550> where<00:00:47.789> Java<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.510> going

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
Java is so you say where Java is going

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
Java is so you say where Java is going
to<00:00:48.840> tell<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.350> Java<00:00:49.590> location<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to tell you the Java location it is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.869 
to tell you the Java location it is
being<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.180> start<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> next<00:00:53.340> thing<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.820> you're

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
being a start so next thing what you're

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.049 
being a start so next thing what you're
going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> create<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
going to do is you have to create a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.139 
going to do is you have to create a
sublime<00:00:57.690> package<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:59.039> build<00:00:59.370> Java<00:00:59.789> source

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
sublime package to build Java source

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.139 
sublime package to build Java source
code<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.020> run<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.879> you're<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
code and run it so what you're going to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.719 
code and run it so what you're going to
do<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> open<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.809> sublime<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
do is open your sublime and then you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.350 
do is open your sublime and then you
have<00:01:06.650> let<00:01:07.650> me<00:01:07.799> show<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> file<00:01:08.520> format<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
have let me show you the file format the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240 
have let me show you the file format the
bridge<00:01:09.600> system<00:01:09.780> phylum<00:01:10.290> formatter<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
bridge system phylum formatter which you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.780 
bridge system phylum formatter which you
need<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.610> need

need to do so if you see here you need
to<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:15.150> sublime<00:01:15.540> website<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.979> under<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> docs

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to go sublime website go under the docs

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.810 
to go sublime website go under the docs
references<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.740> there<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> decent<00:01:20.159> format

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
references and there is a decent format

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.149

have<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> correct<00:01:31.409> format<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> Java<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
have the correct format for the Java and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.580 
have the correct format for the Java and
what<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
replace<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:36.119> line<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.810> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
replace this this line because this is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
replace this this line because this is
for<00:01:37.200> Python<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.310> need<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> replace<00:01:38.939> with

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
for Python and I need to replace with

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.100 
for Python and I need to replace with
Java

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
Java

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
Java
so<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:41.009> Java<00:01:41.250> C<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> Java<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so you see Java C and Java here with the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.230 
so you see Java C and Java here with the
file<00:01:43.020> name<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> file<00:01:43.920> based<00:01:44.189> name<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
file name and the file based name this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
file name and the file based name this
file<00:01:45.540> name<00:01:45.750> probably<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> extension

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
file name probably with the extension

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
file name probably with the extension
dot<00:01:47.579> Java<00:01:48.149> basically<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.079> dot<00:01:49.259> Java

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
dot Java basically the dot Java

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.990 
dot Java basically the dot Java
extension<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.729> without

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
extension and this will be without

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.200 
extension and this will be without
extension<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.460> resting<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.579> key<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.030> need

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
extension and resting you key you need

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.389 
extension and resting you key you need
to<00:01:54.270> keep<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.560> need<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> change<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
to keep as it is just need to change the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.760 
to keep as it is just need to change the
Python<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> tower<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.899> need<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> add<00:01:58.380> two

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
Python to tower and you need to add two

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.300 
Python to tower and you need to add two
more<00:01:58.799> things<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.570> path<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:02.040> path

more things there one is a path the path
is<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.469> tell<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.649> where<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> Java

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
is going to be tell you where the Java

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
is going to be tell you where the Java
is<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:06.990> Java<00:02:07.290> is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
is and you know where your Java is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.029 
is and you know where your Java is
because<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:10.170> we're<00:02:10.830> in

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
because you see here when we're in

because you see here when we're in
command<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.180> word<00:02:12.420> shower<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
command on this word shower and it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.350 
command on this word shower and it
it<00:02:13.709> showed<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.370> where<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.819> Java<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.120> taught

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
it showed you where the Java is taught

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.500 
it showed you where the Java is taught
so<00:02:15.750> same<00:02:15.990> location<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.620> have<00:02:16.950> copied<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:18.209> put

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
so same location I have copied just put

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.290 
so same location I have copied just put
here<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:18.990> need<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.440> put<00:02:19.620> up<00:02:19.860> these<00:02:20.550> double

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
here so you need to put up these double

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.500 
here so you need to put up these double
slashes<00:02:21.870> there<00:02:22.370> until<00:02:23.370> pin<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
slashes there until pin and then you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.809 
slashes there until pin and then you
need<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.810> tell<00:02:24.990> then<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> have<00:02:26.610> add

need to tell then you have to have add

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.430 
need to tell then you have to have add
one<00:02:27.209> more<00:02:28.640> parameter<00:02:29.640> D<00:02:30.120> which<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.360> shell<00:02:30.959> is

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
one more parameter D which is shell is

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.630 
one more parameter D which is shell is
equal<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.890> true<00:02:32.270> now<00:02:33.270> your<00:02:34.040> package<00:02:35.040> file<00:02:35.340> or

equal to true now your package file or
you<00:02:36.360> know<00:02:36.480> build<00:02:36.720> system<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.230> ready<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.800> need

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you know build system is ready you need

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.820 
you know build system is ready you need
to<00:02:38.069> save<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.600> have<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.020> save<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.560> one

package you go under tool and then you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.270 
package you go under tool and then you
can<00:03:20.820> see<00:03:21.030> see<00:03:21.660> there<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.959> my<00:03:22.140> shower<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.190> you

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
can see see there is my shower so you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.569 
can see see there is my shower so you
can<00:03:23.459> check<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.970> my<00:03:24.150> Java<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.799> now<00:03:25.799> your

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
can check that my Java and now your

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.800 
can check that my Java and now your
sublime<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.329> ready<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:28.739> know<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.540> compile<00:03:30.540> and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
sublime is ready you know to compile and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.770 
sublime is ready you know to compile and
run<00:03:30.840> Java<00:03:31.380> program<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.310> let's<00:03:32.519> do<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.030> quick

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
run Java program so let's do a quick

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.680 
run Java program so let's do a quick
test<00:03:34.049> here<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:38.030> what<00:03:39.030> you're<00:03:39.120> going<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.269> do<00:03:39.510> is

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
test here so what you're going to do is

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.560 
test here so what you're going to do is
okay<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.709> we<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.340> create<00:03:41.610> or<00:03:41.820> we<00:03:42.329> have

okay so we have create or we have

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.960 
okay so we have create or we have
created<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.140> package<00:03:43.530> here<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.489> next<00:03:44.730> is

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
created the package here so next is

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.319 
created the package here so next is
create<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.299> HelloWorld<00:03:45.630> dot<00:03:45.900> Java<00:03:46.160> right<00:03:47.329> so
