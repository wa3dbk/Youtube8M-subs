00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.289 
you can look over it shoot the tank for
quite<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> while<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.850> looks<00:01:39.119> at

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
quite a while and then when it looks at

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
quite a while and then when it looks at
you<00:01:39.479> starts<00:01:39.810> aiming<00:01:40.140> at<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.439> course<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you starts aiming at you of course you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
you starts aiming at you of course you
can<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> reacquire<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
can back up and get it to reacquire a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
can back up and get it to reacquire a
different<00:01:42.840> target<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.920> come

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
different target and then just come

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
different target and then just come
forward<00:01:44.460> again<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:45.240> no<00:01:45.390> issue<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
forward again it's really no issue and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
forward again it's really no issue and
it's<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.229> very<00:01:46.290> hard<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> die<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.490> only

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it's very very hard to die the only

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.149 
it's very very hard to die the only
thing<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.090> some<00:01:48.659> enemies<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.380> spawn<00:01:49.860> out

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
thing is that some enemies do spawn out

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.770 
thing is that some enemies do spawn out
of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> doorway<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.270> hiding<00:01:51.600> near

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
of the doorway that you're hiding near

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690 
of the doorway that you're hiding near
but<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.740> worst<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> happen

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
but the worst that's going to happen

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.030 
but the worst that's going to happen
there's<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:55.259> two<00:01:55.290> fallen

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
there's going to be one or two fallen

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.950 
there's going to be one or two fallen
vandals<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> rest<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.060> dregs<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
vandals and the rest are dregs so you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.270 
vandals and the rest are dregs so you
can<00:01:58.200> kill<00:01:58.409> them<00:01:58.619> very<00:01:58.890> very<00:01:59.040> easily

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
can kill them very very easily

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.499 
can kill them very very easily
especially<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.030> two<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> your

especially if you have two of your

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.359 
especially if you have two of your
teammates<00:02:00.540> kind<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> behind<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.890> helping<00:02:02.219> out

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
teammates kind of behind you helping out

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.819 
teammates kind of behind you helping out

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
different strategies but most of them

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.960 
different strategies but most of them
are<00:02:21.299> for<00:02:21.870> soloing<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.709> if<00:02:23.159> you<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> group

to do is go into the area of the boss

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.570 
to do is go into the area of the boss
fight<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.349> just<00:02:28.590> go<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.069> right<00:02:29.370> in

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
those kind of a room and you can hide

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.600 
those kind of a room and you can hide
behind<00:02:31.560> these<00:02:31.799> barrels<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> you're<00:02:32.519> gonna

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
behind these barrels that you're gonna

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.759 
behind these barrels that you're gonna
see<00:02:32.910> me<00:02:33.030> hiding<00:02:33.209> behind<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.769> essentially

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
see me hiding behind and essentially

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.100 
see me hiding behind and essentially
nothing<00:02:35.160> can<00:02:35.580> hit<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.569> can<00:02:36.720> wet<00:02:36.930> yourself

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
nothing can hit you you can wet yourself

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.809 
nothing can hit you you can wet yourself
in<00:02:37.410> between<00:02:37.680> these<00:02:37.739> barrels<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.549> only

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
in between these barrels and the only

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.059 
in between these barrels and the only
thing<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.660> can<00:02:39.750> hit<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.079> is<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.709> grenades

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
thing that can hit you is the grenades

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.619 
thing that can hit you is the grenades
from<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> Drake<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.450> kind

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
from the Drake so you just have to kind

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.600 
from the Drake so you just have to kind
of<00:02:42.690> keep<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.049> top<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.590> ads<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:44.129> really

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
of keep on top of the ads it really

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.330 
of keep on top of the ads it really
isn't<00:02:44.790> too<00:02:45.000> difficult<00:02:45.620> they<00:02:46.620> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.920> clump

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
isn't too difficult they kind of clump

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.100 
isn't too difficult they kind of clump
up<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.700> front<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.569> across<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
up in front of you and then across the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.680 
up in front of you and then across the
gap<00:02:49.379> if<00:02:50.040> they<00:02:50.190> clump<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.549> again<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.599> you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
gap if they clump up again so if you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.180 
gap if they clump up again so if you
have<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> void<00:02:52.109> rocket<00:02:52.530> launcher<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.040> was

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
have a void rocket launcher like I was

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.710 
have a void rocket launcher like I was
being<00:02:53.370> really<00:02:53.609> stingy<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.269> my<00:02:54.450> rocket

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
being really stingy with my rocket

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.349 
being really stingy with my rocket
launcher<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> didn't<00:02:55.260> use<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.650> heavy<00:02:56.609> ammo

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
launcher I didn't use a heavy ammo

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.300 
launcher I didn't use a heavy ammo
synthesis<00:02:57.930> which<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.650> probably<00:02:58.859> should<00:02:59.280> have

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
synthesis which I probably should have

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.819 
synthesis which I probably should have
but<00:02:59.700> when<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.269> enemies<00:03:00.540> come<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.989> one<00:03:01.440> rocket

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
but when the enemies come up one rocket

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.380
