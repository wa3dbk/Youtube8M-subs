we've<00:00:09.480> gradually<00:00:10.200> come<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.889> realization

we've gradually come to the realization
that<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.030> understand<00:00:12.509> how<00:00:12.690> human<00:00:13.080> being

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.539 
that to understand how human being
should<00:00:13.380> be<00:00:13.440> feeding<00:00:13.830> themselves<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.340> got<00:00:14.490> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this is what our ancestors did of course

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
it was born and then drinking the memory

it was born and then drinking the memory
the<00:02:24.440> fluids<00:02:24.799> from<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> memory<00:02:25.340> cans<00:02:25.840> instead

the fluids from the memory cans instead

the fluids from the memory cans instead
of<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.170> calf<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:28.160> answer<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.430> no<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> there<00:02:30.739> is

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
of the calf the answer is no so there is

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.470 
of the calf the answer is no so there is
a<00:02:30.860> predisposition<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:32.090> suppose<00:02:32.450> that

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
beings and then when we look into it we

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.620 
beings and then when we look into it we
discover<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:40.640> there<00:02:40.849> are<00:02:40.910> huge<00:02:41.120> drawbacks

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
discover that there are huge drawbacks

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.170

send it was just after the war there was

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.220 
send it was just after the war there was
very<00:03:28.459> little<00:03:28.609> milk<00:03:28.880> around<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.989> when<00:03:30.139> it

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
very little milk around but when it

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.140 
very little milk around but when it
started<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.680> come<00:03:30.859> back<00:03:31.130> we<00:03:31.459> used<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:31.790> look<00:03:31.940> for

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
started to come back we used to look for

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.180 
started to come back we used to look for
this<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.569> milk<00:03:32.810> bottles<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.500> had<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.859> thick

this the milk bottles that had the thick
cream<00:03:34.519> on<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.760> top<00:03:34.790> or<00:03:35.209> now<00:03:35.959> understand<00:03:36.530> that

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
cream on the top or now understand that

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.500 
cream on the top or now understand that
that's<00:03:36.799> not<00:03:36.950> great<00:03:37.190> we<00:03:37.549> now<00:03:37.760> understand<00:03:38.239> that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
that's not great we now understand that

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.539 
that's not great we now understand that
that<00:03:38.780> saturated<00:03:39.349> fat<00:03:39.680> isn't<00:03:39.889> great<00:03:40.190> for<00:03:40.220> human

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
that saturated fat isn't great for human

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.420 
that saturated fat isn't great for human

weaned your body stopped producing the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.870 
weaned your body stopped producing the
various<00:04:06.079> kinds<00:04:06.380> of<00:04:06.440> enzymes<00:04:06.799> that<00:04:06.919> cope<00:04:07.669> with

various kinds of enzymes that cope with

various kinds of enzymes that cope with
it<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.180> secondly<00:04:08.810> don't<00:04:09.079> need<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:11.269> now<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
it and secondly don't need it so now the

it and secondly don't need it so now the
dairy<00:04:12.590> industries<00:04:12.980> producing<00:04:13.099> skim<00:04:13.910> milk

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
dairy industries producing skim milk

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.719

which<00:04:14.359> is<00:04:14.480> lactose<00:04:14.870> free<00:04:15.009> okay<00:04:16.009> so<00:04:16.459> where

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
which is lactose free okay so where

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.099 
which is lactose free okay so where
they're<00:04:16.880> going<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.090> go<00:04:17.209> next<00:04:17.449> well<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:17.840> think

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
they're going to go next well I think

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.599 
they're going to go next well I think
the<00:04:18.410> next<00:04:18.620> target<00:04:18.949> will<00:04:19.040> be<00:04:19.100> the

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
the next target will be the

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.759 
the next target will be the
seeing<00:04:19.969> that's<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.299> milk<00:04:20.539> what<00:04:21.319> what's<00:04:21.620> wrong

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
seeing that's in milk what what's wrong

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.709 
seeing that's in milk what what's wrong
with<00:04:21.889> Casey<00:04:22.099> well<00:04:22.939> that's<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> protein

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:23.719 
with Casey well that's the protein

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.589 
with Casey well that's the protein
that's<00:04:23.900> in<00:04:24.110> milk<00:04:24.349> that's<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.159> letter<00:04:25.699> a<00:04:26.060> protein

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
that's in milk that's a letter a protein

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.209 
that's in milk that's a letter a protein
which<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:26.840> one<00:04:27.199> of<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.349> most<00:04:27.469> powerful

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:28.219 
which is one of the most powerful

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:30.760 
which is one of the most powerful
cholesterol<00:04:29.090> razors<00:04:29.479> we<00:04:29.629> know<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.139> very

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
cholesterol razors we know of and very

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.490 
cholesterol razors we know of and very
allergenic<00:04:31.449> so<00:04:32.449> maybe<00:04:32.750> they'll<00:04:33.020> produce<00:04:33.259> a

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
allergenic so maybe they'll produce a

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.809 
allergenic so maybe they'll produce a
milk<00:04:33.680> which<00:04:33.860> doesn't<00:04:34.189> have<00:04:34.340> lactose<00:04:34.759> which

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
milk which doesn't have lactose which

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.100 
milk which doesn't have lactose which
doesn't<00:04:35.270> have<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.509> fat<00:04:35.689> and<00:04:35.870> which<00:04:35.990> doesnt

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
doesn't have the fat and which doesnt

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.719 
doesn't have the fat and which doesnt
have<00:04:36.349> the<00:04:36.379> casing<00:04:36.860> what<00:04:36.979> are<00:04:37.039> you<00:04:37.099> left<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.460> why

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
have the casing what are you left it why

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.439 
have the casing what are you left it why
are<00:04:37.789> we<00:04:37.969> bothering<00:04:39.460> Jeff<00:04:40.460> given<00:04:41.300> your

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
are we bothering Jeff given your

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.189 
are we bothering Jeff given your
comments<00:04:42.349> on<00:04:42.909> dairy<00:04:43.909> products<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.930> fact

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
comments on dairy products and the fact

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.740 
comments on dairy products and the fact
that<00:04:45.319> they're<00:04:45.590> not<00:04:45.800> really<00:04:46.360> healthy<00:04:47.360> for<00:04:47.389> us

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
that they're not really healthy for us

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.830 
that they're not really healthy for us
I'm<00:04:48.680> wondering<00:04:49.430> if<00:04:49.610> perhaps<00:04:49.909> there's<00:04:50.599> a

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
I'm wondering if perhaps there's a

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.399 
I'm wondering if perhaps there's a
political<00:04:51.590> or<00:04:52.219> economic<00:04:52.810> agenda<00:04:53.810> going<00:04:54.020> on

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
political or economic agenda going on

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.129 
political or economic agenda going on
that<00:04:55.219> is<00:04:55.520> trying<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.419> get<00:04:56.569> us<00:04:56.719> to<00:04:56.870> believe

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
that is trying to get us to believe

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.580 
that is trying to get us to believe
otherwise<00:04:58.599> the<00:04:59.599> whole<00:04:59.659> idea<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.169> dairy

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
otherwise the whole idea of dairy

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.679 
otherwise the whole idea of dairy
farming<00:05:01.129> and<00:05:01.340> eating<00:05:01.610> dairy<00:05:01.789> products<00:05:02.240> was

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
farming and eating dairy products was

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.830 
farming and eating dairy products was
very<00:05:03.020> much<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.469> Northern<00:05:04.370> European<00:05:04.849> idea<00:05:05.180> the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
very much a Northern European idea the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.600 
very much a Northern European idea the
English<00:05:06.199> brought<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.680> over<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.979> America<00:05:07.189> and

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
English brought it over to America and

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.969 
English brought it over to America and

what<00:05:10.159> we<00:05:10.279> don't<00:05:10.400> realize<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:11.210> that<00:05:11.659> these<00:05:11.870> are

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
what we don't realize is that these are

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.779 
what we don't realize is that these are

basically only countries that actually

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
think that consuming dairy products is a

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.459 
think that consuming dairy products is a
normal<00:05:16.819> thing<00:05:16.879> almost<00:05:17.629> every<00:05:17.960> other<00:05:17.990> society
