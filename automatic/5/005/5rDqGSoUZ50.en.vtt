00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
known that I probably wouldn't have

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.259 
known that I probably wouldn't have
bought<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.830> me<00:02:15.980> when<00:02:16.220> I'm<00:02:16.370> wearing<00:02:16.549> a<00:02:16.939> bag

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
over my shoulder I don't

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.590 
over my shoulder I don't
something<00:02:19.190> where<00:02:19.370> someone<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.850> just<00:02:19.910> creeper

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
something where someone can just creeper

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.260 
something where someone can just creeper
behind<00:02:20.930> G<00:02:21.140> press<00:02:22.010> two<00:02:22.250> buttons<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.940> then<00:02:23.150> your

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
behind G press two buttons and then your

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.900 
behind G press two buttons and then your
bags<00:02:23.480> gone<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.340> want<00:02:25.340> something<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.640> bit<00:02:25.670> more

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
bags gone I want something a bit more

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.830 
bags gone I want something a bit more
secure<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.770> don't<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.120> feature<00:02:29.480> on

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
secure so I don't like that feature on

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.660 
secure so I don't like that feature on
this<00:02:30.050> bag<00:02:30.290> at<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.830> think<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.400> reason

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
this bag at all I think the reason

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.740 
this bag at all I think the reason
they've<00:02:31.790> done<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.270> because<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.630> can

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
they've done that is because you can

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.350 
they've done that is because you can
actually<00:02:32.870> sort<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.230> wear<00:02:33.380> as<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> waist<00:02:33.860> pack

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
actually sort of wear as a waist pack

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.940 
actually sort of wear as a waist pack
rather<00:02:35.360> than<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.630> shoulder<00:02:36.110> bag<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.680> guess

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
rather than a shoulder bag so I guess

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.490 
rather than a shoulder bag so I guess
that's<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.000> can<00:02:38.180> take<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.960> off<00:02:39.050> your<00:02:39.290> waist

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's you can take it off your waist

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's you can take it off your waist
easier<00:02:41.290> flag<00:02:42.290> itself<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:43.270> they<00:02:44.270> call<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.630> I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
easier flag itself is they call it I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.480 
easier flag itself is they call it I
think<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.990> bomb-proof<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.830> fabric<00:02:46.280> they

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
think it's bomb-proof the fabric they

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.950 
think it's bomb-proof the fabric they
called<00:02:46.790> bombshell<00:02:47.120> sorry

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960

will<00:03:30.590> last<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.980> don't<00:03:31.040> know<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.750> if<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.930> focus

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
will last I don't know and if you focus

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.140 
will last I don't know and if you focus
on<00:03:33.770> those<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.250> suspect<00:03:34.790> they<00:03:35.030> would

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
on those and I suspect they would

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.620 
on those and I suspect they would
probably<00:03:35.420> come<00:03:35.870> off<00:03:36.910> else<00:03:37.910> is<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.240> stay<00:03:38.510> on

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
probably come off else is it stay on

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.870 
probably come off else is it stay on
here<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.050> just<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.830> let<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.010> know<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
here and just to let you know the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.080 
here and just to let you know the
internal<00:03:41.209> dimensions<00:03:41.830> are<00:03:42.830> 18<00:03:43.340> centimeters

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
internal dimensions are 18 centimeters

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.780 
internal dimensions are 18 centimeters
by<00:03:44.270> 16<00:03:44.780> centimeters<00:03:45.560> by<00:03:45.770> nine<00:03:46.100> point<00:03:46.490> five

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
by 16 centimeters by nine point five

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.660 
by 16 centimeters by nine point five
centimeters<00:03:47.800> made<00:03:48.800> in<00:03:49.120> China<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:52.580> this

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
centimeters made in China and so this

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.300 
centimeters made in China and so this
bag<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:52.940> actually<00:03:53.300> made<00:03:53.570> for<00:03:54.050> compact<00:03:54.830> DSLR

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
bag is actually made for compact DSLR

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.250 
bag is actually made for compact DSLR
and<00:03:55.640> mirrorless<00:03:56.120> cameras

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
and mirrorless cameras

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260 
and mirrorless cameras
I<00:03:57.320> think<00:03:58.070> you'd<00:03:58.190> struggle<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.880> get<00:03:59.000> anything

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
I think you'd struggle to get anything

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.900 
I think you'd struggle to get anything
much<00:03:59.660> bigger<00:04:00.080> than<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.320> compact<00:04:00.860> this<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.340> d50

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
much bigger than a compact this is a d50

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.400 
much bigger than a compact this is a d50
108<00:04:05.560> 35<00:04:06.560> millimeter<00:04:07.040> 1.8<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.540> probably<00:04:09.170> just

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
108 35 millimeter 1.8 you probably just

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.870 
108 35 millimeter 1.8 you probably just
get<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:09.770> there<00:04:10.040> on<00:04:10.160> its<00:04:10.310> own<00:04:10.459> if<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:10.730> took

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
get that in there on its own if you took

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.770 
get that in there on its own if you took
the<00:04:11.030> divider<00:04:11.360> out<00:04:11.510> but<00:04:13.540> apart<00:04:14.540> from<00:04:14.630> that

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
the divider out but apart from that

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.930 
the divider out but apart from that
you're<00:04:14.989> not<00:04:15.110> going<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.320> get<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.440> lot<00:04:15.620> else

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
you're not going to get a lot else

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.340 
you're not going to get a lot else
and<00:04:17.330> that<00:04:18.130> provider<00:04:19.130> comes<00:04:19.459> out<00:04:20.290> yeah<00:04:21.290> you

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
and that provider comes out yeah you

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.750 
and that provider comes out yeah you
just<00:04:21.709> get<00:04:21.890> light<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.160> there<00:04:22.340> that's<00:04:22.640> probably

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
just get light in there that's probably

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.240 
just get light in there that's probably
a<00:04:22.940> good<00:04:23.060> fear<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.660> say<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.560> bags<00:04:24.890> kind<00:04:25.160> of

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
a good fear to say this bags kind of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.610 
a good fear to say this bags kind of
perfect<00:04:25.700> if<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:26.000> want<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.600> small<00:04:27.110> bag<00:04:27.320> for<00:04:27.350> a
