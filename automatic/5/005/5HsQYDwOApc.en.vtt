different<00:01:11.200> looking<00:01:11.350> they're<00:01:12.220> more<00:01:13.560> they're

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
different looking they're more they're

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.780 
different looking they're more they're
basically<00:01:14.830> just<00:01:15.070> not<00:01:15.250> refined<00:01:15.850> as<00:01:16.090> much<00:01:16.300> as<00:01:17.790> as

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
basically just not refined as much as as

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.360 
basically just not refined as much as as
the<00:01:19.660> regulans<00:01:20.440> you<00:01:20.800> probably<00:01:21.130> most<00:01:21.310> likely

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
the regulans you probably most likely

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.130 
the regulans you probably most likely
eat<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.370> this<00:01:24.520> will<00:01:24.760> help<00:01:24.910> from<00:01:25.270> not

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
eat so in this will help from not

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.930 
eat so in this will help from not
getting<00:01:26.470> them<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:26.830> bushy<00:01:27.100> if<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.430> use<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
getting them so bushy if you use the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.820 
getting them so bushy if you use the
regular<00:01:28.270> oats<00:01:28.480> it<00:01:29.110> would<00:01:29.260> get<00:01:29.410> very<00:01:29.440> messy

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
regular oats it would get very messy

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.980 
regular oats it would get very messy
overnight<00:01:30.480> so<00:01:31.480> those<00:01:31.659> are<00:01:31.690> in<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.110> pot<00:01:33.990> next

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990
