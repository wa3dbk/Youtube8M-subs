00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.080
 Let's see if I'm talking about fluctuating syrup 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 I'm talking calmly that he is not insulting you is one of the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.019
 ingredients that have these cookies we are usually going to buy are 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.190
 parsley we set in that inflation you open on the labels or it's not 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.689
 enough information or is not clear enough 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.060
 but now the european union approved the law to correct this problem and 

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:26.659
 what do you think of it to be to read the labels and the most complicated 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.489
 understands 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.489
 then there would be what is the henry boffin latina 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.180
 percent thiamine 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.660
 neither 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.620
 it's more it's not now either 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.720
 pallero juste 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.700
 I should 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.750
 to this film what is mall acacia lake 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.920
 nor imagine what can be 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 that way there is a tree called catia 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.490
 buses to eat and the human that did 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.160
 Well, I do not know if it's edible or not 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.660
 purportedly saint yogurt is brought supposedly be edible the tc for 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.820
 read labels 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.450
 fructose or if what happens that I do not see well and that letter so little I walk 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.859
 it could not be why it would take the best that was a tad 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.619
 it would be necessary that this one is a tad 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.950
 a little bit bigger 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.060
 for me and for other people like me and I see badly 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.890
 do not leave the power 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.040
 but those that they are interested in that stand out 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.500
 but the little ones 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.110
 where I did what sometimes contain the date that is very blurry and so on 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.100
 I do not see her 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.280
 three layers lady read that letter once to the ingredients 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 I often fixed those evils is very small denunciation 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.370
 besides, the little one would not be better with her 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.620
 you believe that food and drinks also labeled 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.990
 enough information in a correct size does not understand them would put 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 plus 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.270
 with larger print 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.460
 i can possibly give things, although of course there are always those who understand 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.880
 gentleman conforms to what he gave monosodic d'amato 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.319
 Johnson a type of preservatives 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.400
 i 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.929
 the cop was saints has said 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:17.199
 Rodolfo for himself money is a guy with his votes because he hid his consumption 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.059
 the elections then sure of it like those of late 2002 and the globe 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.689
 he showed sure that the prelate 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.199
 cc parallel labels at the supermarket 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.589
 brown a 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.159
 80 percent felt that this process 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.279
 p you that the foods have 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.729
 that's why city itself the series tas is more than enough all face 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.329
 Strong enough water 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.619
 but for the link you have to understand it and this becomes the whiting 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:44.719
 who bites his tail 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.719
 we tried to clarify them we went to the union of consumers 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.939
 but cristina is enough the information that we find in the 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.989
 labels of food products 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.209
 today we still know a long way to go in this field the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.949
 Spanish regulations tve 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.249
 2 with some minimum 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.399
 7 of detail labeling 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.659
 the labeling 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.039
 food products 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.949
 as for tÃ©lam and n the denomination the ingredients until that said but 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:11.579
 the truth 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.040
 by the way many times we buy we try to locate those minimums 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.019
 and not even in those we find with which 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.540
 by the way there was a lot of confusion per hundred if you are noticing what the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.419
 consumers are increasingly demanding 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.569
 with that information they want to receive finger when against one 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.859
 a product especially nutritional know what origin has what process of 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.249
 transformation followed in the manufacturing in little by all the offer that 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.510
 there is right now in the market and also keep in mind 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.900
 and every time blind the post we import or receive in products from outside 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.520
 witnesses of the cadem to be more demanding but 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.360
 the currently the consumer stops to think about to read that day case 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.919
 we have to work a little bit in that sense 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.700
 if it feels sexy people but let's say that still not for that the sem 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.510
 half a minute aaron hill try reading the labeling look for it sometimes because 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.719
 who are exposed to see 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.879
 enke 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.470
 where is all that I know that content 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.279
 he believes that what happened he said that they should find out what measures to take 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.529
 to correct a bit strange 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.909
 with it are taking steps n 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.609
 none at European level which is where many times marked a bit the pattern 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.099
 a forecast of an increase in the sales of a regulation so that 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.349
 Crack the summer 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.860
 which will make percent the unified criteria at European level so the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.439
 hopes of consumers are now put into this new regulation 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.050
 for now 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.199
 we will continue demanding hieroglyphs to know the ingredients of lights like 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:44.550
 these
