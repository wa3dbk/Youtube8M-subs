wrapped in plastic bags nothing else in
the<00:01:41.719> box<00:01:43.659> as<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.899> see<00:01:45.020> when<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.229> take<00:01:45.380> it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
the box as you can see when you take it

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.959 
the box as you can see when you take it
off<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:46.130> can<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:47.869> does<00:01:48.079> come<00:01:48.289> off<00:01:48.789> just<00:01:49.789> have<00:01:49.939> a

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
off you can it does come off just have a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.449 
off you can it does come off just have a
90<00:01:50.270> degree<00:01:50.360> no<00:01:50.630> rotation<00:01:51.079> a<00:01:51.289> bit<00:01:51.979> more<00:01:52.189> than<00:01:52.310> 90

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
90 degree no rotation a bit more than 90

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.600 
90 degree no rotation a bit more than 90
degrees<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.229> little<00:01:54.560> ball<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.219> it

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
degrees so it is a little ball so it

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.459 
degrees so it is a little ball so it
does<00:01:55.759> have<00:01:55.969> some<00:01:56.270> flexibility<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:57.140> where<00:01:57.409> you

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
does have some flexibility on where you

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:03.010 
does have some flexibility on where you
can<00:01:57.590> rotate<00:01:57.740> it<00:02:01.179> standard<00:02:02.179> suction<00:02:02.659> mount<00:02:02.840> I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
can rotate it standard suction mount I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.580 
can rotate it standard suction mount I
believe<00:02:04.119> where<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.270> rotate<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.989> then<00:02:06.110> as<00:02:06.380> you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
believe where you rotate and then as you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.050 
believe where you rotate and then as you
can<00:02:06.709> see<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:08.860> basically<00:02:09.860> compresses<00:02:10.549> or<00:02:10.789> pulls

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
can see it basically compresses or pulls

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.690 
can see it basically compresses or pulls
it<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.329> as<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.260> turn<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.590> let's<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
it in as you turn it let's get the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.120 
it in as you turn it let's get the
suction<00:02:13.880> mount<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.569> um<00:02:15.760> foam<00:02:18.130> basically

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
suction mount here um foam basically

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.410 
suction mount here um foam basically
extends<00:02:19.849> quite<00:02:20.090> far<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.790> that's<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.209> part

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
extends quite far so that's the part

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.809 
extends quite far so that's the part
where<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.630> extend<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.430> it'll<00:02:25.430> basically

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
where you extend it it'll basically

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.930 
where you extend it it'll basically
adjust<00:02:26.450> got<00:02:26.930> foam<00:02:27.140> padding<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.650> side<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
adjust got foam padding on the side and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.569 
adjust got foam padding on the side and
like<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.049> you<00:02:30.530> basically<00:02:30.709> just<00:02:30.980> mounts<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
like so you basically just mounts the

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.289 
like so you basically just mounts the
phone<00:02:31.730> my<00:02:31.910> bad<00:02:33.190> as<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.310> can<00:02:34.459> see<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.090> back

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
I think special um hmm that's about it

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.809 
I think special um hmm that's about it
for<00:02:41.389> the<00:02:41.569> most<00:02:41.720> part<00:02:42.100> basically<00:02:43.100> amounts<00:02:43.730> like

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
for the most part basically amounts like

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.050 
for the most part basically amounts like
