00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.330
 Defeat number 6 in a row should 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.820
 Please understand for mainz 05 understands 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.710
 The TSG will be performing on Saturday in the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.929
 Rhineland Palatinate capital no 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.249
 Out of the way suitable for recreation 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.539
 is 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.220
 I think that's our worst 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.429
 that was the game that we have now 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.990
 we expect we are totally warned 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.970
 have a similar situation before 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.130
 play in Stuttgart as the opponent with 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 stood back to the wall and then totally 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.320
 aggressive and completely fresh there was against 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.510
 us similar situation i believe is in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 think they have a situation now 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.700
 which was so rarely found 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.360
 try with all makes the turning point 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 to accomplish 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160
 it can be very dangerous too 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.950
 That's why we have to be prepared for everything 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.620
 be the mainzer we will think so yes 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.270
 everything takes over 90 minutes and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.600
 we want to play our game though 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 also want to be on the defensive 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.660
 structured play and not so 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.109
 Allow as much as in the past 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.909
 play 

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:08.579
 our maxime is just that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 our individual individually good 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.789
 players simply the best 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.570
 can develop when the team 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.119
 is working 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.920
 that's what we currently have 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.719
 but the performance of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.509
 kevin not surprising for me either 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.130
 he has good skills he must have been 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.079
 however, work reasonably and the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.159
 I have a clear head right now 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:32.069
 do not consider him regularly and he 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.020
 is absolutely clear in the bulb 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.369
 I think if the enemy just 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.990
 also tries to beat scheine 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 then he does not fall and he stands then 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.590
 still stable since that is 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 already as he must first as so in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.249
 you have to cut the tree if you have it there 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 want to bring away that's something 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:49.229
 this robustness that draws him 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.639
 already a great thing 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.689
 and I think if he is not quite like that 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.789
 would have been robust probably 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.909
 also get the eleven against Schalke 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.490
 So in the leg in the 16er still 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.409
 once in the second situation 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.970
 less robust player falls faster 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.850
 but he has one 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.250
 one of two trees in the ground 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.130
 rammed and then been heavy 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.550
 That's why I think so, I think so 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.380
 a robust player I'm like that 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.460
 but they can say they can do it 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.960
 can also take a lot 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.490
 that was also on my way 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.960
 given that I do not because of everyone 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.180
 triviality right away yes you should that 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.310
 I'm even on the teeth 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.650
 to bite and I am too 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.870
 basically the type of player 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.320
 rather robust and that's where it belongs 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.880
 everything I think about this in mainz will be 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.890
 certainly not hurt and maybe 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.840
 his tree-trunk-like legs help him 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.990
 year to achieve its fifth season goal 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.410
 and or tsg the next out of 40 too 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.410
 grant
