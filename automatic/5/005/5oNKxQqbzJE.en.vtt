probably<00:05:18.200> seven<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.890> eight<00:05:19.070> mutants<00:05:19.550> and<00:05:19.730> it's

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
probably seven to eight mutants and it's

all right yeah this map can either be

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.850 
all right yeah this map can either be
really<00:06:15.349> short<00:06:15.770> or<00:06:17.139> not<00:06:18.139> very<00:06:18.319> long<00:06:18.590> at<00:06:18.800> all

actually 456 was the time yeah very
quick<00:06:24.379> map<00:06:24.620> if<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:25.099> just<00:06:25.310> plow<00:06:25.550> through<00:06:25.580> it

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
quick map if you just plow through it

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.869 
quick map if you just plow through it
the<00:06:26.840> secret<00:06:27.199> areas<00:06:27.590> yeah<00:06:28.159> the<00:06:28.370> majority<00:06:28.490> of

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
the secret areas yeah the majority of

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.659 
the secret areas yeah the majority of
this<00:06:29.090> map<00:06:29.300> is<00:06:29.569> the<00:06:29.840> secret<00:06:30.229> area<00:06:30.560> which<00:06:31.310> I<00:06:31.430> kind

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
this map is the secret area which I kind

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.290 
this map is the secret area which I kind
of<00:06:31.729> find<00:06:31.969> fascinating<00:06:32.210> but<00:06:33.340> kind<00:06:34.340> of<00:06:34.490> too<00:06:34.789> easy

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
of find fascinating but kind of too easy

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.309 
of find fascinating but kind of too easy
for<00:06:36.370> a<00:06:37.370> floor<00:06:37.699> 7<00:06:38.150> that<00:06:38.330> is<00:06:38.509> apart<00:06:38.960> from<00:06:39.050> the

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 
for a floor 7 that is apart from the

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.800 
for a floor 7 that is apart from the
final<00:06:39.710> purple<00:06:40.219> room<00:06:40.490> with<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.360> mutants

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
final purple room with the mutants

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.809 
final purple room with the mutants
that's<00:06:42.050> very<00:06:42.529> dangerous<00:06:43.129> and<00:06:43.310> I'm<00:06:43.400> surprised

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819 
that's very dangerous and I'm surprised

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.689 
that's very dangerous and I'm surprised
I<00:06:44.029> came<00:06:44.240> out<00:06:44.590> with<00:06:45.590> a<00:06:45.620> lot<00:06:45.949> of<00:06:46.009> health<00:06:46.340> still

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
I came out with a lot of health still

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.260 
I came out with a lot of health still
remaining<00:06:47.120> and<00:06:48.580> look<00:06:49.580> at<00:06:49.669> the<00:06:49.789> score<00:06:50.090> at<00:06:50.210> the

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
remaining and look at the score at the

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.510 
remaining and look at the score at the
bottom<00:06:50.659> you<00:06:50.779> see<00:06:50.810> the<00:06:51.020> 0<00:06:51.500> for<00:06:51.919> 8

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
bottom you see the 0 for 8

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.689 
bottom you see the 0 for 8
well<00:06:52.729> that<00:06:53.240> means<00:06:53.479> 48<00:06:54.379> thousand<00:06:54.919> 400<00:06:55.129> right

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699 
well that means 48 thousand 400 right

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.719 
well that means 48 thousand 400 right
well<00:06:56.029> the<00:06:56.900> 1<00:06:57.199> in<00:06:57.529> front<00:06:57.770> of<00:06:57.919> the<00:06:58.009> 0<00:06:58.279> couldn't

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
well the 1 in front of the 0 couldn't

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.769 
well the 1 in front of the 0 couldn't
fit<00:06:59.000> so<00:06:59.210> it's<00:06:59.360> 1<00:06:59.659> million<00:07:00.219> 48,000<00:07:01.779> million

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779 
fit so it's 1 million 48,000 million

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:05.439 
fit so it's 1 million 48,000 million
points<00:07:03.259> it's<00:07:03.889> all<00:07:04.039> those<00:07:04.219> crowns<00:07:04.639> man<00:07:05.000> and<00:07:05.300> the

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
points it's all those crowns man and the

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.839 
points it's all those crowns man and the
mutants<00:07:05.839> the<00:07:06.469> mutants<00:07:06.919> do<00:07:07.099> give<00:07:07.310> out<00:07:07.460> a<00:07:07.490> lot<00:07:07.699> of

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
mutants the mutants do give out a lot of

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.499 
mutants the mutants do give out a lot of
points<00:07:08.210> when<00:07:08.389> you<00:07:08.479> kill<00:07:08.719> them<00:07:09.909> so<00:07:10.909> that's<00:07:11.120> this

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:11.509 
points when you kill them so that's this

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:15.640 
points when you kill them so that's this
map<00:07:11.839> it's<00:07:12.229> not<00:07:12.819> as<00:07:13.819> hard<00:07:14.060> as<00:07:14.330> the<00:07:15.139> previous

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
map it's not as hard as the previous

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.149 
map it's not as hard as the previous
maps<00:07:15.919> have<00:07:16.189> been<00:07:16.689> but<00:07:17.689> nonetheless<00:07:18.469> I<00:07:19.039> do

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:19.159 
maps have been but nonetheless I do

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:21.790 
maps have been but nonetheless I do
enjoy<00:07:19.520> this<00:07:19.909> map<00:07:20.210> and<00:07:20.539> I<00:07:21.319> do<00:07:21.379> sometimes

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
enjoy this map and I do sometimes

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.459 
enjoy this map and I do sometimes
speedrun<00:07:22.699> it<00:07:22.849> just<00:07:23.270> to<00:07:23.569> speedrun<00:07:24.110> it<00:07:24.139> you<00:07:24.349> know

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:24.469 
speedrun it just to speedrun it you know

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.559 
speedrun it just to speedrun it you know
just<00:07:24.500> to<00:07:24.949> see<00:07:25.159> if<00:07:25.279> I<00:07:25.370> can<00:07:25.550> get<00:07:25.729> like<00:07:25.909> under<00:07:26.210> 20

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:26.569 
just to see if I can get like under 20

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:29.200 
just to see if I can get like under 20
seconds<00:07:26.960> or<00:07:27.110> something<00:07:27.849> but<00:07:28.849> we'll<00:07:28.969> see<00:07:29.180> you

seconds or something but we'll see you
in<00:07:29.449> floor<00:07:29.779> 8<00:07:30.020> the<00:07:30.740> aardwolf<00:07:31.460> maze<00:07:32.289> don't<00:07:33.289> know

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:33.379 
in floor 8 the aardwolf maze don't know

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:34.269 
in floor 8 the aardwolf maze don't know
what<00:07:33.500> I'm<00:07:33.589> talking<00:07:33.830> about

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:34.279
