00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.200
 now we are 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.519
 you looked at it well technical view either 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.300
 the one you have before your eyes is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:24.480
 just her 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:25.680
 the car you were all looking for 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.260
 it is not yet time to do the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.390
 big step in the end you don't know it 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.070
 did you know nothing about this car 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 that made you fall in love better 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.030
 check again why here if there are 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.030
 surprises are never nice surprises 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.580
 the seller will have sworn you that the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 previous owner was a 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.199
 nice of the church 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.199
 he kept the car in the garage 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.110
 He used only once a week 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.180
 Sunday to go to mass 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.600
 well maybe there is no need to believe him 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.700
 right up to the end better convince 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 the seller to give you a nice round of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 try and since they are not all 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.350
 experienced mechanics 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.290
 the ideal would be to have a 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 real super expert finally 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.159
 you will realize that your 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.259
 eyes of the real condition of the car 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.820
 that you purchased 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.039
 let's start with the engine that must not be 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.080
 too dirty but not too clean either 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.880
 because otherwise it means they have it 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.840
 washed to hide the traces of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 some loss and now off in motion 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.950
 obviously the car must start immediately and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 without strange noises 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.970
 the affection must have a run 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.680
 regular without steps with steps but not 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 to understand if the clutch does his 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.330
 that is, a foolproof method 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.640
 it accelerates at maximum when you are at 50 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.290
 per hour in fifth or sixth laps of the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.539
 engine and speed must increase 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.710
 together otherwise it means that the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.710
 sled board 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.940
 one steering in good condition you do n't 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.790
 the least noise ever but if you want to do 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.690
 a thorough check is infallible 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.090
 remember the number you find a space 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.790
 sufficiently wide and imagine of 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.470
 score an 8 on the asphalt looks like a 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.690
 game but it is very useful to check 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.400
 that the steering does not make noise at the end 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.590
 race the brakes 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 first the pedal must never give 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.460
 the feeling of being spongy and then 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.410
 to understand how worn they are enough 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.330
 take a look at the hand drawings a 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.640
 hand that wear out along the edge 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.560
 outside a small border is formed 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.110
 consumed a step 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.230
 in short, if this super step is 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.530
 milimetro resign yourself the disks are from 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.510
 throw to want to look at everything 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.460
 we should also take a look at the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.610
 seal of the seals that betray 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.830
 just her 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.320
 the worst causes are usually 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.770
 wear a replacement made so 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.770
 too hasty 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.550
 in short, you never have too many eyes 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.600
 one is never bignoli enough if not 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.520
 you are convinced 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.170
 remember that when the car becomes 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.690
 your problems become yours too 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.040
 however it ends up 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.070
 remember not to be guided by 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.740
 anger and make local mind 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.880
 if there is a guarantee you can ask for 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.880
 be compensated 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.550
 what, however, is certainly better to do 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.260
 immediately take into account all possible 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.780
 technicians on the other hand also says the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.780
 proverb better prevention than pushing 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.830
 to
