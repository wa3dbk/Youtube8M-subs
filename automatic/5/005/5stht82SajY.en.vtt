00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.930 
monitoring and program testing so here's
pretty<00:04:00.090> much<00:04:00.329> where<00:04:00.629> I<00:04:00.660> guess<00:04:01.760> more<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.849> the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
pretty much where I guess more of the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.640 
pretty much where I guess more of the
stuff<00:04:03.209> gets<00:04:03.480> created<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.349> network

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
stuff gets created so in network

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.409 
stuff gets created so in network
monitoring<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.280> got<00:04:05.459> security<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.269> data

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
monitoring and I got security and data

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.110 
monitoring and I got security and data
prevention<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:08.040> know<00:04:08.160> as<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.400> can<00:04:08.430> add<00:04:08.669> users

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
prevention you know as you can add users

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.720 
prevention you know as you can add users
in<00:04:09.269> here<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.709> know<00:04:10.739> take<00:04:11.430> control
