africa<00:00:37.710> i<00:00:37.980> spent<00:00:38.340> quite<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> time<00:00:39.030> there

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
africa i spent quite a lot of time there

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
africa i spent quite a lot of time there
and<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.840> intrigued<00:00:40.020> by<00:00:40.610> finding

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and I was really intrigued by finding

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670 
and I was really intrigued by finding
these<00:00:42.080> structures<00:00:43.080> in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.290> middle<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
these structures in the middle of the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
these structures in the middle of the
landscape<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.519> studied<00:00:44.879> sculpture<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
landscape and I studied sculpture and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.970 
landscape and I studied sculpture and
when<00:00:45.720> I<00:00:45.809> first<00:00:45.989> saw<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.620> thought<00:00:46.769> they

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
when I first saw them I thought they

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
when I first saw them I thought they
were<00:00:47.670> extraordinarily<00:00:48.180> sculptural<00:00:49.019> objects

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
were extraordinarily sculptural objects

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.869 
were extraordinarily sculptural objects
because<00:00:49.589> to<00:00:49.739> make<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> goal<00:00:50.160> post<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> has<00:00:50.699> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because to make a goal post it has to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.460 
because to make a goal post it has to
stand<00:00:51.089> up<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.420> space<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.930> you've<00:00:52.050> got<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> deal

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
stand up in space if you've got to deal

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.290 
stand up in space if you've got to deal
with<00:00:52.500> gravity<00:00:53.129> you've<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.089> make<00:00:54.269> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
with gravity you've got to then make a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.680 
with gravity you've got to then make a
junction<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> top<00:00:55.769> corner<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:57.450> all

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
junction that in a top corner so all

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.180 
junction that in a top corner so all
those<00:00:57.870> things<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.410> sculptural<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
those things are really sculptural and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.529 
those things are really sculptural and
then<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> noticed<00:00:59.610> that<00:00:59.940> people<00:01:00.059> were<00:01:00.329> using

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
then I noticed that people were using

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
then I noticed that people were using
whatever<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:01.110> found<00:01:01.350> locally<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
whatever they found locally to do that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.410 
whatever they found locally to do that
so<00:01:02.640> there<00:01:03.329> were<00:01:03.420> somewhat<00:01:03.780> stones<00:01:04.530> string

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
so there were somewhat stones string

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.150 
so there were somewhat stones string
drain<00:01:06.420> pipes<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.229> thought<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.830> tapped

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
drain pipes and I thought that tapped

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.620 
drain pipes and I thought that tapped
back<00:01:08.340> into<00:01:08.670> sculpture<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.210> terms<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> being

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
back into sculpture in terms of being

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
back into sculpture in terms of being
very<00:01:09.899> inventive<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.590> materials<00:01:11.190> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
very inventive with materials so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
very inventive with materials so
originally<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> started<00:01:11.910> taking<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.720> because

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
originally I started taking them because

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.749 
originally I started taking them because
I<00:01:13.050> thought<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.920> were<00:01:13.979> an<00:01:14.160> extension<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> what

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
I thought they were an extension of what

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.029 
I thought they were an extension of what
I<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.000> interested<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> sculptor<00:01:16.380> most

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
I was interested in as a sculptor most

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.830 
I was interested in as a sculptor most
of<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> work<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:17.910> not<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.690> work

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
of the work that's not all the work

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.109 
of the work that's not all the work
there's<00:01:19.500> no<00:01:19.590> people<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.880> barely

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
there's no people in it so it's barely

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.210 
there's no people in it so it's barely
know<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> very<00:01:21.630> architectural<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> know

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
know is very architectural but you know

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
know is very architectural but you know
I<00:01:23.250> litter<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.910> thought<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> myself<00:01:24.149> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
I litter and thought to myself it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.270 
I litter and thought to myself it
doesn't<00:01:24.960> need<00:01:25.229> people<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:26.009> need<00:01:26.130> them

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
doesn't need people you don't need them

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370 
doesn't need people you don't need them
because<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.539> society<00:01:28.050> from<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
because you can see the society from the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
because you can see the society from the
goalpost<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.130> meter<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.670> couldn't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
goalpost and what the meter you couldn't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
goalpost and what the meter you couldn't
have<00:01:30.150> articulated<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> better<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
have articulated it better but and it is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.890 
have articulated it better but and it is
about<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.610> about<00:01:32.670> allowing<00:01:33.060> people

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
about that it's about allowing people

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
about that it's about allowing people
who<00:01:34.200> look<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.530> photographs<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.220> bring

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
who look at the photographs to bring

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
who look at the photographs to bring
something<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.030> their<00:01:36.180> own<00:01:36.210> imagination<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
something of their own imagination to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
something of their own imagination to
that<00:01:37.619> relationship<00:01:37.860> between<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.549> posts<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that relationship between the posts and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.410 
that relationship between the posts and
their<00:01:39.509> location<00:01:40.110> modern<00:01:40.770> football<00:01:41.420> extremely

completely<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.689> part<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.439> you're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
completely as that part of what you're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.960 
completely as that part of what you're
trying<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.460> society's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
trying to see is about society's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.640 
trying to see is about society's
difference<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.479> football<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.140> sport<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
difference with football or sport and

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.620 
difference with football or sport and
the<00:01:52.920> disconnect<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:54.180> that's<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> route

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the disconnect I think that's a route

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.969 
the disconnect I think that's a route
that's<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.930> very<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.229> question<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.860> you're

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that's a very good question and you're

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.460 
that's a very good question and you're
absolutely<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:57.049> football<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.409> it

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
absolutely right football as we know it

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.520 
absolutely right football as we know it
here<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.490> elite<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.570> exclusive<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.320> one

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
here is so elite and so exclusive in one

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.200 
here is so elite and so exclusive in one
sense<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> i'm<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.579> interested<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
sense and i'm really interested in that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.630 
sense and i'm really interested in that
the<00:02:03.540> way<00:02:03.689> people<00:02:03.720> connect<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.590> very<00:02:05.159> very

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the way people connect a very very

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.789 
the way people connect a very very
simple<00:02:05.970> level<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.659> me<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:07.350> i<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.680> like

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
simple level for me what i really like

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.440 
simple level for me what i really like
about<00:02:07.860> football<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.610> its<00:02:08.790> accessible<00:02:09.299> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
about football is its accessible and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.780 
about football is its accessible and
also<00:02:09.780> level<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.619> although<00:02:10.979> i<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.340> perhaps<00:02:11.519> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
also level and although i have perhaps a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.220 
also level and although i have perhaps a
slightly<00:02:12.030> different<00:02:12.299> understanding<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.959> what

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
slightly different understanding of what

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.509 
slightly different understanding of what
i<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.500> people<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.829> see<00:02:13.950> when<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.130> look<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
i want people to see when I look at the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.310 
i want people to see when I look at the
photographs<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:15.510> mind<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:15.930> level

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
photographs I don't mind what level

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.440 
photographs I don't mind what level
people<00:02:16.530> buy<00:02:16.860> into<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.250> work<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.360> it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
people buy into that work and if it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.120 
people buy into that work and if it
encourages<00:02:18.989> people<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.470> out<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.799> look<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
encourages people to go out and look and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.940 
encourages people to go out and look and
do<00:02:20.250> their<00:02:20.430> own<00:02:20.459> thing

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
do their own thing

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.979 
do their own thing
fantastic<00:02:21.670> golf<00:02:22.180> course<00:02:22.420> I've<00:02:22.569> got<00:02:22.720> one

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
fantastic golf course I've got one

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.780 
fantastic golf course I've got one
fantastic<00:02:23.410> thing<00:02:23.800> more<00:02:24.010> than<00:02:24.040> anything<00:02:24.280> else

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
fantastic thing more than anything else

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.660 
fantastic thing more than anything else
naturally<00:02:25.780> they<00:02:26.379> look<00:02:26.590> like<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.890> frame<00:02:27.160> yeah

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
naturally they look like a frame yeah

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.729 
naturally they look like a frame yeah
absolutely<00:02:27.970> they<00:02:28.540> work<00:02:28.690> exactly<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.349> that

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
absolutely they work exactly like that

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.320 
absolutely they work exactly like that
in<00:02:29.890> terms<00:02:30.069> of<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> photographs<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.090> felt

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
in terms of the photographs and I felt

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.119 
in terms of the photographs and I felt
it<00:02:31.420> was<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:31.629> important<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> position

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
it was really important to position

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.040 
it was really important to position
myself<00:02:33.310> relative<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.480> goalpost<00:02:34.870> where

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
myself relative to the goalpost where

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.750 
myself relative to the goalpost where
the<00:02:35.140> penalty<00:02:35.530> spot<00:02:35.560> might<00:02:36.069> have<00:02:36.280> been<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
the penalty spot might have been so it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.600 
the penalty spot might have been so it
just<00:02:37.000> operates<00:02:37.599> like<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.930> frame<00:02:38.319> so<00:02:38.890> no<00:02:39.459> matter

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
just operates like a frame so no matter

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.030 
just operates like a frame so no matter
where<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.569> country<00:02:41.260> there<00:02:41.500> was<00:02:41.530> something

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
where the country there was something

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.430 
where the country there was something
which<00:02:42.160> was<00:02:42.340> absolutely<00:02:42.630> identical<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:44.170> all<00:02:44.260> of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
which was absolutely identical in all of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.990 
which was absolutely identical in all of
them<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.370> city<00:02:45.550> which<00:02:45.849> you've

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
them but you go to a city which you've

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.150 
them but you go to a city which you've
never<00:02:46.030> visited<00:02:46.510> before<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.799> view<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
never visited before with a view to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.770 
never visited before with a view to
taking<00:02:48.190> photographs<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:49.180> gold<00:02:49.390> posts<00:02:49.569> it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
taking photographs of gold posts it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.300 
taking photographs of gold posts it
becomes<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.260> really<00:02:50.530> interesting<00:02:50.890> way<00:02:51.280> of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
becomes a really interesting way of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.850 
becomes a really interesting way of
beginning<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.940> understand<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.750> place<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> city<00:02:53.739> a

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
beginning to understand a place a city a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.500 
beginning to understand a place a city a
landscape<00:02:54.430> which<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.790> might<00:02:55.030> never<00:02:55.360> have

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
landscape which you might never have

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.600 
landscape which you might never have
encountered<00:02:55.989> them<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.709> know<00:02:56.860> previously<00:02:57.370> and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
encountered them you know previously and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.729 
encountered them you know previously and
I<00:02:57.640> quite<00:02:57.849> like<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.269> idea<00:02:58.599> of<00:02:58.810> discerning

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
I quite like that idea of discerning

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.589 
I quite like that idea of discerning
this<00:02:59.920> searching<00:03:00.220> out<00:03:00.579> for<00:03:00.880> something<00:03:01.090> when

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
this searching out for something when

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.630 
this searching out for something when
you<00:03:01.750> find<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.110> gold<00:03:02.440> post<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.950> Italy<00:03:03.310> scoring

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
you find that gold post is Italy scoring

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.460 
you find that gold post is Italy scoring
a<00:03:03.730> goal<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.180> actually<00:03:07.450> sometimes<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.290> find

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
a goal it is actually sometimes you find

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.960 
a goal it is actually sometimes you find
things<00:03:08.680> which<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:09.010> just<00:03:09.190> think<00:03:09.340> well<00:03:09.579> that<00:03:09.819> is

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
things which you just think well that is

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.940 
things which you just think well that is
stunning<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.599> mean<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.019> really<00:03:11.380> surprises<00:03:11.769> me

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
stunning I mean what really surprises me

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.339 
stunning I mean what really surprises me
it's<00:03:12.370> two<00:03:12.700> verticals<00:03:13.299> in<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.480> horizontal<00:03:13.750> but

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
it's two verticals in a horizontal but

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.069 
it's two verticals in a horizontal but
actually<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.980> creativity<00:03:15.489> in<00:03:15.970> how<00:03:16.510> those<00:03:16.840> are

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
actually the creativity in how those are

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.259 
actually the creativity in how those are
done<00:03:17.290> I'm<00:03:17.560> amazed<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.220> every<00:03:18.790> time<00:03:18.970> they're

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
done I'm amazed that every time they're

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.479 
done I'm amazed that every time they're
completely<00:03:19.390> unique<00:03:20.260> they're<00:03:20.590> really<00:03:20.829> special

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
completely unique they're really special

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.009 
completely unique they're really special
and<00:03:21.670> sometimes<00:03:22.299> you'll<00:03:22.450> find<00:03:22.660> one<00:03:22.810> what<00:03:22.930> you

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
and sometimes you'll find one what you
