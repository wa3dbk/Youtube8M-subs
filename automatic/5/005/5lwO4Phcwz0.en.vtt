00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.299
 hello here i am germain lpk and today 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.570
 more of the reason a guest gameplay of 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:14.119
 dirty crispbread he plays he plays 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.880
 here battlefield 3 on the meppener 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.560
 Channels and there you can only one mode 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.080
 playing in the deathmatch is yet 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.900
 logical he to the video title yes 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.330
 read battlefield soon and annually 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.430
 I think the battlefield is playing that 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.480
 really something about the series is the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.200
 almost the heart stops 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.700
 his 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.170
 because that's pretty much the worst 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.820
 what to play as a battlefield player 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.159
 can imagine one 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.359
 release of the game every yes 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:43.399
 every twelve months 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.190
 the question is whether battlefield for every year 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.249
 the employee may have appeared 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.479
 blake jorgensen a journalist 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:55.370
 answered a trade show and he said bob 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.789
 bring her memorial but would 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.559
 second developer studio need yes 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.600
 and I'll just ask you this way 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.280
 We can not do that in a stupid way 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.050
 Another game also a giant 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.510
 blockbuster shooter the biggest 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.690
 competition to battlefield call of duty 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.640
 Of course I know that's her and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.230
 if that is always so positive if you 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.420
 has two developer studios and all 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.710
 Twelve months I bring out a new game 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.600
 think that answered call of duty 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.910
 actually quite good because it is not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.220
 always so useful 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.020
 he has for a two developer studios 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.000
 means the produce though 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.850
 same series but somehow something 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.920
 different and have their own ideas 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.190
 well, and on the other side it is like that 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.390
 the desire is lost permanently 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.050
 if you play new game every year 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.480
 bring out 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.190
 because simply this factor man there 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.990
 something new comes up a bit 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.190
 he loses white is easy 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.160
 it has become routine 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.090
 special more 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.400
 yes, and therefore I think this leaves 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.409
 statement of Mr. jorgensen first so 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.550
 pretty much every passionate battlefield 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.830
 players hands over head together 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.440
 beat or like my video 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.690
 said I had my head over my hands 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.030
 Of course, one thing is for sure 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.319
 also a nice idea 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.770
 unfortunately that does not correspond to the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.360
 actual saying but no matter 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.130
 I want you still doing here first 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.780
 the original wording of Mr. years 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.700
 are reading so that you are about 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.140
 okay, what did he say? 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 because he does not just have that one sentence 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 York , I would imagine 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.860
 needs about two developer studios so 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.060
 I quote that would be one 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.350
 challenge for the man 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.810
 most likely two studios 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.000
 needed because it is hard to do it 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.230
 It's about a two-year project 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.060
 need about two for battlefield 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.410
 years for development would have to 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.090
 make sure you have the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.740
 skills of the employees between the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.450
 studios shares with the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.830
 core capabilities of the product and the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.330
 experience for the customer 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.350
 stay 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.660
 besides, you have to be very careful 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.240
 that you do not destroy the stamps 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.950
 it would have to be enthusiastic and different 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.450
 but at the same time you want to make sure 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.700
 that the great brand got 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.390
 Battlefield remains not sold 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.600
 once only 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.300
 it does not sell for 24 months 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.310
 only as a battlefield but with all those 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.090
 battlefield premium activities the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.040
 customer demands 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.350
 So you have to be careful too 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.000
 that you do not share this appendix to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.800
 battlefield product destroyed quote end 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.660
 yes, so it would be there 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.250
 financial benefits and potentials 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.530
 bring a release every year 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.170
 would be seen 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.970
 but he says fortunately we 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.980
 endanger the entire battlefield 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.650
 3 and how endangered also a large part 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.180
 our player and I think so 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.930
 Very good that they are the principle 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.090
 see 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.280
 because it could well there I am too 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.700
 the opinion be possible that many 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.100
 I think it's very smart 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.200
 that he says I play the game 24 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.940
 for months, say sold when 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.310
 then comes out two years later 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.280
 long with this one game also money 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.480
 that means it is actually done 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.100
 not useful every year 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.740
 because people are buying 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.440
 the game at any time what I 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.090
 on the other hand, it's pretty funny and 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.570
 actually view as wrong is 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.140
 the statement premium activities of the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.780
 customer demands 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.880
 dear electronic arts i have premium 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.040
 never demands so that is completely me 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.979
 Far away that somehow premium times 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.750
 my wish list was over if 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.820
 a new battlefield would come out 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.890
 I like to pay the price again 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.830
 and then a few dlcs gets it 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.260
 former times was free so watchful but 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.910
 well you have to advertise the product and yes 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.280
 that's because in dom marketing language 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.930
 but it is always funny so what 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.820
 to read because no pig on this 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.830
 planet wanted to premium some day 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.990
 that's more like a product 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.970
 many vilify and that is by the way 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.840
 a nice point also premium what would be 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.120
 for now 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.250
 utopian when battlefield every year 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.470
 then there would be any 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.020
 I then pay premium every year 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.210
 50 euros for the game and another 50 euros 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.060
 premium that's probably not it 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.740
 and what synonymous dlcs concerned that's one 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.970
 real chord worker it would have to be so 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.430
 the shorter one 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.750
 in shorter part would have more dlcs 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.690
 produced a total of more 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.490
 apps so i dont know i am the one 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.710
 opinion that the row battlefield 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.480
 not good if we do that from one 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.550
 consider other viewpoint 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.860
 Let's take a look at battlefield 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.080
 3 happened to battlefield 4 is many 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.510
 players from battlefield 4 say yes 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.950
 The game is not finished yet 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.330
 some more might still have 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.330
 needed half a year 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.780
 Now we have to think about what happens 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.660
 if now everyone could get out of the game 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.210
 Well the time is getting shorter despite two 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.130
 studios so somehow that's the time 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.900
 technically a bit tighter 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.810
 Knitted especially if ever 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.100
 Something is then you really get in 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.110
 the bredouille because you have to play the game 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.880
 train every year so i believe 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.450
 that just does not do the series well 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.280
 would 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.410
 I think that this series will take more time 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.870
 needs and I also believe that this 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.470
 row made by a developer studio 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.030
 must be and that dice and that of 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.040
 The employees have been around for a long time 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.090
 are there or come for my sake yes 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.420
 also new people every now and then 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.310
 That's a question, but still 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.960
 The core team should be as possible 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.400
 stay and that is the see 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.350
 I consider it to be incredibly important 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.150
 Two developers are bumping into the world 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.370
 I believe that the produce 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.600
 battlefield-row then quite 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.250
 also develop in two directions 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.420
 could not be want 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.740
 So I want to beg this ultimate 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.630
 experience is so beautiful 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.890
 marketing language and that 's easy 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.810
 no longer the case if he suddenly 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.920
 several research turn around I'm 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.410
 absolutely the opinion 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.900
 and also what the further development of the 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.730
 engine, etc 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.050
 the one developing to the left the 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.480
 others evolve to the right 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.430
 that's that then somehow everything fits 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.780
 not more and also the anticipation goes 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.150
 If I suddenly lost every one of them 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.380
 year at battlefield 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.610
 that's just like cod and me 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.800
 have recently made a video where I 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.750
 I said okay now I'll put cod 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.610
 because I really do not feel like it 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.220
 currently on the line every year 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.750
 then new part there and somehow it is 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.910
 but always the same when you are 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.200
 think about the differences of 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.840
 battlefield 3 to battlefield 4 are yes 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.590
 not too extreme 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.000
 and I think that's the way it always is 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.010
 it would be the same 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.210
 always give marginal changes and that 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.590
 I do not want I want if that 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.140
 next battlefield comes out 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.460
 battlefield five that this game then 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.020
 really a strong one again 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.370
 development towards battlefield 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.420
 4 is and not as it is now between 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.620
 Battlefield 3 and 4 happened so I am 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.110
 would definitely interest now 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.600
 as you may see the whole thing 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.160
 yes there are some sanyo every year 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.980
 such a part is still cool then you have 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.200
 more games and more variety is yes 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.880
 also an argument good otherwise it was 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.880
 the first time until the next video
