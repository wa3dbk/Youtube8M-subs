00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.630
 the fisherman joseph asensio initiated a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.030
 coyhaique hunger strike against 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.100
 fishing law sharpening the opposition that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.719
 keeps craftsmanship in front of the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.940
 new regulations driven by the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 Executive through the so - called law 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.890
 longueira because they estimate that only 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.650
 it benefits the big industrialists what 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.170
 only that the minister seeks to deliver in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.340
 property of seven families of this country 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 the fishing heritage forever here 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.370
 there has been talk of 10 of 15 or 20 years 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.999
 that is false we allow the license 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.640
 class for the industry are eternal are 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:47.909
 heritable are transferable 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.190
 the previous fishing law of 2001 delivered 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.469
 92 percent of the fish to the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.719
 industrial fisheries for trawling 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 Although this technique is questioned 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.530
 for the serious damage it causes in the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.420
 marine ecosystems and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.089
 overexploitation of fishing biomass 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.220
 what remains of the fishing quota is 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.100
 for the 60,000 artisanal fishermen 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 that supply 95 percent of the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 central markets the seven family 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.530
 English 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 in the fishing world no more than 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.500
 50 years I am giving you 50 years in 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.200
 I change the town of the fishermen 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.869
 artisanal the original people we are 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.820
 here forever and they are to them 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.880
 that are taking away the resources we are 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 we the disadvantaged the problem 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.420
 is that the industry the resources 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.850
 fishing that is right and the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 industry which is fishing less 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.140
 Jaurel ended in the country thanks to 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.670
 the industry devastated the horse mackerel resource 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.130
 nobody should forget that the industry 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.509
 had 95 percent of the share of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 horse mackerel for 12 years and that resource is 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.759
 collapsed venues with almost 4 million 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.090
 tons of horse mackerel and now the industry 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.500
 is looking for no more than 300 thousand then 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.539
 it's not that we have gone up 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.789
 our disembarkation but that the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.489
 industry lowered theirs because they have 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.649
 depredated the resources in the last 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.380
 time the seven families designated as 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.870
 the owners of the sea have merged in 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.680
 three large conglomerates that control 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.900
 76 percent 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.730
 industrial fishing capacity and 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.799
 they distribute profits calculated in 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.390
 less about 3 billion dollars 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.210
 annual 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.370
 this is opposed by artisans being 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.610
 hard repressed and reviled by the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.680
 government disqualifies the leaders 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.870
 use the weapons that the state uses 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 to carabinero to dissolve the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.680
 movements of fishermen that in 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.070
 our just in them we are in the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.900
 street repressing us with bullets what 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.700
 occurs just in constitution what 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.430
 happened in Valparaíso what happened in 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.280
 I chiloé what is happening in aysén in 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.510
 the fishing cove in the country are 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.250
 mobilizing and the state is 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.020
 responding to those with bands 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.019
 Mr. Longueira has to tell the 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.239
 true he did not export to this country that he like that 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.970
 as he said yesterday and I'm a fanatic in 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.650
 say yesterday of doctor to the fishermen 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.860
 handcrafted by saying that the leaders 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.860
 we are funded by the industry that 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.760
 tell me my face al fresco if anything 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.129
 I am a sold this corn 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.739
 if he has to check that I 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.510
 received money from the industry but so 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.970
 I have enough capacity and I am 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.250
 honest is to tell Mr. Longueira his 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.439
 presidential campaign is going to be financed 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.629
 by the industrialists because he was not 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.819
 there because you are the one who is going to receive 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.379
 the benefit of the property that you 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.629
 are reaching the industrial by 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.640
 fishermen pointed out that they no longer 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.989
 they have confidence in the executive so 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.840
 who announced they would continue with the 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.269
 mobilizations waiting to change the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.159
 outcome of the previous processing and 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.620
 allow this office of ten thousand 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:00.239
 years of history stay alive 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.239
