00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
maybe the the Authentics a little

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.920 
maybe the the Authentics a little
thicker<00:03:42.760> this<00:03:43.760> face<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.269> little<00:03:44.450> thinner<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
thicker this face is a little thinner a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.690 
thicker this face is a little thinner a
little<00:03:45.200> smoother<00:03:46.269> um<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.830> mean<00:03:48.830> again<00:03:49.459> might

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
little smoother um I mean again might

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.199 
little smoother um I mean again might
just<00:03:49.880> be<00:03:50.000> smoother<00:03:50.390> because<00:03:50.510> it's<00:03:50.750> new<00:03:50.959> but

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
just be smoother because it's new but

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.220 
just be smoother because it's new but
who<00:03:53.209> fucking<00:03:53.660> knows

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
who fucking knows

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.960 
who fucking knows
um<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:55.610> zipper<00:03:56.150> says<00:03:56.810> babe<00:03:57.560> I<00:04:00.760> think<00:04:01.760> that

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
um the zipper says babe I think that

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.860 
um the zipper says babe I think that
might<00:04:02.150> be<00:04:02.180> one<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.630> flaws<00:04:02.900> because<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.739> know

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
might be one of the flaws because I know

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.110 
might be one of the flaws because I know
the<00:04:05.870> authentic<00:04:06.410> at<00:04:06.620> least<00:04:06.799> either<00:04:07.760> seems<00:04:08.030> a

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
the authentic at least either seems a

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.610 
the authentic at least either seems a
little<00:04:08.209> weird<00:04:08.329> maybe<00:04:09.019> it's<00:04:09.200> just<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.440> one

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
little weird maybe it's just this one

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.569 
little weird maybe it's just this one
this<00:04:09.769> one<00:04:09.950> says<00:04:10.160> babe<00:04:11.500> on<00:04:12.500> both<00:04:12.650> sides<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.220> the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
this one says babe on both sides but the

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:21.699 
this one says babe on both sides but the
top<00:04:13.820> zipper<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.440> YKK<00:04:17.739> these<00:04:19.900> don't<00:04:20.900> say<00:04:21.049> YKK

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
top zipper is a YKK these don't say YKK

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.000 
top zipper is a YKK these don't say YKK
anyway<00:04:22.070> so<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:23.380> think<00:04:24.380> that's<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.830> one<00:04:24.950> thing

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
anyway so I think that's the one thing

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.180 
anyway so I think that's the one thing
