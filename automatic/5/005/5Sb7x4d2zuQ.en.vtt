 Shell's spokesperson kept the aex 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.270
 is this saying that it is certain what do you think you have that you know 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.520
 that does mention the timeline 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.579
 the day ended was the best but i prefer to wait worth it 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:27.890
 concerns one 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 you can drive 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.370
 what is 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.230
 were by the eye of the world 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.560
 but it's a big bussemaker lie all 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.370
 he worked in the third quarter 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.740
 enough 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 and count there but once there are none 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.210
 he seemed 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 I am happy within insiders that day that is on the market 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.730
 that I have here the PVV 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.540
 daily go enne en time he signed an employee there that someone so long 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.430
 filmmakers and then that the reform is according to the npo 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.430
 that is indeed not in heavy weather 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.790
 in front of 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.849
 then I have way too long there too long 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.329
 release to king albert 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.389
 who after a subtle his leadership became extreme right 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.209
 you can shave and with that the strong later he was walking along 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.169
 want to work overtime 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.769
 how that tough year but still a killer to ajax from my 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.869
 the work done 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.779
 in but Warsaw 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.389
 a happy time 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.389
 you often hear bek middelburg 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.379
 and thereby home country for info to the hospital 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.579
 and watching 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.579
 a number of statements 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.909
 near the world with nice plan but he saved the keeper 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.419
 after they got that one there right there I just gotta free job 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.919
 and if you returned more to pieces 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.969
 and cleaned sets 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.909
 it is provided in the neighborhood wanted to enter anp 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.259
 January 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.259
 I think I am wondering 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.789
 and is the point of sale 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.409
 I got that afterwards 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.669
 suarez forlan 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.669
 but the shark bank 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.669
 he turned out to be a back up pace 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.759
 that the leaders in great form 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:20.039
 And just as the alderman is lucky to say that's a compromise this encourages 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.659
 identical to the work 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.659
 but what do I have with that 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.629
 and which you push yourself away a bit 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.779
 more than 50 percent 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.509
 critical questions i am really very sorry 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.779
 2013 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.779
 of perception is that in this neighborhood, morgan want 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.759
 and a lot more experience and your chance this year 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:52.019
