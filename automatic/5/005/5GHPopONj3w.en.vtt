00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.730
 that this is a very interesting code of it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.590
 called a poodle or an alien cat 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.109

 loving attention is like an elf them 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.219
 compared with monkeys because they 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.090
 whether you hire rolling around stealing things and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.520
 disobedient devon rex became known 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.500
 after in the first movie superman

 friske off the tree is amazing but u 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.190
 there is no upper protective long layer 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.030
 wool to the touch they are very warm because 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.079
 that you touch their skin Devon Rex 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 were discovered in devonshire in england 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.449
 1959 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 hence the name of the sofa the second part 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.299
 names rax from rabbits which so 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.659
 called 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.700
 they had the same curly wool

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.979
 soft curly short wool 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.060
 thanks to their short wool they 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.060
 seem rebuilt 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.479
 another distinctive feature is big 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.180
 wide-set eyes 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.439
 I think precisely because of the short hair of the eye 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.610
 seem even bigger 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:40.259
 and unusually large low set ears 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.540

 easy but remember the following is convenient 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.480
 Rex are very short and very curly 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 mustache 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.120
 these hairs tend to break off when 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.410
 inaccurate combing or bathing you 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.410
 can easily break them 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.470
