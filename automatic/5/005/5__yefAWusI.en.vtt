00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hey people like this time you can see here 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.269
 video review info the rapier 6700 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.910
 bluetooth keyboard has the keyboard 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.009
 but not a moped but it offers 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.610
 an integrated one on the right side 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.830
 touchpad 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.900
 this is of course multitouch 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.539
 difficult and very good for windows 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.939
 8 suitable processing keyboard 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.029
 looks very high quality it will be next to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 Stable plastics also metals 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.119
 processed the see on the back 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.850
 can and here is also still 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.969
 The battery cover made of plastic 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 powerconnect switch and two leds 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.960
 Incidentally, batteries are firmly integrated and will 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.300
 loaded via micro usb and you may 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 long with power supply the keyboard 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.629
 is significantly smaller than normal steiner 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.879
 keyboards 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 Nevertheless, she is big enough to enter 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 to make fast 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.030
 It also offers a pleasant 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.699
 pressure point and the buttons are light 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 muted and quiet by the use 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 by bluetooth actually the keyboard 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.589
 Of course, also excellent for use 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.689
 with the tablet like here on the lg pad 8.3 too 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.130
 see is for the production of 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.310
 Connection must be a sequence of numbers 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.750
 be entered and then also 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 confirmed with enter is the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.509
 Connection and the touchpad appears 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 as a mouse pointer just scroll 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.750
 word in screen is something overly sensitive in the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.710
 browser you can see some of the known ones 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.970
 multi-touch gestures to perform 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.009
 unfortunately the keyboard is problematic 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.840
 entered in the English layout 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.299
 But that is a general problem with 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.000
 android and can by means of separate app 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 be resolved 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.520
 Of course you can do yours 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.610
 Pair smartphone with keyboard like this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.439
 that the 2 and the advantage here of course 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.170
 when writing is not and screen 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.090
 keyboard in the way and tapping king 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.159
 is also pretty quick by hand 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.930
 this is a small example 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.009
 the text I would give then that could 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.009
 also follow very well 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.410
 after connecting to the pc is also running 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.390
 here the text input fast and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.350
 error free we see here in this text 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 can three okay 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.800
 almost faultless little typo it 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.850
 should of course hot 6700 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.130
 mainly you can the size of the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.540
 keyboard reduce the speed 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.060
 and maybe even small ones 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.270
 typos cause the operation of the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.670
 Touchpads is okay but I do not care 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.200
 I prefer a pen so too 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.820
 no mouse but more such a piece of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.730
 graphic tablet scrolling in web browser 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.810
 and the zoom works that only again 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.810
 very good with me 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.090
 summed up, I can tell you that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.400
 is a very small and very pretty 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.680
 Bluetooth keyboard is also very nice 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.690
 Handy does not weigh much but weighs 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.080
 I had not included that now 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:08.350
 Therefore quite briefly the weight of 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:11.440
 keyboard is 260 grams is so 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.470
 So also quite easy and approximate 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.700
 make good smartphone and enjoy 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.340
 is above all in that here is 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.200
 not only with the pc can use if 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.569
 you have in matching bluetooth dongle 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.180
 but also with your tablet or 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.010
 smartphone is the typing 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.540
 some determines much better of 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.410
 the hand as over the touchscreen 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.390
 keyboard 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.890
 The pressure point keyboard is on everyone 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.870
 case also very pleasant the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.180
 Noise is alright many 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.069
 or say some complain well 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.220
 because in the middle a bit through 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.860
 that's right if you put hero on it 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.049
 then it really bends through 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.810
 right here not a left 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.840
 not either and the middle because here 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.670
 just not a nipple what is under it 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.290
 like here these feet but there 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.870
 Can you help yourself and that? 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.359
 simply in the hardware store or looking for small 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.190
 are icons to get rubber foot or 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.739
 rubber and then down here in the 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.450
 pack it in the middle and then it is not 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.060
 problem for the people the right time 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.070
 with power on keyboard we hit completely 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.700
 normal does not type that field 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.920
 further on 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.789
 disadvantageous I also found who blind 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.959
 Tips like me often will be here 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.090
 have to change very much at keyboard 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.450
 much smaller than normal 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.190
 keyboard and I would be there already 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.410
 biggest disadvantage now arrived and 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.169
 Although the touchpad works as soon as possible 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.940
 I am also quite decent though 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.650
 someone who likes to have his hand here 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.180
 has and then makes inputs and there 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.190
 I always get by hand 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.470
 on the touchpanel makes any 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.600
 information for this reason is the 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.680
 keyboard for me for the pc is not 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.010
 suitable but for the coach for the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.410
 couch for example http so video pc 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.300
 if you're on the tv now 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.620
 need for inputs and so on 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.479
 i definitely do it very well and 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.120
 I can definitely do that for you 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.410
 to heart because there is no need 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.060
 extra mouse or something and has the same 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.949
 touchpad in the keyboard inside you can 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.240
 the mouse fair taxes and inputs 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:12.000
 So make home theater for home theater is 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.500
 the thing in any case a recommendation 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.050
 as well for smartphone and tablet very much 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.580
 well suited to the pc depends on whether 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.470
 her also the peculiarity have the hand here 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.270
 to hold on like that and eventually arises here 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.220
 if not then definitely a very 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.600
 chic keyboard is not even 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.310
 so expensive that they are very good too 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.050
 processed is that's just how 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.970
 said here metal 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.590
 I assume that aluminum is 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.960
 but could also stole his is it 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.910
 unfortunately nothing and here is how 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.060
 said plastic up here where the battery 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.500
 Inside is like a pc I'm on 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.970
 in any case try another 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.850
 keyboard and there I already have 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.110
 one in the eye of rapeseed is not that 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.180
 I will get the latest model 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.460
 look at and of course find 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.130
 her then a video here 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.750
 video review info i hope i could with 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.340
 help the video further if you ask 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.940
 then just have a comment 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.260
 Post 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.260
 until the next video
