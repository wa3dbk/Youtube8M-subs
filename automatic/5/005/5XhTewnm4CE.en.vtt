00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.759
 what are you doing as a greeting to all the 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.950
 sm band today I will explain how 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.099
 the speed sensor is connected to 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.640
 that on his board he correctly 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:20.630
 speed in miles or kilometers 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.019
 this I did it in an eclipse 1997 rs 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.090
 that was automatic and by doing so standard 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.970
 then you have to connect the sensor 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.079
 speed 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:38.160
 this procedure applies in a 1997 to the 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.160
 99 and also that they be rs or gs 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.950
 to do it they will need their space already 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.270
 either standard or automatic can 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.910
 have left the same and will 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.280
 work in this case I left side 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 automatic and it's working for me 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.320
 correctly 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.010
 they have the connectors on their computer 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.570
 the upper and lower weapon everything 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.790
 we will work on the lower harness 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.800
 I leave the cables unlined here so that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.470
 today you can appreciate how we are going to 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.150
 connect the cables are going to need 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.060
 automotive cable they get in a 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.189
 refactional or automotive electric 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 that are long enough for 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.900
 arrive 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.110
 the sensor that is down here is the one 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.010
 has the blue screw that's where it is 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.010
 the speed sensor 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.070
 and on this sensor will connect the stern 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.620
 is that they can also buy in a 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.140
 harness house or in an electric store 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.270
 or in a junkyard and they can take it 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 the harness to one 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.220
 to a box 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.870
 let's connect the three wires themselves 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.409
 that are going 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.729
 to this harness 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.130
 they are going to peel they are not going to cut 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.429
 they only peel and they unite their three 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.429
 cables 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.490
 what colors are the cables where are we going 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.490
 to join is going to be the yellow wire 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.940
 the black wire with a stripe or stripe 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.480
 green 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.690
 the yellow wire with a stripe or stripe 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.970
 white stripe 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.570
 in zintan so there is no short 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.570
 problem 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.170
 here is the interesting thing 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:44.380
 they will put their harness in this way with 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.569
 him with the insurance or tooth that he stuck there 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.780
 down 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.940
 on the top 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.430
 of this part because it is smooth does not have 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.099
 nothing 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.200
 so looking at it this way my cable 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.349
 green in this case is going to be the cable 1 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.130
 blue is going to be cable 2 and orange 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.260
 is going to be the cable 3 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.610
 in the cable 1 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.160
 what is the green wire I am joining 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.520
 my cable that comes from the cable 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.520
 yellow 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.770
 on cable 2 which is the blue 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.610
 I'm joining 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.180
 the black wire that comes with a fringe 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.180
 green 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.700
 and on cable 3 which is the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.250
 orange I'm joining my cable that 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.290
 comes from the yellow with a fringe 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.290
 white 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.560
 this is how they should be connected 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.050
 and seeing the harness in this position 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.340
 once connecting the ones there should not be 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.239
 no problem and should mark 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.239
 correctly 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.800
 that's all and then a greeting to the band 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.800
 of ccm and sm club mexico
