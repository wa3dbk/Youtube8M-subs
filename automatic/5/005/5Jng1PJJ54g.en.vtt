00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.250
 we are in the circuit of 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.440
 Czech Republic 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.950
 bonus has 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.980
 I think the most important way sanz has commented 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.439
 the technological change of two-stroke bikes some of the problems 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.259
 this obeys damage 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.759
 96 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.220
 and here already the two-stroke engines had already made a 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.409
 the evolution 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.279
 I would tell you that it is the last motion that these engines had before the past 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.070
 all this so much the four times 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.800
 before the year 92 the bikes will be two-stroke engines 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.670
 but it was a lot more power delivery looks much more brutal than the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 motorcycles that agreed to doha in the year 96 in this race for example 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.060
 the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.940
 the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 the sense of fusion of the cylinders change 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 that step of writing bad vip go and that made 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.650
 who bonus that is a nomenclature way of speaking not what you want to say is that 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.520
 the pse in the explosion of the impulses of the books was changed 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.800
 to make the the potential cost much more 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.740
 two seconds 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.899
 I feel physically added and somehow as the pilots had in the 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:10.610
 engine 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.740
 is much more on the wrist in two easier to control 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.840
 formerly motorcycles or power and delivery came from 9 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.150
 10 thousand dead there was a protection change Thursday when the motorcycle in that 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.310
 Was missing 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.270
 and that was a really complicated technique, that's not exactly why 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.829
 year 92 they changed to these to this new composition of engines 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.660
 despite the fact that motorcycles 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.020
 second that is the most similar to points we have today's motorcycles 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.780
 four times 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 of the lack of a more controllable way 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.340
 here you can see 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.410
 he lived that driving style all ways that change more 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:52.079
 we believe that it is more important more working now is the reduction or 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.150
 when the engine 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.670
 the sixth place is 200 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.520
 the corpus you finish march 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.490
 cd the bike had no brakes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.040
 I thought you had to wait for everything with the brakes 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.500
 absolutely give me now with the four-stroke bikes when you cut gas 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 the engine is reduced like a knife 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.469
 the engine is reduced look in August 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.309
 the difficult thing is to accept 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.409
 the braking this is the end of the race the Czech republic that 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.299
 reproduced a very tight semifinal 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.540
 and it was not very clear who won this race they did not offer him cattle 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.950
 álex crivillé hour for which we are all very happy this is the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.320
 97 we are in the circuit of catalonia other important issues as 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.330
 let's throw a group race today also a group is running 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.740
 many cars that are made in a group like this war that we are seeing but 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.509
 other important issues 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:43.329
 of the change in engine technology is that percent motorcycles 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.040
 four times are much more predictable is to say 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.889
 the pilot can control with the old fist 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.989
 much more the reactions of the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.079
 and one of the features we want 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.049
 extend 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.459
 now it is much less one the riders on motorcycle gp motorbikes 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.719
 they are motorcycles that I am giving much more power than they gave the motorcycles 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.569
 it is 500 from the time of remembering that now dry little we were in 1990 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.669
 cubic centimeters almost twice as much power 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:16.139
 of cylinder capacity unlocked were these bikes the power should be around 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.499
 30% plus 20% more than the seat on motorcycles that are here on screen 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:25.949
 but one change the accidents are much less - because the engines of four 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.919
 times makes the pilot can predict heredia anticipate much more 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.200
 reactions of the moto irato gto -the more 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.439
 with the funeral so we are 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.510
 at this dead center was a second ago we have been little because we 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.439
 also the important difference is that the moto gp you enter the leak and 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.160
 they just bring those words 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.719
 what is fortí congratulation to Cuba 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.669
 until these travels facilitates unofficially after fía very strong is 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.129
 making the exit we know with certainty until you're almost from the official to 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.519
 Cuba 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.419
 while the company 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.129
 his tricks and scars disputed in any case I would say that he comments 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.139
 from the point of comparing it with the current technology is that the bikes 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.389
 today they are faster they run happier more speed the restart follows 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.160
 being determinant as before 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.849
 We have to keep in mind 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.069
 very important the slipstream do not do the same in the chair of 125 that goes from 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.139
 motorcycle gp 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.100
 much less in challenging the line say that the line becomes the straight much 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:25.750
 more short 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.080
 and the gilada 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.919
 row 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.419
 the help of triumph 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.479
 much smaller in the big category with the small commune category has 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.479
 sentenced 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.369
 there is that
