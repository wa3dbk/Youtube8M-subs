but either way I'm still gonna pick it
up<00:02:22.420> at<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.659> end<00:02:22.749> of<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> day<00:02:22.930> I'm<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.109> huge

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
up at the end of the day I'm a huge

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.229 
up at the end of the day I'm a huge
Dragon<00:02:23.739> Ball<00:02:23.829> Z<00:02:24.010> panel<00:02:24.400> which<00:02:24.489> will<00:02:24.639> begin<00:02:24.879> in

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
HD remastering of it I guess kind of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.670

cool no online which is another bus in

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.250 
cool no online which is another bus in
my<00:02:29.799> opinion<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:30.689> it's<00:02:31.689> not<00:02:31.900> something<00:02:32.230> like

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
my opinion so it's not something like

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.439 
beginning and it's an RPG I really hope
that<00:02:56.560> comes<00:02:56.919> to<00:02:57.219> the<00:02:57.310> US<00:02:57.639> I<00:02:57.819> don't<00:02:58.000> have<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.150> PSP

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:58.449 
that comes to the US I don't have a PSP

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.849 
that comes to the US I don't have a PSP
but<00:02:58.780> I've<00:02:58.870> been<00:02:59.019> thinking<00:02:59.139> about<00:02:59.409> picking<00:02:59.560> one

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
but I've been thinking about picking one

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.770 
but I've been thinking about picking one
up<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.189> this<00:03:00.669> would<00:03:00.790> be<00:03:00.909> a<00:03:00.939> great<00:03:01.150> reason<00:03:01.569> you

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
up and this would be a great reason you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.670 
up and this would be a great reason you
know<00:03:01.870> another<00:03:02.079> great<00:03:02.230> reason<00:03:02.439> because

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
know another great reason because

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.199 
know another great reason because
there's<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:02.859> lot<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.099> good<00:03:03.519> games<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:03.969> far<00:03:04.120> as
