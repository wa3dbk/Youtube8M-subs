00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
off of one of the blades of crota so you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
off of one of the blades of crota so you
when<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.170> once<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.000> it's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> pretty

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
when you once you get this it's a pretty

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.979 
when you once you get this it's a pretty
basic<00:00:39.480> gun<00:00:39.899> very<00:00:40.260> high<00:00:40.559> rate<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> fire<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:42.809> way

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
basic gun very high rate of fire the way

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.650 
basic gun very high rate of fire the way
to<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.610> upgrade<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.239> via<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to actually upgrade it is via this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.850 
to actually upgrade it is via this
catabolism<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.680> it'll<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.960> take<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
catabolism so it'll actually take I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.119 
catabolism so it'll actually take I
think<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.399> 500<00:00:51.090> kills<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.629> thralls

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
think it's like 500 kills of thralls

think it's like 500 kills of thralls
sounds<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> lot<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> very

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
sounds like a lot you can do it very

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.869 
sounds like a lot you can do it very
quickly<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.050> certain<00:00:55.230> missions

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879

like whoa why would I want to do that
well<00:03:01.650> when<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:01.980> think<00:03:02.190> about<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.579> now<00:03:02.730> with

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
well when you think about it now with

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.619 
well when you think about it now with
the<00:03:03.329> new<00:03:03.450> upgrade<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.230> happened<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
the new upgrade that happened the

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.390 
the new upgrade that happened the
shotguns<00:03:06.629> are<00:03:06.750> pretty<00:03:06.959> beast<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:08.250> is

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
shotguns are pretty beast so this is

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.000 
shotguns are pretty beast so this is
great<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.930> up<00:03:09.930> close<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.620> then<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.980> course

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
great for up close and then of course

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.729 
great for up close and then of course
gala<00:03:11.549> horn<00:03:11.819> probably<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.420> best<00:03:12.690> weapon<00:03:13.620> in

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
gala horn probably the best weapon in

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.319 
gala horn probably the best weapon in
the<00:03:13.859> game<00:03:14.010> definitely<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.670> best<00:03:14.849> rocket

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
the game definitely the best rocket

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.319 
the game definitely the best rocket
launcher<00:03:15.599> by<00:03:15.780> far<00:03:16.519> with<00:03:17.519> those<00:03:17.730> exploding

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
launcher by far with those exploding

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.629 
launcher by far with those exploding
rounds<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.650> what<00:03:19.889> ends<00:03:20.069> up<00:03:20.099> happening<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.519> the

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
rounds so what ends up happening is the

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.909 
rounds so what ends up happening is the
game<00:03:20.849> is<00:03:21.030> confused<00:03:21.450> now<00:03:21.599> this<00:03:21.930> primary<00:03:22.709> has

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
game is confused now this primary has

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.680 
game is confused now this primary has
now<00:03:23.069> disappeared<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.910> when<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.299> walk<00:03:24.510> around

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
now disappeared so when you walk around

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.289 
now disappeared so when you walk around
and<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.919> can<00:03:26.220> see<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.669> a<00:03:26.760> little<00:03:26.790> bit<00:03:27.090> glitch

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
and you can see it's a little bit glitch

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.319 
and you can see it's a little bit glitch
because<00:03:27.480> his<00:03:27.660> player<00:03:27.930> actually<00:03:28.290> doesn't<00:03:28.590> even

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
because his player actually doesn't even

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.629 
because his player actually doesn't even
doesn't<00:03:30.329> generate<00:03:31.049> but<00:03:31.410> what<00:03:32.130> happens<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
doesn't generate but what happens is the

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.879 
doesn't generate but what happens is the
game<00:03:32.819> is<00:03:33.000> now<00:03:33.120> confused<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.290> think<00:03:34.650> since

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
game is now confused and so think since

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.680 
game is now confused and so think since
you<00:03:34.980> don't<00:03:35.160> have<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> primary<00:03:35.669> it's<00:03:36.150> only<00:03:36.569> going

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
you don't have a primary it's only going

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.699 
you don't have a primary it's only going
to<00:03:36.750> drop<00:03:38.030> ammo<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.329> your<00:03:39.660> secondary<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.590> your

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
to drop ammo for your secondary and your

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.500 
to drop ammo for your secondary and your
heavy<00:03:40.889> so<00:03:41.459> you're<00:03:41.669> only<00:03:41.849> going<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.299> in

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
heavy so you're only going to get in

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.349 
heavy so you're only going to get in
this<00:03:42.780> case<00:03:42.989> shotgun<00:03:43.500> ammo<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.950> rockets<00:03:44.370> if

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
this case shotgun ammo and rockets if

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.970 
this case shotgun ammo and rockets if
you<00:03:45.480> wanted<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.109> could<00:03:46.230> do<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.889> know

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
you wanted to you could do it you know

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.650 
you wanted to you could do it you know
with<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.160> nice<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:47.669> I<00:03:47.819> want<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.209> do<00:03:48.299> with<00:03:48.450> an<00:03:48.569> ice

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660
