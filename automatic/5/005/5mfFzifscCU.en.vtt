this<00:02:32.030> video<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:33.319> does<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> great<00:02:33.830> job

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
this video it does a great job

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.880 
this video it does a great job
dissolving<00:02:34.970> oil<00:02:35.450> blocks<00:02:35.900> that's<00:02:36.440> really<00:02:36.769> what

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
dissolving oil blocks that's really what

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920 
dissolving oil blocks that's really what
salicylic<00:02:37.430> acid<00:02:37.910> does<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.510> that's<00:02:38.629> why<00:02:38.750> it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
salicylic acid does and that's why it's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.020 
salicylic acid does and that's why it's
in<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.319> many<00:02:39.530> conventional<00:02:40.250> acne<00:02:40.670> products

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
in so many conventional acne products

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.180 
in so many conventional acne products
but<00:02:41.599> it<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.900> really<00:02:42.080> harsh<00:02:42.470> we<00:02:42.860> don't<00:02:43.040> want

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
but it can be really harsh we don't want

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.860 
but it can be really harsh we don't want
to<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.400> indiscriminately<00:02:44.120> dry<00:02:44.690> out<00:02:44.840> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
to just indiscriminately dry out the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.830 
to just indiscriminately dry out the
skin<00:02:45.049> because<00:02:45.650> what<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.340> does<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:47.540> just

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
skin because what that does is just

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.199 
skin because what that does is just
leaves<00:02:48.170> us<00:02:48.380> with<00:02:48.560> dry<00:02:48.950> skin<00:02:48.980> which<00:02:49.849> is<00:02:50.030> why<00:02:50.180> I

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
leaves us with dry skin which is why I

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.900 
leaves us with dry skin which is why I
only<00:02:50.660> use<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.170> as<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.349> spot<00:02:51.799> treatment<00:02:52.010> only<00:02:52.459> for

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
only use it as a spot treatment only for

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.729 
only use it as a spot treatment only for
short-term<00:02:53.209> use<00:02:53.450> because<00:02:53.930> using<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.470> too

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
short-term use because using it too

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.339 
short-term use because using it too
often<00:02:54.980> can<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.730> cause<00:02:56.000> extreme<00:02:56.930> dryness

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
often can really cause extreme dryness

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.619 
often can really cause extreme dryness
and<00:02:57.709> peeling<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:58.910> don't<00:02:59.030> want<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.329> so

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
and peeling and we don't want that so

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.900 
and peeling and we don't want that so
