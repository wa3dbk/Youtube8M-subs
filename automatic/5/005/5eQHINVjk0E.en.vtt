00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160 
on the bottom fade out automatically but
you<00:02:38.609> can't<00:02:38.909> in<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.209> one<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.840> update

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
you can't in this one so the update

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.520 
you can't in this one so the update
that's<00:02:40.640> what<00:02:41.640> i<00:02:41.670> would<00:02:41.819> change<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
that's what i would change but the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.410 
that's what i would change but the
updates<00:02:43.829> too<00:02:44.069> buggy<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:44.879> me<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:46.489> anytime<00:02:47.489> i'm

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
updates too buggy for me so anytime i'm

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.509 
updates too buggy for me so anytime i'm
doing<00:02:48.690> anything<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.140> force<00:02:49.379> closes<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.400> it

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
doing anything it force closes and it

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.910 
doing anything it force closes and it
does<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.940> about<00:02:51.090> 10<00:02:51.450> times<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.810> day<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.049> i<00:02:52.470> just

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
does that about 10 times a day so i just

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.020 
does that about 10 times a day so i just
couldn't<00:02:53.220> take<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.989> run<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.760> even<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.849> one

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
couldn't take that run and even this one

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.970 
couldn't take that run and even this one
it<00:02:57.299> goes<00:02:57.420> black<00:02:57.659> sometimes<00:02:58.139> but<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.769> not<00:02:58.950> a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
it goes black sometimes but it's not a

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.920 
it goes black sometimes but it's not a
big<00:02:59.190> deal<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.700> it<00:03:00.180> goes<00:03:00.329> black<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.810> then

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
big deal because it goes black and then

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.190 
big deal because it goes black and then
it<00:03:01.019> comes<00:03:01.170> back<00:03:01.319> in<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.769> 10<00:03:02.250> seconds<00:03:03.200> so

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
it comes back in like 10 seconds so

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.569 
it comes back in like 10 seconds so
those<00:03:04.560> are<00:03:04.739> some<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.159> the<00:03:05.250> things<00:03:05.280> i<00:03:05.459> like

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
those are some of the things i like

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.460 
those are some of the things i like
about<00:03:05.639> panda<00:03:06.329> home<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.720> it's<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> lot<00:03:07.109> smoother

got the same drawer thing but you know

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.300 
got the same drawer thing but you know
that<00:03:47.549> doesn't<00:03:47.639> move<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.859> got<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.099> phone

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
that doesn't move and you got the phone

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.059 
that doesn't move and you got the phone
button<00:03:50.549> right<00:03:50.790> there<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.620> then<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.739> settings

right there so those don't take up

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.199 
right there so those don't take up
spaces<00:03:55.199> for<00:03:55.530> your<00:03:55.790> applications<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.030> want

room<00:03:57.389> for<00:03:58.669> anything<00:03:59.669> else<00:03:59.879> that<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.209> want<00:04:00.449> on

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
room for anything else that you want on

your<00:04:00.659> home<00:04:00.870> screen<00:04:01.220> um<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:03.060> can<00:04:03.209> enable<00:04:03.680> this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
your home screen um you can enable this

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.479 
your home screen um you can enable this
then<00:04:04.919> it's<00:04:05.190> called<00:04:05.400> auto<00:04:05.579> scrolling<00:04:06.000> or

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
then it's called auto scrolling or

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.550 
then it's called auto scrolling or
flicks<00:04:08.489> out<00:04:08.790> on<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.030> hold<00:04:09.239> on<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.540> think<00:04:09.629> you<00:04:10.379> look

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
flicks out on a hold on I think you look

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.809 
flicks out on a hold on I think you look
at<00:04:10.739> fast<00:04:11.549> flame<00:04:12.120> okay<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:14.190> know<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.549> can

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
at fast flame okay and you know you can

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.909 
at fast flame okay and you know you can
just<00:04:14.849> get<00:04:15.209> all<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.229> way<00:04:16.289> over<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.620> end<00:04:16.829> of

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
just get all the way over to the end of

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.649 
just get all the way over to the end of
it<00:04:17.039> like<00:04:17.430> your<00:04:18.329> last<00:04:18.599> dock<00:04:19.260> or<00:04:19.739> screen<00:04:20.700> I'm<00:04:21.359> not

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
it like your last dock or screen I'm not

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.670 
it like your last dock or screen I'm not
a<00:04:21.719> big<00:04:21.900> fan<00:04:21.930> of<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.320> either<00:04:22.620> so

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.060 

take<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.610> off<00:04:27.050> but<00:04:28.050> on<00:04:28.259> you<00:04:28.770> can<00:04:28.889> enable

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
take that off but on you can enable

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.999 
take that off but on you can enable
sensor-based<00:04:29.550> rotation<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:31.740> uses<00:04:31.889> your

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
sensor-based rotation so it uses your

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.260 
sensor-based rotation so it uses your
accelerometer<00:04:33.530> but<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.949> just<00:04:35.280> exits<00:04:36.120> out<00:04:36.210> of

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
accelerometer but it just exits out of

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.150 
accelerometer but it just exits out of
whatever<00:04:36.600> it's<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.740> that's<00:04:37.949> what<00:04:38.130> it

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
whatever it's in so that's what it

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.450 
whatever it's in so that's what it
that's<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.669> bummer<00:04:38.820> but<00:04:39.330> on<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:43.440> know<00:04:43.530> we<00:04:44.370> just

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
that's a bummer but on you know we just

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.670 
that's a bummer but on you know we just
work<00:04:47.150> if<00:04:48.150> not<00:04:48.210> slowly<00:04:48.750> they<00:04:49.020> still<00:04:49.259> work<00:04:49.410> so

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
work if not slowly they still work so

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.790 
work if not slowly they still work so
that's<00:04:50.280> good<00:04:50.610> on<00:04:54.110> these<00:04:55.110> things<00:04:55.530> right<00:04:55.740> here

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
that's good on these things right here

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.230 
that's good on these things right here
are<00:04:56.160> what<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.490> really<00:04:56.850> like<00:04:57.030> about<00:04:57.830> GD<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.520> are

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
are what I really like about GD the are

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.040 
are what I really like about GD the are
called<00:05:00.509> application<00:05:01.789> docks<00:05:02.789> maybe<00:05:03.389> anything

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
called application docks maybe anything

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.939 
called application docks maybe anything
missing<00:05:04.470> can<00:05:05.400> find<00:05:05.699> out<00:05:09.349> yeah<00:05:10.349> application

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
missing can find out yeah application
