00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.870
 Rome' 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.599
 because I'm not ashamed of the gospel 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.230
 of Christ because it is power of God 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.430
 to give health to everyone who believes in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.260
 Jewish first and also to Greek 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.440
 because in him the justice of God is 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.760
 discover faith in faith as it is written 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.940
 more the just will live by faith because 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.069
 manifests is the wrath of the god of heaven 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.470
 against all impiety and injustice of the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.620
 men who hold the truth with 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.319
 injustice 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.780
 because what of God is known to them 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.900
 It is manifest because God knows 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.260
 manifested because the invisible things of 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.170
 he his eternal power and divinity look 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.720
 understood by the creation of the world and 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.690
 for the things that are done so that they do not 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.140
 there is an excuse because having met 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.470
 God did not glorify him as god nor 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.440
 they gave thanks before they faded 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.250
 in his fantasies and the foolish heart of 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.640
 they were intervened by telling themselves to be 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.250
 wise became fools and touched the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.140
 glory of the incorruptible god in 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.349
 similarity of man image 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.069
 corruptible and bird and animal 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.500
 four feet and snakes so 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.109
 God also gave them to the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.930
 lusts of their hearts for 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.980
 uncleanness to be contaminated in their 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.470
 bodies among themselves 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.349
 which changed the truth of God in 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.560
 lie honoring and serving the 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.430
 creatures before the creator which 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.739
 is blessed for ages amen 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.860
 for which God gave them to affections 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.530
 shameful because even his women moved 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.890
 the natural use in the use that is against 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.470
 nature and in the same way also the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.510
 males leaving the natural use of 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.870
 females lit in their 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.750
 concupiscence the ones with us 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.960
 committing male nefarious things with 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.229
 males and receiving in themselves the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.150
 reward that came from his mistake and 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.090
 as they did not seem to have goodbye 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.669
 in account God gave them to perverse 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.940
 understanding so that they would do what 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:42.590
 it does not agree with all iniquity 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.190
 of greed malice fornication of 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.120
 malice full of envy of homicides 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.900
 of contentions of deception of malignity 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.139
 is 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.870
 haters of hating tractors 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:02.000
 of god ' arrogant arrogant 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:06.169
 inventors of disobedient seas to the 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.610
 disloyal foolish parents without affection 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.410
 implacable natural without mercy that 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.470
 having understood the justice of God 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.800
 they did not understand that those who do such 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.600
 things are worthy of death not only the 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.600
 that make them more a job
