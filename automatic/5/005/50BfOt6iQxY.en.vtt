00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello my dear, I thought so 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.299
 we'll do a photo futh hey again 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 my goodness at some point even 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.599
 learn we made no longer 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 more and yes, at first I was at the butcher 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.770
 and so have a very unspectacular only one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.779
 bit grill bought belly for barbecuing 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.640
 Tonight and then I have this here 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.340
 still found that are farmers sigh 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 I do not know if the rest in the rest 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.570
 known to the republic 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.890
 that are so small Lisa can crisp 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.300
 They do not say they are beautiful because of me 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.009
 my children like to eat and the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.770
 have great smoky aroma 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.520
 So it tastes relatively good then that was 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.890
 when buying country with discount today bert olli 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 original fruity olive oil that use 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.390
 I mean a lot but there is 1 for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.430
 Salads are extra for salads 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.570
 and dips and I have that in mine too 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.390
 last cooking video of yesterday had 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 and that is the tomato salad of the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 Pasta salad with tomatoes and there 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.870
 I use the bertolli oil for salads 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.149
 that is not quite as intense of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.939
 then this olive oil tastes so 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.680
 better adapts to the whole salad 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.119
 then yes when I'm salt almost dead 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.100
 searched but I did it then but still 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 found behind the sugar continues 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.430
 I took it with me again because I was 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.860
 Long not have made itself more 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.490
 then I eat the praline the cost 1 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.170
 euro 49 marc de champagne and I have to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 to say that I actually buy 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.090
 only in the country of purchase or in the real world 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.869
 edeka has the but also medicus 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.280
 because the more expensive with 179 and there 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.140
 I already had packs where the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.670
 pralines have tasted so old 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.590
 must not be synonymous now I think 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.689
 that's why I always buy that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.000
 only in these huge chains like 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.770
 Real or Kaufland because I just the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 opinion, there is the goods turning 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.220
 a little faster there will be more often 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.399
 shopped and you get even fresher 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.299
 was but then I have not taken 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.119
 once a putting green 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.130
 pudding powder to stir in cold 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.799
 milk because I am naturally lazy 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.600
 but sometimes still somehow a 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.729
 Cream pudding was also available for cakes 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.619
 For example , you do not have to pot extra 1 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.840
 but i can just do this here 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.020
 take in an inner bowl 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 clean or in 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.620
 early cup and then you have too 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.480
 Do not wash the giants so I am 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.650
 yes, also the type of washing up 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.800
 actually does not like 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.300
 and that's all to stir in cold 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.920
 milk that is also on it again 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.630
 I have different things 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.580
 taken in any case choco and 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.710
 vanilla either i need to so 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.360
 eat or stop for cake and so on 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.490
 then I took one 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.010
 packet fennel so I think that can 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.170
 they also use as fennel seeds has 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.700
 now here I think 199 costs but 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.750
 I blind you as always at the end of the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.210
 shopping list 1 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.010
 there you will find all the prices I have 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.630
 but this recipe made with the times 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.090
 Sausages in the puff pastry and the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.650
 sauerkraut and there are actually still coming 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.110
 fennel seeds with pure ones I had 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.150
 at that time just not found and it is 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.310
 anyway difficult I cook quite often 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.800
 also from jamie oliver these recipes 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.140
 and there I often find things in the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.420
 Supermarket does not stick to spices that way 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.920
 For example, use this five spices 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.930
 you probably only get that powder 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.820
 to asia shop now is our asia shop 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.590
 in the middle of the city that means I would have to 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.150
 since first 20 minutes and 20 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.160
 minutes back this also found 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.870
 smoked paprika never 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.970
 Found if any of you know 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.620
 please write me in the comments where 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.600
 I find smoked paprika powder 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.090
 at least not in the country of purchase and not 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.709
 im real what makes me totally insane 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.390
 if you want to cook something and that 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.430
 I find recipes at Jamie Oliver 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.560
 always a bit weak that the son 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.990
 had an ingredient that tasted 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.610
 of course, certainly wonderful but at the end 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.180
 if i do not get the ingredients in 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.490
 trade 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.260
 then unfortunately uses me the whole recipe 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.480
 nothing and then I have to stop something 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.010
 Other cooking options were these 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.780
 week at Kaufland again my 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.280
 beloved almex or mine 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.410
 children are so popular I eat ja 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.970
 not for 29 cents instead of 49 I mean 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.310
 I have often cost the normal ones 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.230
 in futuro as mentioned there I have again 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.959
 a few taken and for me too 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.880
 Something I do not eat so crazy 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.890
 a lot but if it is something like that 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.989
 and I always find it very, very 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.000
 expensive with 80 cents the pack but the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.770
 I think now costs only 69 or 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.600
 I find something damn synonymous 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.500
 expensive for such a bit of content that 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.480
 are just 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.190
 160 grams content in it I always find it 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.959
 I did not bring myself heart may not depart from 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.549
 to pack these things five piece 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.220
 where I know so much 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.750
 packaging garbage fields and that can 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.550
 I somehow do not agree with me 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.380
 I'll keep going so I can do it 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.090
 not because we're having a barbecue today 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.360
 my pasta salad with tomatoes the same 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.250
 again and these are fresh German 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.350
 cracked or brushed tomatoes 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.910
 brush tomatoes right there I have again 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.100
 taken five six pieces and me 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.170
 make the pasta salad again this time 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.290
 I also do some pine nuts 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.250
 to my portion with run or roasted 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.810
 sunflower seeds tastes good 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.730
 Safety is great , too 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.420
 still wonderful recipe suggestions for 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.520
 example 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.720
 You should also the pasta salad with 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.880
 refine parmesan 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.920
 Of course, just try whatever you can 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.540
 but please do please take German 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.280
 strawberries or maybe you even have 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.410
 which in the garden then offers nature 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.840
 Of course, it is all the more interesting 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.270
 they have now cost a euro 17 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.770
 So that's really not much and he 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.350
 gets a whole bowl of pasta salad 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.960
 out with wonderfully fruity fresh 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.650
 tomatoes and it does not take 1000 more 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.300
 ingredients 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.700
 yes I believe that arrived in the 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.530
 last video and you already have it 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.420
 diligently comments then I still have 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.340
 taken with pizza dough by henglein 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.100
 This time I love the company Henglein 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.200
 also the spätzle dough and on the 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.630
 yeasty and actually the spaetzle 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.280
 Of course, this is so pizza dough 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.440
 Of course, I use it for mine 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.090
 Grill torches who the video is not 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.830
 The addon has seen times in youtube 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.720
 grill torches make yourself or something 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.560
 or pizza dough so that was called 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.990
 I believe in myself 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.060
 and either my children just love them 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.520
 wrapped in pizza dough or with 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.140
 pizza dough and breakfast bacon that 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.790
 tastes sensationally well we have 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.890
 already done four times within 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.810
 two weeks I think and it works 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.310
 so easy to prepare and you are 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.860
 super fast finished and the taste 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.510
 just awesome as I am me too 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.060
 took to barbecue with too good 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.280
 last is this grill and pan cheese 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.970
 There is also currently at Kaufland im 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.070
 offer 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.330
 I have to look at the note but you 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.580
 see it later at the end 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.440
 I think a eur 42 somehow a whole 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.180
 Great price is also available 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.530
 chili and the 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.419
 I've already introduced the 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.650
 i like very much some like this 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.820
 not if we squeak a bit 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.229
 but I think if the war at 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.310
 Food is not really fried 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.960
 or something 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.490
 I have to look at the internet again 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.860
 In any case, I love this one 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.229
 Grillkäse then there are still with herbs 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.930
 and that is with herbs in the rest 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.460
 or with chili or in nature that wanted 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.229
 I do not say always lower faster 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.850
 before it is pronounced yes for mine 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.740
 next recipe I need a bottle 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.660
 lemonade and you can 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.460
 Of course it will be a drink 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.440
 but that will probably not until tomorrow 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.870
 or come online the day after tomorrow 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.610
 I first go to the strawberry field like that 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.320
 and also for my next recipe 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.720
 I need a syrup honoring him 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.310
 i think i've tasted 299 i have 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.320
 no idea again, I will be myself 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.940
 but also because times by testing and the 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.250
 I also need for this recipe for 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.560
 the same recipe as the other one 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.120
 Now I'm looking for a deodorant I have 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.240
 I took it with me 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.860
 tasted quite good from nivea fresh 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.930
 nature all this always reminds me 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.759
 my youth either because there was the 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.229
 already or gave it similar meanwhile 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.750
 that had a smell that reminds me 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:23.150
 somehow 15 years ago 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.449

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.340

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.590
