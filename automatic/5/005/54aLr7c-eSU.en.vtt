00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
underneath is the fact that when you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
underneath is the fact that when you
actually<00:00:50.850> zip<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.660> creates<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.140> fine

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
actually zip it up it creates this fine

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
actually zip it up it creates this fine
line<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.949> crystal<00:00:53.520> stud<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.420> gives<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
line a crystal stud so it gives that a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.299 
line a crystal stud so it gives that a
little<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.170> dazzling<00:00:55.620> effect<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.129> very

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
little bit of dazzling effect but very

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.569 
little bit of dazzling effect but very
subtly<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.390> that's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.500> Mom<00:00:58.739> and
