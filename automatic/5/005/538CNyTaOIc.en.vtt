00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.120 
this ok so i guess these are the AR
cards<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> need<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.950> use<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and stuff like that and think about

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
and stuff like that and think about
nintendo<00:01:52.079> club<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.740> has<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.100> pin<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
nintendo club it has your pin on it and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.810 
nintendo club it has your pin on it and
i<00:01:54.479> suppose<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> manual<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.640> quite

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
i suppose this is the manual it's quite

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.240 
i suppose this is the manual it's quite
intimidating<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.899> ridiculous<00:01:58.829> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
intimidating it's just ridiculous so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.889

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that's a little bit scary and here's the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.270 
that's a little bit scary and here's the
quick<00:02:01.020> start<00:02:01.259> guide<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.619> anyway<00:02:01.920> let's<00:02:02.130> get
