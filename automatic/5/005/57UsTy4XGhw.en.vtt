00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hey, people, good morning, I'm going. 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.250
 update that my video is that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.099
 my video of how to play mw3 online and up 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.809
 which can not be out of date then 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.940
 I'll make this video here to help. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.949
 You because there are a lot of people with 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.660
 doubt is not knowing how to update the game 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.330
 is having the wrong time to install 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.130
 so I will make a very simple and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.960
 fast without complication 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.680
 first you will have to install the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.599
 game, my game is already installed here 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 in a clean game also install 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.340
 so we're going to do the following you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.160
 you will not need this update here 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.719
 that I'll leave in the video description 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.290
 You will click on it. 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.000
 mine is already open here and they will 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.100
 select all extract to folder 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.030
 game in the case where you installed your game 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.770
 Yes for everyone 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 remembering if you already have a game 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.500
 installed you will not need to launch 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.870
 this version here because it's 2 with 7 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.250
 points a point two is assumed to be the last 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.600
 version that I'll also leave in the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.700
 video description 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 You are going there with you. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.159
 see how it will work to use 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.729
 here while strolling good finished of 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.460
 I'll spend the last pass now. 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.259
 update here that if you already have the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.060
 game installed already have put pressure 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.299
 previous video in the previous video you 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.680
 need to pass this version here that 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.170
 is giving a strange bug when you 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.520
 tries to update directly without putting this 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.740
 version here then let's go 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.740
 you are going to extract to the game folder 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.689
 yes to all is very fast and 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.689

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.210
 We have been updated here. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.930
