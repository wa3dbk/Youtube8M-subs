and then I remember being obsessed with
this<00:00:34.829> color<00:00:35.190> which<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.450> radiant<00:00:37.350> green<00:00:37.680> from

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this color which is radiant green from

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
this color which is radiant green from
gamblin<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:39.899> amazing<00:00:40.200> color<00:00:40.710> I've

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
gamblin and it is an amazing color I've

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.790 
gamblin and it is an amazing color I've
used<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.300> much<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.050> my<00:00:43.170> paintings<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
used so much of it in my paintings and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.410 
used so much of it in my paintings and
every<00:00:44.040> time<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.489> using<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
every time I'm using it I'm like this is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.490 
every time I'm using it I'm like this is
so<00:00:45.600> beautiful

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so beautiful

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.270 
so beautiful
and<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.489> painted<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.000> studio<00:00:48.360> pretty<00:00:48.960> much

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
and so I painted the studio pretty much

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.680 
and so I painted the studio pretty much
with<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> closest<00:00:50.879> color<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.329> could<00:00:51.480> find

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
with the closest color that I could find

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
with the closest color that I could find
to<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.989> which<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> isn't<00:00:53.039> exactly<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.550> same

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to this which it isn't exactly the same

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
to this which it isn't exactly the same
this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> little<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:55.050> greener

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
this is actually a little bit greener

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.700 
this is actually a little bit greener
that's<00:00:56.039> more<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.520> turquoise<00:00:57.030> um<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.590> yeah

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that's more of a turquoise um but yeah

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.039 
that's more of a turquoise um but yeah
yeah<00:00:59.899> I've<00:01:00.899> always<00:01:01.260> wanted<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:02.070> baroque

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
yeah I've always wanted a baroque

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
yeah I've always wanted a baroque
vintage<00:01:04.049> wall<00:01:04.949> pattern<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> hate

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
vintage wall pattern but I hate

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
vintage wall pattern but I hate
wallpaper<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.260> inconvenient

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
wallpaper I think it's so inconvenient

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
wallpaper I think it's so inconvenient
and<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.280> annoying<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.000> didn't<00:01:09.479> want<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and so annoying I just didn't want to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
and so annoying I just didn't want to
deal<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> decided<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.280> torture

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
deal with it so I decided to torture

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
deal with it so I decided to torture
myself<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.390> other<00:01:12.540> ways<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.439> design<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
myself in other ways so the design the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
myself in other ways so the design the
pattern<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.880> wall<00:01:15.150> was<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.840> design

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
pattern on the wall was a design

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.170 
pattern on the wall was a design
actually<00:01:16.530> creative<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.640> order<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> make

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
actually creative but in order to make

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.870 
actually creative but in order to make
the<00:01:18.299> design<00:01:18.630> work<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.590> make<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
the design work I had to make it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.950 
the design work I had to make it
function<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
function like kind of like a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
function like kind of like a
tessellation<00:01:22.890> meaning<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.729> like

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
tessellation meaning that it just like

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
tessellation meaning that it just like
repeat<00:01:24.240> repeats<00:01:24.600> repeats<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
repeat repeats repeats in it's all the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.340 
repeat repeats repeats in it's all the
same<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.939> stencil<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.170> was

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
same so this is the stencil that I was

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
same so this is the stencil that I was
using<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.220> pretty<00:01:29.369> simple<00:01:29.790> this

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
using it's actually pretty simple this

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.890 
using it's actually pretty simple this
is<00:01:30.960> reflected<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.570> edges

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
is reflected in this all of these edges

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.679 
is reflected in this all of these edges
are<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:35.040> design<00:01:35.490> does<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.150> sense<00:01:36.180> I've

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
are one design does that make sense I've

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.890 
are one design does that make sense I've
probably<00:01:37.259> confused<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.509> maybe<00:01:39.509> myself

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
probably confused you and maybe myself

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
probably confused you and maybe myself
all<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:40.799> edges<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.790> thing<00:01:42.180> that's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
all of these edges are one thing that's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.999 
all of these edges are one thing that's
just<00:01:42.689> flipped<00:01:42.930> around<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.530> different<00:01:43.860> ways

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
just flipped around in different ways

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
just flipped around in different ways
but<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> put<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.600> together<00:01:45.810> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
but when you put it all together it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
but when you put it all together it
works<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.250> drew<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.759> design<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
works so then I drew out the design on a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.830 
works so then I drew out the design on a
poster<00:01:49.860> board<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:51.060> cut<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
poster board and I cut it out with a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539 
poster board and I cut it out with a
razor<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.619> probably<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.399> most

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
razor which was probably the most

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.620 
razor which was probably the most
annoying<00:01:53.880> part

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
annoying part

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.440 
annoying part
not<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> did<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.070> tape<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
not so what I did is I just tape the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.410 
not so what I did is I just tape the
pattern<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> wall<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.390> initially<00:02:00.390> I

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
pattern to the wall and initially I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.700 
pattern to the wall and initially I
started<00:02:01.049> off<00:02:01.170> using<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:02.070> roller<00:02:02.789> which<00:02:03.710> didn't

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
started off using a roller which didn't

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.859 
started off using a roller which didn't
really<00:02:04.860> work<00:02:05.549> very<00:02:05.579> well<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.149> actually<00:02:06.390> had<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
really work very well I actually had to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
really work very well I actually had to
go<00:02:07.049> back<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.259> redo<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> design<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.580> paint

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
go back and redo the design the paint

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.750 
go back and redo the design the paint
would<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.660> seep<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.619> through<00:02:11.009> underneath

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
would like seep in through underneath

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.940 
would like seep in through underneath
the<00:02:12.180> design<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:13.050> see<00:02:13.380> like<00:02:13.620> over

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the design and you can see like over

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
the design and you can see like over
here<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:14.370> all<00:02:14.519> covered<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.940> paint<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.510> so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
here that's all covered in paint and so

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.530 
here that's all covered in paint and so
that<00:02:16.620> pretty<00:02:17.010> much<00:02:17.250> turned<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.090> into<00:02:18.239> like<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that pretty much turned it into like a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.330 
that pretty much turned it into like a
blob<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.410> details<00:02:19.830> weren't<00:02:20.069> as

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
blob and the details weren't as

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
blob and the details weren't as
intricate<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.840> switched<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.349> this

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
intricate so then I switched to this

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.710 
intricate so then I switched to this
brush<00:02:22.890> which<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.519> know<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:24.030> crazy<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.660> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
brush which I know is crazy but I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.070 
brush which I know is crazy but I
painted<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.260> entire<00:02:25.860> wall<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:27.720> little

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
painted that entire wall with one little

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.470 
painted that entire wall with one little
brush<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.590> promise<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.670> wasn't<00:02:30.330> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
brush but I promise you it wasn't that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.509 
brush but I promise you it wasn't that
bad<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.900> was<00:02:31.019> pretty<00:02:31.200> much<00:02:31.349> just<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.769> okay

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
bad it was pretty much just like okay

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.089 
bad it was pretty much just like okay
you<00:02:33.480> know<00:02:33.599> like<00:02:33.870> no<00:02:34.080> more<00:02:34.260> than<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> minute<00:02:35.010> or

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
you know like no more than a minute or

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.520 
you know like no more than a minute or
two<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.400> each<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.959> arranged<00:02:37.319> them<00:02:37.380> all

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
two on each one so I arranged them all

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800 
two on each one so I arranged them all
vertically<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.400> then<00:02:38.519> horizontally<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:39.630> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
vertically and then horizontally but I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.050 
vertically and then horizontally but I
still<00:02:40.140> had<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.560> an<00:02:40.709> empty<00:02:41.010> diagonal<00:02:41.730> space

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
still had like an empty diagonal space

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.960 
still had like an empty diagonal space
of<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.630> design<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:43.950> when<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.340> paint<00:02:44.670> was

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
of the design and so when that paint was

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.690 
of the design and so when that paint was
dried<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.630> would<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.900> go<00:02:46.140> back<00:02:46.349> in<00:02:46.620> place<00:02:47.459> it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
dried I would just go back in place it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.030 
dried I would just go back in place it
over<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.329> paint<00:02:48.780> only<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.410> central<00:02:49.799> piece

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
over it and paint only the central piece

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.710 
over it and paint only the central piece
not<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.610> rest<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.090> edges<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.630> that's

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
not the rest of the edges and that's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.509 
not the rest of the edges and that's
pretty<00:02:52.019> much<00:02:52.140> how<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> made<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:52.829> work<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.400> was

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
pretty much how I made it work it was

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.979 
pretty much how I made it work it was
just<00:02:53.700> kind<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> mindless<00:02:54.810> repetitive

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
just kind of like a mindless repetitive

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.229 
just kind of like a mindless repetitive
task<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.040> wasn't<00:02:56.310> hard<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.819> mean<00:02:56.970> some<00:02:57.209> people

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
task it wasn't hard I mean some people

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.240 
task it wasn't hard I mean some people
would<00:02:57.599> get<00:02:57.720> annoyed<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.200> guess<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.650> didn't<00:02:59.130> I

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
would get annoyed I guess but I didn't I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.860 
would get annoyed I guess but I didn't I
