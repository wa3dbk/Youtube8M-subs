pretty<00:00:16.170> sketch<00:00:16.560> because<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:18.090> packaging

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
pretty sketch because the packaging

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200 
pretty sketch because the packaging
wasn't<00:00:19.080> like<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> part<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
wasn't like this was a part and this

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.029 
wasn't like this was a part and this
packaging<00:00:21.720> actually<00:00:22.109> isn't<00:00:22.289> even<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.859> these

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
packaging actually isn't even for these

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.259 
packaging actually isn't even for these
LEDs<00:00:23.460> kind<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.510> funny<00:00:24.720> um<00:00:25.609> it<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.880> slides<00:00:27.090> out

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
LEDs kind of funny um it just slides out

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
LEDs kind of funny um it just slides out
like<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.680> apart<00:00:29.099> when<00:00:29.310> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
like that and this was all apart when it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.790 
like that and this was all apart when it
was<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> package

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
was in the package

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.400 
was in the package
so<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.340> LEDs<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.910> bought<00:00:33.090> them<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:33.410> I'm

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
so these LEDs I bought them because I'm

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.010 
so these LEDs I bought them because I'm
pretty<00:00:34.649> sure<00:00:34.800> they'll<00:00:35.010> fit<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:36.660> has<00:00:36.809> like

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
pretty sure they'll fit and it has like

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
pretty sure they'll fit and it has like
this<00:00:37.200> protective<00:00:37.710> thing<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> back<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
this protective thing on the back so it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.250 
this protective thing on the back so it
protects<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.950> back<00:00:41.129> piece<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
protects the the back piece so that it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
protects the the back piece so that it
doesn't<00:00:43.590> short<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.160> cause<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> fire<00:00:44.610> or

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
doesn't short out and cause a fire or

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.200 
doesn't short out and cause a fire or
anything

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
anything

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
anything
my<00:00:46.050> focus<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:49.649> that's

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
my focus that there you go and that's

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.760

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
latches ones right here the other ones

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.690 
latches ones right here the other ones
here<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.340> actually<00:01:24.090> looks<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:25.369> this<00:01:26.369> on

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
here that actually looks like this on

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.800 
here that actually looks like this on
the<00:01:26.939> inside

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.520 

and<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.440> don't<00:01:30.620> want<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.800> break<00:01:31.010> those<00:01:31.220> just

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
and you don't want to break those just

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.750 
and you don't want to break those just
kind<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.740> pride<00:01:33.980> it<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:36.020> it'll<00:01:36.290> pop<00:01:36.440> out<00:01:36.760> also

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
kind of pride it and it'll pop out also

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.490 
kind of pride it and it'll pop out also
you<00:01:37.820> could<00:01:38.060> do<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.360> with<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.630> small

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
you could do that with a small

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.340 
you could do that with a small
screwdriver<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.430> flathead<00:01:41.140> kind<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.229> like

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
screwdriver like flathead kind of like

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.860 
screwdriver like flathead kind of like
this<00:01:42.650> but<00:01:43.550> if<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.820> did<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.120> like<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.479> you

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
this but if you did it like this you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.609 
this but if you did it like this you
would<00:01:44.990> need<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:46.479> get<00:01:47.479> some<00:01:47.990> type<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.170> paper<00:01:48.410> to

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
would need to get some type of paper to

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.960 
would need to get some type of paper to
cover<00:01:48.800> this<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:49.250> don't<00:01:49.430> scratch<00:01:49.700> up<00:01:49.760> the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
cover this so you don't scratch up the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.210 
cover this so you don't scratch up the
interior<00:01:50.420> unless<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.110> don't<00:01:51.229> care<00:01:51.350> so

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
interior unless you don't care so

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.969 
interior unless you don't care so
anyways<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.729> next<00:01:52.760> step<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:54.710> get<00:01:54.830> those

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
anyways the next step is to get those

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:55.810 
anyways the next step is to get those
things<00:01:55.250> out<00:01:55.400> of<00:01:55.430> there

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
things out of there

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.430 
things out of there
I'm<00:01:56.810> just<00:01:56.960> going<00:01:57.200> on<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.470> top<00:01:57.710> well<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.280> know

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.359 

it's<00:02:03.440> not<00:02:03.619> hot<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.460> grab<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:06.369> there's

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
it's not hot so I can grab it there's

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:19.150 
it's not hot so I can grab it there's
