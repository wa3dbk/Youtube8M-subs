00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
of course you probably won't do it every

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.350 
of course you probably won't do it every
time<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.159> will<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.460> farm<00:04:30.820> for<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.210> and

time you will have to farm for it and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.100 
time you will have to farm for it and
they<00:04:31.719> said<00:04:31.930> something<00:04:32.260> about<00:04:32.469> using

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
they said something about using

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.020 
they said something about using

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
cific uniques on certain enemy so you

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.730 
cific uniques on certain enemy so you
might<00:04:35.330> have<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.510> go<00:04:35.750> like<00:04:35.960> he'll<00:04:36.230> tear

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
might have to go like he'll tear

might have to go like he'll tear
amorphous<00:04:37.160> maybe<00:04:37.400> with<00:04:37.730> let's<00:04:38.420> think<00:04:38.540> of<00:04:38.720> a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
amorphous maybe with let's think of a
