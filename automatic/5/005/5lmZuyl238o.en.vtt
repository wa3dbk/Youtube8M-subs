00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 how to adjust 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.809
 lock latch on sliding designs 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.799
 aluminum if you are like 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.949
 designs now i will show you how 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.310
 do it here these designs are very 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.230
 almost 90 are common in Russia 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 95 percent are Russians and names are not 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.869
 here the problem is very relevant that is 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.020
 there is a latch 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.500
 but it does not work that is not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.280
 snaps still consists of latches 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.610
 short 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.570
 i.e. this is mate 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.620
 here she clings to this one 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.410
 the tongue that went deep 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.820
 actually from this stopped working 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.180
 the latch is if not lost 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.610
 This tongue, that is, it can fall 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.100
 if it is bad on the production spun 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.830
 and accordingly from it will not be 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.020
 latch work in general the tongue of dinner is not 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.380
 latch sold 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.070
 Comes with this tongue or here 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.890
 this mate also shifts sometimes 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:24.300
 weakens and does not work here 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 so what is needed in order to 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.200
 self put in place this 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.190
 the tongue on the latch is available 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.680
 holes that year that fix this 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.330
 tongue we need a key for two with 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 half hex that is he 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.920
 sold in hex key sets 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.930
 and for two and a half we need from 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.090
 This set is the key, that is, we master 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.320
 loosen the mount 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.060
 uvula pull out there but I 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.040
 specially adaptations that is here 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.930
 such a vityuk sewed curved everything I 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:17.870
 pulled up to the so-called state 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.320
 flush flush with profile 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.420
 quartz sash now we need to throw 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.410
 with the same key we stretch 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.110
 carefully to not again with us 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.760
 drowned most likely in production 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.880
 badly 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.340
 tightening and the impact of the sash 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.680
 mate he deepens and 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.270
 stops and cling to it can 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.270
 stretched check should be heard 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.750
 such a click 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.980

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.730
 different designs and here is the hole 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.150
 under the hexagon it is hidden here 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.640
 on this green record that is her 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.940
 need, too , something sharp little awl 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.130
 for example move aside and she will release 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.860
 access here to a similar hole 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.660
