00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.320
 the people welcome, one more chat 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.300
 here in our channel channel 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.610
 electricity that today will bring a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.310
 chronic problem, which occur in 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.130
 thousands of Brazilian households 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.560
 who has not had a shock in a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 refrigerator or in an appliance 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 any 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.500
 today our channel will show why 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.399
 this happens and how it is resolved 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.810
 problem that is easy to solve and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.079
 low cost 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.460
 Let's see the people today, I 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.280
 I decided to share this experience 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.290
 with you because there really is this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 possibility of shock refrigerator 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.840
 new refrigerator has nothing to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.410
 seeing with defect is really a failure 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.879
 of isolation and to show you what 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.840
 It really happens that I did one 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.609
 barbecue here to show you 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.100
 that at this point I intend to 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.590
 I have no tension that can give a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.779
 'shock' bluetooh a person and people 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.399
 decided to quantify how much this 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:19.399
 voltage on the refrigerator casing 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.709
 this refrigerator here is a consultation of 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:29.729
 300 liter brand consul class a frost 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:34.619
 free and that's the power cable of it 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.139
 have no land opinion're 12 and won the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.259
 separated 

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:42.029
 the refrigerator ground comes separately 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.060
 and we'll show you how 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:47.039
 solve this problem of this escape 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.689
 I made sure to also bring a plug 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:54.499
 disassembled to show you that the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:57.509
 it has ground phase and neutral it is 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:01.139
 meeting the Brazilian standards, right? 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:06.299
 and we're going to put this power cord 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:07.919
 here and if you detect detention already shows 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.360
 that there is an electric field here in 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.640
 refrigerator housing 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.720
 But I wanted to qualify for you. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.080
 how much detention 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 time 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.050
 this is a team that is in the role 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:33.150
 voltmeter i have a probe 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.560
 connected to the ground and this other 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.300
 the end of the test that I'm going to 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.320
 carcass of the refrigerator at this point here 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.410
 Where I shaved it and see just how much 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.910
 I have detention here in the house. 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.250
 125 flights 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.800
 is a reasonable voltage this can 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.470
 killing a person is depending on the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.570
 current flowing through the body of this 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.209
 person and there is no dr 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.209
 in the installation this can even kill a 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.800
 person to pay attention to how 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.800
 solve this problem has two ways 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 to solve the right and wrong 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:22.320
 if you just reverse this here 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:25.280
 looks only the tension has gone from a few 120 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:31.350
 others to 21 nÃ© 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:34.470
 but if you besides inverting the earth 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.330
 also there you solve this problem and 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.720
 do not fire the dr 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.959
 What you want to do now is put this 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.790
 ground wire that comes in the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.700
 and we will see how 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.830
 we will completely neutralize this 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.510
 residual stress you have on the housing 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:58.010
 and simply connect 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.010
 and stay here ok 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.680
 ready the refrigerator is now wrong 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:16.660
 and we'll see how much voltage we 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:18.430
 we have at her house now notice that already 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:27.730
 there is no more electric field here 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:31.540
 shift and attention is only two points 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:37.350
 5 volts which is despicable 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:40.750
 ok then our problem is solved 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.300
 problem really was the lack of 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.330
 very personal touch grounding 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.210
 you probably own the dom 's gift right 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.890
 except the electricians on call should 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.680
 have been very curious to know that the 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.670
 equipment is the one that accuses the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.320
 presence of electrical energy is 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.560
 household appliances or wires, all 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.960
 nee induction ne and a certain distance 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.560
 here is a mini voltage detector 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.950
 for this here sesi alert 2 manufactured 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.970
 by minipa and costs approximately 35 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.070
 40 reais 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.080
 and this guy that he is used to 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.410
 detect the presence of electric current 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.400
 passing by a driver is even for 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.160
 you know if you have any 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.930
 electricity is on the conductors and 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.060
 also on the intact 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.690
 simply bring the equipment closer to the wall outlet 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.020
 that you have the sound indication 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.610
 as luminous there of the presence of 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.830
 personal electric current 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.050
 the equipment as it costs 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.980
 approximately R $ 40 works with two 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.620
 AAA batteries binding and is completely safe and 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.360
 very useful in the domestic environment 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.560
 you detect insulation faults there 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.530
 appliances such as refrigerators 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.850
 microwave washing machines nÃ© 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.440
 air conditioning 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.040
 electrical equipment and has a housing 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.440
 metal that maybe he can 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.600
 a person cause the leakage current 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.760
 combined with extra consumption 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.320
 electricity and in the most 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.600
 even critics 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.070
 the fire is personal and if you do not 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.780
 There's a r in your house, the people. 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.700
 also recommends installing this 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.430
 equipment that this one that we 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.350
 We're showing you right now. 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.480
 so you are more interested in knowing 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.680
 how does the 10 work to prevent this 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.100
 type of situation 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.710
 click here and here in this link and see the 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.810
 our video that already has hundreds of 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.310
 thousands of access and is very successful 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.660
 in Brazil and in another 80 countries is 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.490
 people are staying here I hope 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.860
 did you like our video one? 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.860
 hug and even our next chat
