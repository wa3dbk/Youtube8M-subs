they<00:02:07.259> don't<00:02:07.649> do<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.100> justice<00:02:08.340> I'll<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:10.250> close

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
they don't do it justice I'll just close

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
they don't do it justice I'll just close

smooth<00:02:48.350> maybe<00:02:49.070> my<00:02:49.250> camera<00:02:49.640> chops<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.120> up<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.360> bit

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.440 
smooth maybe my camera chops it up a bit
but<00:02:50.780> it's<00:02:50.930> running<00:02:51.260> perfectly<00:02:51.740> smooth<00:02:52.450> that's

but it's running perfectly smooth that's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.270 
but it's running perfectly smooth that's
what<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.720> graphics<00:02:54.080> card<00:02:54.320> overclocked<00:02:54.770> and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
what the graphics card overclocked and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.160 
what the graphics card overclocked and
that's<00:02:55.460> it<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.450> running<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.960> hundred

that's it that it's running in a hundred

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.630 
that's it that it's running in a hundred
percent<00:02:57.320> fan<00:02:57.710> speed<00:02:58.010> right<00:02:58.160> now<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.340> don't<00:02:58.490> know

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
percent fan speed right now I don't know

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.960

if<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:58.940> hear<00:02:59.150> it<00:03:00.280> but<00:03:01.280> that's<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.760> car

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
if you can hear it but that's the car

if you can hear it but that's the car
that<00:03:02.000> sound<00:03:02.420> like<00:03:02.630> playing<00:03:03.190> directx<00:03:04.190> 11<00:03:04.670> in

that sound like playing directx 11 in
eyefinity<00:03:05.600> really<00:03:06.350> really<00:03:06.590> well<00:03:08.020> I'd<00:03:09.020> say

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
eyefinity really really well I'd say

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.050 
eyefinity really really well I'd say
basically<00:03:09.800> for<00:03:10.130> ninety<00:03:10.520> percent<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
basically for ninety percent of the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.850 
basically for ninety percent of the
gamers<00:03:11.450> out<00:03:11.570> there<00:03:11.630> especially<00:03:12.260> if<00:03:12.710> you're

using the single monitor setup a 5770

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.250 
using the single monitor setup a 5770
like<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.910> would<00:03:17.360> be<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.540> perfect<00:03:17.780> choice

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260

some graphics card I'm thoroughly

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.900 
some graphics card I'm thoroughly
impressed<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:30.260> get<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.440> single<00:03:30.880> advantages<00:03:31.880> of

a<00:03:32.090> single<00:03:32.450> GPU<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.730> performs<00:03:34.730> really<00:03:35.000> really

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
a single GPU and performs really really

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.560 
a single GPU and performs really really
well<00:03:35.420> it's<00:03:35.690> using<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.230> 10.2<00:03:37.160> drivers<00:03:37.730> that's

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
well it's using that 10.2 drivers that's

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.030 
well it's using that 10.2 drivers that's
actually<00:03:38.930> why<00:03:39.050> i<00:03:39.080> wanted<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.560> hold<00:03:39.800> off<00:03:40.010> on

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
actually why i wanted to hold off on

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.610 
actually why i wanted to hold off on
during<00:03:40.550> review<00:03:41.060> on<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.390> for<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.600> bit<00:03:41.780> because

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
during review on it for a bit because

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.460 
during review on it for a bit because
all<00:03:43.220> these<00:03:43.489> benchmarks<00:03:44.180> were<00:03:44.300> using<00:03:44.690> pretty

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
all these benchmarks were using pretty

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.190 
all these benchmarks were using pretty
shitty<00:03:45.709> drivers<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.459> stuff<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:47.060> this<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.050> what

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
shitty drivers and stuff so this is what

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.620 
shitty drivers and stuff so this is what
it<00:03:48.290> looks<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.670> running<00:03:49.670> dirt<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:50.420> i'll

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
it looks like running dirt so i'll

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.810 
it looks like running dirt so i'll

so<00:04:09.930> before<00:04:10.930> i<00:04:10.960> get<00:04:11.200> into<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:12.790> kind<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.060> i'll

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
so before i get into just kind of i'll

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.660 
so before i get into just kind of i'll
just<00:04:13.930> show<00:04:14.170> crisis<00:04:14.650> up<00:04:14.800> for<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.130> second<00:04:15.490> i<00:04:15.520> just

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
just show crisis up for a second i just

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.830 
just show crisis up for a second i just
want<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.910> show<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.120> what<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.299> running<00:04:16.690> it

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
want to show you what is running it

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.500 
want to show you what is running it
overall<00:04:17.799> quality<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.549> basically<00:04:19.090> set<00:04:19.359> the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
overall quality is basically set the

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.940 
overall quality is basically set the
high<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.930> then<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.170> up<00:04:20.320> some<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.799> other

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
high and then it up some of the other

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.650 
high and then it up some of the other
stuff<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:21.400> it's<00:04:21.549> set<00:04:21.730> at<00:04:21.760> very<00:04:22.090> high<00:04:22.180> very<00:04:22.420> high

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
stuff so it's set at very high very high

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.360 
stuff so it's set at very high very high
high<00:04:23.470> high<00:04:23.890> high<00:04:24.850> very<00:04:25.480> high<00:04:25.540> high<00:04:26.080> high<00:04:26.530> very

dollar graphics card I'd say that was a
hell<00:05:28.479> good<00:05:29.080> investment<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:31.060> if<00:05:31.360> you

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
hell good investment and if you

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.740 
hell good investment and if you
crossfire<00:05:32.110> these<00:05:32.440> things<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:33.100> did<00:05:34.000> be<00:05:34.270> stupid

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
crossfire these things you did be stupid

crossfire these things you did be stupid
dumb<00:05:34.960> like<00:05:35.350> you'd<00:05:35.530> get<00:05:35.740> so<00:05:36.070> much<00:05:36.310> performance

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
dumb like you'd get so much performance

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.810

this<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.690> actually<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.020> reference<00:05:38.290> PCB<00:05:39.100> not<00:05:39.700> if

this is actually a reference PCB not if

this is actually a reference PCB not if
you<00:05:39.940> can<00:05:40.090> see<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.240> two<00:05:40.600> gold<00:05:40.930> fingers<00:05:41.380> one

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
you can see that two gold fingers one

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.010 
you can see that two gold fingers one
there<00:05:41.830> one<00:05:42.010> there<00:05:42.450> so<00:05:43.450> you<00:05:43.540> can<00:05:43.840> have<00:05:43.990> a

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
there one there so you can have a

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.050 
there one there so you can have a
theoretically<00:05:44.979> you<00:05:45.100> can<00:05:45.190> have<00:05:45.340> for<00:05:45.669> them<00:05:45.910> in

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
theoretically you can have for them in

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.930 
theoretically you can have for them in
one<00:05:46.210> system<00:05:46.419> that<00:05:46.810> could<00:05:46.930> be<00:05:47.190> ridiculous<00:05:48.190> so

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
one system that could be ridiculous so

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.909 
one system that could be ridiculous so

did<00:06:12.120> it<00:06:12.240> on<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.360> calculator<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.410> that's

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
did it on a calculator and that's

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.180 
did it on a calculator and that's
