00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.000
 Welcome to our medicinal herbs channel Weight loss is a concern 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.040
 currently due to multiple reasons, in addition to aesthetics there is also the 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.710
 related to health. Experts insist that obesity is negative for 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.059
 many ailments and the convenience of having an adequate weight. 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.660
 Here we are going to show you the five best slimming plants that help so 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.760
 effective to achieve the ideal weight, provided that a healthy diet is followed and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.360
 some physical exercise. In any case, before starting a diet to lose weight 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.250
 you should consult a professional. 1. Fucus Vesiculosus (Sargazo Vejigoso) 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.440
 Fucus is a marine plant and, like most algae, it has a high content of iodine and salts 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.109
 minerals, such as potassium, bromine, magnesium, calcium, iron and some more. Their efects 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.720
 fighting obesity are effective because their iodine content stimulates the action of 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.520
 the thyroid, increasing the cellular metabolism. On the other hand, they are also present 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.310
 various potassium salts that give it an important diuretic effect. Likewise, 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 its mucilaginous substances eliminate appetite and exert a mild laxative action, due 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.359
 to which the water when coming into contact with the seaweed causes it to swell in the stomach before 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:57.869
 of being assimilated. All very beneficial to help in weight loss. 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.709
 2. Maize stigmas Leaving corn aside as food, 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.780
 that does not differ much from the rest of cereals, the most important part to use in 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.780
 Infusion to combat excess weight are the stigmas of corn. That is, in 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 that the ears are wrapped, also called beards or maize hair. That 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.010
 prepare in the same way as another medicinal plant. 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.659
 This part of corn, is one of the most important diuretics and purifiers that occurs in 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.010
 nature, in addition to possessing other beneficial properties. 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.580
 3. Artichoke We normally use it as food, and 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.370
 although that way we can also take advantage of its benefits, the most active part 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.290
 The artichoke is usually not eaten due to its bitterness and hardness. 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.830
 To obtain all the benefits of the artichoke it is better to prepare its leaves in infusion, 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.590
 decoction or maceration. 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.069
 4. Birch It is the magic tree for American Indians 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:15.760
 and also in India and Siberia. It is indicated as a diuretic and to combat obesity, 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.109
 among other things. The birch can be used very 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.120
 diverse, most ideal for weight loss and cellulite. It is used as an infusion 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.099
 and decoction. 5. Pu Erh red tea 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.010
 Most types of tea usually help in weight loss, being green and 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.640
 especially red, the most recommended to lose weight. 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.499
 Red tea has a great reputation as a fat-eater, and there are many diets to lower 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:47.730
 weight that include 3 or 4 cups. This is because it increases the caloric expenditure 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.420
 because of its effects on the liver, and at the same time it is a great cleanser of the whole organism. 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.080
 Remember that medicinal plants can also produce adverse effects in some 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.980
 cases, so I advise you to adjust to the indicated doses and consult with the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.260
 specialist if you want to give it to children or teenagers, in case of pregnancy and any major ailment. 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.170
 In case of doubt, always consult your doctor. I hope that this data on plants for 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.340
 lose weight have served you, if so collaborate ocn a like.
