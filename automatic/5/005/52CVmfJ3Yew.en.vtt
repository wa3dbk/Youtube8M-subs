00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
in 2004 and I think Ron Dennis's vision

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.999 
in 2004 and I think Ron Dennis's vision
at<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.340> time<00:00:24.579> was<00:00:24.939> that<00:00:25.210> he<00:00:25.840> wanted<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.289> create

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
at the time was that he wanted to create

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.179 
at the time was that he wanted to create
a<00:00:27.220> space<00:00:27.910> for<00:00:28.239> engineers<00:00:29.200> to<00:00:29.559> be<00:00:29.710> really

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
a space for engineers to be really

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.729 
a space for engineers to be really
challenged<00:00:30.820> beyond<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.239> limits<00:00:31.599> our<00:00:32.410> mission

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
challenged beyond the limits our mission

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.260 
challenged beyond the limits our mission
was<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.100> deliver<00:00:33.550> breakthroughs<00:00:34.120> in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
was to deliver breakthroughs in

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.690 
was to deliver breakthroughs in
performance<00:00:34.809> that<00:00:35.020> means<00:00:35.800> we're<00:00:36.070> seeking<00:00:36.550> to

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
performance that means we're seeking to

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.940 
performance that means we're seeking to
win<00:00:36.880> everything<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.600> we<00:00:37.690> do<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:38.649> obvious

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
win everything that we do it's obvious

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.979 
win everything that we do it's obvious
in<00:00:39.100> sport<00:00:39.460> what<00:00:39.670> winning<00:00:39.879> looks<00:00:40.030> like<00:00:40.540> but

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
in sport what winning looks like but

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.380 
in sport what winning looks like but
when<00:00:41.140> you're<00:00:41.290> building<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.980> product<00:00:42.280> it's<00:00:43.180> not

background that's what we know but it's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.270

clear<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.450> can<00:02:23.630> also<00:02:23.780> use<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.319> well

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280

and<00:02:32.600> we'll<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> whole<00:02:33.140> series<00:02:33.470> coming<00:02:33.890> up

and we'll have a whole series coming up

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.410 
and we'll have a whole series coming up
I'd<00:02:34.970> say<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.320> level<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.609> modeling

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
I'd say now the level of of modeling

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.569 
I'd say now the level of of modeling

what<00:04:17.560> was<00:04:17.680> once<00:04:17.859> thought<00:04:18.039> as<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.820> know

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
what was once thought as a you know

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.759 
what was once thought as a you know
standard<00:04:19.299> sort<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.570> bike<00:04:19.840> we<00:04:20.500> can<00:04:20.650> now

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
standard sort of bike we can now

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.710 
standard sort of bike we can now
discover<00:04:21.130> things<00:04:21.340> about<00:04:21.549> how<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.910> materials

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
discover things about how the materials

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.050 
discover things about how the materials
operate<00:04:23.560> under<00:04:23.770> different<00:04:23.800> conditions<00:04:24.160> we

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
operate under different conditions we

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.719 
operate under different conditions we
can<00:04:25.150> optimize<00:04:25.300> for<00:04:26.169> speed<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.770> vibration

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
can optimize for speed and vibration

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.870 
can optimize for speed and vibration
ride<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.900> comfort<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:30.039> so<00:04:30.340> here<00:04:30.490> we<00:04:30.580> are<00:04:30.610> in

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
ride and comfort so so here we are in

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.440 
ride and comfort so so here we are in
front<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.650> McLaren<00:04:32.650> venj

front of the McLaren venj

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.440 
front of the McLaren venj
obviously<00:04:34.450> one<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.919> most<00:04:35.919> notable

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
obviously one of the most notable

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.820 
obviously one of the most notable
products<00:04:37.450> we've<00:04:37.630> designed<00:04:38.050> in<00:04:38.289> in<00:04:38.470> recent

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
products we've designed in in recent

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.520 
products we've designed in in recent
history<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:40.060> notable<00:04:40.810> because<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:41.080> also

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
history and and notable because it also

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.640 
history and and notable because it also
sits<00:04:41.950> on<00:04:42.190> our<00:04:42.430> boulevard<00:04:42.940> amongst<00:04:43.350> many<00:04:44.350> four

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
sits on our boulevard amongst many four

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.130 
sits on our boulevard amongst many four
wheeled<00:04:44.860> varieties<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.669> vehicles<00:04:46.060> but<00:04:46.180> his<00:04:46.780> is

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
wheeled varieties of vehicles but his is

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.900

the only two-wheeled vehicle on the on

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.390 
the only two-wheeled vehicle on the on
the<00:04:49.060> Boulevard<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.440> think<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.919> kind<00:04:51.340> of

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
the Boulevard and I think a kind of

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.719 
the Boulevard and I think a kind of
proud<00:04:51.580> moment<00:04:51.970> for<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.750> design<00:04:53.050> team<00:04:53.260> because

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
proud moment for the design team because

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.529 
proud moment for the design team because
nothing<00:04:54.729> really<00:04:54.789> gets<00:04:55.000> onto<00:04:55.180> our<00:04:55.360> build

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
nothing really gets onto our build

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.040 
nothing really gets onto our build
evolve<00:04:55.780> without<00:04:55.950> some<00:04:56.950> sort<00:04:57.100> of<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.940> guess<00:04:58.539> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
evolve without some sort of I guess the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.680 
evolve without some sort of I guess the
sporting<00:04:59.650> recognition<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.940> so<00:05:01.150> with<00:05:01.330> with

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
sporting recognition and so with with

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.170 
sporting recognition and so with with
the<00:05:01.780> Venge<00:05:01.990> we've<00:05:02.200> had<00:05:02.320> great<00:05:02.470> success<00:05:02.940> we<00:05:03.940> we

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
the Venge we've had great success we we

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.250 
the Venge we've had great success we we
always<00:05:04.360> thought<00:05:04.479> it<00:05:04.600> would<00:05:04.690> be<00:05:04.780> a<00:05:04.810> good<00:05:05.050> bike

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
always thought it would be a good bike

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.469 
always thought it would be a good bike
but<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:05.890> all<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.220> wins<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.669> on<00:05:07.270> the

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
but to have all the wins on on the

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.659 
but to have all the wins on on the
various<00:05:07.750> riders<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:08.260> have<00:05:08.470> ridden<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.919> has

various riders that have ridden it has

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.460

been<00:05:09.880> just<00:05:10.240> it<00:05:10.419> just<00:05:10.600> amazing<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.139> really

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
been just it just amazing and really

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.200 
been just it just amazing and really
that<00:05:11.620> just<00:05:12.070> shone<00:05:12.250> out<00:05:12.460> by<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:12.850> fact<00:05:13.060> that<00:05:13.090> it

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
that just shone out by the fact that it

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.410 
that just shone out by the fact that it

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
tick what we're really taking out is the

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.110 
tick what we're really taking out is the
new<00:05:37.710> McLaren<00:05:37.920> ethos<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.490> McLaren<00:05:38.910> way<00:05:39.000> of

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
new McLaren ethos the McLaren way of

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.780 
new McLaren ethos the McLaren way of
thinking<00:05:39.630> and<00:05:39.920> the<00:05:40.920> approach<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.280> we<00:05:41.550> take

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
thinking and the approach that we take

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.790 
thinking and the approach that we take
to<00:05:41.850> solving<00:05:42.420> problems<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.410> I<00:05:43.470> think<00:05:43.500> that's

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
to solving problems and I think that's

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.380 
to solving problems and I think that's
one<00:05:43.950> of<00:05:44.040> our<00:05:44.190> real<00:05:44.760> strengths<00:05:45.090> is<00:05:45.180> actually

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
one of our real strengths is actually

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.990 
one of our real strengths is actually
taking<00:05:45.750> those<00:05:46.130> methodologies<00:05:47.130> out<00:05:47.670> and

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
taking those methodologies out and

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.490 
taking those methodologies out and
applying<00:05:48.600> them<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.930> other<00:05:49.050> industries

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
applying them to other industries

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.410 
applying them to other industries
because<00:05:49.620> we<00:05:50.400> think<00:05:50.520> in<00:05:50.700> quite<00:05:50.880> different<00:05:51.270> way

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
because we think in quite different way

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.750 
because we think in quite different way
in<00:05:51.600> McLaren<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:52.110> think<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.500> by<00:05:53.310> approaching

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
in McLaren I think and by approaching

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.030 
in McLaren I think and by approaching
problems<00:05:54.180> from<00:05:54.540> a<00:05:54.570> different<00:05:54.750> angle<00:05:55.040> we

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
problems from a different angle we

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.620 
problems from a different angle we
really<00:05:56.340> bring<00:05:56.700> a<00:05:56.760> different<00:05:56.910> viewpoint<00:05:57.240> into

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
really bring a different viewpoint into

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.870 
really bring a different viewpoint into
any<00:05:57.840> situation<00:05:58.770> with<00:05:59.700> GB<00:06:00.690> cycling<00:06:01.230> we<00:06:01.880> they

any situation with GB cycling we they

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.340 
any situation with GB cycling we they
came<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.180> us<00:06:03.270> for<00:06:03.390> the<00:06:03.480> problem<00:06:03.810> whereby<00:06:04.020> they

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
came to us for the problem whereby they

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.920 
came to us for the problem whereby they
had<00:06:04.560> they<00:06:05.460> had<00:06:05.580> an<00:06:05.670> off-the-shelf<00:06:06.120> full

sensor<00:06:07.350> on<00:06:07.470> their<00:06:07.710> on<00:06:08.040> their<00:06:08.370> crank<00:06:08.700> so<00:06:08.880> they

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
sensor on their on their crank so they

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.280 
sensor on their on their crank so they
could<00:06:09.090> understand<00:06:09.419> how<00:06:09.600> much<00:06:09.750> power<00:06:10.020> was

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
could understand how much power was

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.140 
could understand how much power was
going<00:06:10.440> into<00:06:10.919> into<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.460> crank<00:06:11.669> at<00:06:11.790> any<00:06:11.880> point

going into into the crank at any point

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.210 
going into into the crank at any point
in<00:06:12.330> time<00:06:12.360> but<00:06:13.320> they'd<00:06:13.440> hit<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.680> limit<00:06:13.950> of<00:06:14.070> that

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
in time but they'd hit the limit of that

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.650 
in time but they'd hit the limit of that
of<00:06:14.669> that<00:06:14.730> sense<00:06:15.090> of<00:06:15.270> what<00:06:15.419> was<00:06:15.540> really

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
of that sense of what was really

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.360 
of that sense of what was really
happening<00:06:15.900> was<00:06:16.230> there's<00:06:16.950> any<00:06:17.100> logging

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
happening was there's any logging

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.480 
happening was there's any logging
information<00:06:17.990> twice<00:06:18.990> a<00:06:19.050> second<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:20.370> that

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
information twice a second and that

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.670 
information twice a second and that
might<00:06:20.640> be<00:06:20.669> very<00:06:20.820> well<00:06:21.030> for<00:06:21.419> a<00:06:21.450> cyclist<00:06:22.440> out<00:06:22.560> on

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
might be very well for a cyclist out on

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.770 
might be very well for a cyclist out on
the<00:06:22.770> road<00:06:22.980> he's<00:06:23.220> out<00:06:23.400> for<00:06:23.610> several<00:06:24.240> hours<00:06:24.540> but

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
the road he's out for several hours but

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.050 
the road he's out for several hours but
for<00:06:24.930> a<00:06:24.990> track<00:06:25.230> cyclist<00:06:25.710> like<00:06:25.890> Chris<00:06:26.100> Hoy<00:06:26.340> his

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
for a track cyclist like Chris Hoy his

for a track cyclist like Chris Hoy his
race<00:06:27.240> is<00:06:27.390> over<00:06:27.540> in<00:06:27.810> tens<00:06:28.770> of<00:06:28.950> seconds<00:06:29.310> less

race is over in tens of seconds less

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.510 
race is over in tens of seconds less
than<00:06:30.480> that<00:06:30.770> it's<00:06:31.770> what<00:06:31.919> we<00:06:32.040> were<00:06:32.130> able<00:06:32.220> to<00:06:32.370> do

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
than that it's what we were able to do

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.370 
than that it's what we were able to do
with<00:06:32.669> them<00:06:32.820> was<00:06:33.030> taken<00:06:33.570> off<00:06:33.810> the<00:06:33.840> shaft<00:06:34.140> system

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
with them was taken off the shaft system

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.770 
with them was taken off the shaft system
and<00:06:34.650> actually<00:06:34.950> rebuild<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:36.090> logging<00:06:36.390> system

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
and actually rebuild the logging system

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.690 
and actually rebuild the logging system
using<00:06:37.320> some<00:06:37.830> of<00:06:37.919> the<00:06:37.979> background<00:06:38.310> we've<00:06:38.550> got

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
using some of the background we've got

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.219 
using some of the background we've got
in<00:06:38.820> Formula<00:06:39.210> One<00:06:39.360> and<00:06:39.479> the<00:06:39.540> approach<00:06:39.810> we<00:06:40.020> take

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
in Formula One and the approach we take

there<00:06:40.530> my<00:06:41.130> curiosity<00:06:41.760> for<00:06:42.020> understanding

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
there my curiosity for understanding

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.840 
there my curiosity for understanding
data<00:06:43.200> really<00:06:43.560> comes<00:06:43.800> from<00:06:44.160> my<00:06:44.310> engineering

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
data really comes from my engineering

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.750 
data really comes from my engineering
mind<00:06:45.060> I<00:06:45.270> think<00:06:45.330> I<00:06:45.540> like<00:06:45.720> to<00:06:45.870> understand<00:06:46.400> why<00:06:47.400> I

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
mind I think I like to understand why I

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.890 
mind I think I like to understand why I
like<00:06:48.030> to<00:06:48.090> understand<00:06:48.419> the<00:06:48.479> wire<00:06:48.660> behind

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
like to understand the wire behind

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.570 
like to understand the wire behind
everything<00:06:49.350> and<00:06:49.650> I<00:06:49.950> think<00:06:50.010> data<00:06:50.340> is<00:06:50.490> a<00:06:50.550> great

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
everything and I think data is a great

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.080 
everything and I think data is a great
way<00:06:50.880> of<00:06:50.910> finding<00:06:51.840> that<00:06:52.110> why<00:06:52.340> people<00:06:53.340> I<00:06:53.580> attract

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
way of finding that why people I attract

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.210 
way of finding that why people I attract
to<00:06:54.360> this<00:06:54.479> company<00:06:55.020> of<00:06:55.080> people<00:06:55.200> who<00:06:55.560> almost

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
to this company of people who almost

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.100 
to this company of people who almost
enjoy<00:06:56.790> the<00:06:57.000> risk<00:06:57.210> enjoy<00:06:57.870> the

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
enjoy the risk enjoy the

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.590 
enjoy the risk enjoy the
unpredictability<00:06:58.830> I<00:06:59.280> like<00:06:59.910> to<00:07:00.090> say<00:07:00.270> that<00:07:00.479> we

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
unpredictability I like to say that we

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.120 
unpredictability I like to say that we
compete<00:07:00.960> for<00:07:01.140> the<00:07:01.200> future<00:07:01.530> in<00:07:01.650> real<00:07:01.830> time
