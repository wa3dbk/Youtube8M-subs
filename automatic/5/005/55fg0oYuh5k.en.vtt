that I did
so<00:03:59.430> I've<00:03:59.790> opted<00:04:00.150> for<00:04:00.510> something<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:01.050> was

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
so I've opted for something that was

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.150 
so I've opted for something that was
going<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:02.010> be<00:04:02.160> very<00:04:02.970> versatile<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:04.980> wear

going to be very versatile so I can wear

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.850 
going to be very versatile so I can wear
it<00:04:05.400> straight<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.420> in<00:04:06.629> my<00:04:06.810> face<00:04:07.080> like<00:04:07.110> this<00:04:07.560> this

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
it straight on in my face like this this

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
it straight on in my face like this this
is<00:04:08.040> how<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.670> would<00:04:09.269> wear<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.410> daily<00:04:11.370> basis

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
is how I would wear it on a daily basis

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.870 
is how I would wear it on a daily basis
and<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.180> wear<00:04:12.599> this<00:04:12.750> daily<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.410> also<00:04:13.980> cut<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.640> to

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
and I wear this daily I also cut it to

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.750 
and I wear this daily I also cut it to
where<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:16.790> comb<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.510> side<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.519> I

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
where I can comb it to the side and so I

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.820 
where I can comb it to the side and so I
will<00:04:20.970> just<00:04:21.150> put<00:04:21.389> a<00:04:21.870> little<00:04:22.019> bit<00:04:22.139> of<00:04:22.320> concealer

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
will just put a little bit of concealer

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:38.710 
will just put a little bit of concealer
in<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.520> part<00:04:23.850> right<00:04:24.030> there

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.619 

just<00:04:39.720> spray<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:39.990> little<00:04:40.169> bit<00:04:43.909> flatten<00:04:44.909> it<00:04:45.030> out<00:04:45.210> I

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.749 
just spray a little bit flatten it out I
was<00:04:46.080> definitely<00:04:46.259> not<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.680> put<00:04:46.949> it<00:04:47.099> in<00:04:47.310> right

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
was definitely not to put it in right

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.510 
was definitely not to put it in right
here<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.569> make<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:48.930> even<00:04:49.860> more<00:04:49.889> flat

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
here just to make it even more flat
