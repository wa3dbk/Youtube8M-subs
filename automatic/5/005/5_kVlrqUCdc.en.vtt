00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
excellent fusion again we are working

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.080 
excellent fusion again we are working

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
now we're using different camera angles

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.420 
now we're using different camera angles
to<00:05:25.780> show<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.200> welding<00:05:26.530> of<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.680> backside<00:05:27.190> with

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
here's the backside after we completed

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.820 
here's the backside after we completed
the<00:05:54.010> weld<00:05:54.720> again<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.870> weld<00:05:56.080> is<00:05:56.230> smooth<00:05:56.530> and

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
the weld again the weld is smooth and

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
now we'll demonstrate the incorrect
