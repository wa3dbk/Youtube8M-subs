some triangles I will suggest that you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.599 
some triangles I will suggest that you
need<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.960> triangle<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> color<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609

you're<00:00:59.850> looking<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:01.140> use<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.980> contrast<00:01:04.519> once

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
you're looking to use for contrast once

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.530

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you do that you know how much yarn unit

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.660 
you do that you know how much yarn unit
for<00:01:10.430> each<00:01:11.430> motif<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.350> happens<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
for each motif and what happens now is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.840 
for each motif and what happens now is
that<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.380> create<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.159> cotton<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that you can create this is cotton and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.859 
that you can create this is cotton and
these<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.770> metal<00:01:23.000> needles<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.600> little

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
these are metal needles it's a little

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.429 
these are metal needles it's a little
bit<00:01:25.220> funky<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.400> using<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.970> I'm<00:01:27.840> trying<00:01:28.200> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
bit funky to using and I'm trying to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.999 
bit funky to using and I'm trying to
show<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:30.920> how<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:33.500> as<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.950> tell

show you how to do this as you can tell

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.889 
show you how to do this as you can tell
sometimes<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> easy<00:01:38.630> but

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.450

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
the main thing here is that you don't

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.849 
the main thing here is that you don't
lose<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:47.740> find<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.890> continent<00:01:49.579> away<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
lose I find this continent away the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.969 
lose I find this continent away the
fastest<00:01:51.859> way<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.159> net<00:01:52.609> and<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:54.200> want<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.560> need<00:01:54.709> to

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
fastest way to net and I want to need to

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.699 
fastest way to net and I want to need to
their<00:01:55.189> end<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:56.689> or<00:01:57.109> at<00:01:57.289> least<00:01:59.319> to<00:02:00.319> almost

you when you want to do a motif let's

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.860 
you when you want to do a motif let's
say<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> reversed<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:12.730> triangle<00:02:13.730> or<00:02:14.299> something

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870

garment the little design ahead of time

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.360 
garment the little design ahead of time
just<00:02:28.340> once<00:02:29.329> you<00:02:30.170> know<00:02:30.440> how<00:02:30.739> much<00:02:30.890> yarn<00:02:31.129> you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
just once you know how much yarn you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.550 
just once you know how much yarn you
need<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:31.910> then<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.660> can<00:02:32.959> just<00:02:33.200> do<00:02:33.410> little

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
need and then you can just do little

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.569 
need and then you can just do little
bobbins<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.870> will<00:02:36.079> happen<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.129> you

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
bobbins and what will happen is that you

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.720 
bobbins and what will happen is that you
can<00:02:37.849> do<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.420> different<00:02:39.049> places<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:40.040> just

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
can do it and different places and just

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.289 
can do it and different places and just
keep<00:02:41.000> joining<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.690> yarn<00:02:44.319> as<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:45.620> go<00:02:45.799> along<00:02:46.299> so

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
keep joining the yarn as you go along so

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.800 
keep joining the yarn as you go along so
this<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.170> front<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.709> these<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.510> i'm<00:02:50.630> going

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
this is the front of these and i'm going

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.879 
this is the front of these and i'm going
to<00:02:50.900> show<00:02:51.019> you<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.260> back<00:02:52.480> see<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.739> what

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
to show you the back see this is what

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.710 
to show you the back see this is what
you<00:02:55.099> don't<00:02:55.549> want<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.970> show<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.419> see<00:02:59.599> the
