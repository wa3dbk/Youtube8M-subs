00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
to utilize it has the curing salt in
there<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.180> inject<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.320> muscle<00:01:28.950> tissue<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
there to inject the muscle tissue of the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690
