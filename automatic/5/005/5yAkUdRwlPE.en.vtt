00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.200
 would be to install it from our tablet 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.540
 of the android smartphone device and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.239

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.870

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.030
 to your file manager in which 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.989
 apps 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.560
