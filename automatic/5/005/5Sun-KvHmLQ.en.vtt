00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.530
 dc 60 trains that are up to now 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.030
 over 40,000 were built 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.980
 enough to make it andy is more 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.539
 sold of all times and is only one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.270
 intermediate stage given that today 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.820
 the bmw m3's number one opponent yes 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.170
 presents completely renewed throughout 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.720
 new agreement but with wishes 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.680
 ambitions that are the same as always 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.539
 hide relevant performances 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.969
 absolute under the forms of a normal one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.590
 Family sedan which road 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.630
 he does his duty as a sedan from 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 family the road code to the good 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 sense it all conspires to force them to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.690
 bet more than anything on what 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 the Roma sisters sisters define that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.480
 on its enormous potential 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.969
 you can have the most of the huge ones 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.260
 suspects on the track in this case 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.870
 the international circuit of the Algarve 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
 close to portimao at the first corner there 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.260
 forget the rear doors of the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 body mass of the car 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.489
 inside the hood the wonderful v8 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.039
 6.2 liter naturally aspirated has given way 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.080
 a 4-liter biturbo now will not be 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.510
 equally engaging but pushing 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.729
 in short, really strong is certainly not the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.290
 moment of regrets and to begin with 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.920
 see the improvements then lower the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 care quantity of horses that are now 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.100
 476 for the normal c63 and even 510 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.030
 for the c63 s close relative of the void 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.560
 of the ngp 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 the engine has an extraordinary capacity 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.670
 to satisfy the pilot's requests 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.409
 the promptness of response the desire to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.659
 take the laps don't regret the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.130
 empty aspire the 8 meters arrive 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.140
 immediately to the wheels followed then 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.119
 by horses and the tachometer needles and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.520
 of the speedometer go up with a speed 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.310
 which is second only to the vehemence in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.290
 race mode reserved only for c63 s 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 at times from the impression of being born 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 for the curbs and fast corners there are 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.240
 always the feeling of being able to do 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 something more than what you are 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.259
 asked when the limits then arrive 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.509
 really slips on the four wheels in 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.820
 numbers progressively and manageable 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.740
 more surprising, however, the c63 demonstrates 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090
 in the mixed strait where it takes 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.219
 nice and good to put it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.990
 all its mass from a curve 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.159
 to the other where perhaps the change shows i 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.140
 his tiny ones 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.179
 it is a strange automatic 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.649
 typically also where the converter 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.849
 of torque in replaced by clutches 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.410
 traditional 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.510
 this makes it fast in passing from one 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.099
 march to the other but between when it moves 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.060
 the father when the march is really 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 available 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.840
 just a moment too long of which 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.970
 moreover, one only realizes in 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.410
 track and when entering a curve 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.420
 the front wheels exhibit a grip 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.099
 extraordinary able to guarantee the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.540
 trajectory even in the most situations 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.670
 hanged but the greatest satisfactions 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.069
 they come mainly from the interaction between 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.569
 the front and rear wheels 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.980
 a serene communicative relationship that 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.629
 allows you to file perfectly 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.950
 even the narrowest trajectories with 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.120
 wise use of steering wheel 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.290
 accelerator 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.360
 the important thing is not to overdo it with 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.799
 the latter with all those newton meters 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.340
 the power oversteer is there that 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.340
 holds women 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.520
 4 meters and 97 centimeters of pure charm 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.780
 sinuous lines that attract the eyes 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.330
 especially when you approach it 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.610
 German virus rivals is that of 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.990
 four-door coupe and it would look like one 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.740
 contradiction of terms 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.740
 but no
