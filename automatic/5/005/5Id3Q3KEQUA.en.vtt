00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.420 
now I did actually put myself years ago
on<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.900> okay<00:00:37.230> anyway<00:00:37.710> I'll<00:00:37.769> be<00:00:37.800> quite<00:00:38.070> what's

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.520 

now<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.120> first<00:01:02.390> thing<00:01:02.600> people<00:01:02.809> notice<00:01:03.170> is

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
now the first thing people notice is

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.060 
now the first thing people notice is
this<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.799> quite<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.630> bad<00:01:05.630> ripoff<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.290> dragon's

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
this is quite a bad ripoff of dragon's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.130 
this is quite a bad ripoff of dragon's
lair<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:08.060> with<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.270> witch<00:01:08.509> instead<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:09.049> a

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
lair but with a witch instead of a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.380 
lair but with a witch instead of a
dragon<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.799> don't<00:01:10.130> think<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.430> animation<00:01:10.970> is

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
dragon I don't think the animation is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.260 
dragon I don't think the animation is
quite<00:01:11.750> as<00:01:11.899> good<00:01:12.049> as<00:01:12.170> Don<00:01:12.320> Bluths<00:01:12.649> but<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:13.909> by

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
quite as good as Don Bluths but it's by

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.600 
quite as good as Don Bluths but it's by
no<00:01:14.299> means<00:01:14.479> bad<00:01:14.899> it's<00:01:15.289> still<00:01:15.439> quite<00:01:15.799> impressive

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
no means bad it's still quite impressive

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.730 
no means bad it's still quite impressive
and<00:01:17.179> it's<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.509> super<00:01:17.780> game<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.439> does<00:01:18.590> look

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
and it's a super game it does look

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.889 
and it's a super game it does look
really<00:01:18.830> good<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.909> always<00:01:20.119> really<00:01:20.659> lot<00:01:20.780> this

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
really good and always really lot this

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.020 
really good and always really lot this
came<00:01:21.140> on<00:01:21.289> in<00:01:21.409> arcade<00:01:21.770> years<00:01:22.039> ago<00:01:22.340> because<00:01:22.970> I

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
came on in arcade years ago because I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.460 
came on in arcade years ago because I
thought<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.420> was<00:01:23.509> more<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.869> challenge<00:01:24.289> than

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
thought it was more of a challenge than

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.469 
thought it was more of a challenge than
dragon's<00:01:24.979> lair<00:01:25.159> because<00:01:25.640> if<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.030> see<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.299> just

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
dragon's lair because if you see it just

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.600 
dragon's lair because if you see it just
tell<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:26.810> what<00:01:26.960> directions<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.560> press<00:01:27.799> but

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
tell you what directions to press but

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.550 
tell you what directions to press but
it's<00:01:28.759> more<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.569> got<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.959> sort<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.350> time

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
it's more you got to it sort of in time

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.559 
it's more you got to it sort of in time
whereas<00:01:31.340> dragon's<00:01:31.700> lair<00:01:31.880> hasn't<00:01:32.360> got<00:01:32.479> as

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
whereas dragon's lair hasn't got as

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.230 
whereas dragon's lair hasn't got as
money<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:33.319> you've<00:01:33.440> got<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.679> do<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:35.060> does

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
caught what graphic and I don't think

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.050 
caught what graphic and I don't think

they use something like that if it went

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.680 
they use something like that if it went

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you know that's what we used to have a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.990 
you know that's what we used to have a
lot<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:25.920> things<00:03:26.130> with<00:03:26.250> censorship<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:26.880> this

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
lot of things with censorship in this

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
lot of things with censorship in this
country<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.540> know<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> UK<00:03:29.390> which<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.720> don't

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
country you know in the UK which I don't

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.420 
country you know in the UK which I don't
believe<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.320> censorship<00:03:31.530> myself<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.250> think

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
believe in censorship myself I think

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.490 
believe in censorship myself I think
it's<00:03:32.550> it's<00:03:33.000> stupid<00:03:33.480> people<00:03:33.900> don't<00:03:34.110> like<00:03:34.350> what

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it's it's stupid people don't like what

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.860 
it's it's stupid people don't like what
I<00:03:34.530> see<00:03:34.770> more<00:03:34.980> don't<00:03:35.190> watch<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.610> then<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.970> if

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
I see more don't watch it then and if

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.050 
I see more don't watch it then and if
something<00:03:37.260> isn't<00:03:37.830> an<00:03:38.160> for<00:03:38.340> kids<00:03:38.520> anyway<00:03:38.850> water

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
something isn't an for kids anyway water

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.610 
something isn't an for kids anyway water
should<00:03:39.270> be<00:03:39.360> watching<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.810> see<00:03:40.170> that's<00:03:40.440> where

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
should be watching it see that's where

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.070 
should be watching it see that's where
of<00:03:40.740> them<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.550> actual<00:03:42.060> because<00:03:42.780> I'm<00:03:42.960> recording

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
of them the actual because I'm recording

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.490 
of them the actual because I'm recording
it<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.740> messed<00:03:44.040> up<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.640> can't<00:03:44.880> do<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.150> bit

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
it it's messed up so I can't do that bit

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.840 
it it's messed up so I can't do that bit
and<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.650> think<00:03:46.800> it'll<00:03:47.010> mess<00:03:47.190> up<00:03:47.220> again<00:03:47.580> later

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
and I think it'll mess up again later

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.350 
and I think it'll mess up again later
but<00:03:49.190> I'd<00:03:50.190> recommend<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.730> game<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.210> you've

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
but I'd recommend this game if you've

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.790 
but I'd recommend this game if you've
never<00:03:51.480> played<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.930> off<00:03:52.050> personally<00:03:52.470> prefer

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
never played it off personally prefer

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.710 
never played it off personally prefer
from<00:03:53.010> Dragon's<00:03:53.370> Lair<00:03:53.520> because<00:03:54.210> I<00:03:54.300> do<00:03:54.360> think

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
from Dragon's Lair because I do think

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.410 
from Dragon's Lair because I do think
it's<00:03:54.990> got<00:03:55.260> more<00:03:55.380> variety<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.820> very<00:03:57.150> similar

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
it's got more variety it's very similar

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.450 
it's got more variety it's very similar
to<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.870> mean<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.140> released<00:03:58.590> by<00:03:58.740> Universal<00:03:58.980> in

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
to it I mean it released by Universal in

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.400 
to it I mean it released by Universal in
1984<00:04:00.150> after<00:04:00.720> Dragon's<00:04:01.290> Lair<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:04.080> think<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
1984 after Dragon's Lair and I think the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.200 
1984 after Dragon's Lair and I think the
arcade<00:04:04.770> unit<00:04:05.130> was<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> bit<00:04:05.550> more<00:04:05.730> reliable

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
arcade unit was a bit more reliable

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.400 
arcade unit was a bit more reliable
because<00:04:06.300> they<00:04:06.480> had<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.630> better<00:04:06.840> laserdisc

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
because they had a better laserdisc

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.350 
because they had a better laserdisc
player<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:08.130> what<00:04:08.280> Dragon's<00:04:08.640> Lair<00:04:08.760> uses

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
player and what Dragon's Lair uses

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.970 
player and what Dragon's Lair uses
because<00:04:09.510> obviously<00:04:09.630> dragons<00:04:10.590> levels<00:04:10.890> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
because obviously dragons levels the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.130 
because obviously dragons levels the
first<00:04:11.010> want<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.490> use<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.600> weren't<00:04:12.900> all

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
first want to use it so it weren't all

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.660 
first want to use it so it weren't all
that<00:04:13.170> reliable<00:04:13.800> when<00:04:14.100> we<00:04:14.280> used<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.490> try

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
that reliable when we used to try

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.789
