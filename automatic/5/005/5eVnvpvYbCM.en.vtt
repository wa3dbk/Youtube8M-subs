00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.899 
in cases like that the only way to stop
it<00:02:46.139> would<00:02:47.139> be<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.469> send<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.919> other<00:02:48.159> troops<00:02:48.609> and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
pleasant but that's just the nature of

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.250 
pleasant but that's just the nature of
what<00:03:00.579> happens<00:03:01.120> when<00:03:01.329> you've<00:03:01.510> got<00:03:01.780> people

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.110 
invading their neighbors does that make
soldiers<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.419> Canada<00:03:14.019> sends<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:15.120> murderers

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
a couple times here tonight I saw that

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.849 
a couple times here tonight I saw that
you<00:03:22.359> were<00:03:22.659> using<00:03:23.169> some<00:03:23.709> straw<00:03:24.310> man<00:03:24.549> arguments

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
you were using some straw man arguments

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.300 
you were using some straw man arguments
of<00:03:26.859> talking<00:03:27.819> about<00:03:27.909> our<00:03:28.470> soldiers<00:03:29.470> killing

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
of talking about our soldiers killing

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.280 
of talking about our soldiers killing
civilians<00:03:33.030> there<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.180> no<00:03:34.329> specific<00:03:34.989> cases

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
civilians there is no specific cases

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.189 
civilians there is no specific cases
that<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.799> mentioned<00:03:36.540> though<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.569> do<00:03:37.689> know<00:03:38.019> that

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
that you mentioned though I do know that

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.149 
that you mentioned though I do know that
there<00:03:38.530> have<00:03:38.829> been<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:40.090> know<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:41.620> know<00:03:41.739> may

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
there have been and I know you know may

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.490 
there have been and I know you know may
not<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.669> word<00:03:42.849> but<00:03:43.379> there<00:03:44.379> have<00:03:44.470> been

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
not like the word but there have been

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.780 
not like the word but there have been
accidents<00:03:46.829> there<00:03:47.829> have<00:03:47.949> been<00:03:48.040> times<00:03:48.340> where

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.580 

some<00:03:51.790> civilians<00:03:52.359> have<00:03:52.629> been<00:03:52.840> killed<00:03:52.870> and

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
some civilians have been killed and

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.740 
some civilians have been killed and
attacked<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:56.500> not<00:03:56.709> right<00:03:57.009> no<00:03:57.449> no<00:03:58.449> one<00:03:58.599> can

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
attacked it's not right no no one can

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.990 
attacked it's not right no no one can
argue<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.319> ever<00:03:59.439> was<00:03:59.859> but<00:04:02.759> for<00:04:03.759> the<00:04:03.849> most

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
argue that it ever was but for the most

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.920 
argue that it ever was but for the most
part<00:04:05.009> if<00:04:06.009> there's<00:04:06.400> civilians<00:04:07.299> killed<00:04:07.840> by

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
part if there's civilians killed by

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.369 
part if there's civilians killed by
Canadian<00:04:08.530> Forces<00:04:10.109> unfortunately<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.199> turns

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
Canadian Forces unfortunately it turns

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.719 
Canadian Forces unfortunately it turns
out<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.620> be<00:04:11.739> just<00:04:11.919> collateral<00:04:12.280> damage<00:04:13.620> and

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
out to be just collateral damage and

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.509 
out to be just collateral damage and
sometimes<00:04:15.729> it's<00:04:15.939> unavoidable

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.599 

do<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.630> soldiers<00:04:20.079> have<00:04:20.319> the<00:04:20.500> intent<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.160> going

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
do the soldiers have the intent of going

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.689 
do the soldiers have the intent of going
in<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.060> killing<00:04:22.930> people<00:04:23.139> that<00:04:23.620> are<00:04:24.400> not

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
in and killing people that are not

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:31.860 
in and killing people that are not
combatants<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:27.810> doubt<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:30.419> I'm<00:04:31.419> sure<00:04:31.690> you're

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
combatants I doubt that I'm sure you're

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.010 
combatants I doubt that I'm sure you're
gonna<00:04:32.020> get<00:04:32.169> a<00:04:32.229> few<00:04:32.500> nut<00:04:33.130> jobs<00:04:33.520> who<00:04:33.819> are<00:04:34.090> all

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
gonna get a few nut jobs who are all

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.800 
gonna get a few nut jobs who are all
excited<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.740> kill<00:04:36.550> all<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.819> ragheads<00:04:39.660> but<00:04:40.660> for

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
excited to kill all the ragheads but for

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.589 
excited to kill all the ragheads but for
the<00:04:40.870> most<00:04:41.050> part<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.880> think<00:04:42.880> you'll<00:04:43.330> see<00:04:43.569> that

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
the most part I think you'll see that

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.249 
the most part I think you'll see that
our<00:04:43.960> armed<00:04:44.229> forces<00:04:45.539> they<00:04:46.539> just<00:04:46.750> want<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:47.020> go<00:04:47.110> in

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
our armed forces they just want to go in

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.140 
our armed forces they just want to go in
there<00:04:47.440> do<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.370> job<00:04:49.050> get<00:04:50.050> out<00:04:50.400> without<00:04:51.400> causing

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
there do the job get out without causing

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.589 
there do the job get out without causing
as<00:04:52.300> many<00:04:53.229> or<00:04:53.770> as<00:04:53.830> much<00:04:54.960> misery<00:04:55.960> as<00:04:56.319> they<00:04:56.530> can

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
as many or as much misery as they can

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.300 
as many or as much misery as they can
war<00:05:00.090> is<00:05:01.090> never<00:05:01.389> pleasant<00:05:01.930> but<00:05:02.039> sometimes<00:05:03.039> it's

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
war is never pleasant but sometimes it's

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.439 
war is never pleasant but sometimes it's
just<00:05:03.639> unavoidable<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:06.180> think<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.270> would<00:05:07.360> be

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
just unavoidable I think it would be

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.640 
just unavoidable I think it would be
great<00:05:07.659> if<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:07.870> didn't<00:05:08.259> have<00:05:08.409> to<00:05:08.560> fight<00:05:08.800> them

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
great if we didn't have to fight them

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.820 
great if we didn't have to fight them
but<00:05:11.650> as<00:05:11.800> long<00:05:12.099> as<00:05:12.130> there<00:05:12.580> are<00:05:13.710> people<00:05:14.710> out

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
but as long as there are people out

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:24.870 
but as long as there are people out
there<00:05:14.860> who<00:05:16.530> are<00:05:17.530> arrogant<00:05:23.340> lots<00:05:24.340> of<00:05:24.610> good
