the<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.300> map<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.649> berlin<00:00:35.100> wall

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
the first map is going to be berlin wall

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.569 
the first map is going to be berlin wall
the<00:00:37.910> part<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> map<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:40.100> gonna<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.550> best

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the part of the map is gonna be the best

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.119 
the part of the map is gonna be the best
known<00:00:42.149> crossing<00:00:42.780> point<00:00:43.079> remain<00:00:43.379> east<00:00:43.710> west

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
known crossing point remain east west

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.520 
known crossing point remain east west
berlin<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.329> apparently<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:46.500> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
berlin so apparently there's a lot of

berlin so apparently there's a lot of
high<00:00:46.710> trapped<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.430> real<00:00:47.579> life<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
high trapped in real life and it's a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.420 
high trapped in real life and it's a
good<00:00:48.539> spot<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> make<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> map<00:00:49.440> copy<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.010> map<00:00:50.190> off

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
good spot to make a map copy a map off

of it's pretty good it looks like in my
point<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> snow<00:00:57.809> map

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
point that it's going to be a snow map

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.020 
point that it's going to be a snow map
I'm<00:00:58.460> gonna<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.670> lot<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> long<00:01:00.149> distance

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
triarch they said each map was going to

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.690 
triarch they said each map was going to
be<00:01:06.030> interactive<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> player<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.040> kind

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700

off yep well that's how these maps are
going<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.650> they're<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.190> releasing<00:01:17.520> what

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
going to be they're not releasing what

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.450 
going to be they're not releasing what
it<00:01:18.120> is<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.600> yet<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:20.030> who<00:01:21.030> knows<00:01:21.260> I'm

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
expecting only good things the second

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.800 
expecting only good things the second
map<00:01:41.910> is<00:01:42.380> discovered<00:01:43.880> once<00:01:44.880> again<00:01:45.060> also<00:01:45.600> looks

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
map is discovered once again also looks

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.900 
map is discovered once again also looks
like<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:46.020> snow<00:01:46.350> map<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.759> like

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
like a snow map they really do like

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.300 
like a snow map they really do like
there's<00:01:48.119> no<00:01:48.300> matter<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.740> game<00:01:49.920> has<00:01:50.100> more

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
there's no matter the this game has more

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.859 
there's no matter the this game has more
snow<00:01:50.550> maps<00:01:50.790> than<00:01:50.970> any<00:01:51.119> other<00:01:51.360> caught<00:01:51.630> game

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
snow maps than any other caught game

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.870 
snow maps than any other caught game
that<00:01:52.050> I've<00:01:52.170> been<00:01:52.320> played<00:01:52.650> it's<00:01:53.550> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> be

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that I've been played it's going to be

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.450 
that I've been played it's going to be
in<00:01:53.970> Antarctica<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.590> German<00:01:56.070> Research

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
in Antarctica it's a German Research

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.950 
in Antarctica it's a German Research
Center<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.090> been<00:01:57.240> abandoned<00:01:57.810> since

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
Center and it's been abandoned since

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.870 
Center and it's been abandoned since
World<00:01:58.320> War<00:01:58.410> two<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.190> it's<00:01:59.340> probably<00:01:59.430> gonna

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
World War two so it's probably gonna

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.469 
World War two so it's probably gonna
look<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.690> ghost<00:02:01.380> town<00:02:04.910> another<00:02:05.910> map<00:02:06.210> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
look like a ghost town another map that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.809 
look like a ghost town another map that
they<00:02:06.630> didn't<00:02:06.899> release<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.770> Kowloon<00:02:08.460> I

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
they didn't release is the Kowloon I

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.090 
they didn't release is the Kowloon I
can't<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:09.929> pronounce<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.470> my<00:02:10.649> best<00:02:10.890> guess

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
can't really pronounce it my best guess

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.330 
can't really pronounce it my best guess
is<00:02:11.130> Kowloon<00:02:11.760> um<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:13.440> gonna<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:14.069> set<00:02:14.250> in

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
is Kowloon um it's gonna be set in

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.700 
is Kowloon um it's gonna be set in
Kowloon<00:02:14.640> city<00:02:14.880> Hong<00:02:15.180> Kong<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:16.410> got<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.650> be

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
Kowloon city Hong Kong it's got to be

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.370 
Kowloon city Hong Kong it's got to be
played<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.190> rooftops<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.569> rainy

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
played on the rooftops the rainy

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.000 
played on the rooftops the rainy
rooftops<00:02:20.069> Gotham<00:02:20.760> City<00:02:21.060> um<00:02:21.740> you're<00:02:22.740> gonna<00:02:22.830> be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
rooftops Gotham City um you're gonna be

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.840 
rooftops Gotham City um you're gonna be
able<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.220> shoot<00:02:23.930> up<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.350> down<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.069> there's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
able to shoot up and down so there's

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.970 
able to shoot up and down so there's
going<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> be<00:02:27.150> elevated<00:02:27.569> spots<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.560> map<00:02:28.740> so

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
going to be elevated spots of the map so

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.090 
going to be elevated spots of the map so
it's<00:02:29.130> not<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> be<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:30.740> one<00:02:31.740> level

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
it's not just going to be a one level

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.699 
it's not just going to be a one level
math<00:02:32.690> I'm<00:02:33.690> guessing<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.260> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.590> like

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
math I'm guessing it's going to be like
