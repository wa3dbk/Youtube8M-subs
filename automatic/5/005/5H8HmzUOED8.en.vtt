00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
 opposite her is the worthy spine of 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.500
 just got the connoisseur game with istanbul 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.870
 of the year won cordial 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.920
 congratulations, yes you were already them 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.540
 We start with a different way 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.950
 for all who do not know the game in 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.689
 two three sentences what is it all about? 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.640
 Istanbul 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.250
 yes the players slip into the role 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.950
 of merchants in istanbul and theirs 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.439
 task it is the first five rabbis 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.060
 to collect and rubies those 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.370
 you get by solving tasks 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.540
 task can be different 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.399
 collecting gems or money 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 leave 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.079
 and yes, the special thing about the game is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.059
 stop the train mechanism because stand 16 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.789
 places available but the train far 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.199
 therefore limited to 1 to 2 and then 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.960
 You have to go every time you have an action 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.609
 wants to make a mate 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.230
 or even collect them again and 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.449
 there is just such a small 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.670
 logistic problem how do I do that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.589
 first of all, I'll rub these five rubies 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.879
 we just have to ask for the price 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.530
 heard that you said the game 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 was developed over a terribly long time 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.600
 three years 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.600
 what took so long 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.850
 the development time therefore purely temporally 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.890
 It was already three years ago 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.500
 was only four years ago I had 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.620
 both the current il vecchio as well 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.690
 the present istanbul is presented and 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.400
 Ralf has enjoyed both games well and 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.260
 actually we were just using up 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.390
 land in istanbul working on it 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.680
 but then suddenly a lot more 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.660
 done in also in the area vecchio and 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.310
 then it's a bit behind 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.310
 we were then first 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.270
 have cared then get out but by 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.650
 the development time was then 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.090
 subsequently after that published 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.979
 we were then intensively 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.080
 sat down because the game had so synonymous 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.479
 Potential and there we have it right 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.250
 Everything was beautiful and new 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.050
 mechanisms are also sought after and and and 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.910
 if you develop games there are here 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.229
 different approaches 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.119
 Either one starts from the topic or from 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.860
 a little something to the mechanics 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.750
 genesis of islam and 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.310
 say and how do you approach this game 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.890
 gone because the development of this 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.170
 Yes, I am one of them always 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.940
 from the mechanics approaches to such a 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.160
 play and with me it was just very 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.040
 important so my basic idea was 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.600
 just that I have a variable place 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.480
 So I always have it 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.330
 new scenario and that I go through 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.000
 these places here move actions make 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.190
 So that was my first thought and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.020
 this to the mechanism of the now very 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.850
 it was even exposed 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.210
 not yet so we still have it 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.980
 still had the places from a to blablabla 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.470
 provided with letters and I had 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.910
 then on posters I played out 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.720
 and if I had played them 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.090
 I could not go back 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.100
 It was so much more handling and towards the end 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.800
 the development phase then us 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.270
 We sat down more intensively 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.010
 somehow I still gave the feeling 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.220
 we still get people something 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.300
 what makes you kick and yes and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.790
 then I played around a bit 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.820
 and playing around with this is then 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
 this thing arose with these 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.410
 release mechanism and again 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.030
 so collect and yes that was how it is 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.790
 it then came to the topic as saying 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.380
 you actually go out of the mechanics 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.510
 for me it's even a non alps 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.550
 always but it is very common so if it is 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.060
 just go shopping and sell 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.790
 Im immediately in the middle ages only 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.260
 blah blah blah and so it was also and there 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.430
 So do you too , so I'm one 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.410
 he does not worry so much 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.690
 because me is important if the editor 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.760
 says rÃ¼diger of the game well and has 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.380
 potential blablabla then I know that 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.390
 the game is good and then i can 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.190
 insert energy and say okay now 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.840
 Let's take a look at the topic and then 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.280
 I sit down more intensively as well 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.930
 at the way or also at istanbul 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.030
 monsters sat once said what 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.680
 which is still not so exhausted 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.810
 So I start very often as already 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.550
 said with larifari themes or it 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.390
 is also going on topics because it is for me 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.550
 First of all , the game is important 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.070
 is working 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.410
 So the many players know the game 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.340
 already a small area 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.230
 probably already very hot 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.030
 extension what he probably too 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.410
 I'll take it when it comes 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.400
 has not become a game of the year 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.410
 there is already an extension 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.760
 spielbox administration the doner kebab which 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.900
 enlargement will come in the future 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.120
 or what did you develop 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.100
 except perhaps what then still 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.590
 being published is important at 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.930
 your formulation because is now 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.580
 No game is extended that was 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.310
 not at all the case with this 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.770
 cause it was really like that now 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.510
 that we or that after I do that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.070
 I got it in March 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.800
 played a few times and I thought it was nice 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.540
 but I thought human being there 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.310
 you can bring something in there as well 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.020
 there was not nominated and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.060
 I also did not know Oberhof like that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.230
 cuts off and then I have myself 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.270
 just sat down a bit because 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.530
 you so what I do always like that I 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.270
 then I played that said 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.920
 people where could you still a bit 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.060
 rum shine which would still exciting 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.550
 and down and then I have one 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.730
 extension and I have 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.370
 Also already presented in Oberhof and 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.140
 the ralf found that very nice 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.180
 except for one thing the lobster now but 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.640
 taken out and in this but then 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.350
 now continue to work and we will 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.510
 Try it out one way or the other 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.310
 brought because it is simply a value 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.890
 So that's when you played it 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.120
 then you will be without this extension 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.590
 I think that is probably not more then 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.630
 but now want to play one 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.249
 little detail what awaits us for 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.229
 this extension 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:23.199
 exciting new action seemed to everyone 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.699
 falling four signposts here and I was 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.649
 It just matters that still 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.929
 So it's going to be an alternative for everyone 

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:30.849
 If you want to give an area where you are 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:33.219
 again the possibility has rubies too 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.839
 get and then there is one more 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.099
 second area also very 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.559
 interesting but I do not go up 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.199
 details one should come then in Nuremberg 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:44.709
 everything else is just like that right now 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.379
 flow what the 2012 nominated for the 

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:49.659
 game of the year with las vegas or vegas 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.089
 and then because of the pcs vegas exact 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.529
 is now called las vegas love stitch election 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.479
 because now you you win today 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.999
 would have been disappointed if it again 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.519
 would not have worked 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:02.769
 I think you are always disappointed when 

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:05.829
 you do not win because the nomination 

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:07.389
 yes, it is already a while back 

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:09.639
 you have that too , so to speak 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.349
 one is now nominated and 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.259
 then you always hope for that 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.189
 icing that comes then and 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.249
 as you said that in the 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:20.860
 It was not like that in the past 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.629
 Winning it was like that was now 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.189
 istanbul is now the fifth nomination 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.719
 but I have not always with all 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.389
 somehow chances calculated 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.799
 except las vegas and there were in the 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.269
 apron holds the expectation 

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:33.369
 It must be human and it speaks 

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:35.079
 Families and there I have such a 

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:36.549
 pressure felt me human thought that 

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:38.709
 it also has to be there and there 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:40.779
 the disappointment was very high because 

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:43.719
 you call me now with 2014 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:45.219
 I thought so why should 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.139
 I can not do it or why 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:49.509
 the other two win against it 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.769
 so many thoughts through the head but it 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.269
 was not that way now i say now 

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:54.429
 Now I am super disappointed 

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:56.619
 but you think why should I 

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:58.839
 do not make it that's me 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:00.700
 can say hard so it was up now 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:03.550
 in any case, not the pressure there but 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.860
 it did not speak against 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.030
 mainz springer and then in the reason 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.540
 It is then so if they then 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.800
 lift it and then it is there 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.500
 which then also I was really happy 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:24.780
 it was just wonderful 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:24.780
 Actually you are called more
