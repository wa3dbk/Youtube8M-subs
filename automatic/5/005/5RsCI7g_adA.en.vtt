I<00:01:06.770> wanted<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.759> find<00:01:08.000> out<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:08.540> I<00:01:08.780> did<00:01:09.260> some

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
I wanted to find out so I did some

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.480 
I wanted to find out so I did some
testing<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.330> right<00:01:11.330> here<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:12.110> let's<00:01:13.010> see<00:01:13.250> I

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
testing and right here I let's see I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.730 
testing and right here I let's see I
think<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:13.970> cast<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.930> left<00:01:15.200> of<00:01:15.409> her<00:01:15.560> and

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
think I cast it to the left of her and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.530 
think I cast it to the left of her and
it<00:01:15.799> doesn't<00:01:16.159> hit<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:16.670> might<00:01:16.880> hit<00:01:17.060> actually

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
it doesn't hit it might hit actually

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.920 
it doesn't hit it might hit actually
let's<00:01:18.049> see

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.310 

yeah<00:01:21.890> okay<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:22.580> does<00:01:22.790> hit<00:01:23.060> which<00:01:23.840> indicates

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
yeah okay so it does hit which indicates

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.340 
yeah okay so it does hit which indicates
to<00:01:24.500> me<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.100> closer<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.670> are<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:26.350> doesn't

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
to me that the closer you are it doesn't

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.240 
to me that the closer you are it doesn't
really<00:01:27.590> matter<00:01:27.950> where<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.430> put<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.730> cursor

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
really matter where you put the cursor

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.620 
really matter where you put the cursor
to<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.280> champion<00:01:31.850> but<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.180> further<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.510> are

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
to the champion but the further you are

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.630
