00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
shape just check the bottom of the half

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.110 
shape just check the bottom of the half
so<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.720> take<00:00:36.900> that<00:00:37.080> off<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.560> that

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I'm just going to smooth that edge down

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.090 
I'm just going to smooth that edge down
a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.670> bit<00:00:41.880> where<00:00:42.090> we've<00:00:42.240> cut<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.950> now

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
a little bit where we've cut it and now

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.370 
a little bit where we've cut it and now
I<00:00:44.130> just<00:00:44.220> want<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.820> small<00:00:45.660> amount<00:00:45.900> of<00:00:46.080> white

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
I just want a small amount of white

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.800 
I just want a small amount of white
modeling<00:00:47.010> paste<00:00:47.220> which<00:00:47.580> is<00:00:47.970> probably<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.630> bit

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
modeling paste which is probably a bit

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.260 
modeling paste which is probably a bit
much<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:50.810> size<00:00:51.810> just<00:00:51.870> hold<00:00:52.530> against<00:00:53.270> your

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
much the size just hold against your

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.350 
much the size just hold against your
little<00:00:54.480> dummy<00:00:54.780> ship<00:00:54.990> so<00:00:55.290> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:56.150> if<00:00:57.150> it's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
little dummy ship so you can see if it's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
little dummy ship so you can see if it's
about<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.690> right<00:00:57.810> size<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.260> roughly<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
about the right size that's roughly the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.500 
about the right size that's roughly the
right<00:00:58.860> size<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.310> I<00:00:59.490> made<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> kind<00:01:00.060> of<00:01:00.150> herbal

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
right size so I made it kind of herbal

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.810 
right size so I made it kind of herbal
and<00:01:00.630> squash<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.080> down<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.610> start

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and squash it down a little bit to start

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
and squash it down a little bit to start
with<00:01:02.970> but<00:01:03.060> now<00:01:03.150> we're<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.450> change<00:01:03.630> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
with but now we're going to change the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.999 
with but now we're going to change the
shape<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.199> bit<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.829> to

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
shape a little bit more so I'm going to

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.740 
shape a little bit more so I'm going to
pinch<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.630> at<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> bottom<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:08.600> like<00:01:09.600> they

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
pinch it at the bottom just like they

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.860 
pinch it at the bottom just like they
want<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:11.190> be<00:01:11.340> too<00:01:11.550> long<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.630> point

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
want it to not be too long in the point

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.350 
want it to not be too long in the point
if<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.470> makes<00:01:13.650> sense

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
if that makes sense

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
if that makes sense
and<00:01:15.360> using<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:15.870> modeling<00:01:16.260> tool<00:01:16.530> I'm

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and using a little modeling tool I'm

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
and using a little modeling tool I'm
just<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.190> down<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.520> top<00:01:17.730> of<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:18.030> put<00:01:18.659> an

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
just going to down the top of it put an

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.210 
just going to down the top of it put an
indentation<00:01:20.330> down<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.540> center<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.130> we

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
indentation down the center so that we

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.250 
indentation down the center so that we
create<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.510> heart<00:01:24.840> shape<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
create a little heart shape if you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.510 
create a little heart shape if you
prefer<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> use<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> cutter<00:01:26.010> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.280> use<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
prefer to use a cutter you can use a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240 
prefer to use a cutter you can use a
cutter<00:01:26.760> that<00:01:26.880> style<00:01:27.830> just<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:28.860> little<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.190> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
cutter that style just a little bit of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.010 
cutter that style just a little bit of
water<00:01:29.870> in<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:31.080> center<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:35.190> we're<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
water in the center and we're going to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.770 
water in the center and we're going to
stick<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.229> place<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.360> I've

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
stick that in place like so and now I've

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.530 
stick that in place like so and now I've
got<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.380> number<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:41.030> piping<00:01:42.030> nozzle<00:01:42.180> for

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
got a number for piping nozzle for

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.820 
got a number for piping nozzle for
cutting<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.840> some<00:01:42.960> little<00:01:43.200> holes<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.590> so
