00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.549
 all your guests a very good day 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.440
 ar here and today I will show you 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.440
 how to get the best out of your school 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.570
 can troll step 1 make sure you have your CV 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.119
 on a large channel such as daily CD 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.519
 step 2 make sure that the series is viewed frequently 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.230
 and preferably that it is strange like 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.390
 with me the strange fact 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.339
 Step 3 Make sure you are so often viewed 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.929
 so that often on youtube and on google 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.180
 appears in the search result 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.760
 Step 4 Make sure you try getting school 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.079
 in which you have to process for beer and 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.680
 where you need different phobias 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.260
 to investigate 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.280
 I chose the idea phobia 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.809
 step 5 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.550
 go search and waited balls from you 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.649

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.629
 strange but I have the assignment at school 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.000
 got to make a blog about it 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.679
 Strangers for beer and I chose 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.879
 for all the idea for whom some people 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.190
 from a class who also have strange before 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.469
 chosen beer and our teacher said that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.329
 we google and youtube as completely the 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.559
 can use search results so me 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.000
 about the at school 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.560

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 for whom and I have a really true the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.410
 broke out of my pants 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.170
 because you never clear what is right 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.070
 I will go find it but after it 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.690
 phobia idea 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.220
 anatidae for whom sometimes one 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.480
 little fills written so he is good 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.880
 to that idea for whom 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.350
 and look at the search results by number 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.570
 2 fear of one 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.060

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.810
 first 8 search results seven times before 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.900

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.090

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.650
 phobia then I get myself into the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.210
 search result namely fear of this 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.500
 a de to the idea for who I know 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.270
 not if you are often in between but 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.160
 in the middle of here again fear of one 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.960
 the idea of ​​phobia is actually possible 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.880
 I just use myself as a source for that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.590
 a school load and that's great 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.650
 and that's how I troll my school because they know 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.250
 it doesn't they don't know that I have arjan 1995 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.660

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.580
 and she always knows Arjan's name and that 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.709
 I come at the end of 1995 but they don't know 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.670
 that these videos are mine so that is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.780
