00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
of everything go flying about I wouldn't

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.510

really<00:04:40.750> make<00:04:40.990> many<00:04:41.560> predictions<00:04:42.040> just

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
really make many predictions just

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.760 
really make many predictions just
because<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:43.000> don't<00:04:43.480> see<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.840> point<00:04:44.050> like

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
because I don't see the point like

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.560 
because I don't see the point like
because<00:04:45.100> I'm<00:04:45.250> probably<00:04:45.550> gonna<00:04:45.820> be<00:04:45.970> wronged<00:04:46.330> if

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
because I'm probably gonna be wronged if

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.180 
because I'm probably gonna be wronged if
I'm<00:04:46.690> completely<00:04:46.870> honest<00:04:47.320> we<00:04:47.560> can<00:04:47.740> call<00:04:47.980> all

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
I'm completely honest we can call all

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.860 
I'm completely honest we can call all
the<00:04:48.430> obvious<00:04:48.880> things<00:04:48.910> like<00:04:49.270> wolf<00:04:49.630> bug

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
the obvious things like wolf bug

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.650 
the obvious things like wolf bug
probably<00:04:50.530> maybe<00:04:50.920> could<00:04:51.370> be<00:04:51.400> pair<00:04:51.730> at<00:04:52.420> some

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
probably maybe could be pair at some

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.300 
probably maybe could be pair at some
point<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.170> all<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.560> consistent<00:04:54.070> decks

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
point and all the consistent decks

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.680 
point and all the consistent decks
probably<00:04:54.820> gonna<00:04:54.940> have<00:04:55.090> something<00:04:55.450> hitting

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
probably gonna have something hitting

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.990 
probably gonna have something hitting
that's<00:04:56.440> just<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.010> way<00:04:57.130> Konami<00:04:57.460> work<00:04:57.700> that's

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
that's just the way Konami work that's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.730 
that's just the way Konami work that's
the<00:04:58.120> way<00:04:58.240> they<00:04:58.450> actually<00:04:58.690> keep<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.380> business

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
the way they actually keep the business

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.710 
the way they actually keep the business
rolling<00:05:00.100> because<00:05:00.550> if<00:05:00.880> they<00:05:01.030> just<00:05:01.240> left<00:05:01.480> and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
rolling because if they just left and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.950 
rolling because if they just left and
system<00:05:02.140> good<00:05:02.380> decks<00:05:02.710> from<00:05:02.920> previous<00:05:03.400> formats
