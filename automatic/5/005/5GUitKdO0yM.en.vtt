00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.230 
shape again and then another thing I did
I<00:02:19.170> don't<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.860> lay<00:02:20.010> my<00:02:20.040> brushes<00:02:20.460> sideways

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
I don't like to lay my brushes sideways

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.440 
I don't like to lay my brushes sideways
because<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.290> lot<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.010> times<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.820> happens<00:02:23.850> is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
because a lot of times what happens is

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.400 
because a lot of times what happens is
the<00:02:25.080> water<00:02:25.110> gets<00:02:25.950> trapped<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.200> here<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
the water gets trapped up in here and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.590 
the water gets trapped up in here and
when<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.490> gets<00:02:29.550> trapped<00:02:29.850> up<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.420> it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
when it gets trapped up in here it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.930 
when it gets trapped up in here it
loosens<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.260> glue<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:32.280> bristles<00:02:32.580> can

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
loosens the glue and your bristles can

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.880 
loosens the glue and your bristles can
fall<00:02:33.150> out<00:02:33.180> or<00:02:33.660> either<00:02:33.810> your<00:02:33.960> handle<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.680> fall

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
fall out or either your handle can fall

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.430 
fall out or either your handle can fall
off<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.550> I've<00:02:36.300> had<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.690> happen<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:37.200> lot<00:02:37.230> in

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
off and I've had that happen a lot in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.940 
off and I've had that happen a lot in
art<00:02:37.770> class<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.780> yeah<00:02:39.780> art<00:02:40.350> class<00:02:40.500> taught

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
art class and so yeah art class taught

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.550 
art class and so yeah art class taught
me<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> lot<00:02:41.280> about<00:02:41.570> brushes<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.750> stuff<00:02:45.260> yeah<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
me a lot about brushes and stuff yeah I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.850 
me a lot about brushes and stuff yeah I
took<00:02:46.920> studio<00:02:47.430> art<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.850> four<00:02:48.060> years<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.860> anyway

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
took studio art for four years so anyway

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.050 
took studio art for four years so anyway
so<00:02:51.320> yeah<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.500> pretty<00:02:52.709> simple<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.400> make<00:02:53.850> sure

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
so yeah it's pretty simple you make sure

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720 
so yeah it's pretty simple you make sure
your<00:02:54.540> brushes<00:02:54.959> are<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> downward<00:02:55.590> angle<00:02:56.070> in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
your brushes are on a downward angle in

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.540 
your brushes are on a downward angle in
order<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.720> make<00:02:58.170> sure<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> water<00:02:58.770> doesn't<00:02:59.310> get

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
order to make sure the water doesn't get

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.600 
order to make sure the water doesn't get
trapped<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.240> top<00:03:00.480> parts<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.130> brushes

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
trapped in the top parts of the brushes

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.580 
trapped in the top parts of the brushes
and<00:03:02.790> make<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.390> bristles<00:03:03.840> fall<00:03:04.020> out<00:03:04.230> or<00:03:04.380> either

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and make the bristles fall out or either

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.550 
and make the bristles fall out or either
the<00:03:04.740> hand<00:03:05.130> will<00:03:05.310> fall<00:03:05.520> off<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.780> what<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> did

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the hand will fall off and so what I did

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
the hand will fall off and so what I did
instead<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.970> getting<00:03:09.780> some<00:03:09.959> fancy<00:03:10.500> shmancy

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
instead of getting some fancy shmancy

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.610 
instead of getting some fancy shmancy
thing<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.570> trying<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.930> set<00:03:13.110> them<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.320> cup

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
thing or trying to set them in a cup

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.250 
thing or trying to set them in a cup
because<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.519> cup<00:03:14.760> was<00:03:14.940> essentially<00:03:15.540> trap<00:03:16.080> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
because the cup was essentially trap the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.040 
because the cup was essentially trap the
water<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.800> bottle<00:03:17.370> okay<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
water in the bottle okay and so the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.330 
water in the bottle okay and so the
water<00:03:19.260> would<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.680> be<00:03:19.800> sitting<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
water would just be sitting on the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.880 
water would just be sitting on the
bristles<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.970> would<00:03:21.090> never<00:03:21.269> dry<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.380> what

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
bristles and it would never dry so what

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.800 
bristles and it would never dry so what
I<00:03:23.100> decided<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.730> do<00:03:23.940> was<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.300> took<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.660> little

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
I decided to do was I took a little

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.860 
I decided to do was I took a little
piece<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.170> cardboard<00:03:25.470> here<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:27.180> folded<00:03:27.690> in

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
piece of cardboard here and I folded in

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.810 
piece of cardboard here and I folded in
half<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.620> make<00:03:28.650> almost<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.670> little

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
half to make almost like a little

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.030 
half to make almost like a little
pyramid<00:03:31.340> okay<00:03:32.340> can<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.030> guys<00:03:33.120> see<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:34.040> how

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
pyramid okay can you guys see that how

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.310 
pyramid okay can you guys see that how
is<00:03:35.220> almost<00:03:35.610> like<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.820> little<00:03:36.060> payment<00:03:39.320> it's

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
is almost like a little payment it's

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.750 
is almost like a little payment it's
like<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> little<00:03:40.709> peer<00:03:40.980> minute<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.400> make<00:03:41.730> sure

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
like a little peer minute and make sure

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.240 
like a little peer minute and make sure
you<00:03:42.000> kind<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.269> fold<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.660> sharply<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.500> so

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
you kind of fold that sharply and so

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.310 
you kind of fold that sharply and so
what<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.790> does<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.180> commute<00:03:47.120> I'm<00:03:48.120> sorry<00:03:48.390> okay

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
what it does the commute I'm sorry okay

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.979 
what it does the commute I'm sorry okay
so<00:03:49.620> there's<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.400> little<00:03:50.580> pyramid<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.450> try<00:03:51.930> to

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
so there's a little pyramid and try to

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.650 
so there's a little pyramid and try to
fold<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.410> sharply<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.330> what<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.450> does<00:03:54.600> is

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
fold that sharply and what it does is

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.660 
fold that sharply and what it does is
create<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:56.360> downward<00:03:57.360> slope<00:03:57.980> for<00:03:58.980> your<00:03:59.130> brushes

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
create a downward slope for your brushes

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.050 
create a downward slope for your brushes
and<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.720> when<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.800> wash<00:04:02.160> your<00:04:02.340> brushes<00:04:02.580> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
and so when you wash your brushes and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.390 
and so when you wash your brushes and
you<00:04:03.150> smooth<00:04:03.480> them<00:04:03.660> out<00:04:03.720> with<00:04:03.900> your<00:04:04.049> hands

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
you smooth them out with your hands

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.560 
you smooth them out with your hands
after<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.610> wring<00:04:05.850> out<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.030> water<00:04:06.360> and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
after you wring out the water and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.560 
after you wring out the water and
everything<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.560> shape<00:04:07.860> them<00:04:08.269> you<00:04:09.269> can<00:04:09.390> go

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
everything and you shape them you can go

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.590 
everything and you shape them you can go
ahead<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.049> just<00:04:10.530> lay<00:04:10.830> them<00:04:11.160> on<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:12.299> downward

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
ahead and just lay them on this downward

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.260 
ahead and just lay them on this downward
angle<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.730> water<00:04:14.970> will

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
angle and all of the water will

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.300 
angle and all of the water will
essentially<00:04:15.780> gravity<00:04:16.650> will<00:04:16.770> pull<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.979> water

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
essentially gravity will pull the water

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.530 
essentially gravity will pull the water
this<00:04:17.640> way<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.209> down<00:04:18.390> this<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.840> town

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
this way and down this of the town

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.350 
this way and down this of the town
this<00:04:19.810> up<00:04:19.990> under<00:04:20.440> versus<00:04:21.370> just<00:04:21.580> sitting<00:04:22.120> on

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
this up under versus just sitting on

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.440 
this up under versus just sitting on
this<00:04:23.320> part<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.950> loosening<00:04:24.700> your<00:04:24.910> glue<00:04:25.210> and

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
this part and loosening your glue and

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.760 
this part and loosening your glue and
