1/3<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> way<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:53.070> white<00:01:53.939> vinegar<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
1/3 of the way with white vinegar and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.230 
1/3 of the way with white vinegar and
the<00:01:55.140> balance<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.680> cold<00:01:55.920> water<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.460> then

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the balance with cold water and then

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
the balance with cold water and then
it'll<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.689> through<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> cleaning<00:01:58.290> cycle<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it'll go through a cleaning cycle and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.289 
it'll go through a cleaning cycle and
you<00:01:59.040> should<00:01:59.250> rinse<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.579> out<00:01:59.670> afterwards<00:02:00.000> with
