00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hi everyone I'm just going to test me

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.160 
hi everyone I'm just going to test me
ob1<00:00:02.850> have<00:00:03.389> any<00:00:03.510> just<00:00:03.720> go<00:00:03.870> right<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.140> other

ob1 have any just go right to the other
day<00:00:05.450> see<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.540> can<00:00:06.660> do<00:00:06.779> some<00:00:06.930> separation

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
day see we can do some separation

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.250 
day see we can do some separation
between<00:00:08.130> rust<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.300> I've<00:00:09.719> got<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> standard

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
between rust and I've got a standard

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.980 
between rust and I've got a standard
trade<00:00:10.469> weight<00:00:10.710> as<00:00:10.950> well<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.719> gonna<00:00:12.840> see

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
trade weight as well so I'm gonna see

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.220 
trade weight as well so I'm gonna see
how<00:00:13.080> she<00:00:13.139> performs<00:00:13.730> I've<00:00:14.730> got<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
how she performs I've got the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.590 
how she performs I've got the
sensitivity<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.730> about<00:00:17.730> ten<00:00:18.180> light<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.449> can

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
sensitivity on about ten light you can

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.550 
sensitivity on about ten light you can
see<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.550> level<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.230> between<00:00:22.230> what

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
see there this is level one between what

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.390 
see there this is level one between what
it's<00:00:22.920> between<00:00:23.070> temporary<00:00:25.130> yeah<00:00:26.130> I've<00:00:26.220> got

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's between temporary yeah I've got

let's try it a bit closer tell you what
let's<00:02:12.350> put<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.709> top<00:02:13.810> let's<00:02:14.810> test<00:02:15.049> right

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:27.250

the look again the angle from the camera
obviously<00:02:27.349> don't<00:02:28.160> benefit<00:02:29.680> asked<00:02:30.680> how<00:02:30.830> deep

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
obviously don't benefit asked how deep

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.420 
obviously don't benefit asked how deep
that<00:02:31.099> is<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.930> gotta<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:33.380> least<00:02:33.440> 11<00:02:33.860> toes

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that is it's gotta be at least 11 toes

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.300 
that is it's gotta be at least 11 toes
maybe<00:02:35.270> more<00:02:35.540> inches<00:02:35.870> off<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.020> ground

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.690 

see<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:41.420> discriminating<00:02:42.400> pieces<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.519> rust

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
see it's discriminating pieces of rust

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.229 
see it's discriminating pieces of rust
there<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.319> still<00:02:48.500> picks<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.920> up<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:50.120> to

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
there and it still picks it up just to

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.080 
there and it still picks it up just to
prove<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:51.069> let's<00:02:52.069> put<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.519> over<00:02:52.580> there

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
