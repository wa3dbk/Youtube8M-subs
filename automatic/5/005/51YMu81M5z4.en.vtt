and then I separate each one just a
little<00:03:39.170> bit<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:39.800> I'll<00:03:40.570> keep<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.780> little<00:03:41.810> bit

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
little bit so I'll keep it a little bit

00:03:42.200 --> 00:04:19.960 
little bit so I'll keep it a little bit
of<00:03:42.320> body<00:03:47.170> just<00:03:48.170> play<00:03:48.470> with<00:03:48.710> it

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.230 

basically<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.570> end<00:04:21.720> result<00:04:23.240> but

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
basically this is the end result but

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.140 
basically this is the end result but
I'll<00:04:24.419> play<00:04:24.570> with<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> little<00:04:25.020> bit<00:04:25.200> more
