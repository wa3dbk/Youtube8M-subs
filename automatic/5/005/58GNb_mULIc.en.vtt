00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

it<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.480> about<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.989> third<00:00:01.949> day<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.250> our<00:00:02.370> cruise

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
it is about the third day of our cruise

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.840 
it is about the third day of our cruise
I<00:00:02.939> believe<00:00:03.240> we've<00:00:03.480> gone<00:00:03.780> from<00:00:04.170> Copenhagen<00:00:04.950> up

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
I believe we've gone from Copenhagen up

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.299 
I believe we've gone from Copenhagen up
to<00:00:06.859> the<00:00:08.630> fjord<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.809> Norway<00:00:09.840> which<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.099> saw

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
to the fjord in Norway which we just saw

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.560 
to the fjord in Norway which we just saw
and<00:00:11.639> then<00:00:12.540> we've<00:00:12.660> had<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:13.320> days<00:00:13.590> at<00:00:13.860> sea<00:00:14.160> going

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
and then we've had two days at sea going

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.910 
and then we've had two days at sea going
north<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:16.520> Norway<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.680> north<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
north from Norway and north and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.810 
north from Norway and north and
north-east<00:00:21.080> to<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> place<00:00:22.500> called<00:00:22.859> spitsbergen

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
north-east to a place called spitsbergen

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.759 
north-east to a place called spitsbergen
now<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:26.660> we<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:28.320> above<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
now we are in we are going above the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.500 
now we are in we are going above the
80th<00:00:29.279> parallel<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:31.170> give<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
80th parallel and to give you a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.729 
80th parallel and to give you a
comparison<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.469> went<00:00:34.680> south<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
comparison if you went south to

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.160 
comparison if you went south to
Antarctica<00:00:38.390> Antarctica<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.809> think<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Antarctica Antarctica which you think of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170 
Antarctica Antarctica which you think of
as<00:00:40.320> being<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.739> south<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
as being very south right it's on the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.290 
as being very south right it's on the
60th<00:00:42.750> parallel<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.370> 20<00:00:44.910> degrees

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
60th parallel so we're going 20 degrees

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
60th parallel so we're going 20 degrees
more<00:00:46.289> north<00:00:46.770> we're<00:00:47.010> almost<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> North

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
more north we're almost at the North

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.380 
more north we're almost at the North
Pole<00:00:48.170> at<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> place<00:00:49.559> called<00:00:49.730> spitsbergen<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
Pole at a place called spitsbergen and I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
Pole at a place called spitsbergen and I
thought<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.660> would<00:00:51.750> take<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> outside<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
thought it would take you outside and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
thought it would take you outside and
let<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.820> time<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> looks<00:00:54.660> like

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
let you see what time what it looks like

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.520 
let you see what time what it looks like
outside<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.379> does<00:00:55.530> 1130pm<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:57.239> 1140<00:00:58.050> p.m.<00:00:58.379> as

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
outside it does 1130pm it's 1140 p.m. as

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
outside it does 1130pm it's 1140 p.m. as
a<00:00:58.559> matter<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> fact<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.090> outside<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
a matter of fact let's go outside and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.079 
a matter of fact let's go outside and
see<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> looks<00:01:01.079> like

00:02:44.110 --> 00:03:50.000 

that's<00:02:44.320> for<00:02:44.560> sure

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.220 

we<00:03:51.010> didn't<00:03:51.280> stay<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.820> Spitsbergen<00:03:52.780> very<00:03:52.960> long

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
we didn't stay in Spitsbergen very long

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.460 
we didn't stay in Spitsbergen very long
it's<00:03:53.650> available<00:03:54.070> coal<00:03:54.520> coal<00:03:55.300> mining<00:03:55.600> town<00:03:56.050> and

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's available coal coal mining town and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.310 
it's available coal coal mining town and
all<00:03:56.560> those<00:03:56.740> little<00:03:56.860> houses<00:03:57.790> or<00:03:58.600> where<00:03:59.230> the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
all those little houses or where the

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.940 
all those little houses or where the
coal<00:03:59.500> miners<00:03:59.860> live<00:04:00.360> year-round<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.740> guess

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
coal miners live year-round and I guess

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.710 
coal miners live year-round and I guess
just<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.250> few<00:04:03.460> months<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:03.940> year<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.300> opens

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
just a few months of the year it opens

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.110 
just a few months of the year it opens
up<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.990> where<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.440> cruise<00:04:05.980> ship<00:04:06.010> I'm<00:04:06.340> occasional

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
up to where a cruise ship I'm occasional

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.520 
up to where a cruise ship I'm occasional
cruise<00:04:07.330> ship<00:04:07.510> will<00:04:07.660> come<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.200> check<00:04:08.470> it

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
cruise ship will come in and check it

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.830 
cruise ship will come in and check it
out<00:04:08.770> but<00:04:09.460> what<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:09.610> really<00:04:09.910> love<00:04:10.120> with<00:04:10.300> this<00:04:10.420> was
