00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
said one has to offer without glasses 3d

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.060 
said one has to offer without glasses 3d
it's<00:02:09.850> really<00:02:10.180> amazing<00:02:10.360> because<00:02:11.080> we're<00:02:11.260> maybe

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
it's really amazing because we're maybe

it's<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.520> new<00:02:13.240> step<00:02:13.540> ahead<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.170> technology

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
it's a new step ahead in the technology

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's a new step ahead in the technology
I<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:15.310> 3d<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.730> definitely<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.360> future<00:02:16.690> but

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
I think 3d is definitely the future but

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.780 
I think 3d is definitely the future but
it's<00:02:17.290> not<00:02:17.620> there<00:02:17.860> yet<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.400> car<00:02:18.610> of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
it's not there yet it's a car of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.180 
it's not there yet it's a car of
evolution<00:02:19.270> right<00:02:19.390> now<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.620> think<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.160> needs

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
evolution right now and I think it needs

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.810 
evolution right now and I think it needs
for<00:02:21.640> more<00:02:21.910> refinement<00:02:23.190> besides<00:02:24.190> sticking<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
for more refinement besides sticking to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.670 
for more refinement besides sticking to
the<00:02:24.940> tract<00:02:25.210> images<00:02:25.630> in<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.840> 3d<00:02:26.110> board<00:02:26.410> there's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the tract images in the 3d board there's

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.890 
the tract images in the 3d board there's
also<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.950> serious<00:02:27.370> lack<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.760> content<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.420> we

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
also a serious lack of content that we

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.510 
also a serious lack of content that we
make<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.260> think<00:02:29.500> twice<00:02:29.680> before<00:02:29.980> going<00:02:30.340> ahead

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
make you think twice before going ahead

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.580 
make you think twice before going ahead
