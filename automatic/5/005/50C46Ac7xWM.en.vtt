00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
the blind before I just go over the game

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.709 
the blind before I just go over the game
as<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> whole<00:00:08.370> just<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:09.000> show<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.360> build-up

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
as a whole just to show you the build-up

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.270 
as a whole just to show you the build-up
to<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.740> not<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.950> spur-of-the-moment

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
to it it's not a spur-of-the-moment

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.759 
to it it's not a spur-of-the-moment
lucky<00:00:12.090> thing<00:00:12.330> there's<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.349> lot<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.559> thought

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
lucky thing there's a lot of thought

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.990 
lucky thing there's a lot of thought
going<00:00:13.980> into<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.370> throughout<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> whole<00:00:14.940> game

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
going into it throughout the whole game

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.660 
going into it throughout the whole game
to<00:00:15.509> actually<00:00:15.780> pull<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.049> off<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.250> concept

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
to actually pull it off the concept

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.460 
to actually pull it off the concept
itself<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.150> actually<00:00:18.270> pretty<00:00:18.630> simple<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.380> all

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
itself is actually pretty simple it all

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.220 
itself is actually pretty simple it all
comes<00:00:19.740> down<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.070> probably<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:21.050> want<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.170> be

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
comes down to probably I want to be

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.840 
comes down to probably I want to be
trying<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> death<00:00:22.740> when<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.400> most<00:00:23.670> likely

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
trying to death when it's most likely

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
trying to death when it's most likely
that<00:00:24.269> he's<00:00:24.420> gonna<00:00:24.600> blimey<00:00:25.019> know<00:00:25.980> there's<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that he's gonna blimey know there's a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.589 
that he's gonna blimey know there's a
couple<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.490> factors<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.029> come<00:00:27.180> into<00:00:27.240> play

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
couple of factors that come into play

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.910 
couple of factors that come into play
here

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
doing and what he's doing now I guess

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.810 
doing and what he's doing now I guess
the<00:00:34.680> enemy<00:00:34.920> skill<00:00:35.160> level<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> most

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the enemy skill level is the most

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
the enemy skill level is the most
important<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.480> since<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.870> affects<00:00:37.100> wherever

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
important here since it affects wherever

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.440 
important here since it affects wherever
he<00:00:38.250> knows<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.670> you're<00:00:38.790> doing<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.300> whether

he knows what you're doing and whether

he knows what you're doing and whether
he<00:00:39.690> knows<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:39.989> he's<00:00:40.170> doing<00:00:40.200> if<00:00:40.620> he's<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> bad

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
he knows what he's doing if he's a bad

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.690 
he knows what he's doing if he's a bad
player<00:00:42.059> II<00:00:42.090> could<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.870> fry<00:00:43.020> die<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.290> any<00:00:43.469> time

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
player II could just fry die at any time

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.160 
player II could just fry die at any time
completely<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.789> random<00:00:44.940> making<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> premium

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
completely at random making a premium

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.569 
completely at random making a premium
possible<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> death<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:48.120> he's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> good<00:00:48.570> player

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
possible to death if he's a good player

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.160 
possible to death if he's a good player
then<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.760> actually<00:00:50.910> easier<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.750> death<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
then it's actually easier to death the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.600 
then it's actually easier to death the
blind

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
blind

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.709 
blind
mainly<00:00:53.610> cuz<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.059> predict<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> lot

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
mainly cuz you can predict it a lot

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
mainly cuz you can predict it a lot
better<00:00:54.930> based<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.680> you're<00:00:55.890> doing<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
better based on what you're doing and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
better based on what you're doing and
what<00:00:56.489> they're<00:00:56.670> doing<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.930> watch

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
what they're doing then you can watch

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.310 
what they're doing then you can watch
their<00:00:58.829> distance<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.520> death<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.780> he<00:01:00.960> gets<00:01:01.140> in

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
their distance and death when he gets in

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.009 
their distance and death when he gets in
range<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:02.940> against<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> double<00:01:03.600> DPS

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
range so we're up against the double DPS

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.539 
range so we're up against the double DPS
team<00:01:04.379> Shadow<00:01:04.739> Priests<00:01:04.979> rogue<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:06.390> means

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
team Shadow Priests rogue that means

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.219 
team Shadow Priests rogue that means
double<00:01:08.549> DPS<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:08.909> double<00:01:09.360> DPS<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.110> pretty

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
double DPS and double DPS so it's pretty

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
double DPS and double DPS so it's pretty
much<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.500> rush<00:01:10.710> down<00:01:10.950> whoever<00:01:11.369> kills<00:01:11.640> somebody

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
much a rush down whoever kills somebody

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.899 
much a rush down whoever kills somebody
first<00:01:12.150> wins<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> keeping<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.100> mind<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
first wins so keeping that in mind the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.550 
first wins so keeping that in mind the
rogue<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.450> their<00:01:15.720> team<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.080> gonna<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.380> trying

to pay as much damage as possible that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.149 
to pay as much damage as possible that
means<00:01:18.479> he's<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:18.990> gonna<00:01:19.170> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> run<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.830> 30

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
means he's not gonna want to run like 30

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399

this block the rogue is gonna be looking
to<00:01:47.399> blimey<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.060> whenever<00:01:48.600> I'm<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.869> range<00:01:49.200> I'm

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
to blimey so whenever I'm in range I'm

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.819 
to blimey so whenever I'm in range I'm
under<00:01:50.189> threat<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> getting<00:01:50.640> blinded<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.930> to

under threat of getting blinded so to

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
under threat of getting blinded so to
increase<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.280> probability<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.939> death<00:01:54.119> thing

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

now<00:02:33.320> it's<00:02:33.590> really<00:02:33.770> important<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.280> know<00:02:34.430> that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
now it's really important to know that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.360 
now it's really important to know that
it's<00:02:35.330> quite<00:02:35.690> rare<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.230> actually<00:02:36.260> deafblind<00:02:37.040> it

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
it's quite rare to actually deafblind it

it's quite rare to actually deafblind it
probably<00:02:37.700> happens<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.320> ten<00:02:39.500> times

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
probably happens like one in ten times

probably happens like one in ten times
you<00:02:40.010> try<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.600> especially<00:02:41.600> since<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.350> change

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
you try it especially since the change

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.490 
you try it especially since the change
with<00:02:43.280> high<00:02:43.490> CC<00:02:43.970> breaks<00:02:44.240> from<00:02:44.450> deaf<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.350> need

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
to really be pinpoint on it and it's

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.730 
to really be pinpoint on it and it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.210 
really easy to be too late or too early
assuming<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.430> guess<00:02:49.640> right<00:02:49.880> at<00:02:50.060> all
