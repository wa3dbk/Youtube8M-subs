00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.690
 impossible to deny 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.160
 if new call of duty is expected 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.380
 every year by millions of players 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 it's above all for its multi mode the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 Solo campaign serving as call tutorials 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 hidden yes the staging is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 generally solid and wii black ops I 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.590
 should on this point include his lot of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.990
 highlights 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 remains that since the fourth installment a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.939
 some modern warfare the real battle 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 is played online 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.210
 and for this 2012 edition 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.710
 the treyarch studio sees things in 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.450
 big by getting closer to the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.510
 electronic sport through three 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.079
 great phases frankly the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.730
 body 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.899
 the first is the league this is a 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.480
 section totally dedicated to the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.829
 competition within the game that says this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 is not due to the level exclusively 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.660
 thought it for beginners like 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660
 breaks 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.780
 the second thing we did was 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 add the concept of diffusion in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.649
 it's me where I'm playing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.359
 and show it to the rest of the world 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.680
 we already imagine the players 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.880
 professionals show what they know 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 do on call of duty but let's see it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.330
 from another angle the pros will be able to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 teach the community their secrets 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.080
 This is how I play 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.369
 this game mode works this way 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.369
 that's how I use 7 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.570
 finally the last point is what we 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.070
 call caste code this is the possibility 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.680
 for a player to broadcast a match 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.300
 as if it were a sporting event 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.040
 let's say I'm watching a match with the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.100
 caste code tools I display the score 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.380
 live the game mode that leads the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.710
 part that is playing I can 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.180
 also change camera angles see 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.040
 this concept as a football match 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.420
 the director of the show can 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.680
 choose which players show which 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.759
 information posted these tools to all 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.860
 the players so that they can show 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.500
 the game in their own way and then their 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.910
 make you want to talk to each other 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.770
 to this we must add more weapons 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.750
 modern and customizable a new 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.220
 system of experience points as well as 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.320
 greater freedom in the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.979
 choice of his equipment that's it 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.690
 looks good 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.759
 remains to be seen what will give the cards 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.540
 of play once the community he let go 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.370
 in the arena because he controls ours 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.290
 call of duty black ops 2 will be available 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.610
 November 13 on pc ps3 and xbox 360 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.390
 you'll talk about it in the next 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.390
 editions of the jt 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.210
