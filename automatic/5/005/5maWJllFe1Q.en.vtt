00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
plan is to do a long round which I've

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.449 
plan is to do a long round which I've
done<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.500> past<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:08.959> injections<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.459> I

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
done in the past with injections and I

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.760 
done in the past with injections and I

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
think I did like 75 or almost 80 days of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.320 
think I did like 75 or almost 80 days of
objections<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:17.069> very<00:02:17.250> mind<00:02:17.760> taxing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
objections and it was very mind taxing

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.199 
objections and it was very mind taxing
completely<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:20.250> stay<00:02:20.459> focused<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.000> stuff

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
completely to stay focused and stuff

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.800 
completely to stay focused and stuff
like<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.720> don't<00:02:21.959> know<00:02:22.230> exactly<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.810> I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
like that so I don't know exactly if I

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
releasing train because I have a I have

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.180 
releasing train because I have a I have
fallen<00:04:11.909> off<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:15.590> stabilization<00:04:16.590> or<00:04:16.769> whatever

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
fallen off the stabilization or whatever

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.249 
fallen off the stabilization or whatever
you<00:04:17.340> want<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> call<00:04:17.699> it<00:04:17.759> I<00:04:18.090> my<00:04:18.810> body<00:04:19.019> did<00:04:19.229> not

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
you want to call it I my body did not

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.129 
you want to call it I my body did not
stabilize<00:04:20.040> a

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
stabilize a

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:28.119 
stabilize a
and<00:04:21.819> and<00:04:22.819> I<00:04:22.969> know<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.509> so<00:04:24.550> if<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:26.889> guess<00:04:27.889> my

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 
and and I know that so if I guess my

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:32.080 
and and I know that so if I guess my
question<00:04:28.189> is<00:04:28.939> now<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:30.129> because<00:04:31.129> I'm<00:04:31.759> not

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
question is now is because I'm not

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.179 
question is now is because I'm not
stable<00:04:33.370> at<00:04:34.370> my<00:04:35.240> weight<00:04:35.539> and<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.800> know<00:04:36.860> that

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
stable at my weight and I know that

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:41.920 
stable at my weight and I know that
because<00:04:37.340> I've<00:04:38.180> been<00:04:38.240> gaining<00:04:38.960> uh<00:04:40.719> will<00:04:41.719> I

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
because I've been gaining uh will I

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.290 
because I've been gaining uh will I
stabilize<00:04:42.560> once<00:04:43.039> i<00:04:43.159> go<00:04:43.310> into<00:04:43.629> p3<00:04:44.629> after<00:04:45.080> p2<00:04:46.300> if

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
stabilize once i go into p3 after p2 if

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.219 
stabilize once i go into p3 after p2 if
i<00:04:47.539> do<00:04:47.599> a<00:04:47.900> p3<00:04:48.710> properly<00:04:49.430> which<00:04:49.759> I've<00:04:50.419> never<00:04:50.479> done

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
i do a p3 properly which I've never done

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.760 
i do a p3 properly which I've never done
a<00:04:51.499> p3<00:04:52.069> proper<00:04:52.490> ever<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:54.409> know<00:04:54.529> you<00:04:54.710> know

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
a p3 proper ever and I know you know

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.830 
a p3 proper ever and I know you know
what<00:04:55.039> we<00:04:55.159> round<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:55.610> would<00:04:56.120> be<00:04:56.240> for<00:04:56.479> me<00:04:56.539> I

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
what we round this would be for me I

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.159 
what we round this would be for me I
guess<00:04:57.050> it's<00:04:57.289> round<00:04:58.090> or<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.479> don't<00:04:59.840> know<00:04:59.960> I've

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
guess it's round or I don't know I've

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.899 
guess it's round or I don't know I've

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
stable relation because as we all know

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.329 
stable relation because as we all know
stabilization<00:05:12.969> p3<00:05:13.969> is<00:05:14.529> extremely<00:05:15.529> important

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:16.339 
stabilization p3 is extremely important

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.600 
stabilization p3 is extremely important
because<00:05:17.349> you<00:05:18.349> have<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.800> stabilize<00:05:19.009> at<00:05:19.460> that

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
because you have to stabilize at that

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.269 
because you have to stabilize at that
weight<00:05:19.819> and<00:05:20.120> help<00:05:20.870> your<00:05:21.020> body<00:05:21.169> set<00:05:21.650> at<00:05:21.949> that

weight and help your body set at that

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.320 
weight and help your body set at that
point<00:05:23.560> otherwise<00:05:24.560> if<00:05:25.009> you<00:05:25.039> don't<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:26.120> gain

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
point otherwise if you don't you gain

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.369 
point otherwise if you don't you gain
weight<00:05:26.379> very<00:05:27.379> very<00:05:27.650> fast<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:31.479> that's<00:05:32.479> that's

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
weight very very fast and that's that's

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.200 
weight very very fast and that's that's
where<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.710> am<00:05:33.979> and<00:05:34.250> it's<00:05:34.580> because<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.029> never
