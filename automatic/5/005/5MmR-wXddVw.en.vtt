00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
electrical plug and it will actually

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.760 
electrical plug and it will actually
flash<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.690> injector<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> pulsing<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
flash as your injector is pulsing and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.720 
flash as your injector is pulsing and
that'll<00:01:01.980> tell<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.370> you've<00:01:02.489> been<00:01:02.520> an

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that'll tell you if you've been an

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.990 
that'll tell you if you've been an
accurate<00:01:03.470> signal<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.979> computer<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
accurate signal from your computer so

what<00:01:06.119> we're<00:01:06.210> gonna<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.659> show<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.170> guys<00:01:07.290> how

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
what we're gonna do is show you guys how

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740 
what we're gonna do is show you guys how
to<00:01:07.619> hook<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> noid<00:01:08.400> light<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.970> begin

to hook up the noid light and begin

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.929 
to hook up the noid light and begin
testing<00:01:10.220> all<00:01:11.220> right<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.580> thing<00:01:11.729> you're

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
testing all right the first thing you're

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
testing all right the first thing you're
gonna<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.479> before<00:01:12.689> messing<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.710> any

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
gonna want to do before messing with any

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.380 
gonna want to do before messing with any
electrical<00:01:14.640> connections<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
electrical connections you want to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
electrical connections you want to
disconnect<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> negative<00:01:16.170> terminal<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.830> your

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
disconnect the negative terminal of your

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.490 
disconnect the negative terminal of your
battery<00:01:17.330> once<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> we're<00:01:19.350> gonna

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
battery once you do that we're gonna

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
battery once you do that we're gonna
identify<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.100> injector<00:01:20.729> plugs<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.869> it's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
identify the injector plugs and it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.280 
identify the injector plugs and it's
really<00:01:22.320> simple<00:01:22.790> most<00:01:23.930> engines<00:01:24.930> will<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
really simple most engines will have a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.499 
really simple most engines will have a
fuel<00:01:25.740> rail<00:01:25.950> similar<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.150> here

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
fuel rail similar to this right here

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.450 
fuel rail similar to this right here
it's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.810> rail<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.049> runs<00:01:28.500> along<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> engine

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it's a rail that runs along the engine

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
it's a rail that runs along the engine
and<00:01:29.640> across<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> other<00:01:30.810> side<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.200> v6<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and across to the other side on v6 and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.399 
and across to the other side on v6 and
v8<00:01:32.180> for<00:01:33.180> cylinders<00:01:33.570> will<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.170> rail

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
v8 for cylinders will just be one rail

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
v8 for cylinders will just be one rail
obviously<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.189> four<00:01:35.369> cylinders<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
obviously with just four cylinders and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.990 
obviously with just four cylinders and
on<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.229> rail<00:01:37.470> you'll<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.979> four<00:01:38.340> individual

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
on that rail you'll have four individual

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.210 
on that rail you'll have four individual
connectors<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.380> injectors<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
connectors for your injectors and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.300 
connectors for your injectors and
usually<00:01:42.030> they'll<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.299> pink<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.720> white<00:01:43.310> but

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
usually they'll be pink and white but

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.649 
usually they'll be pink and white but
they<00:01:44.520> don't<00:01:44.820> go<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.570> be

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
they don't go off of that it could be

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
they don't go off of that it could be
any<00:01:45.780> color<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.409> want<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.860> is

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
any color what you want to do is

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
any color what you want to do is
disconnect<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> connectors<00:01:48.509> let's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
disconnect one of the connectors let's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.749 
disconnect one of the connectors let's
see<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.130> ahead<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.700> one

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
see if we can go ahead and get this one

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.450 
see if we can go ahead and get this one
disconnected<00:01:51.479> we're<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.720> gonna<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
disconnected we're just gonna do the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.770 
disconnected we're just gonna do the
number<00:01:53.759> two<00:01:53.909> cylinder<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:56.329> there<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.450> go

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
number two cylinder here there we go

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.950 
number two cylinder here there we go
pop<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.590> connector<00:01:58.950> off<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.840> you're<00:02:00.840> gonna

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
pop that connector off and you're gonna

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.109 
pop that connector off and you're gonna
hook<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> connector<00:02:02.340> side<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
hook up to the connector side of the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.109 
hook up to the connector side of the
injector<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.079> actual<00:02:04.469> injector<00:02:05.130> because

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
injector not the actual injector because

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
injector not the actual injector because
once<00:02:06.329> again<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> noid<00:02:06.719> light<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.140> testing<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
once again the noid light is testing the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.249 
once again the noid light is testing the
pulse<00:02:07.920> signal<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.640> testing<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.929> actual

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
pulse signal it's not testing the actual

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.690 
pulse signal it's not testing the actual
injector<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.770> making<00:02:11.039> sure<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.280> computer

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
injector it's making sure the computer

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.309 
injector it's making sure the computer
is<00:02:11.819> sending<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.239> signal<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
is sending a signal to it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.539 
is sending a signal to it
so<00:02:13.709> we'll<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:13.920> ahead<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.069> get<00:02:14.219> our<00:02:14.310> annoyed

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
so we'll go ahead and get our annoyed

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.589 
so we'll go ahead and get our annoyed
lights<00:02:14.730> set<00:02:14.909> out<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.239> we're<00:02:15.329> gonna<00:02:15.420> identify

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
lights set out and we're gonna identify

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.890 
lights set out and we're gonna identify
which<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.500> we're<00:02:16.709> going<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.890> use<00:02:17.900> alright

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
which one we're going to use alright

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.300 
which one we're going to use alright
next<00:02:19.079> we're<00:02:19.230> going<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.379> go<00:02:19.530> ahead<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.890> connect

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
next we're going to go ahead and connect

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.319 
next we're going to go ahead and connect
our<00:02:20.579> noid<00:02:21.209> light<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.370> injector<00:02:23.760> plug<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
our noid light to the injector plug and

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.000 
our noid light to the injector plug and
I've<00:02:24.599> picked<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.079> correct<00:02:25.439> one<00:02:25.680> you'll<00:02:25.890> have

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
I've picked the correct one you'll have

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.449 
I've picked the correct one you'll have
to<00:02:26.159> look<00:02:26.400> at<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.120> application<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
to look at your application and the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.099 
to look at your application and the
spacing<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.209> pins<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.599> find<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:30.989> which

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
spacing of the pins to find out which

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.080 
spacing of the pins to find out which
one<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.379> need<00:02:31.409> to<00:02:31.620> use<00:02:31.939> basically<00:02:32.939> you're

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
one you need to use basically you're

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.630 
one you need to use basically you're
just<00:02:33.239> gonna<00:02:33.359> wedge<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.230> down<00:02:34.409> in<00:02:34.650> there<00:02:34.920> like

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
just gonna wedge it down in there like

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190 
just gonna wedge it down in there like
that<00:02:35.670> be<00:02:36.120> careful<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.629> break<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.959> prongs

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
that be careful not to break the prongs

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.530 
that be careful not to break the prongs
it<00:02:38.069> won't<00:02:38.250> necessarily<00:02:38.370> go<00:02:38.879> all<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.239> way<00:02:39.359> in

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it won't necessarily go all the way in

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.349 
it won't necessarily go all the way in
you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.019> see<00:02:40.439> it's<00:02:40.769> not<00:02:40.950> perfect<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.269> in

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
you can see it's not perfect but it's in

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.330 
you can see it's not perfect but it's in
there<00:02:42.480> enough<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.500> we'll<00:02:43.650> set<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:43.950> off<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
there enough so we'll set that off to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.949 
there enough so we'll set that off to
the<00:02:44.489> side<00:02:44.579> now<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.030> what<00:02:45.359> you<00:02:45.450> want<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.659> do<00:02:45.750> is

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
the side now and what you want to do is

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.720 
the side now and what you want to do is
connect<00:02:46.409> your<00:02:46.859> negative<00:02:47.310> terminal<00:02:47.579> of<00:02:47.609> your

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
connect your negative terminal of your

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.399 
connect your negative terminal of your
battery<00:02:48.060> back<00:02:48.209> up<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:49.049> we're<00:02:49.139> gonna<00:02:49.230> go<00:02:49.319> ahead

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
battery back up and we're gonna go ahead

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.440 
battery back up and we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:49.500> fire<00:02:49.739> up<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.010> engine<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.609> you're<00:02:51.269> gonna

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
and fire up the engine and you're gonna

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.929 
and fire up the engine and you're gonna
notice<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:52.109> rough<00:02:52.409> idle<00:02:52.680> which<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:53.609> you've<00:02:53.790> got

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
notice a rough idle which if you've got

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.330 
notice a rough idle which if you've got
an<00:02:54.060> injector<00:02:54.540> tester<00:02:55.019> you're<00:02:56.010> probably

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
an injector tester you're probably

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.039 
an injector tester you're probably
already<00:02:56.790> experiencing<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.419> rough<00:02:57.599> idle<00:02:57.780> that's

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
already experiencing a rough idle that's

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.110 
already experiencing a rough idle that's
why<00:02:58.200> we're<00:02:58.349> looking<00:02:58.470> into<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.040> if<00:02:59.639> you

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
why we're looking into it but if you

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.849 
why we're looking into it but if you
unplug<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.780> different<00:03:01.200> one<00:03:01.349> other<00:03:01.620> than<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
unplug a different one other than the

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.470 
unplug a different one other than the
one<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.129> question<00:03:02.609> you<00:03:02.730> might<00:03:02.849> get<00:03:03.030> an<00:03:03.120> even

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
one in question you might get an even

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.119 
one in question you might get an even
rougher<00:03:03.720> idle<00:03:04.169> because<00:03:04.379> now<00:03:04.530> theoretically

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
rougher idle because now theoretically

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.470 
rougher idle because now theoretically
you<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.310> two<00:03:05.609> injectors<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.299> aren't

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you have two injectors that aren't

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.949 
you have two injectors that aren't
working<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:07.549> we'll<00:03:08.549> go<00:03:08.669> ahead<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.959> connect

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
working so we'll go ahead and connect

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.860 
working so we'll go ahead and connect
the<00:03:10.079> battery<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:11.329> start<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.450> truck<00:03:12.629> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
the battery and start the truck and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:27.710 
the battery and start the truck and
we'll<00:03:13.530> test<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.919> verify<00:03:14.220> that's<00:03:14.430> working

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.640 

as<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.650> see

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
as you can see

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.450 
as you can see
fulfill<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.390> whole<00:03:32.629> thing

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.430 

is<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.360> injector<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.020> working

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
is that that injector is working

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.699 
is that that injector is working
perfectly

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
perfectly

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.229 
perfectly
go<00:03:42.579> ahead<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.790> shut<00:03:42.939> it<00:03:42.970> off<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.760> now<00:03:45.909> we<00:03:45.970> know

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
go ahead and shut it off so now we know

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.869 
go ahead and shut it off so now we know
that<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.480> injector<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.319> good<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.890> we<00:03:48.549> can<00:03:48.730> go

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
that that injector is good and we can go

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.449 
that that injector is good and we can go
ahead<00:03:48.909> and<00:03:49.150> move<00:03:49.480> our<00:03:49.810> noise<00:03:50.019> tester<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.920> each

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
ahead and move our noise tester to each

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.309 
ahead and move our noise tester to each
individual<00:03:52.209> injector<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.870> test<00:03:53.140> them

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
individual injector and test them

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.559 
individual injector and test them
separately<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:53.920> if<00:03:54.489> there<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.819> problem<00:03:55.209> in

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
separately and if there is a problem in

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.539 
separately and if there is a problem in
the<00:03:55.989> current<00:03:56.409> or<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> signal<00:03:57.099> coming<00:03:57.340> from

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
the current or the signal coming from

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.640 
the current or the signal coming from
the<00:03:57.670> computer<00:03:57.939> to<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.239> injector<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:59.470> will

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
the computer to the injector that will

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.110 
the computer to the injector that will
tell<00:03:59.859> us<00:03:59.950> which<00:04:00.099> injector<00:04:00.549> it's<00:04:00.670> on

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
tell us which injector it's on

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.449 
tell us which injector it's on
so<00:04:02.109> to<00:04:02.439> disconnect<00:04:03.069> all<00:04:03.340> you'll<00:04:03.549> do<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.959> pull

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
so to disconnect all you'll do is pull

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.789 
so to disconnect all you'll do is pull
the<00:04:06.459> pin<00:04:06.670> out<00:04:06.700> here<00:04:07.090> just<00:04:07.900> like<00:04:07.989> that<00:04:08.230> separate

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
the pin out here just like that separate

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.740 
the pin out here just like that separate
it<00:04:08.920> set<00:04:09.819> it<00:04:09.939> out<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.150> way<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.480> we'll<00:04:10.599> take

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it set it out of the way and we'll take

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.520 
it set it out of the way and we'll take
we'll<00:04:11.620> take<00:04:11.890> our<00:04:12.189> almost<00:04:12.879> drop<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.379> take<00:04:14.379> our

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
we'll take our almost drop that take our

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.670 
we'll take our almost drop that take our
injector<00:04:14.859> plug<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.909> we<00:04:16.209> will<00:04:16.500> look<00:04:17.500> at<00:04:17.620> it

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
injector plug and we will look at it

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.789 
injector plug and we will look at it
right<00:04:17.919> back<00:04:18.160> into<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.519> fuel<00:04:18.699> injector<00:04:19.799> there

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
right back into the fuel injector there

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.379 
right back into the fuel injector there
we<00:04:20.889> go<00:04:21.039> and<00:04:21.579> we're<00:04:21.820> good<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:21.970> go<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.300> the

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
we go and we're good to go on to the

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.540 
we go and we're good to go on to the
next<00:04:22.539> one<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:23.020> there<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.830> go<00:04:23.949> guys<00:04:24.130> that's<00:04:24.190> how

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
next one so there you go guys that's how

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.210 
next one so there you go guys that's how
you'd<00:04:24.699> use<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:25.060> noid<00:04:25.240> light<00:04:25.539> to<00:04:26.190> verify<00:04:27.190> that

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
you'd use the noid light to verify that

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.390 
you'd use the noid light to verify that
your<00:04:27.550> ECM<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.180> giving<00:04:28.600> signal<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:30.039> your<00:04:30.130> fuel

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
your ECM is giving signal to your fuel

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.490 
your ECM is giving signal to your fuel
