living quarters of the RV at that point
in<00:04:43.889> time<00:04:43.919> we<00:04:44.699> have<00:04:44.820> also<00:04:45.090> checked<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.020> water

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
in time we have also checked the water

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.080 
in time we have also checked the water
line<00:04:46.470> connections<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.669> gas<00:04:47.820> line

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
leakage at this point time we need to

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.020 
leakage at this point time we need to
install<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.800> water<00:04:55.979> heater<00:04:56.220> into<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.820> side

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
install the water heater into the side

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.580 
install the water heater into the side
wall<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.509> wat<00:04:57.659> of<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.229> RV<00:04:59.449> basically<00:05:00.590> give

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
wall of the wat of the RV basically give

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.620 
wall of the wat of the RV basically give
it<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.770> good<00:05:01.979> push<00:05:02.750> in<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:06.090> butyl<00:05:06.419> take

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
it a good push in so that the butyl take

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.909 
it a good push in so that the butyl take
takes<00:05:07.729> onto<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.849> side<00:05:09.060> wall<00:05:09.650> we<00:05:10.650> then<00:05:10.919> want<00:05:11.190> to

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
takes onto the side wall we then want to

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.700 
takes onto the side wall we then want to
secure<00:05:15.139> screws<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:17.550> side<00:05:17.759> wall<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.710> what

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
secure screws the side wall and what

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.180 
secure screws the side wall and what
we're<00:05:19.860> looking<00:05:20.099> for<00:05:20.310> is<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:22.590> butyl<00:05:23.009> to

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
we're looking for is the butyl to

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.660 
we're looking for is the butyl to
actually<00:05:23.699> move<00:05:23.969> up<00:05:26.150> from

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
actually move up from

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:38.990 
actually move up from
the<00:05:29.670> flange<00:05:37.190> now<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.370> we've<00:05:38.490> secured<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
the flange now that we've secured the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.110 
the flange now that we've secured the
water<00:05:39.210> heater<00:05:39.450> flange<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.590> sidewall<00:05:41.120> we

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
water heater flange to the sidewall we

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.180 
water heater flange to the sidewall we
have<00:05:42.300> completed<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:44.400> installation<00:05:45.300> by

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
have completed the installation by

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.760 
have completed the installation by
removing<00:05:47.190> any<00:05:47.340> excess<00:05:47.550> putty<00:05:48.540> or<00:05:48.840> silicone

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
removing any excess putty or silicone

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.790 
removing any excess putty or silicone
around<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:50.250> flange<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:51.480> that<00:05:52.170> completes<00:05:52.560> the
