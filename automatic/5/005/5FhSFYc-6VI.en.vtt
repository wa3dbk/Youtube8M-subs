masterpiece<00:02:01.600> I'm<00:02:01.870> working<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.200> anyway<00:02:02.860> let<00:02:03.070> me

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
masterpiece I'm working on anyway let me

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.570 
masterpiece I'm working on anyway let me
show<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.430> how<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.330> make<00:02:04.750> this<00:02:05.280> over<00:02:06.280> here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
show you how you make this over here

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.180 
show you how you make this over here
this<00:02:07.150> is<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.630> design<00:02:08.050> that<00:02:08.470> we<00:02:08.679> will<00:02:08.979> be

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
this is the design that we will be

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.790 
this is the design that we will be
creating<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:10.269> start<00:02:10.720> off<00:02:10.929> we<00:02:11.170> need<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.349> piston

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
creating to start off we need a piston

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.750 
creating to start off we need a piston
above<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:13.030> need<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.239> rail<00:02:13.599> on<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.340> block<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.550> some

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
above we need a rail on a block of some

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.280 
above we need a rail on a block of some
flavor<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.269> we're<00:02:16.629> going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.900> break<00:02:17.110> this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
flavor and we're going to break this

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.440 
flavor and we're going to break this
block<00:02:17.620> later<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:18.819> does<00:02:19.030> not<00:02:19.060> need<00:02:19.390> to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
block later on so this does not need to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.880 
block later on so this does not need to
be<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> delicate<00:02:20.080> block<00:02:20.319> like<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> bookshelf

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
be a delicate block like a bookshelf

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.729 
be a delicate block like a bookshelf
which<00:02:21.610> when<00:02:21.879> broken<00:02:22.180> only<00:02:23.049> gives<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.379> books

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
which when broken only gives you books

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.130 
which when broken only gives you books
and<00:02:24.069> planks<00:02:24.489> back<00:02:24.700> or<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.510> books<00:02:25.930> back

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
and planks back or just books back

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.020 
and planks back or just books back
actually<00:02:26.650> now<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.799> false<00:02:29.799> way<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.550> do

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
actually now this is a false way to do

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.990 
actually now this is a false way to do
it<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.510> actually<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.410> east<00:02:32.830> west<00:02:33.610> and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
it this is actually going east west and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.030 
it this is actually going east west and
to<00:02:34.450> pull<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.930> off<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.680> need

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
to pull this off you need

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.429 
to pull this off you need
actually<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.519> facing<00:02:36.790> north<00:02:37.299> south<00:02:37.599> another

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
actually be facing north south another

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.970 
actually be facing north south another
thing<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.860> note<00:02:39.010> as<00:02:39.219> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.579> see<00:02:39.790> sometimes

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
thing to note as you can see sometimes

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.580 
thing to note as you can see sometimes
the<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.359> minecart<00:02:43.359> that<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:44.019> holding<00:02:44.379> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the the minecart that is holding the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.149 
the the minecart that is holding the
chest<00:02:44.920> will<00:02:45.340> glitch<00:02:45.819> through<00:02:46.530> these<00:02:47.530> these

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
chest will glitch through these these

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.160 
chest will glitch through these these
library<00:02:48.849> books<00:02:48.969> I've<00:02:49.359> noticed<00:02:49.689> that<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.840> little

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
library books I've noticed that a little

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.380 
library books I've noticed that a little
bit<00:02:50.349> sometimes<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.640> goes<00:02:51.730> away<00:02:51.909> with<00:02:52.239> just

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
bit sometimes it goes away with just

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.000 
bit sometimes it goes away with just
relogin<00:02:52.870> actually<00:02:53.379> every<00:02:53.560> single<00:02:53.590> time<00:02:53.920> it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
relogin actually every single time it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.830 
relogin actually every single time it
goes<00:02:54.099> away<00:02:54.280> with<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.579> relogin<00:02:54.939> sometimes<00:02:55.689> it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
goes away with just relogin sometimes it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.289 
goes away with just relogin sometimes it
just<00:02:55.959> goes<00:02:56.140> away<00:02:56.290> over<00:02:57.189> time<00:02:57.519> let's<00:02:58.150> go<00:02:58.269> ahead

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
just goes away over time let's go ahead

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.300 
just goes away over time let's go ahead
and<00:02:58.750> build<00:02:58.959> this<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.439> build<00:02:59.680> this<00:02:59.920> we<00:03:00.129> need

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
and build this so to build this we need

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.140 
and build this so to build this we need
of<00:03:00.489> course<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.970> bookshelf<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:03.250> also<00:03:03.430> need<00:03:03.909> a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
of course a bookshelf we also need a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.410 
of course a bookshelf we also need a
piston<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.939> don't<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.269> use<00:03:07.389> a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
piston and you don't have to use a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.539 
piston and you don't have to use a
sticky<00:03:07.750> piston<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.349> normal<00:03:08.680> piston<00:03:08.859> for

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
sticky piston just a normal piston for

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.759 
sticky piston just a normal piston for
this<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:10.269> also<00:03:10.450> need<00:03:10.569> something<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.109> start

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
this we also need something to start

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.020 
this we also need something to start
that<00:03:11.920> piston<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.430> let's<00:03:12.579> get<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.790> button<00:03:15.030> we

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
that piston so let's get a button we

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.360 
that piston so let's get a button we
also<00:03:16.419> let's<00:03:17.049> just<00:03:17.230> use<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.379> normal<00:03:17.650> old<00:03:17.980> plank

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
also let's just use a normal old plank

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.440 
also let's just use a normal old plank
and<00:03:18.810> we<00:03:19.810> need<00:03:20.200> some<00:03:20.560> rail<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:22.169> we<00:03:23.169> also<00:03:23.439> need<00:03:24.010> a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
and we need some rail and we also need a

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.960 
and we need some rail and we also need a
minecart<00:03:25.450> with<00:03:25.689> a<00:03:25.720> chest<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.709> which<00:03:27.459> looks

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
minecart with a chest in it which looks

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.110 
minecart with a chest in it which looks
like<00:03:28.060> this<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.799> first<00:03:30.159> let's<00:03:30.669> go<00:03:30.730> ahead<00:03:30.819> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
like this so first let's go ahead and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.020 
like this so first let's go ahead and
put<00:03:31.329> down<00:03:31.359> our<00:03:31.930> bookshelves<00:03:32.919> where<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.849> want

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
put down our bookshelves where we want

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.539 
put down our bookshelves where we want
to<00:03:34.180> flanked<00:03:34.569> on<00:03:34.750> either<00:03:34.989> side<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:36.280> chest

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
to flanked on either side of the chest

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.009 
to flanked on either side of the chest
I'm<00:03:36.849> gonna<00:03:37.000> go<00:03:37.090> ahead<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.239> break<00:03:37.599> this<00:03:37.840> from

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
I'm gonna go ahead and break this from

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.159 
I'm gonna go ahead and break this from
earlier<00:03:38.169> then<00:03:39.159> we'll<00:03:39.459> put<00:03:39.700> down<00:03:39.730> our<00:03:40.239> plank

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
earlier then we'll put down our plank

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.360 
earlier then we'll put down our plank
which<00:03:41.379> we're<00:03:41.530> just<00:03:41.680> going<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.859> break<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.069> little

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
which we're just going to break a little

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.930 
which we're just going to break a little
bit<00:03:42.489> later

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
bit later

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.990 
bit later
put<00:03:43.720> down<00:03:43.870> your<00:03:44.229> rail<00:03:44.530> on<00:03:44.859> top<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.609> and

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
put down your rail on top of this and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.619 
put down your rail on top of this and
then<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:47.169> will<00:03:47.199> need<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.829> put<00:03:48.010> down<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.310> piston

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
then we will need to put down the piston

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.960 
then we will need to put down the piston
facing<00:03:49.629> downwards<00:03:50.349> above<00:03:50.949> this<00:03:51.159> rail<00:03:51.430> now<00:03:51.639> I

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
facing downwards above this rail now I

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.479 
facing downwards above this rail now I
have<00:03:52.599> a<00:03:52.629> piece<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.109> glowstone<00:03:53.560> right<00:03:54.040> above<00:03:54.340> it

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
have a piece of glowstone right above it

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.430 
have a piece of glowstone right above it
but<00:03:54.699> if<00:03:54.879> you<00:03:55.209> don't<00:03:55.449> you<00:03:55.750> can<00:03:55.900> all<00:03:56.019> actually

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
but if you don't you can all actually

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.399 
but if you don't you can all actually
look<00:03:56.650> down<00:03:56.889> at<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.310> rail<00:03:57.489> place<00:03:58.389> the<00:03:58.810> piston

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
look down at the rail place the piston

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.710 
look down at the rail place the piston
and<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.919> appears<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.030> in<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.419> correct

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
and it appears in the in the correct

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.110 
and it appears in the in the correct
direction<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.409> it's<00:04:03.040> kind<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.400> nice<00:04:03.549> pro<00:04:03.849> tip

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
direction so it's kind of a nice pro tip

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.629 
direction so it's kind of a nice pro tip
finally<00:04:04.900> take<00:04:05.379> your<00:04:05.680> minecart<00:04:06.190> with<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.340> chest

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
finally take your minecart with a chest

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.699 
finally take your minecart with a chest
in<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.879> and<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.629> would<00:04:07.750> name<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.199> before<00:04:08.590> you

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
in it and you would name it before you

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.309 
in it and you would name it before you
do<00:04:08.919> this<00:04:09.099> but<00:04:09.840> we're<00:04:10.840> not<00:04:10.959> going<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.139> name<00:04:11.290> it

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
do this but we're not going to name it

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.629 
do this but we're not going to name it
anything<00:04:11.650> fancy<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:12.190> let's<00:04:12.340> just<00:04:12.459> go<00:04:12.549> ahead

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
anything fancy so let's just go ahead

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.939 
anything fancy so let's just go ahead
and<00:04:12.819> put<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.060> down<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.569> then<00:04:14.079> break<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.680> block

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
and put it down and then break the block

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.460 
and put it down and then break the block
underneath<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:15.879> and<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.479> minecart<00:04:16.930> will<00:04:17.139> fall

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
underneath it and the minecart will fall

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.399 
underneath it and the minecart will fall
in<00:04:17.769> now<00:04:18.099> sometimes<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:19.120> get<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.510> where<00:04:20.109> the

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
in now sometimes you get this where the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.379 
in now sometimes you get this where the
texture<00:04:21.150> appears<00:04:22.150> above<00:04:22.659> the<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:24.250> book<00:04:25.000> so<00:04:25.270> on

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
texture appears above the the book so on

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.629 
texture appears above the the book so on
the<00:04:25.510> other<00:04:25.630> side<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.770> can<00:04:26.800> see<00:04:26.979> that<00:04:27.220> that

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
the other side you can see that that

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.219 
the other side you can see that that
texture<00:04:28.120> isn't<00:04:28.330> there<00:04:28.690> we're<00:04:28.900> actually<00:04:29.020> going

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
texture isn't there we're actually going

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.790 
texture isn't there we're actually going
to<00:04:29.320> continue<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:29.919> from<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:31.090> side<00:04:31.800> next

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
to continue on from this side next

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.020 
to continue on from this side next
you're<00:04:32.949> going<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.130> take<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.400> bookshelf<00:04:33.849> which

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
you're going to take the bookshelf which

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.089 
you're going to take the bookshelf which
we'll<00:04:34.180> be<00:04:34.210> covering<00:04:34.509> this<00:04:34.870> up<00:04:34.930> place<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:35.830> on

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
we'll be covering this up place it on

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.249 
we'll be covering this up place it on
the<00:04:36.280> piston<00:04:36.490> just<00:04:37.330> like<00:04:37.449> this<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:38.110> it's

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
the piston just like this and so it's

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.200 
the piston just like this and so it's
kind<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.560> above<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.979> go<00:04:39.580> ahead<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.820> put<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
kind of above it go ahead and put a

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.939 
kind of above it go ahead and put a
plank<00:04:40.570> on<00:04:40.840> your<00:04:40.870> piston<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.560> then<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.680> button

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
plank on your piston and then a button

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.209 
plank on your piston and then a button
so<00:04:42.520> that<00:04:42.669> you<00:04:42.789> can<00:04:42.970> push<00:04:43.150> this<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.990> pushes<00:04:44.650> the

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
so that you can push this it pushes the

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.050 
so that you can push this it pushes the
library<00:04:46.210> or<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:47.050> bookshelf<00:04:47.919> block<00:04:48.250> on<00:04:48.490> to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
library or the the bookshelf block on to

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.650 
library or the the bookshelf block on to
the<00:04:49.150> minecart

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
the minecart

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.110 
the minecart
and<00:04:49.810> now<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.740> see<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:51.010> hitbox<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.760> the

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
and now you can see that hitbox of the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.470 
and now you can see that hitbox of the
of<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.870> shelf<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.530> then<00:04:54.070> when<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.730> hover<00:04:55.060> over

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
of the shelf and then when I hover over

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.510 
of the shelf and then when I hover over
to<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.690> hitbox<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.260> minecart<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:57.160> hitbox

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
to the hitbox of the minecart the hitbox

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.310 
to the hitbox of the minecart the hitbox
of<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.820> shelf<00:04:58.090> disappears<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:58.960> can

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
of the shelf disappears I can

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.950 
of the shelf disappears I can
right-click<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.890> open<00:05:00.310> up<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.210> place<00:05:01.570> items

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
right-click and open up and place items

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.830 
right-click and open up and place items
inside<00:05:02.860> of<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.190> bookshelf<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:04.480> reason<00:05:04.750> you

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
inside of a bookshelf the reason you

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.540 
inside of a bookshelf the reason you
can't<00:05:05.050> pull<00:05:05.260> this<00:05:05.380> off<00:05:05.620> if<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.100> bookshelves

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
can't pull this off if the bookshelves

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.380 
can't pull this off if the bookshelves
are<00:05:06.910> facing<00:05:07.620> west<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.890> east<00:05:09.220> is<00:05:09.520> because<00:05:09.940> when

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
are facing west and east is because when

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.740 
are facing west and east is because when
the<00:05:10.510> minecart<00:05:11.020> Falls<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.950> will<00:05:12.310> always

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
the minecart Falls it will always

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.590 
the minecart Falls it will always
redirect<00:05:13.750> itself<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.710> fall<00:05:14.980> with<00:05:15.280> a

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
redirect itself to fall with a

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.060 
redirect itself to fall with a
north-south<00:05:16.600> direction<00:05:17.380> so<00:05:17.590> you're<00:05:17.830> always

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
north-south direction so you're always

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.120 
north-south direction so you're always
going<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.400> get<00:05:18.610> like<00:05:18.760> a<00:05:18.790> weird<00:05:19.210> minecart

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
going to get like a weird minecart

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.370 
going to get like a weird minecart
coming<00:05:21.130> out<00:05:21.250> of<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.970> bookshelf<00:05:22.450> a<00:05:22.720> texture

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
coming out of the bookshelf a texture

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.690 
coming out of the bookshelf a texture
which<00:05:23.410> you<00:05:23.950> don't<00:05:24.280> want

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
which you don't want

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.640 
which you don't want
