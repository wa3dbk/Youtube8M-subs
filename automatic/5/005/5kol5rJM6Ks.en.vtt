00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 today we are in a mountain stream 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.400
 different between larch woods that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.880
 blueberry seedlings you do not have delicious 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.430
 in Valsesia there are numerous streams 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.140
 lateral that have flowed of the sesia that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.140
 they are wonderful, one more beautiful than the other and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.750
 they are all beautiful to fly 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 also because as you see how you will see 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.230
 images are not frascati not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 there are many plants in this stream 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.110
 we can show you how effective it is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.940
 keskar in Valsesian fly naturally 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.780
 adapting the equipment a rod more 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.640
 short rowan three meters and 70 and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.460
 flies maybe a little closer together 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 between them always pay attention to not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 let you see by holding the flies comes to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 float making sure to see 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.250
 what will be the first fly maybe 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 put a fly like that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.920
 this yellow fly with a feather of 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.390
 partridge that remains there before the first one 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.070
 fly towards you what you owe 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.729
 keep afloat when you raise the tip 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.729
 of the room 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.610
 ok now let's see 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.329
 how we must fish autonomously and towels from 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.270
 below to rise so as not to be seen 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.710
 looking for 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.710
 the party can see as little as possible 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.600
 not very combative 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.600
 he sees it as marble 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.340
 speak the colors of these 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.340
 of these three amazing demos 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.100
 of course we are seeing effectiveness of 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.290
 a peach of the kind also in the streams 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.290
 mountain really makes us have fun 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.230
 this is a fish of a certain size 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.510
 let's see how the sum works 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.510
 bring you various 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.700
 means 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.659
 to come and fish the thing in the mountains 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.430
 beautiful of the Val Seriana is that everything 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.200
 what you need you see here in front of 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.170
 we 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.829
 the wallet with the line and ours 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.410
 mosques and a cane 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.440
 so you travel very light though 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:28.449
 both inside your wallet and all that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.810
 which serves as we review the feathers if 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.610
 it was necessary river silk and ci 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.430
 we build a fly directly on the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.639
 maximum freedom and maximum river 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.639
