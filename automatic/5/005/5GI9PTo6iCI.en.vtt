now<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.000> can<00:01:17.150> see<00:01:17.330> I'm<00:01:17.420> finger-picking<00:01:18.020> and

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
now you can see I'm finger-picking and

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.080 
now you can see I'm finger-picking and
after<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.340> initial<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:21.430> play<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.700> g<00:01:22.880> string

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
after the initial I play on the g string

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.789 
after the initial I play on the g string
and<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.270> B<00:01:23.420> string

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.459 

so<00:01:27.670> I'm<00:01:27.759> kind<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.090> bouncing<00:01:28.630> off<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.960> g-string

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
so I'm kind of bouncing off the g-string

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:37.160 
so I'm kind of bouncing off the g-string
for<00:01:29.890> each<00:01:30.189> of<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.789> notes<00:01:30.969> on<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.270> B<00:01:31.539> string

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.870 

but<00:01:38.170> those<00:01:38.350> g-string<00:01:38.890> notes<00:01:39.100> are<00:01:39.340> kind<00:01:39.789> of

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
but those g-string notes are kind of

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.590 
but those g-string notes are kind of
ghosted<00:01:40.390> they're<00:01:40.569> just<00:01:40.780> sort<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.170> alluded<00:01:41.710> to

so<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.180> second<00:01:56.600> time<00:01:58.210> I'm<00:01:59.210> going<00:01:59.600> up<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.780> the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
so that second time I'm going up to the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:11.220 
so that second time I'm going up to the
high<00:02:01.570> F<00:02:02.570> no<00:02:02.840> minor<00:02:03.470> third<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> right<00:02:09.020> here

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
high F no minor third so right here

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:22.660

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
so this is over the five chord so those

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.000 
so this is over the five chord so those
quick<00:02:31.170> pull<00:02:31.439> backs<00:02:35.750> again<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.230> bouncing

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
quick pull backs again this is bouncing

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
quick pull backs again this is bouncing
off<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.159> g-string<00:02:38.939> just<00:02:39.510> for<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.810> rhythmic

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
off that g-string just for the rhythmic

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.240 
off that g-string just for the rhythmic
quality<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.859> it<00:02:45.260> then<00:02:46.260> up<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.560> 13

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
