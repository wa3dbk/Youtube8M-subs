00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello girls nights welcome to me 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.549
 jolie channel today I have a video 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.549
 totally different 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.240
 in a few days I 'm going to move and then 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.330
 I'm buying decoration things 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.610
 to be able to decorate my space since in 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.529
 this moment, what I have is this 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.470
 that you can see inside me 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.810
 fourth and then it's a chaos actually 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.090
 it's chaos to keep this but already when 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.190
 I 'm going to have my own space and 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.130
 then I am buying things and not 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.450
 just little things for the room that I think 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.700
 that if the majorities are little things for the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.609
 fourth but I've also been buying 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.739
 little things to decorate the rest of the house 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.239
 but he orders them online and he has not yet 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.129
 come but I can not wait to 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.160
 share these little things that really 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.109
 fascinate me but before continuing the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.850
 I invite you to subscribe to my channel if 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.769
 it's the first time they're watching a video 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.960
 mine then subscribe to my channel to 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.850
 be updated of the following 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.350
 videos that I'm going to upload and now if I'm going to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.770
 start if they know my surname's 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.140
 Alexander houses and fascinates me then has 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.700
 found these two to put them in 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.830
 different places of course not 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.140
 put them on par or maybe if you see 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.050
 Nice does not look cute 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.490
 part of the decoration is how to combine 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.100
 metallic or gold and silver 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.640
 combine them together and at the same time the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.790
 white and black with the touch of color 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.979
 it's going to be pink but I do not want a 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.800
 fourth as well as teenagers not 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.990
 I want it very minimalist and the same 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.690
 once sophisticated and well this is what 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.600
 I've been getting and you've cost me 14 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.000
 dollars and it cost 8 dollars but the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.850
 I found at a discount of 6 dollars 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.440
 I was looking for many expensive and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.780
 economic that are not very expensive but 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.390
 that are beautiful and details and this is 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.539
 another candle that cost me 8 dollars and it's 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.429
 chevron print that is a pattern 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.220
 that fascinates me but what else 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.640
 liked is that it is golden brown and white 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.769
 precious and this is how to put the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.090
 rings or those accessories that do not 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.300
 take away from the hand 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.209
 of what it takes and put it here but the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.760
 gold detallito the Eiffel Tower I 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.250
 fascinated and this has no label but 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.650
 I think this cost me 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.070
 around 9 dollars also in 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.550
 burlington if I'm not wrong and in this 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.420
 camera is in silver and is 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.090
 It cost 599 and that 's how it's super cute and 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.620
 Look, if it makes me beautiful, it was like 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.170
 that gold and silver not combined 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.170
 together but now it is very intendancy 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.600
 this to combine in the accessories and in 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.730
 any things combine the metallic ones and 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.400
 this fits me so that to me I 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.510
 love I love that idea 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.379
 and also so that this one that is 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.110
 1 to place jewelry lenses things like that 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.260
 but it is uncovered is a glass box 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.200
 golden at the same time and I was fascinated by this 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.989
 It cost me 15 dollars in burlington and 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.940
 had in different sizes and is in 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.840
 stores so I'm a kimber fan 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.230
 yes burlington rose where they sell as not 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.790
 I know accessories and decoration things and 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.400
 everything you can good put in 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.269
 of the house at less price then that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.700
 is what fascinates me and it cost me 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:34.049
 10 dollars 10 dollars look and I was 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.480
 super hidden in the offers section 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.909
 for 8 dollars and I just gave him this 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.129
 that there was something in discount there tucked 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.159
 and urine and today I found it and it touched me with 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.260
 this and one of the themes of my room goes 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.389
 to be the stripes and then I said good 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.310
 this is perfect white with black or 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.980
 green stripes with black I love me 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.230

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.550

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.560

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.270
 remove the streaks to make 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.460
 the detail but I found it done and 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.070
 well I said good I save this job 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.560
 It cost me 8 dollars in burlington and 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.420
 I also have this other one that is already 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.150
 forgotten because I already bought it some ago 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.920
 days and look at this picture this box what 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.720
 I bought in chasms and if it is not premium 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:47.860
 it cost or 24 25 dollars something like that and look 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.760
 this other picture is my favorite story 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.220
 of love is ours and it is like that and it has 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.500
 the transits with gold inside me 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.270
 loved it and the project is golden truth 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.750
 fascinated me and I also found this other 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.230
 these two are max and this I found 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:11.300
 in burlington and says never let that 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.810
 nobody or for your brightness and look 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.479

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.250
 passionate these pictures of truth and 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.319
 there are many more of you if you want 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.849
 happen to see there are many more in these 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:27.889
 moments like this is forever in love and 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.580
 it is with this pattern the same pattern 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.710
 of the candle can be fixed and I do not know 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.979
 I love it and really I can already 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.420
 put all those little things there and another 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.120
 little thing that I bought is this 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.620
 little circle that is here flat but 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.170
 look at this little thing as well as to put 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.360
 lipsticks put nail paints and I think 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.870
 which is a good idea to store the 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.950
 things that look nice buy this other 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.630
 that is a beige a florerito no 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.890
 florerito but that is a coasts and 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.480
 Transparent just like I want to put 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.510
 cottons or any little thing that is 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.050
 necessary to store but to be seen 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.460
 the same time nice that looks cute and 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.810
 Well, I've always liked everything 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.330
 this decoration but I think that 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.490
 lately it makes me one stronger who 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.410
 tell me who of you has heard the 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.590
 nest syndrome nest syndrome 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.770
 It's like a desire to have everything in 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.320
 perfect state everything ready for when 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.150
 the baby is born as it is roncito bani 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.850
 and will perform everything or if everything is 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.010
 perfect but I also do not know that about that 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.470
 I'm pregnant and I'm with the 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.390
 emotion that I'm going to move to a 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.810
 bigger space and then I'm going to 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.270
 be able to decorate the each space I do not know 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.990
 I'm very excited and that's why I wanted to 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.630
 share with 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.600
 it's you and I'm missing one last one if you can 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.600
 see here behind this mirror also this 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.720
 mirror I just bought them in Burlington and 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.370
 it cost me 50 dollars only to me 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.560
 it made me cheap because I was watching in 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.340
 other places was super expensive and the 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.110
 Silver detail here fascinated me and 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.790
 I think it will be perfect with my 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.470
 intention to combine what is metallic 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.030
 the metal ones I think it will be very 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.070
 good and good girls this practically 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.190
 It has been everything I hope you liked it

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.150
 for the channel but at the same time and I 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.010
 It made fun to be able to share with 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.720
 you and only when they come to me 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.370

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:01.980
 adapt to my personality but in this 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.980
 video I'm going to share a few
