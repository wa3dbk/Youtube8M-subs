the uppermost position the question

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.670 
the uppermost position the question

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
becomes how much is it going to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
becomes how much is it going to
interfere<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> shock<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
interfere with the shock so there's a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.850 
interfere with the shock so there's a
couple<00:01:15.750> things<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> might<00:01:16.320> notice<00:01:16.470> wrong

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
couple things you might notice wrong

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
couple things you might notice wrong
with<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.280> showing<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:17.960> one<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
with what I'm showing right now one of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.749 
with what I'm showing right now one of
them<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> huge<00:01:20.159> gap<00:01:20.460> right

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
them is that I have a huge gap right

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.490 
them is that I have a huge gap right
here<00:01:21.090> where<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> bracket<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.049> meet<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
here where the bracket would meet to the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
here where the bracket would meet to the
chassis<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.130> order<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> create<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
chassis in order to create a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.870 
chassis in order to create a
perpendicular<00:01:24.810> shock<00:01:25.710> mount<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.640> I'll<00:01:26.729> show

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
perpendicular shock mount so I'll show

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.980 
perpendicular shock mount so I'll show
you<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> fix<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.750> problem

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you how I'm going to fix that problem

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.749 
you how I'm going to fix that problem
and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> other<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> because

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and then the other thing is that because

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.210 
and then the other thing is that because
of<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.210> clearance<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.900> found<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.070> most

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of this clearance I found that the most

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.469 
of this clearance I found that the most
effective<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> deal<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
effective way to deal with that is to

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
effective way to deal with that is to
invert<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.579> invert<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> coil<00:01:36.000> over<00:01:38.689> which

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
invert the invert the coil over which

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.580 
invert the invert the coil over which
means<00:01:40.020> placing<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.650> position<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
means placing it in position like so and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
means placing it in position like so and
therefore<00:01:43.590> providing<00:01:44.250> plenty<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.640> clearance

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
therefore providing plenty of clearance

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.359 
therefore providing plenty of clearance
in<00:01:45.149> order<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.570> able<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
in order to be able to get to the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
in order to be able to get to the
crossmember<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:48.390> only<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.259> drivability

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
crossmember not only for the drivability

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.060 
crossmember not only for the drivability
but<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.460> serviceability<00:01:51.649> some<00:01:52.649> people<00:01:52.920> might

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
but for serviceability some people might

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
but for serviceability some people might
be<00:01:53.189> concerned<00:01:53.549> about<00:01:53.729> inverting<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> coil

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
be concerned about inverting the coil

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.100 
be concerned about inverting the coil
over<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.460> single<00:01:56.880> two<00:01:57.299> coil<00:01:57.750> over

and<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.659> 50/50<00:02:01.140> ratio<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.890> not

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and it's of a 50/50 ratio that's not

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
and it's of a 50/50 ratio that's not
adjustable<00:02:02.579> dampener<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:03.960> not<00:02:04.110> concerned

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
adjustable dampener so I'm not concerned

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.340 
adjustable dampener so I'm not concerned
and<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.159> anything<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.729> puts<00:02:06.000> less<00:02:06.750> unsprung

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and if anything it puts less unsprung

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.919 
and if anything it puts less unsprung
weight<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> tire<00:02:08.670> side<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> puts<00:02:09.690> more

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
weight on the tire side and it puts more

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.040 
weight on the tire side and it puts more
of<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> weight<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> chat

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
of the weight on to the chat

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.950 
of the weight on to the chat
sighs<00:02:11.290> I'm<00:02:11.500> producing<00:02:11.950> unsprung<00:02:12.400> weight<00:02:12.960> by

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
sighs I'm producing unsprung weight by

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.990 
sighs I'm producing unsprung weight by
inverting<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.620> coilover<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.430> that's<00:02:15.910> a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
inverting the coilover and that's a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.940 
inverting the coilover and that's a
pretty<00:02:16.210> common<00:02:16.570> thing<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> do<00:02:16.960> that's<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.920> I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
pretty common thing to do that's so I

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.290 
pretty common thing to do that's so I
trust<00:02:18.610> that'll<00:02:18.910> work

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
trust that'll work

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.750 
trust that'll work
so<00:02:20.170> here's<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.500> mock-up<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.070> how<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.250> plan<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
so here's a mock-up of how I plan to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.390 
so here's a mock-up of how I plan to
deal<00:02:21.940> with<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.530> offset<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.770> coil<00:02:24.070> over

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
deal with the offset of the coil over

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.830 
deal with the offset of the coil over
you<00:02:24.550> can<00:02:24.670> see<00:02:24.820> I've<00:02:24.910> created<00:02:25.120> two<00:02:25.360> brackets

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
you can see I've created two brackets

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.050 
you can see I've created two brackets
one<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.140> them<00:02:26.260> has<00:02:26.590> very<00:02:26.980> elongated<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.850> face

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
one of them has very elongated to face

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.820 
one of them has very elongated to face
whereas<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.990> other<00:02:29.110> one<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.470> very

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
whereas the other one is a very

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.700 
whereas the other one is a very
symmetrical<00:02:30.550> design<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:32.170> two<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.440> them<00:02:32.590> were

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
symmetrical design the two of them were

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.380 
symmetrical design the two of them were
created<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.280> such<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.490> way<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.940> they<00:02:34.060> share<00:02:34.360> a

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
created in such a way that they share a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.140 
created in such a way that they share a
plane<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:35.560> flat<00:02:35.860> bottom<00:02:36.250> plane<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.790> so

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
plane this flat bottom plane and so

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.790 
plane this flat bottom plane and so
that's<00:02:37.390> what's<00:02:37.630> going<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.900> find<00:02:38.230> its<00:02:38.380> way<00:02:38.530> up

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
that's what's going to find its way up

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.460 
that's what's going to find its way up
underneath<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.460> chassis<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.440> because<00:02:41.440> of

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
underneath the chassis and because of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.050 
underneath the chassis and because of
the<00:02:41.680> difference<00:02:42.070> in<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> end<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.910> I've

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
the difference in the end that I've

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.910 
the difference in the end that I've
demonstrated<00:02:43.510> here<00:02:44.140> we<00:02:44.260> could<00:02:44.380> see<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.710> my

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
demonstrated here we could see that my

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.860 
demonstrated here we could see that my
mock-up<00:02:45.340> little<00:02:45.580> piece<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.880> wood<00:02:46.090> does<00:02:46.630> come

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
mock-up little piece of wood does come

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.150 
mock-up little piece of wood does come
off<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.290> chassis<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.800> perpendicular

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
off of the chassis in a perpendicular

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.090 
off of the chassis in a perpendicular
fashion<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.780> very<00:02:49.900> easy<00:02:50.200> for<00:02:50.530> me<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.860> mount

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
fashion so be very easy for me to mount

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.710 
fashion so be very easy for me to mount
these<00:02:51.340> tabs<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.820> then<00:02:51.940> grind<00:02:52.210> off<00:02:52.510> this

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
these tabs and then grind off this

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.750 
these tabs and then grind off this
excess<00:02:53.110> material<00:02:53.740> in<00:02:54.160> order<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.520> create<00:02:54.700> a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
excess material in order to create a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.960 
excess material in order to create a
very<00:02:54.940> flush<00:02:55.530> 45-degree<00:02:56.530> oriented<00:02:57.190> upper

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970

shock<00:02:58.510> bracket<00:02:59.850> here<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.940> can<00:03:01.090> see<00:03:01.270> how<00:03:01.420> I've

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
shock bracket here you can see how I've

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.840 
shock bracket here you can see how I've
mounted<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.930> very<00:03:02.110> thin<00:03:02.650> piece<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.100> one<00:03:03.340> bite<00:03:03.550> of

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
mounted a very thin piece of one bite of

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.790 
mounted a very thin piece of one bite of
a<00:03:04.210> one-inch<00:03:04.540> stock<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.500> sort<00:03:05.740> of

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
a one-inch stock it's sort of

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.160 
a one-inch stock it's sort of
representing<00:03:06.730> what<00:03:06.880> will<00:03:07.060> become<00:03:07.210> a<00:03:07.750> piece<00:03:08.020> of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
representing what will become a piece of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.710 
representing what will become a piece of
one-inch<00:03:08.350> square<00:03:09.090> tubing<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.330> I'll<00:03:10.450> place

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
one-inch square tubing that I'll place

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.500 
one-inch square tubing that I'll place
here<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.530> create<00:03:11.800> an<00:03:11.920> a-frame<00:03:12.270> effect<00:03:13.270> and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
here to create an a-frame effect and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.199 
here to create an a-frame effect and
this<00:03:14.020> will<00:03:14.290> then<00:03:14.530> simulate<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.580> surface

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
this will then simulate to the surface

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.240 
this will then simulate to the surface
of<00:03:16.390> where<00:03:17.080> I'll<00:03:17.200> be<00:03:17.350> mounting<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.830> lower

of where I'll be mounting the lower
shock<00:03:18.700> brackets<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:21.100> here<00:03:21.250> we<00:03:21.340> see<00:03:21.520> a<00:03:21.550> very

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
shock brackets so here we see a very

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.570 
shock brackets so here we see a very
preliminary<00:03:22.330> dry<00:03:23.020> fit<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.790> shock<00:03:25.330> mounts

preliminary dry fit of the shock mounts
coilover<00:03:27.580> shock<00:03:27.850> now<00:03:28.150> my<00:03:28.330> concern<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:29.140> is

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
coilover shock now my concern here is

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.740 
coilover shock now my concern here is
about<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.680> clearance<00:03:29.980> as<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.150> can<00:03:31.300> see<00:03:31.480> here

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
about the clearance as you can see here

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.360 
about the clearance as you can see here
there's<00:03:32.020> very<00:03:32.200> little<00:03:32.380> space<00:03:32.770> between<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
is closed free and clear because I've

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.229 
is closed free and clear because I've
inverted<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.340> shock<00:03:42.580> I've<00:03:42.790> got<00:03:42.940> plenty<00:03:43.120> of

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
inverted the shock I've got plenty of

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.670 
inverted the shock I've got plenty of
clearance<00:03:43.540> between<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.340> shock<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.640> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
brackets are pretty well oriented I

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.560 
brackets are pretty well oriented I
think<00:03:54.400> there<00:03:54.520> may<00:03:54.610> be<00:03:54.640> some<00:03:54.940> gaps<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.360> there

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
think there may be some gaps in there

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.210 
think there may be some gaps in there
but<00:03:55.720> they'll<00:03:55.870> resolve<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.680> as<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:56.980> weld

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
but they'll resolve that as I weld

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.620 
but they'll resolve that as I weld
everything<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:59.500> it's<00:04:00.489> not<00:04:00.730> symmetrical<00:04:01.510> in

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630

everything and it's not symmetrical in

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
the sense that the lower control arm I

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.790 
the sense that the lower control arm I
wanted<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.360> bias<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.840> shock<00:04:05.080> toward<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> rear

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
wanted to bias the shock toward the rear

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.100 
wanted to bias the shock toward the rear
and<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.000> may<00:04:07.360> be<00:04:07.420> able<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.660> gets<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.989> little

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
and so I may be able to gets a little

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.840 
and so I may be able to gets a little
bit<00:04:08.320> more<00:04:08.470> out<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.650> these<00:04:08.860> brackets<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:09.550> and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
bit more out of these brackets but and

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.430 
bit more out of these brackets but and
orient<00:04:10.269> this<00:04:10.420> whole<00:04:10.600> shop<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.870> little<00:04:11.080> bit<00:04:11.290> more

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
orient this whole shop a little bit more

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.759 
orient this whole shop a little bit more
to<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.680> right<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.360> in<00:04:13.360> doing<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:14.470> makes

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
to the right and in doing so it makes

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.590 
to the right and in doing so it makes
some<00:04:14.920> more<00:04:15.070> clearance<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:15.670> even<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.419> much

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
some more clearance so even that much

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.810 
some more clearance so even that much
should<00:04:16.810> make<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:16.989> difference<00:04:17.410> but<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.430> will<00:04:18.609> have

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
should make a difference but I will have

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.340 
should make a difference but I will have
to<00:04:18.850> make<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.299> lower<00:04:19.450> control<00:04:19.810> arm<00:04:20.080> a<00:04:20.200> little

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
to make the lower control arm a little
