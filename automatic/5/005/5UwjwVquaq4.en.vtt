what is up guys mysteries of us here
this<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:02.850> full<00:00:03.120> review<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> watch<00:00:04.259> a

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
this is my full review of the a watch a

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:18.140 
this is my full review of the a watch a
8<00:00:04.980> plus<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> at<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.320> over<00:00:16.470> $70<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.699> thing<00:00:17.940> is

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
8 plus so at just over $70 this thing is

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.060 
8 plus so at just over $70 this thing is
not<00:00:18.330> exactly<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> super<00:00:19.439> budget<00:00:19.770> part<00:00:20.010> of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
not exactly in the super budget part of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.220 
not exactly in the super budget part of
the<00:00:20.130> market<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:21.060> basically<00:00:21.600> sits<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.990> top<00:00:22.170> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the market it basically sits on top of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.439 
the market it basically sits on top of
devices<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:22.949> cost<00:00:23.310> around<00:00:23.430> $30<00:00:24.240> there's

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
devices that cost around $30 there's

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.759 
devices that cost around $30 there's
quite<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> few<00:00:24.720> Chinese<00:00:25.050> smartwatches<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
quite a few Chinese smartwatches that

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
quite a few Chinese smartwatches that
fit<00:00:25.920> into<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.279> bracket<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.090> obviously<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
fit into that bracket but obviously this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
fit into that bracket but obviously this
is<00:00:27.689> significantly<00:00:28.349> cheaper<00:00:28.560> than<00:00:28.740> something

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
is significantly cheaper than something

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.370 
is significantly cheaper than something
like<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.429> Apple<00:00:29.699> watch<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.900> price<00:00:31.109> it's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
like the Apple watch for the price it's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
like the Apple watch for the price it's
built<00:00:31.619> extremely<00:00:32.219> well<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.759> feels<00:00:32.910> basically

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
built extremely well it feels basically

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.209 
built extremely well it feels basically
just<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.079> good<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> Apple<00:00:34.739> equivalent

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
just as good as the Apple equivalent

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
just as good as the Apple equivalent
it's<00:00:35.700> got<00:00:35.969> metal<00:00:36.239> around<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> face<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it's got metal around the face of the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.780 
it's got metal around the face of the
device<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> leatherette<00:00:38.250> kind<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
device and then a leatherette kind of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.490 
device and then a leatherette kind of
plastic<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> goes<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> bands<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
plastic that goes on the bands and it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.709 
plastic that goes on the bands and it
fits<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:40.890> comfortably<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.520> place<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.329> top<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
fits very comfortably in place on top of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.209 
fits very comfortably in place on top of
that<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> actual<00:00:43.140> band<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.469> strong<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that the actual band is very strong and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
that the actual band is very strong and
to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.460> honest<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.879> terms<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> build<00:00:45.719> there's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
to be honest in terms of build there's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
to be honest in terms of build there's
very<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.440> place<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> fault<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> device<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
very little place to fault the device is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.569 
very little place to fault the device is
very<00:00:47.670> nice<00:00:48.090> indeed<00:00:49.070> upon<00:00:50.070> turning<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
very nice indeed upon turning on the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.549 
very nice indeed upon turning on the
display<00:00:50.879> you'll<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.210> greeted<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.690> 240<00:00:52.350> by

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
display you'll be greeted by a 240 by

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.130 
display you'll be greeted by a 240 by
240<00:00:53.129> resolution<00:00:53.280> display<00:00:54.000> viewing<00:00:54.690> angles<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
240 resolution display viewing angles a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
240 resolution display viewing angles a
sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> average<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.920> best<00:00:55.949> colors<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.850> not

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sort of average at best colors are not

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
sort of average at best colors are not
exactly<00:00:57.360> popping<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> resolution<00:00:58.620> isn't

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
exactly popping and the resolution isn't

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
exactly popping and the resolution isn't
brilliant<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.640> will<00:00:59.850> suffice<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.859> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
brilliant but it will suffice so the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
brilliant but it will suffice so the
interface<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.370> quite<00:01:02.670> nice<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> say<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
interface is quite nice I have to say it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
interface is quite nice I have to say it
looks<00:01:03.899> kind<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.470> Apple<00:01:04.769> esque<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.580> obviously

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
looks kind of Apple esque but obviously

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
looks kind of Apple esque but obviously
they're<00:01:06.030> failing<00:01:06.240> at<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.689> points<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.650> if

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
they're failing at some points so if

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.350 
they're failing at some points so if
quite<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> few<00:01:08.100> built-in<00:01:08.460> tools<00:01:08.760> such<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.090> quick

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
quite a few built-in tools such as quick

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.080 
quite a few built-in tools such as quick
contacts<00:01:09.840> calendar<00:01:10.439> radio<00:01:10.920> FM<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> then

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
contacts calendar radio FM and then

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.760 
contacts calendar radio FM and then
we've<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.360> got<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> app

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
we've actually got like a kind of app

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
we've actually got like a kind of app
drawer<00:01:14.040> equivalent<00:01:14.610> which<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.210> tell<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
drawer equivalent which you can tell is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.450 
drawer equivalent which you can tell is
trying<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> copy<00:01:16.229> Apple<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.189> really

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
trying to copy Apple but is not really

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.520 
trying to copy Apple but is not really
working<00:01:17.869> having<00:01:18.869> said<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> though<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.350> can

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
working having said that though you can

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.810 
working having said that though you can
tell<00:01:19.830> there's<00:01:20.040> actually<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> lot<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> different

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
tell there's actually a lot of different

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
tell there's actually a lot of different
apps<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.840> actually<00:01:22.080> got<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> fair

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
apps on here it's actually got a fair

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
apps on here it's actually got a fair
few<00:01:22.770> features<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.140> starting<00:01:25.140> with

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
few features going for it starting with

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
few features going for it starting with
a<00:01:25.259> camera<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.159> pretty<00:01:26.460> poor<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.970> mean<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
a camera it's pretty poor I mean the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.810 
a camera it's pretty poor I mean the
image<00:01:27.420> quality<00:01:27.659> produces<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.650> bad<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
image quality produces is bad and it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
image quality produces is bad and it
just<00:01:30.119> looks<00:01:30.299> even<00:01:30.540> worse<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.350> poor

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
just looks even worse on this poor

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.100 
just looks even worse on this poor
display<00:01:32.270> we've<00:01:33.270> got<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> dialer<00:01:33.840> which<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
display we've got a dialer which is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
display we've got a dialer which is
pretty<00:01:34.290> easy<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.619> use<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
pretty easy to use but I have to say the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980 
pretty easy to use but I have to say the
numbers<00:01:35.970> feel<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> little<00:01:36.509> bit<00:01:36.630> small<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
numbers feel a little bit small and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
numbers feel a little bit small and
occasion<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.829> miss<00:01:38.040> type<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:39.060> be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
occasion you do miss type and to be

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
occasion you do miss type and to be
honest<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:39.960> much<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> same<00:01:40.380> story

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
really say is that the main functions

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.759 
really say is that the main functions
work<00:02:54.510> fine<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:55.319> all<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> added

work fine but all the added

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.559 
work fine but all the added
functionality<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.579> sort<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.000> here<00:02:57.180> or<00:02:57.329> there

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
pretty nippy I mean I would put this

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.849 
pretty nippy I mean I would put this
down<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> combination<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.530> running<00:03:19.769> a

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
down to a combination of it running a

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.740 
down to a combination of it running a
very<00:03:20.160> light<00:03:20.370> operating<00:03:20.910> system<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.480> having

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
very light operating system and having

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.750 
very light operating system and having
an<00:03:21.840> extremely<00:03:22.260> low<00:03:22.530> screen<00:03:22.859> resolution<00:03:22.920> so

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
an extremely low screen resolution so

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.449 
an extremely low screen resolution so
not<00:03:24.329> too<00:03:24.510> taxing<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.139> CPU<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.620> GPU<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.430> I

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
not too taxing on the CPU and GPU so I

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.710 
not too taxing on the CPU and GPU so I
mean<00:03:26.609> because<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.060> simplest<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
mean because of the simplest to the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.059 
mean because of the simplest to the
operating<00:03:28.019> system<00:03:28.380> there's<00:03:28.530> no<00:03:28.560> complex

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
operating system there's no complex

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.220 
operating system there's no complex
animations<00:03:29.609> or<00:03:29.730> anything<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:30.690> works<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
animations or anything it just works I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.599 
animations or anything it just works I
mean<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.470> click<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.799> something<00:03:31.950> it'll<00:03:32.370> open

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
mean you click on something it'll open

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.090 
mean you click on something it'll open
instantly<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:34.109> scroll<00:03:34.440> through<00:03:34.470> it'll

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
instantly and you scroll through it'll

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.740 
instantly and you scroll through it'll
scroll<00:03:35.370> through<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.850> screen<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.239> capacitive

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
scroll through the screen is capacitive

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
scroll through the screen is capacitive
so<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.500> know<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.739> not<00:03:37.829> like<00:03:37.889> you<00:03:38.069> have<00:03:38.190> to

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
so you know it's not like you have to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.979 
so you know it's not like you have to
push<00:03:38.459> too<00:03:38.670> hard<00:03:38.700> or<00:03:39.030> anything<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:39.900> again

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
push too hard or anything but then again

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.360 
push too hard or anything but then again
it's<00:03:40.200> hardly<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.530> high-end<00:03:41.040> premium

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
it's hardly a high-end premium

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.319 
it's hardly a high-end premium
experience<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.160> sum<00:03:44.370> up<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.700> arch<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.120> 8

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
experience so to sum up the arch a 8

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.449 
experience so to sum up the arch a 8
plus<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.870> quite<00:03:46.109> an<00:03:46.260> interesting<00:03:46.650> product<00:03:46.889> it

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
plus is quite an interesting product it

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.460 
plus is quite an interesting product it
has<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.760> build<00:03:47.970> quality<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.450> something<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.230> lot

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
has the build quality of something a lot

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.720 
has the build quality of something a lot
better<00:03:49.680> than<00:03:49.920> what<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.160> actually<00:03:50.310> is

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
better than what it actually is

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.699 
better than what it actually is
having<00:03:51.569> said<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.750> we<00:03:51.989> must<00:03:52.139> consider<00:03:52.319> that

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
having said that we must consider that

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.319 
having said that we must consider that
even<00:03:52.859> though<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.220> does<00:03:53.370> cost<00:03:53.609> more<00:03:53.910> than<00:03:54.090> some

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
even though it does cost more than some

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.150 
even though it does cost more than some
of<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.540> cheaper<00:03:55.109> Chinese<00:03:55.260> watches<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:56.010> is

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
of the cheaper Chinese watches it is

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160 
of the cheaper Chinese watches it is
still<00:03:56.400> quite<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> budget<00:03:57.090> oriented<00:03:57.299> device<00:03:57.810> so

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
still quite a budget oriented device so

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.199 
still quite a budget oriented device so
it<00:03:58.650> actually<00:03:58.829> offers<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.220> fair<00:03:59.609> amount<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.030> bang

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
it actually offers a fair amount of bang

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.580 
it actually offers a fair amount of bang

services provided by something like the

services provided by something like the
Apple<00:04:09.599> watch<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:10.079> not<00:04:10.290> exactly<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.829> a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
Apple watch it's not exactly like a

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.710 
Apple watch it's not exactly like a
fully<00:04:11.250> fledged<00:04:11.519> ecosystem<00:04:12.269> here<00:04:12.419> it's<00:04:12.569> just

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
fully fledged ecosystem here it's just

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
fully fledged ecosystem here it's just
something<00:04:13.109> which<00:04:13.590> kind<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.919> works<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.579> does

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
something which kind of works and does

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.940 
something which kind of works and does
stuff<00:04:15.090> on<00:04:15.299> your<00:04:15.540> phone<00:04:15.810> if<00:04:16.049> you're<00:04:16.530> not<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.709> mean

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
stuff on your phone if you're not I mean

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.740 
stuff on your phone if you're not I mean
some<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.880> features<00:04:18.209> they've<00:04:18.359> tried<00:04:18.599> to

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
some of the features they've tried to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.360 
some of the features they've tried to
cram<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.169> just<00:04:19.530> feel<00:04:19.680> like<00:04:19.859> they're<00:04:20.039> out<00:04:20.070> of

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
cram in just feel like they're out of

cram in just feel like they're out of
place<00:04:20.609> on<00:04:20.789> this<00:04:20.910> device<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.479> overall<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.930> think

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
place on this device and overall I think

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:36.510 
place on this device and overall I think
you<00:04:22.530> can<00:04:22.710> do<00:04:22.830> better<00:04:23.010> for<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.310> money

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520
