00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
are working but do you want a little

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.839 
are working but do you want a little
system<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.569> more<00:02:44.950> fair<00:02:45.950> more<00:02:46.010> honest<00:02:46.730> and

system that is more fair more honest and
more<00:02:47.120> impartial<00:02:47.569> like<00:02:48.349> maybe<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.739> chess

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
more impartial like maybe the chess

basically<00:02:52.519> if<00:02:52.730> you're<00:02:52.880> facing<00:02:53.030> people<00:02:53.510> near

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
basically if you're facing people near

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.949 
basically if you're facing people near
your<00:02:53.870> rank<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.590> gain<00:02:54.950> more<00:02:55.220> points<00:02:55.959> lose

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
your rank you gain more points lose

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.690 
your rank you gain more points lose
against<00:02:57.200> someone<00:02:57.500> that's<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.829> much<00:02:58.190> lower<00:02:58.400> rank

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700

against someone that's a much lower rank
than<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.239> lose<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.599> lot<00:02:59.959> of<00:02:59.989> points<00:03:00.440> so

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
than you you lose a lot of points so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.100 
than you you lose a lot of points so
basically<00:03:01.489> on<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.730> 20<00:03:02.090> point<00:03:02.239> scale<00:03:02.599> even

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
basically on a 20 point scale even

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.259 
basically on a 20 point scale even
matches<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.890> get<00:03:04.040> 20<00:03:04.340> points<00:03:04.519> if<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:04.849> win<00:03:05.030> or

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
always think is the best system I

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.569 
always think is the best system I
wouldn't<00:03:21.200> mind<00:03:21.440> there<00:03:21.709> being<00:03:21.889> a<00:03:21.980> leader<00:03:22.280> board

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579
