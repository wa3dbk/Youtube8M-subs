00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
websites nowadays they just kind of suck

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.219

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
even know they're on there and I think I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.790 
even know they're on there and I think I
think<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.250> gives<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.700> lot<00:02:10.850> less<00:02:11.060> values<00:02:11.800> to

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
think that gives a lot less values to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.670 
think that gives a lot less values to
the<00:02:12.830> site<00:02:13.280> itself<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.900> particularly
