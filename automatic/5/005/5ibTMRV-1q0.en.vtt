00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
to this is the nitric oxide cell

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.039 
to this is the nitric oxide cell
volumizing<00:01:02.910> matrix<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.750> got<00:01:03.899> some

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
volumizing matrix and that's got some

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.100

impressive<00:01:04.739> ingredients<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.430> arginine<00:01:06.110> AKG

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
impressive ingredients like arginine AKG

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960

which<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> expand<00:01:08.670> those<00:01:08.729> blood

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
which is going to expand those blood

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
which is going to expand those blood
vessels<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.659> also<00:01:09.840> got<00:01:10.080> ethyl

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
vessels and then it's also got ethyl

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560 
vessels and then it's also got ethyl
ester<00:01:10.799> ester<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> nice

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
ester ester in it and that's a nice

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.060 
ester ester in it and that's a nice
ingredient<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> does<00:01:13.830> help
