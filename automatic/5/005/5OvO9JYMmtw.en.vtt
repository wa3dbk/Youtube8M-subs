alright<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.690> I'm<00:00:00.780> going<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> do<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.110> little

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 
alright so I'm going to do a little

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.050 
alright so I'm going to do a little
post-mortem<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.140> cut<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.430> DIY<00:00:05.700> book

couple<00:00:11.280> things<00:00:11.460> went<00:00:11.700> wrong<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:12.090> this

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
couple things went wrong with this

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.419 
couple things went wrong with this
particular<00:00:12.389> programming<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.190> lot

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
particular programming one is that a lot

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.210 
particular programming one is that a lot
of<00:00:14.549> parts<00:00:14.820> had<00:00:15.000> too<00:00:15.269> few<00:00:15.540> tabs<00:00:16.070> some<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> these

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
of parts had too few tabs some of these

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.680 
of parts had too few tabs some of these
stuck<00:00:17.550> well<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.940> some<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.119> them<00:00:18.240> didn't<00:00:18.539> it's

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
stuck well and some of them didn't it's

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
stuck well and some of them didn't it's
hard<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> say<00:00:19.140> exactly<00:00:19.289> what<00:00:20.010> threw<00:00:20.820> them<00:00:20.939> over

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
hard to say exactly what threw them over

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.779 
hard to say exactly what threw them over
but<00:00:21.270> I'll<00:00:21.390> need<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.720> tab<00:00:21.930> these<00:00:22.140> better

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
but I'll need to tab these better

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.540 
but I'll need to tab these better
likewise<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.180> inside<00:00:24.539> piece<00:00:25.550> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
likewise with this inside piece the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.220 
likewise with this inside piece the
outside<00:00:26.970> however<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> pretty<00:00:27.720> well<00:00:27.869> tabbed

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
outside however is pretty well tabbed

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.560 
outside however is pretty well tabbed
although<00:00:28.830> I'm<00:00:28.949> faintly<00:00:29.490> concerned<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
although I'm faintly concerned about the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.319 
although I'm faintly concerned about the
thickness<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.349> edge<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:33.620> here<00:00:35.329> we'll

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
thickness of this edge right here we'll

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
thickness of this edge right here we'll
see<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.750> that's<00:00:36.899> sufficient<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.739> we're

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
see if that's sufficient I know we're

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.850 
see if that's sufficient I know we're
trying<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> 14<00:00:39.390> inch<00:00:39.750> width<00:00:40.350> piece<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
trying to get a 14 inch width piece of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.200 
trying to get a 14 inch width piece of
glass<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.640> might<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
glass in there so it might just have to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
glass in there so it might just have to
be<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.480> thick<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.649> could<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
be that thick you could see that this

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
be that thick you could see that this
isn't<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> complete<00:00:44.789> scanner<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.539> test

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
isn't a complete scanner because my test

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
isn't a complete scanner because my test
pieces<00:00:46.079> cut<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.590> side<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> still<00:00:47.399> felt

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
pieces cut this side out I still felt

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580 
pieces cut this side out I still felt
like<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.850> was<00:00:47.969> worth<00:00:48.120> cutting<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.500> make

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
like it was worth cutting it will make

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.110 
like it was worth cutting it will make
good<00:00:49.770> firewood<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> learned<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> lot

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
good firewood in it and I learned a lot

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.229 
good firewood in it and I learned a lot
from<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:52.280> likewise<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:53.850> bearing

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
from it likewise here these bearing

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.619 
from it likewise here these bearing
supports<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.050> thin<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.160> see

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
supports are a little thin you can see

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.240 
supports are a little thin you can see
how<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> thickness<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> wood<00:00:58.680> changes

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
how the thickness of the wood changes

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.400 
how the thickness of the wood changes
along<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:01.020> edge<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
along here that's because one edge of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.779 
along here that's because one edge of
this<00:01:01.500> was<00:01:01.710> lifted<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.100> higher<00:01:02.309> than<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> other

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
this was lifted up higher than the other

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.140 
this was lifted up higher than the other
edge<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.359> unfortunate<00:01:04.489> here<00:01:05.489> again<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
edge that's unfortunate here again as it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
edge that's unfortunate here again as it
lifted<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> tabs<00:01:07.070> didn't<00:01:08.070> hold<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
lifted up the tabs didn't hold it in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
lifted up the tabs didn't hold it in
place<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.180> generally<00:01:09.780> held<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> place

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
place it it was generally held in place

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440 
place it it was generally held in place
but<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> way<00:01:11.670> I'd<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.270> that's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
but not kind of way I'd like so that's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
but not kind of way I'd like so that's
another<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.869> I'll<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> change<00:01:16.939> here

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
another thing I'll need to change here

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.980 
another thing I'll need to change here
on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.750> leaves<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> cradle<00:01:20.720> they<00:01:21.720> cut

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
on the leaves of the cradle they cut

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.800 
on the leaves of the cradle they cut
very<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.770> again<00:01:23.390> insufficient<00:01:24.390> tabbing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
very well but again insufficient tabbing

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.289 
very well but again insufficient tabbing
I<00:01:25.009> suspect<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.280> over<00:01:26.729> cut<00:01:26.939> could<00:01:27.180> be

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
I suspect that this over cut could be

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
I suspect that this over cut could be
reduced<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.020> wouldn't<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> huge<00:01:28.680> time

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
reduced it wouldn't be a huge time

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
reduced it wouldn't be a huge time
savings<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.700> there<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.900> were

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
savings but it would be there these were

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.740 
savings but it would be there these were
actually<00:01:31.409> slightly<00:01:31.650> undercut<00:01:32.600> which<00:01:33.600> was

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
actually slightly undercut which was

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
actually slightly undercut which was
surprising<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.560> could<00:01:34.740> essentially<00:01:35.220> bring

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
surprising but I could essentially bring

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.630 
surprising but I could essentially bring
these<00:01:35.670> dog<00:01:35.909> bones<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.570> further

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
these dog bones out a little further

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
these dog bones out a little further
here<00:01:39.229> on<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> other<00:01:41.250> back<00:01:42.150> leaf<00:01:42.450> have

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
here on the on the other back leaf have

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.429 
here on the on the other back leaf have
some<00:01:43.530> interesting<00:01:44.720> corner<00:01:45.720> irregularities

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
some interesting corner irregularities

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.840 
some interesting corner irregularities
that<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> machine<00:01:47.520> setup

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that have to do with the machine setup

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
that have to do with the machine setup
so<00:01:48.360> i<00:01:48.390> may<00:01:48.600> extend<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.259> dog<00:01:49.560> bone<00:01:49.799> slightly

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so i may extend this dog bone slightly

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
so i may extend this dog bone slightly
to<00:01:50.460> overcome<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.500> otherwise<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.680> feel<00:01:52.890> like

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to overcome that otherwise I feel like

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670 
to overcome that otherwise I feel like
the<00:01:53.220> coroner's<00:01:53.579> came<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.119> well<00:01:54.680> save

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the coroner's came out very well save

completely free and i'll have to think

completely free and i'll have to think
of<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.220> way<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.370> deal<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.240> don't<00:02:20.390> know

if<00:02:20.569> more<00:02:20.900> tabs<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.380> really<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.740> answer<00:02:21.890> there

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
if more tabs is really the answer there

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.860 
if more tabs is really the answer there
or<00:02:22.490> if<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.590> pocket<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.709> out<00:02:24.830> or<00:02:25.069> what

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
or if I just pocket it out or what

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.050

likewise this piece broke free but this

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.330 
likewise this piece broke free but this
piece<00:02:29.270> didn't<00:02:29.630> I've<00:02:30.080> got<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> 3d<00:02:30.620> tab<00:02:30.830> here<00:02:31.190> and

here there there there and there and
they<00:02:34.130> weren't<00:02:34.400> sufficient<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.120> I'll<00:02:35.180> need<00:02:35.270> to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
they weren't sufficient so I'll need to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.210 
they weren't sufficient so I'll need to
figure<00:02:35.540> out<00:02:35.630> why<00:02:35.870> probably<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:37.040> thickness

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220

beautifully<00:02:40.550> I'm<00:02:40.670> very<00:02:40.850> happy<00:02:41.090> with<00:02:41.120> them

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
beautifully I'm very happy with them

glad<00:02:42.260> i<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.410> say<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.830> in<00:02:42.950> at<00:02:43.040> least<00:02:43.100> one

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
glad i can say that in at least one

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
pieces the tabbing is again a little bit

insufficient<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.519> they<00:02:52.670> cut<00:02:52.880> out

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
insufficient but they cut out

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.910 
insufficient but they cut out
beautifully<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.720> I'm<00:02:53.810> tempted<00:02:54.470> almost<00:02:54.830> to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
beautifully and I'm tempted almost to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.220 
beautifully and I'm tempted almost to
leave<00:02:55.070> them<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> way<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:55.459> are<00:02:56.230> pocketing

could<00:02:57.530> probably<00:02:57.830> be<00:02:58.250> reduced<00:02:58.670> slightly<00:02:59.000> but

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
could probably be reduced slightly but

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.380 
could probably be reduced slightly but
came<00:03:00.320> out<00:03:00.500> well<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.820> sort<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.030> seeing<00:03:02.209> this

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
came out well just sort of seeing this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.420 
came out well just sort of seeing this
as<00:03:02.570> being<00:03:02.750> more<00:03:02.900> than<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.080> quarter<00:03:03.260> inch

it's<00:03:12.050> probably<00:03:12.260> smart<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:13.390> trim<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.420> out

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
it's probably smart to trim that out

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
saw this happen from a crappy bit it

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.199 
saw this happen from a crappy bit it
could<00:03:51.980> very<00:03:52.160> well<00:03:52.220> be<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.549> my<00:03:52.820> bit<00:03:53.030> is

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
could very well be that my bit is

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.910 
could very well be that my bit is
somewhat<00:03:53.570> damaged<00:03:53.959> but<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.470> could<00:03:54.620> also<00:03:54.709> be

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
somewhat damaged but it could also be

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.620 
somewhat damaged but it could also be
that<00:03:55.040> we're<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.459> between<00:03:55.760> two<00:03:55.970> levels<00:03:56.360> in<00:03:56.540> a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
that we're in between two levels in a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.470 
that we're in between two levels in a
cheap<00:03:56.870> layer<00:03:57.079> of<00:03:57.230> wood<00:03:57.940> they<00:03:58.940> certainly<00:03:59.239> get

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
cheap layer of wood they certainly get

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.640 
cheap layer of wood they certainly get
better<00:03:59.720> with<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.019> wood<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> little<00:04:00.530> more

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
better with the wood is a little more

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.880 
better with the wood is a little more
dense<00:04:00.920> here<00:04:01.870> I'm<00:04:02.870> just<00:04:02.900> not<00:04:03.170> sure<00:04:03.230> I've<00:04:03.709> never

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
dense here I'm just not sure I've never

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.610 
dense here I'm just not sure I've never
particularly<00:04:04.430> loved<00:04:04.970> these<00:04:05.239> parts<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:05.930> see<00:04:06.500> why

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
particularly loved these parts I see why

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.979 
particularly loved these parts I see why
they're<00:04:06.799> practical<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.430> why<00:04:07.489> we<00:04:07.610> need<00:04:07.790> them

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
they're practical and why we need them

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.699 
they're practical and why we need them
but<00:04:08.989> uh<00:04:09.700> not<00:04:10.700> sure<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:11.359> want<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:11.989> sort<00:04:12.230> of<00:04:12.260> keep

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
but uh not sure I want to sort of keep

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.080 
but uh not sure I want to sort of keep
going<00:04:13.040> with<00:04:13.160> those<00:04:13.310> until<00:04:13.609> I<00:04:13.670> think<00:04:13.820> of<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.970> good

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
going with those until I think of a good

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.870 
going with those until I think of a good
solution<00:04:14.390> as<00:04:14.989> far<00:04:15.290> as<00:04:15.410> these<00:04:15.650> guys<00:04:15.859> these<00:04:16.519> also

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
solution as far as these guys these also

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.870 
solution as far as these guys these also
broke<00:04:17.120> off<00:04:17.329> inside<00:04:17.630> their<00:04:18.370> their<00:04:19.370> mounts

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
broke off inside their their mounts

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.000 
broke off inside their their mounts
despite<00:04:20.419> being<00:04:20.630> tabbed<00:04:20.989> pretty<00:04:21.410> extensively

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
despite being tabbed pretty extensively

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.440 
despite being tabbed pretty extensively
and<00:04:22.930> this<00:04:23.930> curved<00:04:24.770> Inlet<00:04:25.370> here<00:04:25.849> again

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
and this curved Inlet here again

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.210 
and this curved Inlet here again
cause<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.930> machine<00:04:27.230> to<00:04:27.380> hammer<00:04:27.620> it's<00:04:27.980> an

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
cause the machine to hammer it's an

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.890 
cause the machine to hammer it's an
interaction<00:04:28.790> between<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.300> constant

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
interaction between the constant

velocity settings and the and the type
of<00:04:35.030> curve<00:04:35.390> so<00:04:36.080> on<00:04:36.260> I'll<00:04:36.590> just<00:04:36.740> need<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.010> change

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
of curve so on I'll just need to change

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.890 
of curve so on I'll just need to change
those<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.700> sort<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.000> polygonal<00:04:38.270> shape<00:04:38.660> and

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
those to a sort of polygonal shape and

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.050 
those to a sort of polygonal shape and
let<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.110> constant<00:04:39.590> velocity<00:04:39.850> setting<00:04:40.850> round

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
let the constant velocity setting round

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.880 
let the constant velocity setting round
them<00:04:41.240> off<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:42.740> can<00:04:42.860> see<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.220> kind<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.580> hairy

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
them off you can see the kind of hairy

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.500 
them off you can see the kind of hairy
bottom<00:04:45.890> edge<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.340> these<00:04:46.460> parts<00:04:46.880> I'm<00:04:47.240> pretty

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
bottom edge of these parts I'm pretty

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.150 
bottom edge of these parts I'm pretty
pleased<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.290> machine<00:04:48.590> didn't<00:04:48.860> cut<00:04:49.040> its

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
pleased that the machine didn't cut its

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.950 
pleased that the machine didn't cut its
own<00:04:49.310> bed<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.610> mean<00:04:49.910> it's<00:04:50.030> pretty<00:04:50.480> accurately

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
own bed I mean it's pretty accurately

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.510 
own bed I mean it's pretty accurately
said<00:04:51.320> we<00:04:51.530> didn't<00:04:51.770> seem<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:51.950> lose<00:04:52.070> an<00:04:52.220> easy

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
said we didn't seem to lose an easy

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.730 
said we didn't seem to lose an easy
steps<00:04:52.880> but<00:04:53.780> I'll<00:04:53.870> need<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.080> think<00:04:54.260> about<00:04:54.440> how

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
steps but I'll need to think about how

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.310 
steps but I'll need to think about how
to<00:04:54.770> treat<00:04:55.100> this<00:04:55.340> have<00:04:56.150> one<00:04:56.360> idea<00:04:56.510> it's<00:04:57.110> pretty

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
to treat this have one idea it's pretty

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.440 
to treat this have one idea it's pretty
obvious<00:04:57.680> but<00:04:57.710> I'll<00:04:57.950> come<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.250> later

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
obvious but I'll come to that later

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.520 
obvious but I'll come to that later
these<00:04:59.450> two<00:04:59.630> side<00:04:59.840> pieces<00:05:00.020> came<00:05:00.380> out

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
these two side pieces came out

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.280 
these two side pieces came out
beautifully<00:05:00.950> they're<00:05:01.160> held<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:01.490> well<00:05:02.290> and

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
beautifully they're held in well and

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.550 
beautifully they're held in well and
that<00:05:03.440> pretty<00:05:03.740> much<00:05:03.890> completes<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.820> whole

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
that pretty much completes the whole

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.440 
that pretty much completes the whole
machine<00:05:06.560> I'm<00:05:07.250> gonna<00:05:07.370> sneak<00:05:07.730> back<00:05:07.970> out<00:05:08.180> here

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
machine I'm gonna sneak back out here

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.240 
machine I'm gonna sneak back out here

sorry about the shaky cam footage in the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.920 
sorry about the shaky cam footage in the

of<00:05:12.020> this<00:05:12.170> but<00:05:12.380> I'm<00:05:12.470> just<00:05:12.560> trying<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.860> get<00:05:12.950> all

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
of this but I'm just trying to get all

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.220 
of this but I'm just trying to get all
these<00:05:13.160> things<00:05:13.400> in<00:05:13.520> one<00:05:13.670> place<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.900> when<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.050> go

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
these things in one place so when I go

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.600 
these things in one place so when I go
back<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.440> programming<00:05:16.160> I'll<00:05:16.280> be<00:05:16.400> in<00:05:16.490> good

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
back to programming I'll be in good

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.330 
back to programming I'll be in good
shape<00:05:17.110> all<00:05:18.110> right<00:05:18.230> so<00:05:18.410> as<00:05:18.500> far<00:05:18.680> as<00:05:18.740> these<00:05:19.010> these

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
shape all right so as far as these these

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.640 
shape all right so as far as these these
pieces<00:05:20.300> that<00:05:20.660> they<00:05:20.840> have<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.020> lot<00:05:21.260> of<00:05:21.290> this<00:05:21.500> kind

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
pieces that they have a lot of this kind

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.680 
pieces that they have a lot of this kind
of<00:05:21.800> chewed<00:05:22.040> up<00:05:22.190> bottom<00:05:22.580> edge<00:05:22.700> and<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:23.090> guess<00:05:23.390> I

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
of chewed up bottom edge and I guess I

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.950 
of chewed up bottom edge and I guess I
could<00:05:24.440> plunge<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.130> machine<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.870> thousandth<00:05:26.870> or

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
could plunge the machine a thousandth or

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.220 
could plunge the machine a thousandth or
two<00:05:27.170> deeper<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:28.760> trim<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.030> off<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.690> could<00:05:30.110> also

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
two deeper to trim that off I could also

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.160 
two deeper to trim that off I could also
use<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.530> different<00:05:30.950> bit<00:05:31.720> but<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.810> know<00:05:32.900> the

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
use a different bit but you know the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.560 
use a different bit but you know the
right<00:05:33.320> thing<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.650> do<00:05:33.880> might<00:05:34.880> be<00:05:35.060> just<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.420> use

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
right thing to do might be just to use

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.590 
right thing to do might be just to use
some<00:05:35.780> sandpaper<00:05:36.520> like<00:05:37.520> this<00:05:37.730> is<00:05:37.880> 100<00:05:38.030> grit<00:05:39.010> and

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
some sandpaper like this is 100 grit and

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.980 
some sandpaper like this is 100 grit and
you<00:05:41.600> know<00:05:41.690> pass<00:05:42.110> like<00:05:42.470> that<00:05:43.690> see<00:05:44.690> if<00:05:44.780> I<00:05:44.840> can<00:05:44.930> get

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
you know pass like that see if I can get

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.570 
you know pass like that see if I can get
this<00:05:45.170> to<00:05:45.350> focus<00:05:45.710> now<00:05:46.330> gives<00:05:47.330> me<00:05:47.510> a<00:05:47.540> nice<00:05:47.810> clean

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
this to focus now gives me a nice clean

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.480 
this to focus now gives me a nice clean
edge<00:05:49.580> with<00:05:50.150> really<00:05:50.720> no<00:05:50.870> fuss<00:05:51.200> it<00:05:52.160> might<00:05:52.370> be

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
edge with really no fuss it might be

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.040 
edge with really no fuss it might be
better<00:05:52.700> for<00:05:52.820> me<00:05:53.030> just<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.300> ship<00:05:53.600> one<00:05:53.630> of<00:05:53.930> these

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
better for me just to ship one of these

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.910 
better for me just to ship one of these
with<00:05:54.290> each<00:05:54.410> kit<00:05:55.150> than<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.420> you<00:05:56.660> know<00:05:56.920> bother

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
with each kit than to you know bother

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.520 
with each kit than to you know bother
with<00:05:58.250> a<00:05:58.280> lot<00:05:58.580> of<00:05:58.960> extraneous<00:05:59.960> machine

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
with a lot of extraneous machine

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.900 
with a lot of extraneous machine
settings<00:06:00.800> or<00:06:01.070> trying<00:06:01.310> much<00:06:01.490> harder<00:06:01.520> on<00:06:01.880> that

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
settings or trying much harder on that

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.830 
settings or trying much harder on that
front<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:03.940> again<00:06:04.940> this<00:06:05.090> is<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.330> router<00:06:05.510> doing

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
front and again this is the router doing

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.040 
front and again this is the router doing
all<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.080> work<00:06:06.340> somewhere<00:06:07.340> along<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.730> job<00:06:08.050> my

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
all the work somewhere along the job my

all the work somewhere along the job my

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
kent cnc rush foot things started coming

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.000 
kent cnc rush foot things started coming
out<00:06:13.280> so<00:06:13.490> i'll<00:06:13.580> need<00:06:13.700> to<00:06:13.960> reglue<00:06:14.960> that<00:06:15.230> i<00:06:15.530> also

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
out so i'll need to reglue that i also

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.500 
out so i'll need to reglue that i also
heard<00:06:16.250> some<00:06:16.460> interesting<00:06:16.520> squealing<00:06:17.390> from

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
heard some interesting squealing from

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.260 
heard some interesting squealing from
the<00:06:17.600> z<00:06:18.020> axis<00:06:18.050> so<00:06:18.680> i'll<00:06:18.740> have<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:18.980> see<00:06:19.190> if<00:06:19.400> my

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
the z axis so i'll have to see if my

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.950 
the z axis so i'll have to see if my
thrust<00:06:20.690> bearings<00:06:21.080> are<00:06:21.260> okay<00:06:22.300> J<00:06:23.300> in<00:06:23.450> general

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
thrust bearings are okay J in general

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.660 
thrust bearings are okay J in general
I'll<00:06:24.230> kind<00:06:24.590> of<00:06:24.680> look<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:24.890> machine<00:06:25.280> over

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
I'll kind of look the machine over

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.440 
I'll kind of look the machine over
there's<00:06:26.540> some<00:06:26.750> slop<00:06:27.110> here<00:06:28.180> that's<00:06:29.180> probably

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
there's some slop here that's probably

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.110 
there's some slop here that's probably
probably<00:06:30.110> needs<00:06:30.350> to<00:06:30.500> be<00:06:30.590> taken<00:06:30.770> up<00:06:31.070> though<00:06:31.880> the

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
probably needs to be taken up though the

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.350 
probably needs to be taken up though the
gears<00:06:32.450> seem<00:06:32.690> to<00:06:32.810> be<00:06:32.900> holding<00:06:33.110> well<00:06:34.360> likewise

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
gears seem to be holding well likewise

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.610 
gears seem to be holding well likewise
here<00:06:36.520> again<00:06:37.520> some

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
here again some

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.340 
here again some
some<00:06:39.010> slop<00:06:39.280> but<00:06:39.550> not<00:06:39.669> terrible<00:06:40.350> certainly

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
some slop but not terrible certainly

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.110 
some slop but not terrible certainly
within<00:06:41.500> Machine<00:06:41.919> tolerance<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:43.540> overall

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
within Machine tolerance and overall

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.950 
within Machine tolerance and overall
z-axis<00:06:46.120> holding<00:06:46.780> strong<00:06:47.729> so<00:06:48.750> all<00:06:49.750> right

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
z-axis holding strong so all right

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.680 
z-axis holding strong so all right
anyway
