00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:56.240 
translate to in binary and how to
decrypt<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.039> Excel<00:01:35.489> water<00:01:38.179> let<00:01:39.179> me<00:01:39.300> talk

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.700 

you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:50.090 

you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.559 

pattern<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.340> mean<00:02:51.670> clicking<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.150> numbers

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
pattern that I mean clicking the numbers

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.080 
pattern that I mean clicking the numbers
in<00:02:52.750> isn't<00:02:53.530> gonna<00:02:53.650> be<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.730> only<00:02:56.069> possible

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
in isn't gonna be the only possible

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.400 
in isn't gonna be the only possible
pattern<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.360> border<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.900> you're<00:02:59.050> trying

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
pattern of the border that you're trying

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:07.530 
pattern of the border that you're trying
to<00:02:59.560> translate<00:03:00.120> from<00:03:04.050> XOR<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:06.270> readable<00:03:07.270> text

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
to translate from XOR to readable text

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.660 
to translate from XOR to readable text
so<00:03:08.230> that's<00:03:08.500> why<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.739> kind<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.100> why<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> said<00:03:09.520> only

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
so that's why I kind of why I said only

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.000 
so that's why I kind of why I said only
partially<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.110> one<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.620> that's<00:03:11.739> why

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
partially for that one so that's why

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.760 
partially for that one so that's why
I'll<00:03:12.430> say<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.090> I'm<00:03:13.209> only<00:03:13.440> partially<00:03:14.440> telling

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
I'll say that I'm only partially telling

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.600 
I'll say that I'm only partially telling
you<00:03:14.860> how<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.069> translate<00:03:15.459> XOR<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.270> encrypt<00:03:16.959> to

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
you how to translate XOR to encrypt to

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.699 
you how to translate XOR to encrypt to
understandable<00:03:18.610> text<00:03:18.940> because<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:20.110> you're

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
understandable text because it you're

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.110 
understandable text because it you're
gonna<00:03:20.860> be<00:03:21.070> changing<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.790> letters<00:03:22.090> around

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
gonna be changing the letters around

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.180 
gonna be changing the letters around
here<00:03:22.540> by<00:03:22.690> changing<00:03:22.930> binary<00:03:23.500> numbers<00:03:23.830> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
here by changing binary numbers and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.259 
here by changing binary numbers and
unless<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.300> know<00:03:25.450> binary<00:03:25.959> off<00:03:26.350> my<00:03:26.590> heart

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
unless you know binary off my heart

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.940 
unless you know binary off my heart
which<00:03:28.269> is<00:03:28.420> pretty<00:03:28.570> much<00:03:28.750> impossible<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.380> I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
which is pretty much impossible to I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.870 
which is pretty much impossible to I
think<00:03:30.370> then<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:32.470> could<00:03:32.920> just<00:03:33.190> lead<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> lot

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
think then this could just lead to a lot

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.460 
think then this could just lead to a lot
of<00:03:33.910> different<00:03:34.120> combinations<00:03:34.540> if<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:35.140> switch

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
of different combinations if I switch

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.860 
of different combinations if I switch
these<00:03:35.620> binary<00:03:36.130> numbers<00:03:36.370> around<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.690> get<00:03:37.840> a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
these binary numbers around to to get a

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.259 
these binary numbers around to to get a
part<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.739> or<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.190> translation<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.030> makes

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
part of that or a translation that makes

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.090 
part of that or a translation that makes
sense

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
sense

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.729 
sense
so<00:03:42.100> anyway<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:47.230> because<00:03:47.560> when<00:03:47.680> I

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
so anyway on this just because when I

00:03:47.739 --> 00:04:19.949 
so anyway on this just because when I
click<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.970> translate<00:03:49.390> this<00:03:49.540> word<00:03:49.810> password

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.340 

I<00:04:19.989> was<00:04:20.650> like<00:04:20.919> an<00:04:21.040> SDI<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.120> can<00:04:22.270> see<00:04:22.509> that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
I was like an SDI and you can see that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.930 
I was like an SDI and you can see that
that<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:27.570> strip<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.720> XOR<00:04:29.080> cryptid<00:04:29.940> text

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
that that this strip of XOR cryptid text

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.620 
that that this strip of XOR cryptid text
and<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:34.150> also<00:04:34.780> this<00:04:35.789> order<00:04:36.789> of<00:04:36.940> numbers<00:04:37.389> in

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
and and also this order of numbers in

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.860 
and and also this order of numbers in
binary<00:04:38.340> means<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.699> word<00:04:39.820> password<00:04:41.009> so<00:04:42.870> now

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
binary means the word password so now

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.060 
binary means the word password so now
I'm<00:04:43.990> going<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.199> be<00:04:44.289> showing<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.830> another

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
I'm going to be showing you another

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.529 
I'm going to be showing you another
example<00:04:47.789> I'm<00:04:48.789> just<00:04:48.940> showing<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.270> what<00:04:49.419> the

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
example I'm just showing you what the

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.600 
example I'm just showing you what the
word<00:04:49.690> hidden<00:04:50.110> means<00:04:50.320> in<00:04:50.620> binary<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.220> also

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
word hidden means in binary and also

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.590 
word hidden means in binary and also
like<00:04:51.820> so<00:04:51.940> long<00:04:52.090> approaching<00:04:52.740> type<00:04:54.360> I'm<00:04:55.360> gonna

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
like so long approaching type I'm gonna

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:06.290 
like so long approaching type I'm gonna
type<00:04:57.419> six<00:04:58.419> eight<00:04:59.039> six<00:05:00.039> nine<00:05:01.020> six<00:05:03.510> four<00:05:04.510> six

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
type six eight six nine six four six

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.860 
type six eight six nine six four six
four<00:05:07.300> six<00:05:07.900> five<00:05:08.560> six

four six five six

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.150 
four six five six
and<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.560> can<00:05:11.710> see<00:05:11.949> that<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:13.330> this<00:05:14.160> XOR

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
and you can see that the that this XOR

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.520 
and you can see that the that this XOR
encrypted<00:05:15.610> string<00:05:15.789> is<00:05:16.150> hidden<00:05:16.539> and<00:05:16.780> these

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
encrypted string is hidden and these

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.550 
encrypted string is hidden and these
letters<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:18.190> binary<00:05:18.460> means<00:05:18.880> hidden<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:20.530> you

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
letters and binary means hidden and you

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.339 
letters and binary means hidden and you
can<00:05:20.800> also<00:05:20.949> get<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.669> Unicode<00:05:22.210> meaning<00:05:22.810> feeling

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
can also get the Unicode meaning feeling

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.760 
can also get the Unicode meaning feeling
which<00:05:23.590> is<00:05:23.620> that<00:05:23.949> little<00:05:24.190> son<00:05:25.169> um<00:05:26.169> so<00:05:26.470> anyway

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
which is that little son um so anyway

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.520 
which is that little son um so anyway

with this trick and this is what's up to
one<00:05:35.949> nine<00:05:36.099> zero<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.940> I<00:05:37.330> am<00:05:37.690> signing<00:05:37.990> off<00:05:38.260> have

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
one nine zero and I am signing off have

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.120 
one nine zero and I am signing off have
a<00:05:38.949> nice<00:05:39.130> day<00:05:39.340> I'll<00:05:39.580> see<00:05:39.699> you<00:05:39.789> next<00:05:39.849> video
