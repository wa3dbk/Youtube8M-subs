as<00:00:25.050> much<00:00:25.199> as<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> ac-130<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> simple

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
as much as the ac-130 for the simple

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.060 
as much as the ac-130 for the simple
fact<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> gets<00:00:27.210> shot<00:00:27.480> down<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:28.529> lot<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
fact that it gets shot down a lot of the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
fact that it gets shot down a lot of the
times<00:00:29.310> immediately<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.689> ac-130<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
times immediately an ac-130 is just a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
times immediately an ac-130 is just a
little<00:00:31.800> harder<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.040> take<00:00:32.279> out<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
little harder to take out but for the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
little harder to take out but for the
fact<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:35.190> my

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
fact that you know I like to in my

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
fact that you know I like to in my
opinion<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.390> more<00:00:36.600> kills<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
opinion you can get more kills with the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
opinion you can get more kills with the
pave<00:00:37.469> low<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.820> know<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.090> out

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
pave low because you can you know go out

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.060 
pave low because you can you know go out
killing<00:00:39.629> people<00:00:39.899> while<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.620> pave<00:00:40.800> low<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
killing people while the pave low is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
killing people while the pave low is
killing<00:00:41.430> people<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> same<00:00:42.540> time

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
killing people you know at the same time

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.540 
killing people you know at the same time
so<00:00:43.110> that's<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> reason<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.040> use<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
so that's the reason I use it in a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
so that's the reason I use it in a
Reaper<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.329> my<00:00:45.510> opinion<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> best

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
Reaper to my in my opinion is the best

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.529 
Reaper to my in my opinion is the best
kill<00:00:46.469> streak<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> game<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.180> there's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
kill streak in a game you know there's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.240 
kill streak in a game you know there's
points<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.079> game<00:00:49.140> where<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.770> six

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
points in this game where I get six

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.819 
points in this game where I get six
seven<00:00:50.640> kills<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.510> each<00:00:51.750> each<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.320> my<00:00:52.410> Reapers

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
seven kills with each each of my Reapers

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.279 
seven kills with each each of my Reapers
I<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.239> feel<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.750> gets<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.230> more

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

I just feel like it gets a lot more
kills<00:00:55.710> consistently<00:00:56.520> than<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570

space not waiting for them to come to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660 
space not waiting for them to come to
you<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.409> my<00:01:13.530> first<00:01:13.710> tip<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.369> use<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you so you know my first tip is to use a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.420 
you so you know my first tip is to use a
submachine<00:01:15.299> gun<00:01:15.619> reason<00:01:16.619> being<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.250> your

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
submachine gun reason being is your

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
submachine gun reason being is your
faster<00:01:18.119> whether<00:01:18.540> you're<00:01:18.750> strafing<00:01:19.080> whether

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
faster whether you're strafing whether

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.660 
faster whether you're strafing whether
you're<00:01:19.740> walking<00:01:20.189> whether<00:01:20.369> you're<00:01:20.520> running

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you're walking whether you're running

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
you're walking whether you're running
you're<00:01:21.360> faster<00:01:21.810> all<00:01:21.960> around<00:01:22.259> using<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.890> than

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you're faster all around using this than

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
you're faster all around using this than
any<00:01:23.280> other<00:01:23.460> gun<00:01:23.640> plus<00:01:23.939> shotguns<00:01:24.420> obviously

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
any other gun plus shotguns obviously

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.890 
any other gun plus shotguns obviously
but<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.770> faster<00:01:26.040> than<00:01:26.070> any<00:01:26.250> other<00:01:26.460> gun<00:01:26.900> in

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
but you're faster than any other gun in

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.210 
but you're faster than any other gun in

is<00:01:32.040> absolutely<00:01:32.790> ridiculous<00:01:33.110> with<00:01:34.110> hip<00:01:34.290> fire

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
is absolutely ridiculous with hip fire

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.980 
is absolutely ridiculous with hip fire
and<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.909> probably<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> best<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.869> my

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and it's probably the best one in my

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
and it's probably the best one in my
opinion<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.549> after<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> PP<00:01:39.210> 90<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
opinion then then after the PP 90 you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
opinion then then after the PP 90 you
probably<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> p90<00:01:40.680> both<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.759> very

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
probably have the p90 both have very

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.539 
probably have the p90 both have very
high<00:01:42.030> rate<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> fire<00:01:42.450> which<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:42.930> another

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
high rate of fire which is another

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
high rate of fire which is another
suggestion<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.759> give<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.329> there's<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.869> bigger

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
mp5 and hip fire it's not bad but it's

i feel that way i don't like using

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.590 
i feel that way i don't like using
extreme<00:02:35.610> conditioning<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.450> don't

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
extreme conditioning because you don't

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.750 
extreme conditioning because you don't
have<00:02:36.720> unlimited<00:02:36.750> sprint<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.400> real<00:02:38.640> i

reload<00:02:39.300> time<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.050> slow<00:02:40.080> when<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> don't

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
reload time is so slow when you don't

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.199 
reload time is so slow when you don't
have<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.130> slight<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.580> hand<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.880> that's<00:02:42.060> what<00:02:42.180> i

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
have one slight of hand so that's what i

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.440

the<00:03:03.660> enemy<00:03:03.959> on<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.140> mini-map<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.800> somebody

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the enemy on the mini-map and somebody

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.260 
the enemy on the mini-map and somebody
else<00:03:05.220> goes<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.610> kills<00:03:05.730> them<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.209> you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
else goes and kills them you know you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.520 
else goes and kills them you know you
get<00:03:06.510> an<00:03:06.570> assist<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.320> do<00:03:07.440> have

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
get an assist for that so you do have

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.490 
get an assist for that so you do have
four<00:03:07.739> times<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.280> two<00:03:08.430> kills<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.500> that's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
four times that's two kills so that's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.840 
four times that's two kills so that's
another<00:03:10.709> reason<00:03:10.950> i<00:03:11.100> like<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.340> use<00:03:11.370> hardline

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
another reason i like to use hardline

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.260 
another reason i like to use hardline
and<00:03:12.500> steady<00:03:13.500> aim<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:13.980> great<00:03:14.520> because<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.120> know

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
and steady aim is great because you know

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.000 
and steady aim is great because you know
this<00:03:15.390> gun<00:03:15.600> already<00:03:15.810> has<00:03:16.140> great<00:03:16.380> hip<00:03:16.530> fire<00:03:16.739> but

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
this gun already has great hip fire but

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.470 
this gun already has great hip fire but
when<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.220> put<00:03:17.370> steady<00:03:17.610> aim<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.209> really

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
when you put steady aim on it you really

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.590 
when you put steady aim on it you really
don't<00:03:18.870> even<00:03:19.080> have<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.320> aim<00:03:19.880> pretty<00:03:20.880> much<00:03:21.120> for

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
don't even have to aim pretty much for

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600 
don't even have to aim pretty much for
you'll<00:03:21.930> see<00:03:22.110> in<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.290> video<00:03:22.470> how<00:03:23.100> far<00:03:23.400> i<00:03:23.430> get

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
kills with steady aim one it's pretty

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.300 
kills with steady aim one it's pretty
ridiculous<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.650> i<00:03:25.709> drop<00:03:25.950> them<00:03:26.100> pretty

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.790 
practicing that because it does take a
little<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.900> get<00:04:30.020> used<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.380> little<00:04:30.620> time<00:04:30.770> to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
little to get used to a little time to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800 
little to get used to a little time to
get<00:04:30.980> used<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.310> spraying<00:04:31.610> from<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.910> hip<00:04:32.090> but

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
get used to spraying from the hip but

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.970 
get used to spraying from the hip but
once<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.020> get<00:04:33.139> it<00:04:33.260> down<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.590> very<00:04:33.680> very

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
once you get it down is very very

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.650 
once you get it down is very very
effective<00:04:36.010> another<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:38.090> once<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.360> get<00:04:38.540> that

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
effective another so once you get that

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.420 
effective another so once you get that
down<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:39.139> spraying<00:04:39.530> from<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.830> hip<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.310> know

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
down the spraying from the hip you know

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.830 
down the spraying from the hip you know
then<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.669> can<00:04:40.850> pick<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.270> choose<00:04:41.360> when<00:04:41.690> you're

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
then you can pick and choose when you're

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.320 
then you can pick and choose when you're
going<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.020> run<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:43.430> see<00:04:43.639> here<00:04:43.850> I'm<00:04:43.970> doing<00:04:44.270> a

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
couple other things like drop shotting

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.560 
couple other things like drop shotting
you<00:04:46.460> always<00:04:46.669> want<00:04:46.850> when<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.150> see<00:04:47.300> an<00:04:47.360> enemy

like<00:04:47.600> I<00:04:47.780> did<00:04:47.960> there<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.200> always<00:04:48.380> want<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.620> go

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
like I did there you always want to go

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.129 
like I did there you always want to go
behind<00:04:48.860> cover<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.430> shoot<00:04:49.639> I<00:04:50.389> saw<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.050> was

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
behind cover and shoot I saw it was

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.420 
behind cover and shoot I saw it was
right<00:04:51.320> there<00:04:51.350> obviously<00:04:51.680> if<00:04:51.980> nothing's<00:04:52.310> there

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
right there obviously if nothing's there

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.129 
right there obviously if nothing's there
you<00:04:52.580> don't<00:04:52.669> have<00:04:52.820> no<00:04:52.970> cover<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:53.540> you<00:04:53.930> need<00:04:54.080> to

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
you don't have no cover so you need to

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.330 
you don't have no cover so you need to
figure<00:04:54.260> out<00:04:54.380> some<00:04:54.740> either<00:04:54.919> kill<00:04:55.220> him

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
figure out some either kill him

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.610 
figure out some either kill him
instantly<00:04:55.640> or<00:04:56.150> drop<00:04:56.690> shot<00:04:56.960> or<00:04:57.110> do<00:04:57.500> whatever

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
instantly or drop shot or do whatever

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.870 
instantly or drop shot or do whatever
but<00:04:58.010> there<00:04:58.160> was<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.310> truck<00:04:58.490> there<00:04:58.669> so<00:04:58.850> I

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
but there was a truck there so I

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.550 
but there was a truck there so I
immediately<00:04:59.150> jumped<00:04:59.570> behind<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.930> truck<00:05:00.110> and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
immediately jumped behind the truck and

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.560 
immediately jumped behind the truck and
I<00:05:00.770> kept<00:05:00.950> shooting<00:05:01.160> them<00:05:01.400> because<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.730> that<00:05:02.360> you

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
I kept shooting them because I that you

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.210 
I kept shooting them because I that you
know<00:05:02.690> what<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.200> does<00:05:03.230> is<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.650> gives<00:05:03.950> me<00:05:04.070> his

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
know what that does is it gives me his

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.310 
know what that does is it gives me his
whole<00:05:04.400> body<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.940> kill<00:05:05.150> where<00:05:05.750> he<00:05:05.840> can<00:05:05.990> only<00:05:06.080> hit

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
whole body to kill where he can only hit

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.890 
whole body to kill where he can only hit
the<00:05:06.470> top<00:05:06.650> part<00:05:06.980> of<00:05:07.070> my<00:05:07.160> body<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.000> have<00:05:08.450> a<00:05:08.510> much

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
the top part of my body so I have a much

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.480 
the top part of my body so I have a much
better<00:05:09.080> chance<00:05:09.200> of<00:05:09.620> killing<00:05:09.890> him<00:05:10.130> than<00:05:10.160> he<00:05:10.370> has

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
better chance of killing him than he has

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.280 
better chance of killing him than he has
killing<00:05:10.820> me<00:05:10.940> so<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:11.750> know<00:05:11.810> just<00:05:11.990> use<00:05:12.140> your

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
want to stick the close-quarter areas

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.610 
want to stick the close-quarter areas
which<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.510> know<00:05:20.630> most<00:05:20.780> of<00:05:20.960> this<00:05:21.080> map<00:05:21.290> is<00:05:21.320> I

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
which you know most of this map is I

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.870 
which you know most of this map is I
died<00:05:21.830> there<00:05:22.070> because<00:05:22.280> somebody<00:05:22.580> was<00:05:22.669> came

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
died there because somebody was came

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.270 
died there because somebody was came
behind<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.300> box<00:05:23.510> like<00:05:23.750> he<00:05:23.870> works<00:05:24.080> at<00:05:24.200> UPS<00:05:24.590> but

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
behind a box like he works at UPS but

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.200 
behind a box like he works at UPS but
I'm<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.550> want<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:25.760> stick<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.030> close

I'm you want to stick to close

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.850 
I'm you want to stick to close
cordilleras<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.020> that's<00:05:27.140> why<00:05:27.290> your<00:05:27.530> hipfire

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
cordilleras and that's why your hipfire

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.710 
cordilleras and that's why your hipfire
is<00:05:28.220> so<00:05:28.370> effective<00:05:28.669> because<00:05:29.000> if<00:05:29.450> you're<00:05:29.570> close

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
is so effective because if you're close

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.450 
is so effective because if you're close
to<00:05:29.780> enemy<00:05:30.260> you<00:05:30.500> know<00:05:30.590> nine<00:05:30.770> times<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.160> attend

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
to enemy you know nine times that attend

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.440 
to enemy you know nine times that attend
the<00:05:31.550> bullets<00:05:31.790> going<00:05:31.880> to<00:05:31.970> hit<00:05:32.120> them<00:05:32.240> if<00:05:32.330> your

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
the bullets going to hit them if your

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.230 
the bullets going to hit them if your
aim<00:05:32.600> is<00:05:32.630> good<00:05:32.930> so<00:05:33.830> just<00:05:34.100> try<00:05:34.280> that<00:05:34.310> like<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:35.180> said

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
aim is good so just try that like I said

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.610 
aim is good so just try that like I said
after<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:35.870> get<00:05:36.020> comfortable<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:36.440> the

after you get comfortable with the

after you get comfortable with the
hipfire<00:05:36.770> pick<00:05:37.220> and<00:05:37.370> choose<00:05:37.550> where<00:05:37.760> you<00:05:37.789> run

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
hipfire pick and choose where you run

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.150 
hipfire pick and choose where you run
and<00:05:38.960> just<00:05:39.169> just<00:05:39.380> move<00:05:39.560> around<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.919> map<00:05:39.979> you

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
and just just move around the map you

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.830 
and just just move around the map you
don't<00:05:40.400> need<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.669> sprint<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.210> go<00:05:41.539> buck<00:05:41.810> wild
