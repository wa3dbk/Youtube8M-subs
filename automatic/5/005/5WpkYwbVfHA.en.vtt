00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.429
 this video is about how to be 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.260
 tracking over into the ketchscher and over 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.799
 sms of the class zero so-called silence 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.480
 sms can suppress silent sms 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.440
 in the hot phase in ukraine from 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 maybe you have three months 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.770
 heard there was the demonstration 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.949
 forbidden 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.460
 and people who were there all a sms 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.230
 gets in there with the same content 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.219
 stood that the person as a subscriber 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.190
 a mass demonstration was recognized 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.680
 And it was just on the spot 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.829
 the people can of course be sent 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.809
 asked how it works and to do so 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.329
 a so-called imsi catcher used 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.579
 this is just a mobile radio mast 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 virtualized and a testament in the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.309
 Medium attack performed that is how 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 the wlan just that it was like the wifi 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.420
 roaming the client always connects 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.450
 with the access point the same 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.130
 best signal strength can offer 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.119
 Yes, such things are in practice 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.220
 used and has become a team of 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.540
 developers from the xda developer alongside 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.590
 thought about what you did against it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.350
 could do and they are now too 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.200
 There was a concert 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.700
 a database of open cell id where all 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.290
 mobile masts listed by providers 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.420
 are going to introduce the apps soon 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.979
 android in you catcher detector james 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.869
 keane wins simply compares 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.610
 location and then see if the cell 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.009
 So you're connected to the EU 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.990
 elena dialed time then looks 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 easy if the mast with the sea 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 is connected to one of the here 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.579
 Registered GPS position is when it is 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.880
 not the case is your cell phone in 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.469
 the flight mode offset because then 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.960
 can just assume that one of 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.390
 an attack is affected if you the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.150
 app opens from now as this surface 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.319
 here are the general information 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.359
 to your mobile phone as well 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.609
 the offer is and if he is a rider 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.319
 Next scrolls you can just count the 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:26.129
 just around the circumference are available and the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.200
 signal strength so dbm the damping then 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.510
 There's another database you're able to do 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.889
 just open cell id data 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.629
 we just have a browser 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.500
 that's what they are all about 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:42.359
 registered cells and then there are still 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.090
 So the map is right here on the top 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.560
 map you can just that this is it so to speak 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.549
 the thing you are doing in the browser 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.260
 you can see her 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.010
 individual stations click on them 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.230
 just look 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.379
 he has come to the quiet now 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.180
 sms that are sms with the so-called 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.030
 so-called sms of class zero 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.319
 be sent 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.579
 These sms will not be displayed 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.209
 and that's how it works 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.889
 motion profiles create the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.639
 works so that just these sms 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.859
 is sent 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:18.569
 you want to pick up your mobile phone sms 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.790
 worried next door world worries 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.470
 the mobile mast 1 gets the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.780
 cards and thereby arises 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.400
 Record just to this mobile radio mast 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.829
 and the authorities can per 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.459
 Judicial decision this data just 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.530
 pick up from the provider and you can 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.000
 in virtually any time around 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.939
 eat it and let it eat 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.009
 always a whole movement profile 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.489
 create or euro position too 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:46.470
 a certain time and the android 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.870
 catcher detector also supports 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.290
 blocking of these sms of the class 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.209
 0 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.799
 I'll show you every download 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.979
 can click on get up then you have the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:04.590
 releases and then getting is indeed the 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:07.259
 version the changes and here in the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.539
 latest version you can see sms detection 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:14.489
 class and it just becomes one 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:16.560
 respective message will be displayed 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.269
 on the risk because you me 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.840
 think it can be taken as not block 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.840
 without root rights 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.570
 I can do more but also moment 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.580
 not so in a row you're loading into the app 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.370
 down and install on the 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.110
 Handy flashes I grab in the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.040
 description good that was it already 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.040
 here too scared
