00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
took me about a I guess a week a week to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.720 
took me about a I guess a week a week to
completely<00:02:21.380> construct<00:02:21.950> just<00:02:22.430> because

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
completely construct just because

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.479 
completely construct just because
there's<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.239> lot<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.630> problems<00:02:24.170> with

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
there's a lot of problems with

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.289 
there's a lot of problems with
first-degree<00:02:26.590> lighting<00:02:27.590> problems<00:02:28.299> also

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
first-degree lighting problems also

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.479 
first-degree lighting problems also
there<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:30.110> lot<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.350> balance<00:02:30.920> issues<00:02:31.310> between

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
there is a lot of balance issues between

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.800 
there is a lot of balance issues between
the<00:02:31.700> weapons<00:02:32.000> originally<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.420> had<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.630> use<00:02:32.780> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the weapons originally I had to use the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.039 
the weapons originally I had to use the
flood<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.860> fuel<00:02:34.370> rod<00:02:34.780> because<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.900> was<00:02:35.989> a

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
flood of the fuel rod because I was a

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.930 
flood of the fuel rod because I was a
halo<00:02:36.230> reach<00:02:36.319> version<00:02:36.860> but<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.310> did<00:02:37.459> not<00:02:37.610> work

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
halo reach version but it did not work

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.789 
halo reach version but it did not work
in<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.299> because<00:02:38.750> they<00:02:39.230> would<00:02:39.380> be<00:02:39.500> spawned

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
in this because they would be spawned

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.440 
in this because they would be spawned
before<00:02:40.040> they<00:02:40.130> get<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> top<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.060> also<00:02:41.330> they

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
before they get to the top and also they

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.449 
before they get to the top and also they
created<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.810> lot<00:02:41.959> more<00:02:42.110> leg<00:02:42.349> than<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.830> sinner

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
created a lot more leg than the sinner

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.580 
created a lot more leg than the sinner
air<00:02:43.640> cannon<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.299> incinerator<00:02:45.230> cannon

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
air cannon and the incinerator cannon

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.710 
air cannon and the incinerator cannon
actually<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.069> reduce<00:02:46.310> lag<00:02:46.670> because<00:02:46.970> when

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
actually can reduce lag because when

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.000 
actually can reduce lag because when
it's<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.110> body<00:02:48.319> is<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> bodies<00:02:48.890> will

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
it's the body is the bodies will

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.559 
it's the body is the bodies will
actually<00:02:49.250> disintegrate<00:02:49.760> keeping<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.299> bodies

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
actually disintegrate keeping the bodies

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.930 
actually disintegrate keeping the bodies
