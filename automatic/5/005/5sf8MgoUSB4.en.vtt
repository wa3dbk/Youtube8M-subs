00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 friends today we will know more 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.930
 of a game that we liked a lot 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 llama nac is for playstation 4 and good 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.849
 I'm Luis, I said this is intermediate 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.849
 tv and without further ado we started 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.330
 friends the time we already owed them 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.730
 for a while the review of this game 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.980
 it's called nac which is for playstation 4 and 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.989
 when before we extended much more what 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.000
 What we can tell you is that I was born 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.610
 It is a character that was created 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.350
 artificially we are in a taste in 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.890
 which if there are humans but there are also 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.270
 goblins and there are different species of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.610
 people who live together but good 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.030
 nac is created by humans and is a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.269
 sort of let's say that robot that is 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.269
 formed by different jewels and each time 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.339
 that is approaching some jewels 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.170
 specials is growing to the point of 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.580
 become a being almost the size of 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.310
 a building in this sense has to 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.770
 find the secret behind these 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.990
 jewelry and be able to free humans from 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.450
 surely an evil elf that is 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.530
 looking to dominate the world out there 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.780
 even from a love story 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.640
 processed and thus one as if it were a 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.950
 perhaps animated film part 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.050
 more interesting is not a game that 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.210
 We can say that we recommend 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.950
 for gamers it 's more for players 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.530
 casual because you have infinity 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.030
 of lives you are not tied to time and the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.160
 truth is that there are few controls 2 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.410
 votes that you use normally and 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.900
 that in this way they can help you 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.640
 fulfill your missions there is a version of 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.950
 cooperative game of you have another 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.200
 character that does not make the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.450
 history concludes at the moment of which 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.220
 It's where you die if what you can 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.740
 help them to also fulfill all these 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.520
 missions as we have already mentioned is 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.710
 available for the platform 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.380
 playstation 4 and good surely 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.480

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.190
 we had delayed a bit in the review 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:33.160
