00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.260
 welcome back her design people are not for 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.330
 this new episode on borderlands 2 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.250
 this today we are going to find out how 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.859
 get endless keys for this chest 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 found on borderlands 2 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.960
 I tried it myself long ago 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.850
 at the beginning it is a very simple thing in the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.019
 sense however I went too late one 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 of the first days that boardman had left 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.279
 between a fact and a text file 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.500
 minimum script that is how many were saved 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.390
 keys you had and there all the people would have 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 wanted to change them easily 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 so what did the gearbox do 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 what any other would have done 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.800
 normal person has created a file that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.230
 it cannot be decrypted at least without 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 know how it can be beheaded only 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.629
 from the game I guess I am inside 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.730
 mark how many keys you have and after 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.780
 days of research I finally found 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.049
 in another video where finally 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.460
 someone found out where to do it 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.470
 in short, something that was quite obvious 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.240
 because it also aims to pasture mind that is 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.610
 take a rescue of the dl 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.540
 cracked borderlands where it had one 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.860
 key and or or even a Saturday of 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.299
 the one not trodden where it sees anyway 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.100
 a key but I have no keys not 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.270
 I could do it and find no silence 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.320
 because I am shooting you in the head 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.280
 however it is finding the place where 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.780
 place this file 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.740
 first find out which file is copper 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.360
 finally discovered and then discovered 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.189
 where to place it so let's go 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.049
 to see together how to do it 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.860
 as you see I had 0 keys if not 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.000
 you have seen we go to see them 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:53.840
 for glasses too expensive so we go out 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.450
 from boardman we go out if we can 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.880
 totally and we will have this file yes 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
 call profile that I will link to here 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.470
 description that we will have to go to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:14.060
 never replace documents in documents 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.990
 games borderlands 2 9 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.690
 willow game 6 date and time which of the two 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.959
 my profile but I think it is indifferent 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.700
 let's try this this now 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.690
 file tenetevelo good that is you can do 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.750
 this procedure every time 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.450
 so then you want to try beck 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.590
 appears to be stuff maybe we copy e 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.800
 we paste here so we take profile 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.840
 and we replace it within this one 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:50.050
 post on smears ok 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.540
 we are to restart boardland we go to 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.580
 discover or wait first of all 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.870
 I made a big shit because he now has 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.970
 done so then you have to download the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.910
 file therefore not convenient agreed 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.049
 they copied where but games borderlands 2 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.340

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.340
 we paste on the desktop 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.870
 ok let's get back to what this does not want 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:22.049
 break the balls 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:22.049
 then balance bye baby plays 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:37.000
 let's discover this together 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:38.890
 idiot song so far ok 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.720
 come back maybe a little too high for now 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.170
 so they lower it wait are 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.170
 two backgrounds 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.000
 here we are therefore in the alternative two 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.599
 gentlemen gentlemen so let's go and see 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.400
