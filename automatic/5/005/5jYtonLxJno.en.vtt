00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
click on join game right now it is just

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.010 
click on join game right now it is just
the<00:00:31.830> typical<00:00:32.070> Blizzard<00:00:32.610> maps<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.750> will

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the typical Blizzard maps but this will

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.709 
the typical Blizzard maps but this will
be<00:00:34.500> where<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> custom<00:00:35.489> maps<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.940> located<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
be where the custom maps are located and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.540 
be where the custom maps are located and
people<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.380> actually<00:00:37.500> publish<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
people can actually publish them and I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
people can actually publish them and I
guess<00:00:39.480> they<00:00:39.629> will<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> battlenet

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
guess they will go on to the battlenet

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
guess they will go on to the battlenet
servers<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> people<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.969> select<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
servers and people can just select the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
servers and people can just select the
map<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.840> start<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> game<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.340> map<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
