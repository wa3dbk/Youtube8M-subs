Baker's<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:17.180> was<00:02:17.660> worried<00:02:17.900> about<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.230> acrylic

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
Baker's I was worried about the acrylic

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.940 
Baker's I was worried about the acrylic
powder<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.620> anything<00:02:21.799> about

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
powder and if you know anything about

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.759 
powder and if you know anything about
anatomy<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.640> physiology<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:23.450> your<00:02:23.629> body<00:02:23.840> is

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
anatomy and physiology of your body is

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.860 
anatomy and physiology of your body is
that<00:02:24.950> your<00:02:25.190> nose<00:02:25.459> has<00:02:25.880> hair<00:02:26.299> on<00:02:26.329> it<00:02:26.600> for<00:02:26.840> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
that your nose has hair on it for a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.550 
that your nose has hair on it for a
reason

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
reason

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.740 
reason
and<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.190> reason<00:02:28.579> is<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.730> filter<00:02:29.120> out<00:02:29.389> anything

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
and the reason is to filter out anything

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.729 
and the reason is to filter out anything
on<00:02:30.139> the<00:02:30.319> point<00:02:30.709> 100<00:02:31.069> microns<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.739> problem

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
on the point 100 microns and the problem

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.129 
on the point 100 microns and the problem
when<00:02:34.069> you're<00:02:34.220> doing<00:02:34.549> this<00:02:34.730> acrylic<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.900> that

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
when you're doing this acrylic is that

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.059 
when you're doing this acrylic is that
acrylic<00:02:36.500> dust<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.420> half<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.450> size<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.560> it

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
acrylic dust is half that size and it

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.300 
acrylic dust is half that size and it
can't<00:02:40.370> be<00:02:40.579> filtered<00:02:41.090> out<00:02:41.239> by<00:02:41.329> your<00:02:41.810> nose<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:43.280> I

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
can't be filtered out by your nose so I

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.180 
can't be filtered out by your nose so I
love<00:02:43.880> these<00:02:44.569> type<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.930> machines<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.130> these

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
love these type of machines and these

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.430 
love these type of machines and these
type<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.459> systems<00:02:46.819> because<00:02:47.389> if<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.230> takes

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
type of systems because if it takes

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.800 
type of systems because if it takes
eighty<00:02:48.859> percent<00:02:49.519> out<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:50.030> air<00:02:50.299> it's

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
eighty percent out of the air it's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.839 
eighty percent out of the air it's
eighty<00:02:51.079> percent<00:02:51.560> less<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:52.069> goes<00:02:52.250> into<00:02:52.700> your

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
eighty percent less that goes into your

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.910 
eighty percent less that goes into your
lungs
