00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:07.130
 well let's go to teach as I told you 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.800
 to see how many pairs need 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.139
 the work that we are going to use this work 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.910
 It is made of half a point or canvas 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.510
 braids canvas braids and foot yo 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 always when I start a job 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.490
 What I do is 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.529
 and start at a point for example like this 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.970
 and tell but today we are going to tell about another 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.950
 way and we'll see each foot 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.989
 You can enter the pairs you need or the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.000
 I want you because there are 300 ways to 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.730
 do the foot different but good we go 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.280
 to follow the lines of this graph is 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:51.210
 a couple two liabilities 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:55.050
 3 a guide 4 5 6 and 7 we have 7 pairs in 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.610
 the foot and now we start counting 7 2 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:05.399
 more than braid 92 plus braid 11 13 15 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.500
 17 here the lines are thinner less 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:13.530
 marked with which is not a braid 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:20.210
 is a single pair then 19 20 21 22 23 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:26.760
 24 25 26 and 27 we go back to the braids 29 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:33.000
 31 33 35 37 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.980
 the guide here 38 39 40 the liabilities 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 this is a braid that is more marked 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.740
 42 and this 43 this would be 43 pairs we're going to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.900
 others 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.480
 this fan 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.940
 Well, exactly the same, always in 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.950
 straight line and if we are not going to do so 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.750
 which is easier and we will understand 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.060
 better how do you see this photocopy load 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.909
 it's very bad then we would start in the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:07.340
 foot five pairs of agreement 5 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:09.729
 one that goes out 6 7 8 9 and 10 11 12 13 14 15 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:18.970
 16 17 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:27.099
 this 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.880
 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 and 38 this would be 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.710
 38 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.190
 I'll put 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:40.640
 this is exactly the same then here 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:52.790
 two pairs the end and the guide 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:58.400
 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:01.850
 21 and 22 would be 22 pairs 44 let's put 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.860
 this in these two ways of doing it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.300
 corner or diagonal 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.590
 I always just when a handkerchief 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.210
 take the corner because if you give 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.660
 account here we are working to the canvas 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.990
 half a point and more or less then we go 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.990
 to the corner 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.600
 this would be like foot 57 does not matter 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.370
 let's make him the king counted without the 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.940
 foot because in the foot you can put the 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.210
 wall you want then it would be 1 2 3 4 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.750
 5 6 7 8 8 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.900
 braid 9 and 10 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.379
 11 is 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:49.430
 we left it because it would be here 12 13 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:50.930
 14 15 16 17 and 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 y 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.659
 this we are going to do to braids because 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:01.790
 these are 30 25 27 is that is the guide 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:08.140
 29 31 33 another braid 35 and here they would be 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.140
 two passives 37 the guide 38 and the edge 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.190
 let's put exactly the same 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.450
 we're going to do it anyway we can do it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.450
 so for the line that puts it here you see and 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.340
 we started counting 1 2 3 which is more 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:32.750
 difficult let's do it like I do 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:40.750
 always 1 and 2 3 4 5 and 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:50.960
 13 most marked line 2 15 16 17 18 19 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:56.720
 20 21 22 and 2 24 24 25 26 27 28 and 29 30 and 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:01.790
 31 32 33 34 and this goes in braids 36 38 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.689
 40 42 44 couples puts it here you see it 44 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.540
 couple 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:08.920
 other 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:13.450
 I'm so it's super easy diagonal 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:19.990
 and we started counting the pairs 1 2 3 4 5 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:29.820
 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20 22 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:33.190
 24 26 27 and 28 the fat 29 30 31 32 34 36 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:42.080
 37 that is not signaled with is here 38 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:47.810
 39 40 41 the fat 42 43 44 45 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.810
 46 47 48 and 49 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.389
 this 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.240
 more or less more complicated but we are going to 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.969
 why I'm going to catch let's see what 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:08.029
 lame line this one 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:15.319
 so we started counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:19.780
 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:23.270
 21 22 23 24 25 25 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.800
 25 the one who comes here 26 here that we can 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.220
 put here what really 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.760
 we want I can we are going to put 7 25 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:45.290
 and 7 32 this one that comes out here 33 others 7 40 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:48.170
 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 and 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.940
 here the ones that we want 7 the ones that go 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.730
 going in here we go like this more or less 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.950
 They are 7 and exactly the same 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.680
 we counted these we left them and we put 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.810
 this is from here that's 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.600
 and now I'm going to teach you 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.520
 to know how many pairs we should have 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.800
 put here is more studies 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.800
 imagine that this wool is century 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:18.320
 so what then we would do 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.320
 we would be to take a few threads 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.720
 imagine that these are each guide 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.979
 of threads are a pair of bobbins 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.180
 we would have to take the thread that 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:35.639
 we want to do the work and put it 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:38.580
 if we want it yes yes 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:40.550
 exactly with hemstitches and so on 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.900
 we would do 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.900
 we would evaluate the thread we need
