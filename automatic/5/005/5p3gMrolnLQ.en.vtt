00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.910
 and cordially with Germany I am 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.530
 I have not yet because of football, club 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 asked me would a video 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.650
 interested in sports and what to do 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 train the best and most sensible 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 should maximum force for the legs at 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.039
 football hypertrophy or rather in the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.390
 endurance repetition numbers range 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.240
 water should make football 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 I generalize this question now 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.040
 simply and give my opinion 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.880
 sports-specific strength training 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.879
 I personally see no sense in it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 because when we do a strength training 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.180
 Let's say Monday monday 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 friday and we try ours there 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.360
 Body at five to eight repetitions 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.920
 five to ten repetitions depending on 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.780
 Season now, for example , yours 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.760
 The figure in the final in the play off 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.199
 For example, in the phase I go to the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.210
 mode does not mean that the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.100
 repetitions balance down 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.750
 simply to stimulate protein synthesis 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.020
 just to get the muscle 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.400
 assure reasonably depending 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 how much stress is naturally on the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.909
 have teeth and on the entire body 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 that's the way I have to, of course 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.450
 Whole adjust but the maximum force 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 area at the hypo-professional sector for 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 examples are very close to each other 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 which means you will not have one without 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.360
 but the other one really depends on me 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.770
 In addition, my sport will bring me 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.479
 to move with me 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.159
 yes I think football is there 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.600
 also some ladder trails where you can 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.680
 go through or jump over hurdles 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.540
 must or something 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.350
 that means my sport teaches me 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.329
 to move and to step in my power 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.180
 should be there as a supplement my 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.399
 my body more resistant 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.979
 stronger or stronger too 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.540
 get and accordingly should be 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.320
 not really great 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.939
 to change 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 It may well be that in the season 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.420
 the intensity as I said a bit 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.790
 must shut down muscle 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.700
 fail because otherwise maybe 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.909
 At some point the engine bursts when you're in 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.670
 training full throttle gives investors and im 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.210
 Sport on specific sports training and 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.680
 in force 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.240
 henning full throttle and maybe still 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.470
 a job he has physically exhausting 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.510
 then of course it does someday 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.760
 but then the month engine goes 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.380
 of course broken if you stay there too long 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.950
 I simply say red areas now 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.230
 and our sport teaches us 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.970
 the musculature we might have 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.030
 win the tax yes if we over yes 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.950
 food 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.440
 these musculature we are there 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.790
 possibly gain to move 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.920
 that means now let's just say 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.770
 as we assume the optimal case and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.800
 we take in 500 grams of muscle in 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.470
 a month which is a good cut 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.300
 Well a very positive case is then 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.860
 we have within four weeks 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.560
 For example, personally it would be so 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.480
 I 've been there in the meantime 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.280
 16 times training had now 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.590
 Nobody can tell me that the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 Musculature actually made you new 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.580
 if at all, if I have one 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.470
 have formed new musculature 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.780
 that's at the 16 times baseball 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.400
 training not immediately learns to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.650
 move and join the baseball 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.780
 adapt and adapt 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.610
 that would be the same for football 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.049
 or the basketball or the football 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.180
 or any other 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.000
 sports because we sport 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 we do specific training 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.840
 Do not just stop exercising again 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.519
 to exercise or just not listen 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.720
 to do weight training when I am 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.209
 think football is going to be that way 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.950
 be that in winter even if there 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.900
 maybe less training is though 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.910
 that you still have a two times the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.579
 week still in the hall is kicking 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.220
 that means you move there too 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.200
 Body learns the moves again when 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.110
 new musculature is added and how 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.530
 said there is so little or much 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.480
 Musculature to that one with the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.160
 security still this inter muscular 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.829
 coordination that means the legs have to 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.600
 eye and so on and everything immediately 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.730
 depending on course is sport 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.400
 but these movements become dependent 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.310
 naturally learned from the body and at 500 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.010
 Nobody can grasp my muscles 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.450
 that after one month or two 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.180
 months to call the muscles 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.910
 has built up that he becomes immobile 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.530
 So I would always do that 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.660
 training in the hypo trophy area if you 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.520
 To say it that way you argue yes 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.870
 until today where he is exactly I would 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.250
 always between five and ten 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.160
 repetitions remain 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.380
 our body increases in strength 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.830
 getting stronger and the 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.960
 to let the sport do the job for you 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.210
 we dlb now we take the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.550
 Football I have to go 90 minutes in one 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.380
 certain speed of course 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.000
 to be on the field that way 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.360
 means then endurance training 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.990
 so low intensity steady-state it is 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.080
 the typical round running or 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.180
 sprints break springs pause haiti also 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.700
 high intensity interval training though 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.100
 That's what you do during that 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.380
 football training already means that 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.130
 we are the sport and sport 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.620
 accordingly do that in the training 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.190
 what the body do in this sport 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.160
 should 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.289
 But weight training is one 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.300
 supplement the body stronger 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.570
 more powerful tougher 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.580
 and I would get in there 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.539
 keinster wise change anything that is 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.190
 no evidence now the clap traveler 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.310
 that is my personal opinion and 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:36.139
 also my personal experience 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.919
 god 31 16 years baseball and ten 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.830
 years 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.139
 By the way, no weight training was needed 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.760
 be made break and immovable 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.620
 you really did not become one either 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.270
 except with higher body weight that one 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.169
 just slowing down but that can be done 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.700
 also exercise 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.650
 that's a bit we're at baseball 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.530
 been on the back or I personally 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.960
 with the knee operations, etc 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.490
 that was a bit weak but will 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.180
 you can not be immobile and you have to 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.250
 no thoughts 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.590
 weight training the weight training and the 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.130
 Sport brings us to the body for 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.330
 to get the sport armed and 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.330
 to move the body there
