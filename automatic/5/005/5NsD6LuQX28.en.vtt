00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.410
 today we are going to demonstrate ganache 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.700
 here we already have the melted chocolate 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 it may be retained in the last where 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.040
 We have here in a water bath or in the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.759
 microwave 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.739
 only they are using caching it 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.739
 has 200 grams in each box 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.549
 now our bridge gear 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.319
 [Music] 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 our channel ready we'll take him 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.850
 to the refrigerator later before and I will show 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.700
 For you, some situations. 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.719
 we can make ganache a joker 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.079
 In the kitchen of the people we can do is 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:42.159
 use ganache for filling to 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:46.359
 truffle for coverage and also 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.500
 fillings we can taste what we 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.829
 I did that I made a folder where the wick 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.049
 right 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.450
 so if we make a plum paste 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.569
 or an apricot paste and then we can 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.119
 I'll mix it up a little here 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.750
 You see how I do then I 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:12.930
 I get a quantity that I go 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:17.820
 determine the folder 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:22.570
 and I'll mix well 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:27.040
 here we already have a wonderful filling 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:30.340
 to put on us in joy that can be 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.990
 classic american or non-cover 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.010
 people did not know just click 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.860
 wonderful filling our passing leaves 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.340
 that I did so I put half a pound 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.290
 longer locks in seed a cup of sugar 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.590
 and water to cover the mind 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.970
 I left it in the pressure cooker so she 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.959
 it started to sizzle 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.000
 I counted until 5 right only to snack 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.300
 I then went through the blender 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.170
 put in a pan and point and 1 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.220
 point is simple is not do not need to stay 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.260
 I cook long enough as 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.130
 I want point that I want I want only 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.270

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.150
 I'll show you now how it is that 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.390
 guard in the fridge, homage already done 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.190

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:32.769
 No problem, I'll put the paper 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:36.450
 film or I lean against it 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.920
 This is what this is for here. 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.840
 I did not want that shell when 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.140
 people put the brigadeiro in the refrigerator 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.110
 You can also do this. 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.790
 but I did not see that cone I put there 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.270
 Hot yet no problem 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.270
 I put it well I put another movie here 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.860
 It was in the fridge and tomorrow is perfect. 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.200

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.569
