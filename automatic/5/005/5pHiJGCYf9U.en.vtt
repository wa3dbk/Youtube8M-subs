slightly from the original note in order

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.050 
slightly from the original note in order
to<00:00:24.340> produce<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:25.150> correct<00:00:25.420> pitch<00:00:26.760> within<00:00:27.760> the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
to produce the correct pitch within the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.920 
to produce the correct pitch within the
the<00:00:28.449> music<00:00:28.810> itself<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:30.550> we're<00:00:31.119> talking<00:00:31.480> about

a sharp we are talking about taking a

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.100 
a sharp we are talking about taking a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
raising it a half step meaning that

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.860 
raising it a half step meaning that
you're<00:00:41.649> going<00:00:41.770> to<00:00:41.860> want<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.280> go<00:00:42.520> up<00:00:42.969> a<00:00:43.270> half

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
you're going to want to go up a half

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.750 
you're going to want to go up a half
step<00:00:43.930> from<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.770> note<00:00:44.920> that<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.190> start<00:00:45.579> on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
step from the note that you start on

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.110 
step from the note that you start on
when<00:00:46.660> we<00:00:46.750> talk<00:00:46.960> about<00:00:46.989> flatten<00:00:47.800> that<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.640> flat

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
when we talk about flatten that a flat

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.600 
when we talk about flatten that a flat
will<00:00:49.390> actually<00:00:49.809> lower<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.260> note<00:00:50.710> a<00:00:50.920> half<00:00:51.280> step

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
will actually lower a note a half step

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.299 
will actually lower a note a half step
now<00:00:52.030> here<00:00:52.480> let<00:00:52.600> me<00:00:52.840> take<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.469> second<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:53.980> show

okay<00:01:25.840> now<00:01:26.229> a<00:01:26.259> half<00:01:26.740> step<00:01:27.130> each<00:01:27.939> one<00:01:28.359> of<00:01:28.389> these

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
okay now a half step each one of these

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.309 
okay now a half step each one of these
is<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.859> half<00:01:30.189> step<00:01:30.389> now<00:01:31.389> if<00:01:31.569> I<00:01:31.659> go<00:01:31.689> another<00:01:32.049> half

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
is a half step now if I go another half

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.449 
is a half step now if I go another half
step<00:01:32.499> I've<00:01:32.889> now<00:01:33.099> moved<00:01:33.310> up<00:01:33.579> a<00:01:33.849> whole<00:01:34.779> step<00:01:35.459> so

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
step I've now moved up a whole step so

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.959 
step I've now moved up a whole step so
this<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:36.880> C<00:01:37.240> sharp<00:01:37.569> right<00:01:37.869> here<00:01:38.109> okay<00:01:38.950> now<00:01:39.639> if

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
this is C sharp right here okay now if

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.580 
this is C sharp right here okay now if
we<00:01:40.179> want<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.419> take<00:01:40.569> a<00:01:40.630> note<00:01:40.899> we<00:01:41.079> want<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.380> flat

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
we want to take a note we want to flat

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.709 
we want to take a note we want to flat
it<00:01:41.770> will<00:01:42.069> start<00:01:42.369> at<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.639> next<00:01:42.939> node<00:01:43.119> up<00:01:43.359> which

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
it will start at the next node up which

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.919 
it will start at the next node up which
this<00:01:43.989> note<00:01:44.200> here<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.469> d<00:01:44.789> okay<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:46.060> we<00:01:46.719> are

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
this note here is d okay and we are

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.779 
this note here is d okay and we are
going<00:01:47.139> to<00:01:47.259> go<00:01:47.499> down<00:01:47.709> a<00:01:47.739> half<00:01:48.009> step<00:01:48.069> so<00:01:48.520> this

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
going to go down a half step so this

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.949 
going to go down a half step so this
would<00:01:48.969> also<00:01:49.179> be<00:01:50.219> D<00:01:51.219> flat<00:01:51.639> they<00:01:52.239> are<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.779> same

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
would also be D flat they are the same

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.349 
would also be D flat they are the same
note<00:01:53.259> C<00:01:53.590> sharp<00:01:53.919> and<00:01:54.159> D<00:01:54.340> flat<00:01:54.609> will<00:01:54.880> end<00:01:55.179> up

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
note C sharp and D flat will end up

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.169 
note C sharp and D flat will end up
being<00:01:55.389> the<00:01:55.810> same<00:01:55.840> note<00:01:56.319> on<00:01:56.529> the<00:01:56.709> keyboard<00:01:57.179> now

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
being the same note on the keyboard now

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.269 
being the same note on the keyboard now
as<00:01:58.419> you<00:01:58.450> look<00:01:58.749> at<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.959> music<00:01:59.380> here<00:01:59.649> you're

what we just talked about this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.360 
what we just talked about this
symbol<00:02:13.320> here<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.650> looks<00:02:13.830> sort<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.220> a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
symbol here that looks sort of like a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.230 
symbol here that looks sort of like a
number<00:02:14.730> sign<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.200> sharp<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> sharp

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
number sign is a sharp that is a sharp

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
sharp and raised a half-step if we slide

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
sharp and raised a half-step if we slide
over<00:02:23.550> here<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:23.940> look<00:02:24.150> at<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.570> we<00:02:25.230> have

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
over here we look at this we have

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.040 
over here we look at this we have
another<00:02:25.650> sharp<00:02:25.980> here<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:27.480> note<00:02:27.660> next<00:02:27.930> to

another sharp here and the note next to
it<00:02:28.200> has<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.560> other<00:02:28.770> looking<00:02:29.160> symbol<00:02:29.520> here

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
it has this other looking symbol here

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.660 
it has this other looking symbol here
this<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> natural<00:02:31.410> symbol<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.010> shows<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
this is a natural symbol this shows that

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
we've now lowered it a half step once

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.300 
we've now lowered it a half step once
again<00:02:40.760> okay<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.960> what<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> flat<00:02:43.890> symbol

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
again okay now of what a flat symbol

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.670 
again okay now of what a flat symbol
looks<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:44.760> we've<00:02:45.000> got<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.450> down<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:45.990> this

looks like we've got one down here this
is<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> flat<00:02:47.190> symbol<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.700> kind<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.060> looks<00:02:48.330> like

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
is a flat symbol it kind of looks like

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.080 
is a flat symbol it kind of looks like
