00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.430
 well first of all we will 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.550
 We propose to the provincial government that the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.639
 new proposal that the executive made to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.309
 through the Ministry of Economy if 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.830
 well he had some issues that were 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.160
 very positive the truth is that still 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.560
 It remains insufficient since 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.289
 considers all the needs of the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.990
 workers of the provincial state said 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.090
 that some aspects are positive 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.650
 because clearly the impact on this 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.359
 new proposal the biggest impact of 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.760
 wage increases are the sectors 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.620
 lower are the sectors of lower 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.499
 salary the case the assistants of the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 education and health workers 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:45.959
 fundamentally nurses and also 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.429
 child workers and that's one is a 

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:49.530
 I suggest that we have been doing in 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.449
 each day in each day of struggle 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.899
 because also now the offer is in two 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.699
 quotas and not in three and this obviously 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.469
 this is a mathematical question is in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.029
 better conditions generates better 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.179
 conditions although we insist 

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:04.789
 in what he continues to do in a quota and 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.820
 because there is an increase in the wage bill 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.920
 this said the government that no 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.900
 he has done it there is an increase in mass 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.000
 salary and we understand that this should be 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.720
 increase more to make a proposal 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.100
 that is really is contemplating 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.830
 dimension of the needs of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.900
 workers 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.480
 but it has some aspects that are 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.340
 clearly negative in this proposal 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.340
 of salary increase are based two 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.960
 bonuses one that impacts according to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.660
 schedule regime so manner 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.070
 different and the other the auxiliaries of the 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.940
 education that is a bonus in 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.240
 black with which we go back to times of 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.370
 wage discussion that we had left 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.340
 behind that the provincial government itself 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.869
 I had left behind 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.570
 at the request of organizations 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.479
 unionists unfortunately those 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.069
 bonuses in black and us in 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.020
 that we disagree 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.060
 salary increase has to be 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 clearly white has to have the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.810
 contributions must have an impact on the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.880
 retired as it should be and the other 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.740
 aspect also very negative is that no 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.080
 you touch the basic as it's based on 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.610
 two bonuses is not retouched the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.860
 basic therefore does not affect 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.819
 bonuses like as lan as the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.280
 seniority and also by not touching the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.319
 basic discuss wages in 2015 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.750
 would mean discussing wages over 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.299
 of the year 2013 with which we 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.519
 puts far behind in that aspect nothing in the 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.190
 discussion why we say with 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.569
 much clarity that we consider the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.200
 proposal of the provincial government and 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.030
 we told the insufficient minister and he 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.370
 We raise the need for you to make a 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.340
 new proposal based on the aspects 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.470
 positive that I mentioned earlier 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.440
 previously and correcting the aspects 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.139
 negative of it and of course 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.090
 how does the economic situation and 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.099
 politics in our country 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 It is also essential to maintain the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.420
 premise that at least 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.489
 the parity is reopened every six months 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.440
 to discuss salary increases because 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.220
 the deterioration of the salary is still 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.220
 progressive day by day
