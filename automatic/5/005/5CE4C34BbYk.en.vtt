00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 the right to housing is a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.250
 fundamental element for the well-being 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.750
 human that the Brazilian constitution 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.510
 the maximum document governing our 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.279
 life in society defends and guarantees this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.800
 right to all persons 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.779
 historically throughout the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.189
 Brazilian society and in a special way 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.140
 here in the São Paulo capital 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.599
 this right has been disrespected 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 systematically by public managers 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.440
 today here in são paulo we laugh 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 the time when it concerns the right to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.980
 housing reaches absurd levels of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.710
 aggression by means of a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.750
 known as jail education agent 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.850
 indication or social cleansing is a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 set of urban measures 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.899
 The goal is to expel the most 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 poor in the region to give way to 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.550
 fruit population absurd transit 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.320
 that he faces in the capital every day is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.079
 in part result of construction 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 rampant building of high standard that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 makes a lot more vehicles 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 of a single square meter 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.640
 crowded public transportation is linked 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.979
 to the abusive flow of rents in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 central regions of the city the people of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.450
 lower purchasing power are required 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.090
 place to the periphery where the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770
 jobs every day 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.390
 one has to aim en masse in the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.750
 center of the city to be able to 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.969
 working in arid public spaces without 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 shadow without bathroom and nowhere 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.520
 to sit 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.100
 This is the most hygienic face to study. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.229
 gentrification that creates public spaces 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.390
 the teens exactly to avoid the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.939
 undesirable public in general 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.679
 street workers and youth 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.810
 low- income households that could use this 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.579
 space for the practice of sports or 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.799
 any other type of leisure the project 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.569
 journalistic made by me sabrina 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.689
 duran in partnership with the brazilian reporter 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.369
 aims to map this process to 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.200
 from the identification that has been 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.179
 held in the center of são paulo 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.250
 The premise is simple only when 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.259
 you know the real cause of a problem 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.549
 mechanism is that it is possible to 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.280
 solution against it 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.640
 an initiative as a series of 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.009
 depth reports on issues 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.489
 that are available for the whole 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.250
 citizens informed and to position 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.160
 in this sense is fundamental and is the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.470
 the central ingredient of a process of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.799
 public debate in cities is fundamental 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.889
 that we like not just to register 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.709
 this process of showing also of fire 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.720
 popular movements are 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.540
 organizing and making their 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.670
 resistance here in the city of são paulo 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.489
 unfortunately we are paulo that we want is 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.150
 a little distant so that it can be 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.970
 fulfilled 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.610
 it is necessary that you enter this 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.019
 discussion contribute to the project and 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.360
 help us to make these 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.280
 information becomes a 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.379
 instrument of resistance in the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.720
 people's hands because so others 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.790
 gentrification processes do not happen 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.540
 not only in the city of são paulo but in 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.540
 any Brazilian city
