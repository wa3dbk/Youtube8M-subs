 hands down by Italian women 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.860
 Europe must not give in to pressure 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.779
 of the united states in the picture 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.730
 for the free trade agreement for 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.340

 our products that we all eat 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.400
 days in the tables from the meats and 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.680
 Italian oil cheeses are 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.590
 a system that boasts a turnover of 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.020
 over 12 billion euros and for Italy 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.460
 this is fundamental given that the agro 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.580
 food represents the second 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.129
 Italian industrial sector is a 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.110
 international debate that 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.360
 has received tremendous pressure from the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.370
 American producers pushing for 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.280
 a total free market intention 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.140
 we will not allow this 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.420
 debate that is likely to take away from the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.729
 our country and especially to 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.760
 my region emilia romagna al veneto a 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.159
 heritage built up over many years 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 from the people who made it their life 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.330
 of their families 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.250
 welcome the exchange agreements and the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.420
 creation of a fritta e veria between 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.159
 europe and states 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.340
 but don't dare touch the system 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.870
 of the dop and the typical indications 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.990
 geographic would be a damage not only 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.550
 for consumers and producers but 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.520
 for our entire sector 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.260
 agribusiness and for the made in it and for 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.240
 we must understand each other better 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.380
 think that when we go to the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.990
 European Parliament 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.320
 we think we must defend Italian

 our country can not change the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.890
 passed in our consent 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.190
 I can try to improve ours
