00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it off yet I could claim shouldn't be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.880 
it off yet I could claim shouldn't be
doing<00:01:09.840> makeup<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.830> even

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
doing makeup right now because not even

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
doing makeup right now because not even
fully<00:01:11.250> developed<00:01:11.729> yet<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.689> possible

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
fully developed yet so it's possible

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
fully developed yet so it's possible
that<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.350> might<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.010> white<00:01:14.280> face<00:01:14.580> tomorrow

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that I might have a white face tomorrow

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
that I might have a white face tomorrow
and<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> tan<00:01:15.570> body<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.290> me<00:01:16.380> looking<00:01:16.650> at<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and a tan body and for me looking at a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.020 
and a tan body and for me looking at a
screen<00:01:17.070> I'm<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.490> sure<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:17.850> really

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
