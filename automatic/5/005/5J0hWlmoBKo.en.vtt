is on call duty ghosts which really

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.990 
is on call duty ghosts which really
threw<00:00:21.420> me<00:00:21.449> off<00:00:21.570> because<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.900> expected<00:00:22.380> more

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
threw me off because I expected more

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.340 
threw me off because I expected more
people<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.420> black<00:00:24.570> ops<00:00:24.750> 2<00:00:24.900> than<00:00:25.199> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
Titan it's a really casual game and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.870 
Titan it's a really casual game and
that's<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> route<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.640> took

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that's like the route that they took

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240 
that's like the route that they took
with<00:01:15.060> tight<00:01:15.210> fall<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.680> make<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> really

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
with tight fall it's to make it really

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
with tight fall it's to make it really
just<00:01:17.460> casual<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.170> fun

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
just casual and really just to have fun

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.510 
just casual and really just to have fun
um<00:01:20.689> unfortunately<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.290> game<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.979> getting

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
um unfortunately the game it's getting

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.770 
um unfortunately the game it's getting
kind<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.729> repetitive<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.390> me<00:01:24.479> even<00:01:24.600> though<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
kind of repetitive for me even though I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
kind of repetitive for me even though I
haven't<00:01:24.960> played<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> full<00:01:25.439> game<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.860> think

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
haven't played the full game I think

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.740 
haven't played the full game I think
it's<00:01:26.970> gonna<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.360> competitive

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it's gonna be really competitive

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's gonna be really competitive
repetitive<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> holding<00:01:30.000> off

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
repetitive and I'm kind of holding off

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.530 
repetitive and I'm kind of holding off

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
better is and to be honest there is some

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.330 
better is and to be honest there is some
truth<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.140> same<00:02:58.350> time<00:02:58.620> yeah

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
truth to that but at the same time yeah

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.370 
truth to that but at the same time yeah
I<00:02:59.580> think<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.360> only<00:03:00.510> thing<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:01.170> more

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
I think like the only thing that's more

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.070 
I think like the only thing that's more
valuable<00:03:01.590> than<00:03:02.430> money<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:03.420> probably<00:03:03.630> like

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
valuable than money it's probably like

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.070 
valuable than money it's probably like
it's<00:03:04.290> time<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.450> because<00:03:06.450> time<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.810> something

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's time and because time is something

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.720 
it's time and because time is something
you<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.350> can't<00:03:07.650> replace<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.580> can

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
you just can't replace like you can

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.400 
you just can't replace like you can
spend<00:03:09.000> money<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.450> get<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.780> money<00:03:09.989> back<00:03:10.230> when

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
