 [Music] 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.860

 [Music]

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 yes 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.629
 [Music] 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.789
 [Music] 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.980
 Y 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.260
 in the style but if after a ballad of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.480
 frank 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.469
 not have so politician sound the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.399
 clock in the mix rather works in 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:03.089
 the box to sound the recording and 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.089
 then the mixture 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:26.459
 [Music] 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.689

 [Music] 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.420
 the gummies 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.610
 [Music] 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
 A) Yes 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.400
 according to the attitude 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.890
 d 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.590
 doing such spring 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.769
 to him 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.590
 the truth 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.200
 and you'll see that to impersonate instead of 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.690
 put the toilet paper 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.690
 [Music] 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.350
 and 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.380
 I'm going to put on it can be super rich 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.970
 idea is that there never be harmonics or 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.620
 always the case is always me 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.960
 annoying when there is the sound of 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:53.280
 ropes 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:53.280
 [Music] 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.500
 in the face 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.160
 [Music] 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.500

 [Music] 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.049
 plus 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.049
 [Music] 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:36.900

 [Music] 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:03.559
 perhaps 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:03.559
 [Music] 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:12.669
 some people that we always start by 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:16.080
 as serious as 14 inches as the sound 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.080
 more serious that can give the tone 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.499
 14 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.909
 do not 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.750
 [Music] 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.750

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.139
 [Music] 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.420
 a risk of this type is not worth 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.339
 sound peaks and nationals 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.339
 [Music] 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:58.949
 of fourth as the congas 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.610
 ah 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:41.569
 [Music] 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.229
 for 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.720
 of s 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:11.839
 to tune and detune 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:11.839

 [Music] 

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:55.270
 the screws below 2 always tend 

00:07:52.670 --> 00:08:06.760
 loosen up so much to click
