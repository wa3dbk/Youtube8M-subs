lineside computer workstation where
you're<00:01:15.090> entering<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.570> data<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.080> an<00:01:16.200> infrequent

you're entering in data on an infrequent

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.120 
you're entering in data on an infrequent
basis<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:18.330> reason<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.350> number<00:01:19.950> one

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
basis the reason for that is number one

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
basis the reason for that is number one
it's<00:01:20.430> cheap<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> gets<00:01:22.170> dirty<00:01:22.409> or

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it's cheap and so if it gets dirty or

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.330 
it's cheap and so if it gets dirty or
damaged<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.729> very<00:01:24.000> very<00:01:24.270> easy<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.900> replace

damaged it's very very easy to replace
the<00:01:26.340> other<00:01:26.490> thing<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.090> corded<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.990> it's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the other thing is it's corded so it's

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.039 
the other thing is it's corded so it's
less<00:01:28.380> likely<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.799> walk<00:01:29.670> away<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> the

similar in shape and concept to this the

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.969 
similar in shape and concept to this the

neutral position like the handshake

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.020 
neutral position like the handshake
position<00:04:01.199> the<00:04:01.739> shoulder<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.579> elbow<00:04:02.609> and

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
position the shoulder and the elbow and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.539 
position the shoulder and the elbow and
the<00:04:03.150> wrist<00:04:03.180> are<00:04:03.510> all<00:04:03.690> neutral<00:04:04.319> there<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.310> no

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
the wrist are all neutral there is no

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.490 
the wrist are all neutral there is no
contact<00:04:06.540> stress<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.019> underside<00:04:07.379> of<00:04:07.409> the

contact stress on the underside of the
