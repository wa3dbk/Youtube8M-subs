then<00:00:06.830> what<00:00:06.950> would<00:00:07.099> we<00:00:07.220> put<00:00:07.399> in<00:00:07.550> it<00:00:07.700> well<00:00:07.880> we

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
then what would we put in it well we

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.850 
then what would we put in it well we
probably<00:00:08.269> put<00:00:08.599> the<00:00:09.019> fire<00:00:09.290> blade<00:00:09.560> in<00:00:09.740> it

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
probably put the fire blade in it

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.360 
probably put the fire blade in it
wouldn't<00:00:10.070> we

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
wouldn't we

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.920 
wouldn't we
well<00:00:10.760> always<00:00:10.970> remember<00:00:11.210> that<00:00:11.240> name<00:00:11.540> the<00:00:11.720> blade

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
well always remember that name the blade

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.509 
well always remember that name the blade
even<00:00:12.110> if<00:00:12.260> they<00:00:12.410> never<00:00:12.590> make<00:00:12.860> another<00:00:13.190> one

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
even if they never make another one

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.490 
even if they never make another one
as<00:00:14.059> far<00:00:14.240> as<00:00:14.269> Yamaha<00:00:14.750> goes<00:00:15.019> then<00:00:15.290> it<00:00:15.380> would

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
as far as Yamaha goes then it would

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.130 
as far as Yamaha goes then it would
probably<00:00:15.680> be<00:00:16.099> their<00:00:16.580> top<00:00:16.849> sports<00:00:17.150> bike<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:17.599> r1

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
probably be their top sports bike the r1

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.130 
probably be their top sports bike the r1

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
what then about Suzuki well perhaps the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.040

Kawasaki well if you think back to the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.609 
Kawasaki well if you think back to the
70s<00:00:29.300> it'd<00:00:29.449> be<00:00:29.569> something<00:00:29.779> like<00:00:29.929> the<00:00:30.230> old<00:00:30.259> Zed

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619
