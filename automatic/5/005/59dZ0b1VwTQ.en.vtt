00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello today we will meet you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.250
 the two most famous Australian 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.860
 animals this kangaroo and emu this couple 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.520
 in australia so honored that even 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.400
 depicted on the emblem of this country 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.619
 let's take a closer look at them 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.099
 our first hero is a red kangaroo 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.590
 a bit like a huge mouse from a distance 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.980
 but as soon as we take a better look 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 see that kangaroo hind legs are much 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.950
 longer than the front front 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 paws he uses for his jumps 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 kangaroo will not be able to jump 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.219
 raising his tail and he must rest the earth 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 upholding the balance of australia is 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 where to run and jump 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.649
 so the kangaroo can run up to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 a good speed of 60 kilometers per hour and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.280
 on the move to jump even three-meter 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.150
 barrier these animals eat grass and leaves 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 and may sometimes long for several months 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:13.260
 dispense with water kangaroos refer to 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.200
 to marsupial animals what does it mean this 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.530
 means that mother-kangaroo on the stomach is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.460
 special bag that puts the baby 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.509
 kangaroo 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.960
 there he is sleeping growing and gaining strength 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.689
 when kangaroo grows up he starts 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.180
 go out of my mother's bag for a walk 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.590
 but at the slightest danger hides 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.259
 back cute loving kangaroo at times 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.770

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.100

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.640
