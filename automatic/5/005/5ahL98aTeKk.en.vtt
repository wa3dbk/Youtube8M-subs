00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.630
 You will not see the little bitch because she's 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.570
 underground and how it was possible 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.110

 they take the plane flew over the place they 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.479
 they want to see and emit a laser and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.090
 elect can overcome these sheets 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.420
 of the trees reaches the ground and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.970
 plane also analyzes the reflected and form 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.880
 a 3D map of the local business that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.219
 pass over 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.280
