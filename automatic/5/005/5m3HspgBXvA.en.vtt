shouldn't have won this race but because

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.140 
shouldn't have won this race but because
of<00:03:11.620> how<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.860> AI<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.220> programmed<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.790> ended<00:03:13.090> up

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
of how the AI is programmed I ended up

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.270 
of how the AI is programmed I ended up
winning<00:03:13.420> anyways<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.320> might<00:03:14.710> also<00:03:14.890> be<00:03:15.130> worth
