hi I'm Kendall Richard from Pleasant
Valley<00:00:04.230> iris<00:00:04.740> farm<00:00:05.330> today<00:00:06.330> I'm<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:07.080> to

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
Valley iris farm today I'm going to

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.870 
Valley iris farm today I'm going to
teach<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:08.250> how<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:09.260> dig<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.639> irises<00:00:11.639> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
teach you about how to dig up irises and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.900 
teach you about how to dig up irises and
separate<00:00:12.480> them<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.990> proper<00:00:13.259> way<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
separate them the proper way I the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.060 
separate them the proper way I the
reason<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.360> dig<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.660> irises<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.379> separate

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
reason you dig up irises and separate

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.370 
reason you dig up irises and separate
them<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:18.210> after<00:00:18.960> several<00:00:19.350> years

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
them is because after several years

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.980 
them is because after several years
usually<00:00:19.890> three<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.400> four<00:00:20.640> years<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.510> irises

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
usually three or four years the irises

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
usually three or four years the irises
get<00:00:22.199> very<00:00:22.410> compact<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:24.269> don't<00:00:24.359> have

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
get very compact and they don't have

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320 
get very compact and they don't have
anywhere<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> grow<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:27.060> stopped

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
anywhere to grow so they stopped

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.689 
anywhere to grow so they stopped
blooming<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:28.529> nicely<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.490> normally

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
blooming as nicely as they normally

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
blooming as nicely as they normally
would<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.960> dig<00:00:31.560> them<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.769> separate<00:00:32.309> them

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
would so you dig them up separate them

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
would so you dig them up separate them
you<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> lot<00:00:33.000> more<00:00:33.149> plants<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.899> give<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you have a lot more plants to give to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.639 
you have a lot more plants to give to
friends<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:35.040> put<00:00:35.489> around<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.820> garden<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
friends or put around your garden and

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.549 
friends or put around your garden and
then<00:00:37.649> they'll<00:00:37.890> bloom<00:00:38.100> much<00:00:38.370> nicer<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
then they'll bloom much nicer for you

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
then they'll bloom much nicer for you
the<00:00:40.559> first<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.020> first<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the first thing that you do is first of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.880 
the first thing that you do is first of
all<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.559> reason<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> time<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.890> dig

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
all the reason or the time that you dig

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.119 
all the reason or the time that you dig
up<00:00:47.010> irises<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.030> usually<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.960> August<00:00:49.710> because

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
up irises is usually in August because

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.650 
up irises is usually in August because
the<00:00:50.250> plants<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.820> semi<00:00:51.329> dormant<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.530> time

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
the plants are semi dormant at that time

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
the plants are semi dormant at that time
when<00:00:54.660> there's<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.170> dormant<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:55.770> look

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
when there's some my dormant they look

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.330 
when there's some my dormant they look
not<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:58.050> nice<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
not as as nice as they do in the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.700 
not as as nice as they do in the
springtime<00:00:59.930> there's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> lot<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> dead<00:01:01.500> leaves

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
springtime there's a lot of dead leaves

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.619 
springtime there's a lot of dead leaves
and<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.160> sort<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> thing<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> first

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and that sort of thing so the first

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.420

thing<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.170> before<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.710> dig<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
thing that I do before I dig them up is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340 
thing that I do before I dig them up is
I<00:01:05.549> clear<00:01:05.880> away<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.540> dead<00:01:06.750> leaves<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
of rip and you don't have to worry about

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.859 
of rip and you don't have to worry about
that<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:53.210> irises<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.450> grow<00:01:54.659> all

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that the the the irises will grow all

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.170 
that the the the irises will grow all
new<00:01:55.079> roots<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.619> don't<00:01:55.829> worry<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.100> them<00:01:56.430> you

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the plant we gave them up this is a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:17.620 
the plant we gave them up this is a
pretty<00:02:07.240> large<00:02:08.240> clump

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.060 

there<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.960> lot<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.260> new<00:02:21.500> plants<00:02:21.920> that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
there you have a lot of new plants that

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.790 
there you have a lot of new plants that
this<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:23.620> when<00:02:24.620> it's<00:02:24.770> all<00:02:25.010> nice<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.520> loose

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
this one when it's all nice and loose

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.740 
this one when it's all nice and loose
hopefully<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.100> dig<00:02:28.340> them<00:02:28.520> up<00:02:28.640> some<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
hopefully as you dig them up some of the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.560 
hopefully as you dig them up some of the
the<00:02:30.640> clumps<00:02:31.640> will<00:02:31.820> have<00:02:31.940> broken<00:02:32.180> apart

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
the clumps will have broken apart

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.540 
the clumps will have broken apart
already<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.350> don't<00:02:33.590> have<00:02:33.770> such<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.070> tour<00:02:34.520> of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
already so you don't have such a tour of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.720 
already so you don't have such a tour of
digging<00:02:35.120> everything<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.370> pull<00:02:37.610> it

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
digging everything up and if you pull it

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.960 
digging everything up and if you pull it
out<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> ground<00:02:38.180> like<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:40.820> can

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
out of the ground like that and you can

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
out of the ground like that and you can
see<00:02:41.180> you've<00:02:41.390> got<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.750> rhizome<00:02:42.230> here<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.690> old

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
see you've got the rhizome here the old

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.220 
see you've got the rhizome here the old
rhizomes<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.130> new<00:02:46.420> new<00:02:47.420> rhizome<00:02:47.960> you<00:02:48.080> can

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
rhizomes and the new new rhizome you can

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.530 
rhizomes and the new new rhizome you can
just<00:02:48.350> shake<00:02:48.560> off<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.890> dirt<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> pull<00:02:50.240> up<00:02:50.360> all

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
just shake off the dirt and pull up all

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.340 
just shake off the dirt and pull up all
those<00:02:50.690> Swedes<00:02:51.440> again<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.960> then<00:02:53.960> you<00:02:54.110> just

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
those Swedes again and then you just

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.770 
those Swedes again and then you just
where<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.160> rhizome<00:02:55.760> connects<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.570> other

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
where the rhizome connects to the other

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.640 
where the rhizome connects to the other
rhizome<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:59.020> you<00:03:00.020> just<00:03:00.050> break<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.620> right

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
rhizome you just you just break it right

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.150 
rhizome you just you just break it right
apart<00:03:01.570> right<00:03:02.570> where<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.840> connects<00:03:03.170> like<00:03:03.920> that

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
apart right where it connects like that

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.470 
apart right where it connects like that
and<00:03:05.680> all<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:07.010> these<00:03:07.190> are<00:03:07.460> new<00:03:07.640> little<00:03:08.000> babies

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
and all of these are new little babies

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.060 
and all of these are new little babies
that<00:03:09.170> will<00:03:09.380> be<00:03:09.560> full<00:03:10.600> rhizomes<00:03:11.860> next<00:03:12.860> year

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
that will be full rhizomes next year

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.040 
that will be full rhizomes next year
they'll<00:03:13.310> be<00:03:13.460> good<00:03:13.790> sized<00:03:14.030> rhizomes<00:03:14.480> next<00:03:14.870> year

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
they'll be good sized rhizomes next year

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.110 
they'll be good sized rhizomes next year
and<00:03:15.260> then<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.130> plant<00:03:16.370> those<00:03:16.610> separately

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
and then you can plant those separately

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.940 
and then you can plant those separately
next<00:03:17.570> year<00:03:17.810> but<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.320> would<00:03:18.560> not<00:03:18.680> suggest

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
next year but I would not suggest

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.090 
next year but I would not suggest
breaking<00:03:19.610> them<00:03:19.730> off<00:03:19.820> now<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.770> then<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.920> just

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
breaking them off now and then you just

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:30.940 
breaking them off now and then you just
replant<00:03:22.580> this<00:03:22.760> in<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.060> ground<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:30.770> don't

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
replant this in the ground you you don't

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.580 
replant this in the ground you you don't
need<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:32.210> know<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.960> break<00:03:33.200> them<00:03:33.380> all<00:03:33.470> apart

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
need to you know to break them all apart

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.260 
need to you know to break them all apart
at<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.640> time<00:03:34.910> just<00:03:35.230> well<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.440> one<00:03:36.620> is

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.930 

and<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.860> plant<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.250> whole<00:03:42.460> thing<00:03:42.700> in<00:03:42.850> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
and I just plant this whole thing in the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.780 
and I just plant this whole thing in the
ground<00:03:43.180> as<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> new<00:03:43.750> plant<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:45.280> then<00:03:45.460> you<00:03:45.580> just

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
ground as a new plant and then you just

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.510 
ground as a new plant and then you just
continue<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> clump<00:03:47.370> pulling<00:03:48.370> out

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
continue on with the clump pulling out

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.840 
continue on with the clump pulling out
the<00:03:48.670> new<00:03:49.080> rides<00:03:50.080> on

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.400 

and<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.720> new<00:03:57.900> one<00:03:57.930> also<00:04:00.080> by<00:04:01.080> next

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
and this is a new one also by next

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.190 
and this is a new one also by next
summer<00:04:01.590> all<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.430> these<00:04:02.610> will<00:04:02.820> be<00:04:02.940> fully<00:04:03.240> grown

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
summer all of these will be fully grown

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.760 
summer all of these will be fully grown
plants<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:06.570> you'll<00:04:06.690> have<00:04:06.870> quite<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.140> few<00:04:07.260> on

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
plants and you'll have quite a few on

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.060 
plants and you'll have quite a few on
this<00:04:08.270> fish<00:04:09.270> plants<00:04:09.630> as<00:04:09.690> well<00:04:09.800> here's<00:04:10.800> another

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
this fish plants as well here's another

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.350 
this fish plants as well here's another
one<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:14.160> that's<00:04:14.340> about<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.880> just<00:04:15.120> dig

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
one and so that's about it you just dig

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.280 
one and so that's about it you just dig
them<00:04:15.480> up<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.870> when<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.500> plant<00:04:16.800> the<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:18.290> new

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
them up and when you plant the the new

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.960 
them up and when you plant the the new
rhizomes<00:04:19.860> in<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.160> ground<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.550> want<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:20.820> wait

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
rhizomes in the ground you want to wait

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.420 
rhizomes in the ground you want to wait
at<00:04:21.180> least<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.600> day<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.400> new<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:24.570> newly

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
at least a day so that the new the newly

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.360 
at least a day so that the new the newly
separated<00:04:26.430> portion<00:04:27.330> right<00:04:27.480> here<00:04:27.860> seals<00:04:28.860> over

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
separated portion right here seals over

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.620 
separated portion right here seals over
so<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:31.320> don't<00:04:31.470> get<00:04:32.120> bacteria<00:04:33.120> from<00:04:33.480> the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
so that you don't get bacteria from the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.930 
so that you don't get bacteria from the
soil<00:04:33.870> into<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.620> rhizome<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.670> can<00:04:35.790> also

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
soil into the rhizome you can also

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.120 
soil into the rhizome you can also
sprinkle<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.630> with<00:04:36.660> Ajax<00:04:37.290> or<00:04:37.500> comet<00:04:37.890> cleanser

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
sprinkle it with Ajax or comet cleanser

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.420 
sprinkle it with Ajax or comet cleanser
and<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:39.120> will<00:04:39.710> also<00:04:40.710> take<00:04:41.040> care<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.340> the

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
and that will also take care of the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.920 
and that will also take care of the
problem<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.270> don't<00:04:42.450> spread<00:04:42.720> any

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
problem so that you don't spread any

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.200 
problem so that you don't spread any
kind<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.260> disease<00:04:43.590> into<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.010> plant<00:04:44.310> and

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
kind of disease into the plant and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.430 
kind of disease into the plant and
that's<00:04:45.720> about<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.990> thank<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.920> for<00:04:48.110> joining<00:04:49.110> us

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
that's about it thank you for joining us
