in beta although i have not seen any
problems<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.370> bugs<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:43.140> it

problems or bugs at all with it but it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.220 
problems or bugs at all with it but it
is<00:00:43.440> said<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.489> still<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.850> beta<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.270> let's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
is said to be still in beta so let's

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.750 
is said to be still in beta so let's
just<00:00:46.410> check<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.829> right<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
just check it out right here as you see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.340 
just check it out right here as you see
it<00:00:48.210> looks<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:49.020> different<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it looks a little bit different of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
it looks a little bit different of
course<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> 3d<00:00:50.670> look

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
course it's not going to be the 3d look

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.479 
course it's not going to be the 3d look
from<00:00:51.180> Apple<00:00:51.660> maps<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.250> little

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
from Apple maps but it is just a little

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.459 
from Apple maps but it is just a little
bit<00:00:53.640> higher<00:00:54.300> quality<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.930> looks<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> little

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bit higher quality and looks a little

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.410 
bit higher quality and looks a little
bit<00:00:55.620> better<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.640> does<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.149> turn<00:00:57.390> by

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
bit better so it does also have turn by

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.660 
bit better so it does also have turn by
turn<00:00:57.570> navigation<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:59.280> course<00:00:59.550> some

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
turn navigation and of course some

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.209 
turn navigation and of course some
improved<00:01:00.059> features<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> let's<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.920> ahead<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
improved features so let's go ahead and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.579 
improved features so let's go ahead and
just<00:01:03.120> check<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.510> some<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> things<00:01:04.350> right

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

at the bottom you can just kind of see
your<00:01:07.080> basic<00:01:07.470> features<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> see

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
York later on and satellite view as you
see<00:01:22.860> looks<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.310> cool<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.909> zoom<00:01:24.299> in

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
see looks really cool and just zoom in

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
see looks really cool and just zoom in
by<00:01:24.659> pinching<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> course<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.369> loads<00:01:26.549> very

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
by pinching of course and it loads very

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.929 
by pinching of course and it loads very
very<00:01:27.270> quick<00:01:27.630> which<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
very quick which I really like as you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.719 
very quick which I really like as you
see<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.900> zoom<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:32.189> much<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
see you can just zoom in as much you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880

transportation i don't i don't know how

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.500 
transportation i don't i don't know how
this<00:03:59.190> all<00:03:59.400> works<00:03:59.580> as<00:03:59.760> i've<00:03:59.880> never<00:04:00.090> had<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.360> do

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
this all works as i've never had to do

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.300 
this all works as i've never had to do
with<00:04:00.690> public<00:04:01.020> transit<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:01.620> there<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.160> go<00:04:02.220> i

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
with public transit but there you go i

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.010 
with public transit but there you go i
guess<00:04:02.520> that's<00:04:02.700> just<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.000> subways<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
guess that's just the subways and and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.570 
guess that's just the subways and and
the<00:04:04.260> railroads<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.920> all<00:04:05.010> kinds<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.490> things

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
the railroads and all kinds of things

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.720 
the railroads and all kinds of things
like<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.680> could<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.310> useful<00:04:08.459> i

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
like that so that could be useful i

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.400 
like that so that could be useful i
guess<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:09.090> you're<00:04:09.240> in<00:04:09.390> New<00:04:09.600> York<00:04:09.870> or<00:04:10.050> somewhere

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
guess if you're in New York or somewhere

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.890 
guess if you're in New York or somewhere
that<00:04:10.560> has<00:04:10.709> subways<00:04:11.520> Washington<00:04:12.239> places<00:04:12.750> like

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
that has subways Washington places like

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.410 
that has subways Washington places like
that<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:14.700> course<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.000> could<00:04:15.120> do<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.209> at

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
that and of course you could do that at

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.599 
that and of course you could do that at
the<00:04:15.480> same<00:04:15.630> time<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.840> satellite<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.280> want<00:04:17.459> to

the same time a satellite if you want to
do<00:04:17.730> that<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.989> let's<00:04:19.140> go<00:04:19.200> ahead<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.380> take<00:04:19.470> that

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
do that so let's go ahead and take that

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.170
