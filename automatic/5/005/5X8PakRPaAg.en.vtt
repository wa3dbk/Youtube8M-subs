00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
which is right before prohibition

however one of the judges that is

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.499 
however one of the judges that is
talking<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.549> being<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.299> particular

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
talking about being at this particular

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
talking about being at this particular
competition<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.380> Walter<00:01:29.009> Winchell<00:01:29.369> now

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
competition is Walter Winchell now

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
competition is Walter Winchell now
Walter<00:01:30.119> Winchell's<00:01:30.479> career<00:01:30.840> didn't<00:01:31.140> really

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
Walter Winchell's career didn't really

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.740 
Walter Winchell's career didn't really
get<00:01:31.380> started<00:01:31.650> until<00:01:32.070> 1920<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.180> he<00:01:33.390> really

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
get started until 1920 so he really

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
get started until 1920 so he really
wouldn't<00:01:33.930> been<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> radar<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:35.189> brought

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
wouldn't been on the radar to be brought

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.740 
wouldn't been on the radar to be brought
into<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> competition

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
into the competition

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
into the competition
other<00:01:37.079> than<00:01:37.439> happening<00:01:38.159> after<00:01:38.579> prohibition

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
other than happening after prohibition

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.210 
other than happening after prohibition
started<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.020> 1928<00:01:40.829> sounds<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
started so I think 1928 sounds like a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
started so I think 1928 sounds like a
better<00:01:41.460> date<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> drink

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
better date for it and so the drink

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.630 
better date for it and so the drink
itself<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:43.770> has<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> little<00:01:44.310> bit<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
itself now has a little bit more of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
itself now has a little bit more of
Appeal<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.079> invented<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
Appeal because it was invented and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
Appeal because it was invented and
created<00:01:47.430> during<00:01:47.729> Prohibition<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
created during Prohibition one of the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.539 
created during Prohibition one of the
few<00:01:48.899> cocktails<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.100> say<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> about

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
few cocktails that we can say that about

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.700 
few cocktails that we can say that about
and<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.360> came<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> second<00:01:52.020> place<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.200> some

could use brown creme de cacao there are
two<00:02:34.660> problems<00:02:35.110> with<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:35.260> one<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:36.490> brown

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
two problems with that one is the brown

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.070 
two problems with that one is the brown
would<00:02:36.910> make<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> drink<00:02:37.360> look<00:02:37.540> kind<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.930> weird

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
would make the drink look kind of weird

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.350 
would make the drink look kind of weird
and<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:39.100> other<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.430> actually<00:02:39.670> brown<00:02:40.030> creme<00:02:40.240> de

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and the other is actually brown creme de

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.700 
and the other is actually brown creme de
cacao<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.630> made<00:02:40.840> slightly<00:02:41.200> differently<00:02:41.560> than

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
cacao is made slightly differently than

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.620 
cacao is made slightly differently than
white<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.730> tastes<00:02:43.120> are<00:02:43.240> slightly

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
white and so the tastes are slightly

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.400 
white and so the tastes are slightly
different<00:02:43.900> too<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:45.160> lastly<00:02:45.940> we<00:02:46.270> add<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
different too and lastly we add the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:56.100 
different too and lastly we add the
cream<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.980> an<00:02:48.130> ounce<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:54.990> suppose<00:02:55.990> you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
cream and an ounce of that I suppose you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.090 
cream and an ounce of that I suppose you
could<00:02:56.290> use<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.470> low-fat<00:02:57.340> nonfat<00:02:57.580> cream<00:02:57.970> but<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
especially if you think it should be

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.330 
especially if you think it should be
kind<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.209> foamy<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.630> rich<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:39.100> wanna<00:03:39.220> make

kind of foamy and rich you wanna make

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.530 
kind of foamy and rich you wanna make
sure<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.580> shake<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.940> up<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.060> little<00:03:40.090> bit<00:03:40.300> longer

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
sure you shake it up a little bit longer

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.270 
sure you shake it up a little bit longer
than<00:03:40.780> normal<00:03:40.930> just<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.500> kind<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.740> try<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:41.920> foam

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280

it<00:03:42.400> up

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.400 

so<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.500> rich<00:04:04.890> green<00:04:05.310> color<00:04:06.020> is<00:04:07.020> obviously

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
doesn't really look like a grasshopper

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.170 
doesn't really look like a grasshopper
NOFA<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.250> doesn't<00:04:11.550> taste<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:11.760> one<00:04:12.000> either

it's not a serious cocktail but

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.700

you should write a grasshopper the next
time<00:04:35.100> you're<00:04:35.250> looking<00:04:35.490> for<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.669> good<00:04:35.940> dessert
