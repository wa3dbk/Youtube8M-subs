00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
so let's have a look at B bot now B BOTS

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.440 
so let's have a look at B bot now B BOTS
the<00:00:04.740> little<00:00:04.950> B<00:00:05.100> icon<00:00:05.580> I've<00:00:05.850> just<00:00:06.089> gone<00:00:06.240> ahead

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the little B icon I've just gone ahead

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.900 
the little B icon I've just gone ahead
and<00:00:07.379> actually<00:00:07.680> clicked<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.400> already<00:00:08.670> so

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
and actually clicked on it already so

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.959 
and actually clicked on it already so
it's<00:00:09.150> Paul<00:00:09.330> Hamilton<00:00:09.750> he<00:00:09.900> wraps<00:00:10.849> iPads<00:00:11.849> in

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
it's Paul Hamilton he wraps iPads in

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.390 
it's Paul Hamilton he wraps iPads in
schools<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.570> we're<00:00:13.410> looking<00:00:13.650> at<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.889> B<00:00:14.130> bot

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
schools and we're looking at this B bot

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.279 
schools and we're looking at this B bot
now<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.820> great<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.420> prep<00:00:15.660> students<00:00:16.049> year

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
now this is great for prep students year

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.370 
now this is great for prep students year
1<00:00:16.470> students<00:00:17.039> I'm<00:00:17.220> not<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> big<00:00:18.060> fan<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:19.050> guess

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
1 students I'm not a big fan of I guess

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.849 
1 students I'm not a big fan of I guess
game<00:00:19.680> based<00:00:20.130> learning<00:00:21.230> but<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.650> one

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
game based learning but I think this one

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.790 
game based learning but I think this one
is<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> good<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.820> relation<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.800> strategy

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is a good one in relation to strategy

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
is a good one in relation to strategy
are<00:00:26.189> teaching<00:00:26.699> kids<00:00:26.730> basic<00:00:27.390> programming<00:00:27.840> even

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
are teaching kids basic programming even

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.259 
are teaching kids basic programming even
skills<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.189> thinking<00:00:29.550> ahead<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.029> so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
skills and just thinking ahead and so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.920 
skills and just thinking ahead and so
forth<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.790> basically<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.510> B<00:00:33.719> bot

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
forth so basically what we do with B bot

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.660 
forth so basically what we do with B bot
here<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.500> click<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.860> level<00:00:35.130> 1<00:00:35.280> let's<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
here is we click on level 1 let's go to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.930 
here is we click on level 1 let's go to
level<00:00:35.880> 1<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> I'll<00:00:36.390> click<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.840> start<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
level 1 and I'll click on start and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.220 
level 1 and I'll click on start and
basically<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> down<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
basically what we have to do is down the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
basically what we have to do is down the
bottom<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:41.070> hand<00:00:41.280> corner<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.030> can

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
bottom right hand corner there you can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
bottom right hand corner there you can
see<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.750> forward<00:00:43.260> left<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
see the little forward left right and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
see the little forward left right and
back<00:00:44.910> arrows<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.140> basically<00:00:46.530> need<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.010> do

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
back arrows what we basically need to do

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
back arrows what we basically need to do
is<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:48.180> B<00:00:48.539> bot<00:00:48.840> onto<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> flour

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
is get the little B bot onto the flour

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.150 
is get the little B bot onto the flour
here<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.110> need<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.010> our

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
here so what we need to do is do all our

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910 
here so what we need to do is do all our
programming<00:00:53.670> first<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.840> press<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
programming first then we press go and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
programming first then we press go and
see<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.940> were<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.629> our<00:00:57.780> programming

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
see if we were right in our programming

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.819 
see if we were right in our programming
so<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.930> forward<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
so for this one it's forward one so I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.100 
so for this one it's forward one so I
press<00:01:02.100> forward<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> press<00:01:03.840> go

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
press forward one and then I press go

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
press forward one and then I press go
and<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.970> there<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.360> was

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and you can see there that that was

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
and you can see there that that was
really<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.170> easy<00:01:07.530> let's<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> our<00:01:08.670> menu

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
really really easy let's go to our menu

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
really really easy let's go to our menu
let's<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.810> harder<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.320> let's<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
let's go to a harder one let's go to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
let's go to a harder one let's go to
about<00:01:11.340> level<00:01:11.580> five<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> press<00:01:12.869> Start

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500

get it wrong so let's say I do two

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.959 
get it wrong so let's say I do two
forwards<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.240> then<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.140> right<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.820> our

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
forwards and then a right and then our

two forwards and see what happens to the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.510 
two forwards and see what happens to the
little<00:01:59.880> B<00:02:00.119> body<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> press<00:02:01.200> go<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:05.369> can

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
little B body so I press go and you can

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850 
little B body so I press go and you can
see<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.450> I've<00:02:06.570> basically<00:02:06.810> failed<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
see there that I've basically failed and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.589 
see there that I've basically failed and
I<00:02:07.920> need<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.310> start<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.360> hit<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
I need to start again and I can hit the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.559 
I need to start again and I can hit the
plus<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:11.099> will

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
plus and it will

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.780 
plus and it will
let<00:02:11.749> me<00:02:11.900> attempt<00:02:12.799> again<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:15.310> start<00:02:16.310> again<00:02:16.579> so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
let me attempt again and start again so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.369 
let me attempt again and start again so
that's<00:02:16.909> B<00:02:17.239> bought<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.689> great<00:02:18.019> little

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
that's B bought a great little

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.559 
that's B bought a great little

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
introduction I guess to programming

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.050 
introduction I guess to programming
terrific<00:02:21.560> for<00:02:21.739> your<00:02:21.859> maths<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.340> science<00:02:22.760> kids

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
terrific for your maths and science kids

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.670 
terrific for your maths and science kids
and<00:02:23.299> developing<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.019> think<00:02:24.409> of<00:02:24.530> those

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and developing that think of those

and developing that think of those
thinking<00:02:25.099> ahead<00:02:25.249> skills<00:02:25.879> very<00:02:26.420> similar<00:02:26.900> to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
thinking ahead skills very similar to

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.309 
thinking ahead skills very similar to
chess<00:02:27.349> but<00:02:28.129> in<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.430> game<00:02:28.760> sort<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.299> situation<00:02:30.079> as

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
chess but in a game sort of situation as

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.119 
chess but in a game sort of situation as
I<00:02:30.379> said<00:02:30.709> before<00:02:30.859> I'm<00:02:31.069> not<00:02:31.189> a<00:02:31.250> big<00:02:31.670> fan<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:33.129> game

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
I said before I'm not a big fan of game

I said before I'm not a big fan of game
based<00:02:34.730> learning<00:02:34.909> in<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.569> early<00:02:35.989> years<00:02:36.260> I

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
based learning in the early years I

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.039 
based learning in the early years I
think<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.739> really<00:02:37.219> need<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.790> get<00:02:37.969> our<00:02:38.239> younger

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
think we really need to get our younger

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.740 
think we really need to get our younger
students<00:02:39.760> doing<00:02:40.760> very<00:02:41.269> rich<00:02:43.090> not<00:02:44.090> complicated

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
students doing very rich not complicated

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.640 
students doing very rich not complicated
but<00:02:45.109> but<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.280> think<00:02:46.639> we<00:02:47.000> need<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.359> set<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.439> bar

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
but but I think we need to set the bar

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.800 
but but I think we need to set the bar
higher<00:02:49.069> with<00:02:49.459> our<00:02:49.639> younger<00:02:50.030> students<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.569> not

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
higher with our younger students and not

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.319 
higher with our younger students and not
just<00:02:50.840> do<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.889> game<00:02:52.159> based<00:02:52.519> learning<00:02:52.849> you<00:02:53.120> know

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
just do the game based learning you know

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.199 
just do the game based learning you know
the<00:02:53.510> multiplication<00:02:54.290> facts<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.980> where<00:02:55.519> the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
the multiplication facts and where the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.879 
the multiplication facts and where the
balloon<00:02:56.510> based<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.139> the<00:02:57.199> little<00:02:57.409> game<00:02:57.590> thinks

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
balloon based and the little game thinks

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.259 
balloon based and the little game thinks
they're<00:02:58.040> great<00:02:58.430> for<00:02:58.699> students<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.180> be

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
they're great for students to be

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.420 
they're great for students to be
involved<00:02:59.599> with<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.409> I<00:03:00.500> think<00:03:00.769> our<00:03:00.919> students

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
involved with but I think our students

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.129 
involved with but I think our students
our<00:03:01.609> younger<00:03:02.000> students<00:03:02.419> need<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.629> be<00:03:02.870> involved

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
our younger students need to be involved

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.649 
our younger students need to be involved
in<00:03:03.349> those<00:03:03.500> rich<00:03:03.889> iPad<00:03:04.459> activities<00:03:05.030> like

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
in those rich iPad activities like

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.899 
in those rich iPad activities like
taking<00:03:06.199> photos<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.919> storytelling<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.819> all

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
taking photos and storytelling and all

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.399 
taking photos and storytelling and all
those<00:03:08.120> things<00:03:08.449> that<00:03:08.629> we've<00:03:08.750> talked<00:03:09.019> about<00:03:09.109> in

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
those things that we've talked about in

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.220 
those things that we've talked about in
other<00:03:09.469> tutorials<00:03:10.310> however<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.389> is<00:03:11.629> a<00:03:11.659> really

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:17.509 
and right tunes that basic maths

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.020

bit of an introduction to programming
skills<00:03:23.239> at<00:03:23.449> an<00:03:23.540> early<00:03:23.810> age<00:03:23.840> which<00:03:24.349> i<00:03:24.590> think<00:03:24.949> is

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
skills at an early age which i think is
