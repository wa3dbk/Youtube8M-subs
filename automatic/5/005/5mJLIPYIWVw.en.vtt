00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello when you hear the word shooter but 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.910
 comes two games this is battlefield and call 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.320
 of duty 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.210
 cruise is associated more with 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.890
 eSports here today you will find out 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.470
 the story of one of them is this greatest 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.939
 series of games and in this release I can 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.770
 from tips from other wikipedia 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 sources talk about each dreaming 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.000
 and the series will start the very first game was 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 it is clear that the main competitor medal 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.750
 of honor there is no chance because when 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 It was head and shoulders above this and the new engine 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.680
 lively gameplay beautiful graphics 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 publishers since inception is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 And it turns out one is very 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.140
 interesting but strange 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.760
 activating fact shifted its 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.620
 activity in favor of mega successful 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000
 series by country only guitar hero only 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.610
 in 2011 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.420
 moment of release of 8 games of the modern series 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.280
 warfare 3 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.990
 the topic was not previously thought of the previous part 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 modern warfare before the block is not long 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.090
 lingered they were bought up like hot 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.980
 pies and so the story begins in 2003 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.400
 year when game developers infinity 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.259
 ward 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.689
 started developing first-person shooter 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.460
 the week 3 team arena engine in the team 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.840
 developers called the game to 2 what 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 assigned official name 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.979
 killers medal of honor game had a mass 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.200
 merits the main of which is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.299
 the diversity of the storyline in contrast 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 from places 2 under in the game you could go 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.079
 the whole of the second world war on behalf of not 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.229
 only American but also Soviet and 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.479
 British soldier 2 playing series 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.579
 it turned out even better myself sometimes before 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.439
 I pass though those emotions that I experienced in 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.149
 childhood is not getting for me exactly 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.950
 from the second part of the game the name 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.869
 translated as call of duty or feeling 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.340
 debt gaming life began already in 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.990
 first week of sales is active 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.520
 managed to realize more than two hundred 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.350
 fifty thousand copies of the game 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.479
 This is due to the fact that the game came out almost 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.310
 at the start of the xbox 360 console 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.079
 where companies in the game made it possible 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.509
 fully experience the second world 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.639
 war on behalf of the salad of the USSR and Britain 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.929
 united states is now a series of code in 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:57.270
 impossible to imagine without multiplayer 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.950
 in those days he was made an amateur 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.479
 then the console was only born 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.429
 gaming as the main gaming platform 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 by the way the game still had the opportunity 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.759
 to manage transport in a well 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 certain missions and it was a tank 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.929
 and here the meeting from the conveyor bypassed 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.400
 side form personal computers 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.370
 so it sold worse than her 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.230
 predecessors 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.000
 perhaps the role was played by the fact that the new group 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.920
 developed by another studio treyarch 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.780
 the new studio has contributed its 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.150
 The game concerns this mainly graphic 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.620
 component and visual effects also 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.190
 player has more funds available for 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.750
 travel for someone 2007 is it 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.760
 emo and blazer for gamers 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.890
 this is the year that the legendary was released 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.959
 call of duty 4 modern warfare 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.579
 For developers, this is a time of change . 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.950
 infinity ward and temporarily abandoned 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.569
 ideas about the second world war it is 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.849
 game studio will not return to this 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.739
 topic but this is not now the basis of modern 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.230
 warfare which translates as new war 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.180
 already the third world war the beginning of which 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.799
 Of course they put Russian but even 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.200
 despite this and his age 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.700
 the game still appears on the rumor and from 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.890
 nostalgia often pereprohod 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.180
 there is something unusual about these games 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.799
 captain price who constantly 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 opening the door is what's interesting 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.730
 captain price was a hero 2 call of duty 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.340
 if that happens in the second 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.230
 world war that is for 60 70 years 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.480
 captain price is not something that has aged on 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.129
 well by the way captain price appeared and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.200
 in the first put the same in the second and 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.440
 the fourth and seventh they all look alike 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.299
 so after the successful part 4 everyone was waiting 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.190
 something like this so on her background 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.810
 world at war with the theme of the second world 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.940
 war did not seem so cool 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.590
 the developers have set a triar to remind you 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.450
 what they used to work on in the third 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.590
 part in the general action takes place in 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.359
 World War II 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.160
 here we play for the Americans because 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.049
 Russians in the first and second halves 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.819
 games, respectively, and the American 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.650
 soldier fight against japanese russian 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.150
 against the Germans 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.340
 after such a relatively calm game 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.079
 goes sensational modern warfare 2 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.849
 in which there really is a couple 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.099
 controversial moments one of them is 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.569
 mission called not a word in Russian 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.430
 where the player will have to be disguised 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.680
 US agent to split the whole 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
 civilian airport at the end of the mission 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.269
 his Russian friends sell him 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.949
 after which they are found by the FBI and for this 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.319
 the mission could first be skipped in 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:04.510
 Russian version and then completely forbid 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.340
 and cut out of the game on the territory of the Russian Federation 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.230
 but still the game sold out very much 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.079
 well the first day it was implemented 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.349
 more than 4 million copies in this way 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.539
 2 overtook the gta4 itself with whom comes out black 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.699
 ops new game from 3 or multiple 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.639
 and got used to this series with 1 modern 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.709
 warfare in 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.110
 he was just great in this game 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.090
 he disappointed fans a little changed 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.379
 earning system ate strii this 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.180
 murder series reward 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.919
 if anyone knows and generally ideas with 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.750
 glitches in the head of the main character is good 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.310
 you took the public in this 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.349
 Game 3 or proven as 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.150
 developers who can write good 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.069
 the plot though the game did not bring anything 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.900
 new to the game industry plan 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.729
 innovation but it has pleased millions 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.509
 gamers last calm year for 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.360
 activism 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.400
 after the fabulous success of modern warfare 2 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.139
 fans of the series were waiting for a breathtaking 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.539
 a masterpiece but a publisher and a developer 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.400
 there were conflicts because of this game 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.199
 did other studios with the participation 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.419
 infinity ward nothing came of it 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.169
 good but the game sold better than anyone 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.060
 predecessors 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.069
 but so numerous and sales were not 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.180
 justified by the quality of the game just gamers 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.279
 could not even think 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.080
 which of these magnificent series of games can 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.969
 get what happened in terms of 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.430
 history of the game was a continuation of the mv2 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.689
 from that very moment everyone began to hook this 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.550
 great series of games 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.830
 before everyone absolutely didn’t care 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.479
 on the graphon on the engine on the texture in the plan 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.969
 The plot of the game was a sequel 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.199
 and ending the modern warfare series through 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.550
 year publisher active 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.279
 managed to partially restore credibility 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.050
 among the gaming community in the game was 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.029
 excellent multiplayer which i 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.529
 sometimes play on stream subscribe 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.690
 on the tweak channel then we will have 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.610
 much more often the game continued the story 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.440
 Mentally from black ops is very difficult 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.449
 tell and call of duty and when 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.250
 This is not a spoiler that's why I'm not enough 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.169
 told the storyline of these games 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.479
 zombie mode is also worth mentioning 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.099
 here it is made very soundly strengthened to 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.620
 his creation was attached as 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.370
 full game in the past 22 loved even 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.860
 Wikipedia 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.990
 as you remember the reputation of the publisher and so 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.330
 badly damaged black ops 2 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.759
 influenced and and setting but still so 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.710
 in 2013 also goes on doing 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.539
 Noise guest people waited for what will happen in 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.400
 this year is true style disappointment 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.349
 trailer starring actress megan 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.599
 Fox and Sunstrike are written and minimum 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.159
 talked a little treat life this year but 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.139
 here's a gameplay trailer claimed 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.819
 the opposite in the end you yourself know what 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.020
 turned out but contrary to opinion 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.310
 I played the public almost 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.200
 liked and 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.970
 if the plot just did not reach the end 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.860
 it seems to me that it was done for that 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.870
 reason to stir up 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.880
 the second part is a handful according to Bobby 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.010
 cat CEO activism 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.440
 the game sold very well but little 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.690
 who believed this call of duty advanced 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.040
 warfare will have to upset all lovers 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.690
 classic call of duty 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.760
 Now in this series will be so much 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.160
 futuristic genre apart from the zombie mode 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.200
 black ops 3 but not about it now advanced 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.480
 warfare I bought myself like many games 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.220
 this series and a couple of times I almost regretted 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.200
 I think about buying all the same 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.210
 despite the balk more often the sale of the game 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.280
 stop feeding people the same 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.890
 every year again a futuristic basis 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.790
 old graph he however this is compensated 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.950
 dynamic multiplayer gameplay 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.540
 attention deserves and kevin spacey with 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.150
 which loomed the main villain in 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.070
 the game and this year we are waiting for a new black 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.720
 ops 3 and gameplay screen for sure 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.850
 last chance to activate fix 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.100
 situation but one thing is certain 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.080
 games will be high system requirements 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.210

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.040
