00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 the red line and further back 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.069
 again 400 are each missile you 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.710
 the cancer cancer of this game are 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.939
 the light ones 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.939
 besides already night 2 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.699
 and that game is pretty much gone 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.659
 500 500 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:56.770
 and balance it as a balanced 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.990
 it's already the bm but I'm asking the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.990
 I want 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.880
 year 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.180
 It is very well made and the water is very 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.180
 well done 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.909
 I was closing that what is cool here 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.909
 is that the article closes the list 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:47.770
 4 - is a total invention for Carmen 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.770
 to balance that the defective ones 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 treat it you say you have a cannon 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.170
 120 meters because the uncle has developed 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.280
 500 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.480
 or that you have targeted yourself 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.480
 already designated is the explanation 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.870
 here I am hot is a little 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.120
 Russia wins 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.030
 we can lose this alive zooming in and not 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.030
 we can lose this uncle 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.870
 will not happen to donkey uncle and I have his 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.870
 second exit from the left 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.830
 what I want is to try to empty this 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.130
 side because I do not trust the leopard of 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.130
 behind 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.960
 it appears behind you will be there giving 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.030
 for ass all the time 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.210
 they have to go in there to get them out and not 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.210
 to me 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.250
 you take advantage of paint while errors 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.250
 our 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.290
 it must be turn off the light 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.290
 No god 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.989
 efe 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.440
 sidereal sting you 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.530
 it is bouncing the missile fish 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.400
 games that bounce the missiles because 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.400
 some that has 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.920
 last year 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.560
 is very very well done is very cool 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.350
 truly together 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.350
 have you entirely true 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.280
 but then 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.910
 if we do not go out because they know but if 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.910
 everything is alive 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:48.940
 I discriminated against you for that but it would be 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.940
 good every day tomorrow 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.240
 but already with the spark of life of Javier 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.240
 here 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.080
 that shot for me that guy for me that 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.460
 kind for me if you think it has not 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.460
 painted has been painted completely 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.719
 works different fields the one that is said 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.719
 in the x6 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.430
 the duke 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.990
 keep in mind that everything you speak 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.990
 here it will come out worse 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.180
 a must is riding 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.960
 saved by commander 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.960
 I'm in 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.389
 I will be able to touch reset I do not want no 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.389
 I want to reset 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.560
 has already put me to participate if perhaps the 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:57.560
 wheel 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.560
 fuck 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:10.189
 and I do not have time 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:13.810
 you followed the game well 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:17.080
 I need you to tell me who they're targeting 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.870
 to 34 it rises facing detailed knowledge 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.570
 that this strategy is looking 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.500
 they were both looking is already insecure 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.500
 sideways also around here 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.820
 I said looking 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.510
 the joke too 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.510
 no not neither of the two worlds 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:55.139
 I do not know what is happening to you 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.409
 fuck what harder thing than disgusting 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.409
 car 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.960
 there he is dead 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.550
 unlike the low 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.440
 it's okay 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.140
 oh god do not fuck the joke I do not have it 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.070
 in fact I have the clear challenger 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.070
 because I'm playing this car
