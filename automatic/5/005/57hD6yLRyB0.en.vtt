affair would be truly believing that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.010 
affair would be truly believing that
perhaps<00:01:28.970> production<00:01:29.970> had<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> lot<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> deal

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

with it was I right actually yeah kind

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
with it was I right actually yeah kind
of<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.729> surprisingly<00:01:35.729> enough<00:01:36.000> global

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
of what surprisingly enough global

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.840 
of what surprisingly enough global
flatline<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.710> torrid<00:01:38.250> affair<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
flatline is just a torrid affair it's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
flatline is just a torrid affair it's
something<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.360> rips<00:01:39.869> through<00:01:40.200> you

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
something that just rips through you

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.520 
something that just rips through you
it's<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> 15<00:01:41.759> track<00:01:42.150> affair<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:43.170> very

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it's a 15 track affair is a very very

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.730 
it's a 15 track affair is a very very
lengthy<00:01:44.189> track<00:01:44.850> wise<00:01:45.180> ideal<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.470> clocks

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
lengthy track wise ideal but it clocks

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
lengthy track wise ideal but it clocks
it<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.040> only<00:01:47.189> 51<00:01:48.119> minutes<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.600> length<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.049> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it in only 51 minutes in length so you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
it in only 51 minutes in length so you
can<00:01:49.290> tell<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> death<00:01:49.860> grind<00:01:50.189> persona<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
can tell that the death grind persona is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
can tell that the death grind persona is
still<00:01:51.540> something<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> infinitely

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
still something that is infinitely

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
still something that is infinitely
present<00:01:53.250> amongst<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.670> band<00:01:53.970> however<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
present amongst this band however the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.480 
present amongst this band however the
sound<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.409> feels<00:01:55.649> different<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
sound just feels different this is a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.969 
sound just feels different this is a
bandit<00:01:56.939> sounds<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> lot<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:57.810> refreshed<00:01:58.710> than

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
bandit sounds a lot more refreshed than

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.319 
bandit sounds a lot more refreshed than
they<00:01:59.070> did<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.280> their<00:01:59.369> previous<00:01:59.640> two<00:02:00.119> efforts

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
they did on their previous two efforts

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.990 
they did on their previous two efforts
and<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.500> does<00:02:01.710> resemble<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.729> more

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and it does resemble a little bit more

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
and it does resemble a little bit more
along<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.329> lines<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> Gorman<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.380> an<00:02:04.500> era

along the lines of the Gorman get an era

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.499 
along the lines of the Gorman get an era
which<00:02:04.950> means<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> gentleman

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
which means that this is a gentleman

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240 
which means that this is a gentleman
that<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:07.020> seems<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.500> bring<00:02:07.710> out<00:02:07.920> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that really seems to bring out that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.780 
that really seems to bring out that
sound<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.780> band<00:02:10.020> although<00:02:10.520> many<00:02:11.520> many

some people may actually think that that
is<00:03:40.890> what<00:03:41.310> resembles<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.269> bit<00:03:42.360> more<00:03:42.570> of

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
is what resembles a little bit more of

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.410 
is what resembles a little bit more of
their<00:03:42.780> previous<00:03:43.049> works<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.910> previous<00:03:45.090> two

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
their previous works the previous two

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.420 
their previous works the previous two
albums<00:03:45.450> but<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.230> really<00:03:46.769> think<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
albums but I really think that this is a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.970 
albums but I really think that this is a
good<00:03:47.700> exercise<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.840> when<00:03:49.350> working<00:03:49.620> with<00:03:49.769> the
