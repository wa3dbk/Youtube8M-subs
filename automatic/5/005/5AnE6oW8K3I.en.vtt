00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
just basically the film of this I got

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.830 
just basically the film of this I got
they<00:02:00.030> look<00:02:00.179> pretty<00:02:01.039> similar<00:02:02.039> but<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:03.630> looks

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
they look pretty similar but it looks

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
they look pretty similar but it looks
really<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.350> well<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.520> want<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

get something specifically for curly
hair<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.970> curl<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.660> wavy

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989

hair and so this is the curl and wavy
from<00:02:10.590> organic<00:02:11.340> natural<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.080> curl

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
from organic natural and it's the curl

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190 
from organic natural and it's the curl
defining<00:02:13.980> conditioner<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.819> detangler<00:02:15.200> it's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
defining conditioner and detangler it's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.339

this stick together I rather than having

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.370 
this stick together I rather than having
like<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.190> many<00:02:50.430> little<00:02:50.670> pieces<00:02:51.230> but<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
like so many little pieces but that

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.830 
like so many little pieces but that
makes<00:02:52.530> sense<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.670> that's<00:02:53.940> why<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.599> um

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
makes sense so that's why I like that um

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.229 
makes sense so that's why I like that um
and<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.410> scrunch<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.579> makes<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and I just scrunch it and it makes a

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.150 
and I just scrunch it and it makes a
beautiful<00:02:57.420> ways
