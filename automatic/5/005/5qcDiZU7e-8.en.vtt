to<00:03:16.750> remove<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.350> what<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> used<00:03:20.770> the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.740 
to remove and so that is what I used the
only<00:03:21.340> thing<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.610> would<00:03:21.790> have<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:22.090> stay<00:03:22.270> negative

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
only thing I would have to stay negative

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.510

about<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.200> nail<00:03:23.320> polish<00:03:23.740> was<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:24.040> used<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.340> lot

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
about the nail polish was I used a lot

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.370 
about the nail polish was I used a lot
of<00:03:24.640> different<00:03:24.970> colors<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:26.110> fumes

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
of different colors and the fumes

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.350 
of different colors and the fumes
started<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.010> give<00:03:27.160> me<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> pretty<00:03:27.700> bad<00:03:27.910> headache

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
started to give me a pretty bad headache

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.810 
started to give me a pretty bad headache
so<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:29.290> be<00:03:29.410> careful<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:29.950> you're<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.460> a<00:03:30.490> room

so just be careful that you're in a room

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.730
