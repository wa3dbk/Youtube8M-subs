keeping the storm tracks in the north

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.670 
keeping the storm tracks in the north
and<00:02:06.360> keeping<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.750> cold<00:02:06.990> arctic<00:02:07.290> air<00:02:07.409> away

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.080 
and keeping that cold arctic air away
from<00:02:07.890> us<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.340> why<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.729> are<00:02:08.849> starting

this<00:02:09.390> warming<00:02:09.780> trend<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> showers<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
this warming trend so the showers and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.710 
this warming trend so the showers and
