trippers in the life fish it's a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.500 
trippers in the life fish it's a
standard<00:00:14.969> 10<00:00:15.210> gallon<00:00:15.599> tank<00:00:15.870> um<00:00:17.330> it's<00:00:18.330> got<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
standard 10 gallon tank um it's got a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.189 
standard 10 gallon tank um it's got a
fluval<00:00:19.020> c3<00:00:19.619> filter<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> back<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.109> kind<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
fluval c3 filter on the back so kind of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
fluval c3 filter on the back so kind of
an<00:00:22.289> overkill<00:00:22.590> frustration<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.789> tank<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
an overkill frustration for this tank I

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
an overkill frustration for this tank I

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
think it's necessary because i do not

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
think it's necessary because i do not
want<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:26.730> kind<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.119> parasitic<00:00:28.400> things<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.779> my

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
native fish but now I'm just using it as

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.140 
native fish but now I'm just using it as
a<00:02:26.270> nicer<00:02:26.810> quarantine<00:02:27.290> tank<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.760> feed

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
a nicer quarantine tank what I feed

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.270 
a nicer quarantine tank what I feed
these<00:02:29.360> feeder<00:02:29.750> fish<00:02:30.050> are<00:02:31.060> new<00:02:32.060> life<00:02:32.300> spectrum

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
these feeder fish are new life spectrum

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.790 
these feeder fish are new life spectrum
theory<00:02:34.280> pellets<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.870> does<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> nice<00:02:36.440> job<00:02:36.500> of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
theory pellets it does a nice job of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.750 
theory pellets it does a nice job of
keeping<00:02:37.130> keeping<00:02:37.820> them<00:02:38.150> healthy<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:39.760> think

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
keeping keeping them healthy I think

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:55.339 
keeping keeping them healthy I think
throw<00:02:41.060> some<00:02:41.270> balance<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.630> here<00:02:41.840> real<00:02:41.989> quick

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.839 

you<00:02:56.349> can<00:02:56.500> give<00:02:56.680> me<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.860> second<00:02:57.250> let's<00:02:57.579> start

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
you can give me a second let's start

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.539 
you can give me a second let's start
let's<00:02:58.269> start<00:02:58.390> forming<00:02:59.049> them<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.620> may<00:03:00.220> just<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
let's start forming them I may just a

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.220 
let's start forming them I may just a
nibble<00:03:00.760> off<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.209> they<00:03:01.329> can<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:01.900> what<00:03:02.079> they

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
nibble off what they can and what they

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.679 
nibble off what they can and what they
usually<00:03:02.470> do<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.819> wait<00:03:03.849> for<00:03:04.060> them<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.450> hit

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
usually do is to wait for them to hit

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.089 
usually do is to wait for them to hit
the<00:03:04.840> bottom<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.409> then<00:03:05.590> they'll<00:03:05.709> get<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.890> little

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
the bottom and then they'll get a little

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.710 
the bottom and then they'll get a little
soggy<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.730> then<00:03:06.879> we'll<00:03:07.120> eat<00:03:07.150> them<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.569> they're

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
soggy and then we'll eat them on they're

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:16.890 
soggy and then we'll eat them on they're
soggy<00:03:14.040> yeah<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.489> just<00:03:15.760> right<00:03:16.060> my

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
soggy yeah this is just right my

00:03:16.900 --> 00:04:10.040 
soggy yeah this is just right my
quarantine<00:03:17.769> set<00:03:18.040> up

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.820
