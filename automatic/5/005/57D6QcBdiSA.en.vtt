have<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.469> goosenecks<00:01:11.030> same<00:01:12.030> suitcases<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
have the goosenecks same suitcases you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
have the goosenecks same suitcases you
have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> focus<00:01:14.899> it<00:01:15.899> doesn't<00:01:16.229> fit<00:01:16.880> what's

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
have to focus it doesn't fit what's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.670 
have to focus it doesn't fit what's
actually<00:01:18.030> wrong<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.719> fact<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.560> have

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
actually wrong is the fact you have

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
actually wrong is the fact you have
three<00:01:19.950> inches<00:01:20.189> less<00:01:20.399> from<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.700> load<00:01:20.909> floor

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
three inches less from the load floor

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690 
three inches less from the load floor
here<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.680> underside<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.159> package<00:01:23.490> tray

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
here the underside of the package tray

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340 
here the underside of the package tray
so<00:01:24.360> even<00:01:24.600> though<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.930> almost<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.289> same

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
so even though they have almost the same

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.649 
so even though they have almost the same
volume<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.009> can't<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> same<00:01:26.610> suitcases

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
volume you can't get the same suitcases

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.899 
volume you can't get the same suitcases

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
easier to drive it doesn't make awed

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.529 
easier to drive it doesn't make awed
noises<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.369> fact<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.759> didn't<00:01:32.939> even<00:01:32.999> complete
