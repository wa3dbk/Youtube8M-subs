I realized that the sofa actually adds
weight<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.210> rocket<00:02:43.750> we<00:02:44.050> need<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.380> make<00:02:44.560> this

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
weight the rocket we need to make this

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.720 
weight the rocket we need to make this
sofa<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:46.300> need<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.600> have<00:02:46.780> zero<00:02:47.500> gravity<00:02:47.920> right

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
sofa we need to have zero gravity right

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.670 
sofa we need to have zero gravity right
right<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.180> can<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.870> go<00:02:50.620> bad<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:52.680> luxury

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
right you can do this go bad the luxury

on five thousand we're gonna get rid of

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.110 
on five thousand we're gonna get rid of
the<00:02:56.800> gravity<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.820> shouldn't

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
the gravity on that so I shouldn't

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.450 
the gravity on that so I shouldn't
influence<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.530> weight<00:02:59.800> of<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.040> rocket<00:03:00.160> but

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
influence the weight of the rocket but

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.770 
influence the weight of the rocket but
we<00:03:00.550> are<00:03:00.700> gonna<00:03:00.850> add<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> little<00:03:01.300> bit<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.570> weight

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
we are gonna add a little bit of weight

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.240
