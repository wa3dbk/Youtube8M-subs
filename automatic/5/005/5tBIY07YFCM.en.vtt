00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:10.339 
about the attack position I see a lot of

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.560 
about the attack position I see a lot of
novice<00:00:11.339> and<00:00:11.670> beginning<00:00:11.969> mountain<00:00:12.240> bikers

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
starts to get a little steeper and they

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.100 
starts to get a little steeper and they
start<00:00:17.190> getting<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.400> little<00:00:17.430> apprehensive

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
where when you get a prehensile you

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.360 
where when you get a prehensile you
start<00:00:21.090> leaning<00:00:21.270> back<00:00:21.770> that's<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:22.980> exact

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 
start leaning back that's the exact

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.950 
start leaning back that's the exact
opposite<00:00:23.970> thing<00:00:24.030> you<00:00:24.360> want<00:00:24.540> to<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.930> a

opposite thing you want to do on a

mountain bike when you're going downhill

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.370 
mountain bike when you're going downhill
what<00:00:27.450> you<00:00:27.540> want<00:00:27.690> to<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.050> don't<00:00:28.200> want<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
what you want to do so you don't want to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.440 
what you want to do so you don't want to
lean<00:00:28.500> forward<00:00:28.910> actually<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.030> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.270> be<00:00:30.360> in

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
lean forward actually you want to be in

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.630 
lean forward actually you want to be in
the<00:00:30.540> attack<00:00:30.840> position<00:00:31.320> which<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.590> about<00:00:31.890> 50<00:00:32.309> 50

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the attack position which is about 50 50

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.160 
the attack position which is about 50 50
weight<00:00:32.789> distribution<00:00:33.510> between<00:00:33.660> your<00:00:33.960> front

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
weight distribution between your front

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.009 
weight distribution between your front
and<00:00:34.260> back<00:00:34.410> tires<00:00:34.820> but<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.390> into<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.809> turn

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
and back tires but going into the turn

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.470 
and back tires but going into the turn
it's<00:00:37.289> good<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.679> wait<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.609> front<00:00:38.879> tire<00:00:39.089> so<00:00:39.449> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's good to wait the front tire so that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.090 
it's good to wait the front tire so that
would<00:00:39.749> actually<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.829> weight

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
would actually be a little more weight

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.250 
would actually be a little more weight
on<00:00:41.339> the<00:00:41.489> front<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> exact

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
on the front so that's the exact

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
on the front so that's the exact
opposite<00:00:43.769> of<00:00:44.010> what<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.550> lot<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.850> people

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
opposite of what a lot of people

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
opposite of what a lot of people
actually<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:46.159> so<00:00:47.159> how<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.089> you<00:00:48.379> maintain<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
actually do so how do you maintain that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.529 
actually do so how do you maintain that
attack<00:00:50.190> position<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.969> mountain<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
attack position when the mountain of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.119 
attack position when the mountain of
your<00:00:51.690> gold<00:00:51.899> mountain<00:00:52.170> biking<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.679> it's<00:00:52.829> going

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
your gold mountain biking and it's going

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.009 
your gold mountain biking and it's going
up<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.550> left<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.179> right<00:00:54.269> up<00:00:54.659> and<00:00:54.899> down

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
up and down left and right up and down

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.009 
up and down left and right up and down
left<00:00:55.409> and<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.739> flat<00:00:56.339> down<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.149> it's

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
left and right flat down so it's

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.779 
left and right flat down so it's
basically<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.920> basically<00:00:59.280> need<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
basically you basically need to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.079 
basically you basically need to
continuously<00:01:00.749> adjust<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:02.159> your<00:01:02.460> bike<00:01:02.609> when

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
continuously adjust on your bike when

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.330 
continuously adjust on your bike when
you're<00:01:03.239> mountain<00:01:03.479> biking<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.010> once<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.190> I

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
you're mountain biking and once if I

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.490 
you're mountain biking and once if I
have<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.910> maintain<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.660> attack<00:01:07.020> position

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
have to maintain your attack position

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
have to maintain your attack position
how<00:01:07.620> do<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.950> you're<00:01:08.250> you're<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.030> your

how do you know you're you're in your
attack<00:01:09.540> position<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.380> tip<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.180> when<00:01:12.180> you're

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
attack position one tip is when you're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
attack position one tip is when you're
going<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.870> going<00:01:13.170> downhill<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.710> you're
