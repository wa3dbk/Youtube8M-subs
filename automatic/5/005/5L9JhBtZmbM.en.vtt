move along the ceiling in this room for
a<00:01:29.250> long<00:01:29.460> time<00:01:29.790> before<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.390> finally<00:01:30.689> zapped

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
a long time before it finally zapped

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.039 
a long time before it finally zapped
back<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.579> my<00:01:32.729> character<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.689> stuck<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
back down to my character I got stuck in

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
back down to my character I got stuck in
this<00:01:34.290> weird<00:01:34.619> void<00:01:34.950> by<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> building<00:01:35.729> where<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this weird void by a building where I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.580 
this weird void by a building where I
couldn't<00:01:36.240> move<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.110> many<00:01:37.290> times

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
couldn't move and there are many times

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
couldn't move and there are many times
where<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:37.979> trying<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> jump<00:01:38.759> off<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
where you're trying to jump off of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700 
where you're trying to jump off of
something<00:01:39.479> where<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.229> character<00:01:40.560> just

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
something where your character just

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
something where your character just
attaches<00:01:41.310> himself<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> random<00:01:42.450> pole<00:01:42.780> or

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
attaches himself to a random pole or

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.539 
attaches himself to a random pole or
something<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.009> difficult<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
something and it's really difficult to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.160 
something and it's really difficult to
move<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:45.119> were<00:01:45.210> many<00:01:45.420> times<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.899> which<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
move there were many times in which I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
move there were many times in which I
tried<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.470> draw<00:01:46.799> my<00:01:47.009> sword<00:01:47.340> why<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> press

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
square over and over again and the sword

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
square over and over again and the sword
would<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.850> draw<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:52.020> once<00:01:52.290> following

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
someone who disappeared right before my

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.499 
someone who disappeared right before my

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
eyes and did not come back there are so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.179 
eyes and did not come back there are so
many<00:01:57.659> glitches<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.380> game<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.009> it's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
many glitches in this game that it's

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
many glitches in this game that it's
honestly<00:01:59.790> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.180> broken<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> worst

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
honestly kind of broken and the worst

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.780 
honestly kind of broken and the worst
part<00:02:01.380> was<00:02:01.469> some<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.890> those<00:02:01.979> glitches<00:02:02.280> weren't

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
part was some of those glitches weren't

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.730 
part was some of those glitches weren't
just<00:02:02.969> annoying<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.840> actually<00:02:04.229> made<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.710> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
just annoying they actually made it so I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.920 
just annoying they actually made it so I
couldn't<00:02:05.040> progress<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.299> had<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.570> actually

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
couldn't progress and I had to actually

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.719 
couldn't progress and I had to actually
restart<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.399> were<00:02:08.489> certain

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
restart because there were certain

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
restart because there were certain
people<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.569> supposed<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.050> looking

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
for that actually vanished from

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.370 
for that actually vanished from
since<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.240> couldn't<00:02:15.240> complete<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.750> objective

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
since I couldn't complete the objective

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.810 
since I couldn't complete the objective
there<00:02:16.680> are<00:02:16.800> also<00:02:16.920> times<00:02:17.310> when<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> game

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
there are also times when the game

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.570 
there are also times when the game
throws<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.390> instructions<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.290> parry<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:19.980> dodge

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
you can do but a lot of it is just

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.890 
you can do but a lot of it is just
running<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.550> set<00:04:08.880> destination<00:04:09.090> running<00:04:09.810> to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
this destination and you can't swing

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.730 
this destination and you can't swing
there<00:04:12.150> like<00:04:12.360> spider-man<00:04:12.780> or<00:04:12.930> use<00:04:13.200> your<00:04:13.320> powers

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
there like spider-man or use your powers

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.620 
there like spider-man or use your powers
like<00:04:13.980> an<00:04:14.100> infamous<00:04:14.550> so<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:15.180> kind<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.390> run

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
like an infamous so you just kind of run

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.330 
like an infamous so you just kind of run
through<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.930> whole<00:04:16.140> bunch<00:04:16.170> of<00:04:16.410> crowds<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
through a whole bunch of crowds and the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.220 
through a whole bunch of crowds and the
collision<00:04:17.760> detection<00:04:17.790> isn't<00:04:18.600> very<00:04:18.810> good<00:04:19.080> and

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
collision detection isn't very good and

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.229 
collision detection isn't very good and
sometimes<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:20.100> can<00:04:20.250> get<00:04:20.400> really<00:04:20.700> cumbersome

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
sometimes that can get really cumbersome

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.280 
sometimes that can get really cumbersome
overall<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.750> wouldn't<00:04:22.049> really<00:04:22.169> recommend

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
overall I wouldn't really recommend

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.960 
overall I wouldn't really recommend
unity<00:04:23.100> if<00:04:23.280> you've<00:04:23.400> never<00:04:23.520> played<00:04:23.790> an
