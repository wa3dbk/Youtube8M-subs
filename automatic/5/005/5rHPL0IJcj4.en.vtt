00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
dash and I wanted it to work like a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.520 
dash and I wanted it to work like a
factory<00:02:40.760> head<00:02:41.120> unit<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.630> look<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:42.500> a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
factory head unit as much as possible so

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.610 
factory head unit as much as possible so
I've<00:02:47.720> got<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.110> set<00:02:48.410> up<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:49.720> when<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.780> turn

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
I've got it set up so that when I turn

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.160 
I've got it set up so that when I turn
the<00:02:51.800> key<00:02:51.830> on<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:55.220> automatically<00:02:56.030> comes<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.720> I

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
the key on it automatically comes on I

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.000

the<00:03:17.300> iPad<00:03:17.690> went<00:03:18.050> straight<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.310> app<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:20.060> I

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the iPad went straight to the app that I

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.770 
the iPad went straight to the app that I
was<00:03:20.420> using<00:03:20.720> which<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.140> Pandora<00:03:25.569> instead<00:03:26.569> of

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
was using which is Pandora instead of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.660 
was using which is Pandora instead of
just<00:03:27.349> going<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.950> lockscreen

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
just going to the lockscreen

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.309 
just going to the lockscreen
and<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.660> achieved<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.410> by<00:03:31.099> using<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:32.330> tweak

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
and I achieved that by using a tweak

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.059 
and I achieved that by using a tweak
called

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
called

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.430 
called
no<00:03:34.489> lockscreen<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.330> believe<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:36.019> what<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.290> was

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
no lockscreen I believe is what it was

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.750 
no lockscreen I believe is what it was
called<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:38.500> then<00:03:42.190> messing<00:03:43.190> around<00:03:43.310> with

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
called and then messing around with

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.500 
called and then messing around with
activator<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.489> using<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.700> tweak<00:03:47.060> course

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
activator and using that tweak course

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.720 
activator and using that tweak course
you'd<00:03:47.630> have<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.900> be<00:03:48.019> jailbroken<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:49.340> get<00:03:49.519> to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
you'd have to be jailbroken to get to

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.210 
you'd have to be jailbroken to get to
get<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.269> tweaks<00:03:50.690> but<00:03:52.480> at<00:03:53.480> any<00:03:53.690> rate<00:03:54.040> we<00:03:55.040> want

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
get the tweaks but at any rate we want

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.160

couple<00:05:54.690> of<00:05:54.870> different<00:05:55.199> colors<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:56.330> they

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
couple of different colors and they

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.620 
couple of different colors and they
ended<00:05:57.449> up<00:05:57.570> getting<00:05:57.810> a<00:05:58.460> local<00:05:59.460> paint<00:05:59.880> shop<00:06:00.210> to

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
ended up getting a local paint shop to

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.250 
ended up getting a local paint shop to
our<00:06:00.960> paint<00:06:01.440> store<00:06:01.800> actually<00:06:02.190> to<00:06:03.050> mix<00:06:04.050> me<00:06:04.229> up

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
our paint store actually to mix me up

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.469 
our paint store actually to mix me up
some<00:06:04.590> paint<00:06:04.860> because<00:06:05.849> we<00:06:05.970> couldn't<00:06:06.300> match<00:06:06.449> the

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
some paint because we couldn't match the

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.520 
some paint because we couldn't match the
factory<00:06:07.320> paint<00:06:07.620> exactly<00:06:07.889> of<00:06:08.720> this<00:06:09.720> panel<00:06:10.080> and

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
factory paint exactly of this panel and

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.339 
factory paint exactly of this panel and
this<00:06:10.949> panel<00:06:11.010> and<00:06:11.699> actually<00:06:12.479> the<00:06:12.690> only<00:06:12.900> two

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
this panel and actually the only two

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:20.020 
this panel and actually the only two
that<00:06:13.800> are<00:06:14.690> the<00:06:15.690> same<00:06:15.930> color<00:06:16.349> in<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:17.490> cab<00:06:17.990> so<00:06:18.990> I

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
that are the same color in the cab so I

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.779 
that are the same color in the cab so I
basically<00:06:21.030> ended<00:06:21.630> up<00:06:21.780> going<00:06:22.020> with<00:06:22.229> this<00:06:22.889> this

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
basically ended up going with this this

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.080 
basically ended up going with this this
color<00:06:24.090> same<00:06:24.780> paint<00:06:25.430> because<00:06:26.430> I<00:06:26.729> think<00:06:26.970> it

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
color same paint because I think it

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.930
