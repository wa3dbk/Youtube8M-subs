00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
stuff like that this is what I recommend

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.000 
stuff like that this is what I recommend
and<00:00:40.030> I'm<00:00:40.930> going<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.080> go<00:00:41.290> through<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.530> relatively

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
and I'm going to go through a relatively

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.329 
and I'm going to go through a relatively
low<00:00:42.400> volume<00:00:42.910> AB<00:00:43.120> routine<00:00:43.570> but<00:00:44.199> that<00:00:45.040> doesn't

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
low volume AB routine but that doesn't

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.799 
low volume AB routine but that doesn't
mean<00:00:45.430> that<00:00:45.489> doing<00:00:45.910> more<00:00:46.150> wouldn't

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
mean that doing more wouldn't

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.689 
mean that doing more wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:47.230> benefit<00:00:47.769> you<00:00:47.890> more<00:00:48.129> I<00:00:48.370> do

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
necessarily benefit you more I do

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.579 
necessarily benefit you more I do
believe<00:00:49.089> that<00:00:49.120> if<00:00:49.479> you<00:00:49.809> do<00:00:49.960> more<00:00:50.110> work<00:00:50.350> more

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
believe that if you do more work more

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.740 
believe that if you do more work more
volume<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:51.220> stuff<00:00:51.460> typically<00:00:51.850> it's<00:00:52.479> better

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
volume and stuff typically it's better

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.740 
volume and stuff typically it's better
for<00:00:52.989> size<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.589> strength<00:00:53.799> on<00:00:54.100> stuff<00:00:54.489> like<00:00:54.790> you

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
for size and strength on stuff like you

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.530 
for size and strength on stuff like you
know<00:00:55.839> abs<00:00:56.110> or<00:00:56.500> curls<00:00:56.890> or<00:00:57.040> something<00:00:57.339> like<00:00:57.460> that

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
know abs or curls or something like that

squatting just feels really terrible and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
squatting just feels really terrible and
off<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.140> normally<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.560> drop<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.769> at<00:02:37.920> the

off and you normally like drop it at the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.620 
off and you normally like drop it at the
top<00:02:38.190> well<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.000> gonna<00:02:39.120> help<00:02:39.330> with<00:02:39.480> that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
top well this is gonna help with that

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.759 
top well this is gonna help with that
can<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.810> think<00:02:39.989> it's<00:02:40.080> gonna<00:02:40.170> help<00:02:40.319> stabilize

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
can I think it's gonna help stabilize

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.500 
can I think it's gonna help stabilize
your<00:02:40.950> core<00:02:41.160> you're<00:02:41.640> gonna<00:02:41.730> probably<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.150> 10

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
your core you're gonna probably do 10

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.410 
your core you're gonna probably do 10
sets<00:02:42.810> or<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.349> be<00:02:43.530> 2<00:02:43.680> sets<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.190> 20<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.940> 30<00:02:45.150> reps

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
sets or to be 2 sets of 20 to 30 reps

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.640 
sets or to be 2 sets of 20 to 30 reps
again<00:02:45.930> I'll<00:02:46.470> go<00:02:46.739> hundreds<00:02:47.239> hundred<00:02:48.239> fifty<00:02:48.540> s

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
again I'll go hundreds hundred fifty s

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.339 
again I'll go hundreds hundred fifty s
something<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:50.780> but<00:02:51.780> often<00:02:52.170> times

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
something like that but often times

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.550 
something like that but often times
we'll<00:02:52.560> just<00:02:52.739> use<00:02:52.890> fifties<00:02:53.690> because<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:55.079> believe

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
we'll just use fifties because I believe

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.380 
we'll just use fifties because I believe
for<00:02:55.739> abs<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.130> not<00:02:56.310> always<00:02:56.549> about<00:02:56.790> pushing

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
for abs it's not always about pushing

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.240 
for abs it's not always about pushing
weights<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.079> trying<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.739> go<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.920> failure<00:02:59.069> and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
weights and trying to go to failure and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.949 
weights and trying to go to failure and
stuff<00:02:59.519> like<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.880> sometimes<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:00.840> just

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
stuff like that sometimes it's just

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.479 
stuff like that sometimes it's just
about<00:03:01.140> actually<00:03:01.739> working<00:03:01.920> your<00:03:02.250> core<00:03:02.430> a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
about actually working your core a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.009 
about actually working your core a
little<00:03:02.670> bit<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.450> little<00:03:03.480> bit<00:03:03.780> more

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
little bit so it's a little bit more

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.620 
little bit so it's a little bit more
just<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.099> little<00:03:05.459> bit<00:03:05.579> bigger<00:03:05.880> stronger<00:03:06.360> than

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
just a little bit bigger stronger than

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.300 
just a little bit bigger stronger than
it<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.170> doesn't<00:03:07.290> need<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.620> taken<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.190> an

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
it was it doesn't need to be taken to an

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.039 
it was it doesn't need to be taken to an
extreme<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.360> needs<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.599> be<00:03:09.690> trained<00:03:09.989> a

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
extreme it just needs to be trained a

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.690 
extreme it just needs to be trained a
little<00:03:10.140> bit<00:03:10.349> more<00:03:10.500> than<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.680> was<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.489> know<00:03:11.579> if

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
little bit more than it was you know if

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.890 
little bit more than it was you know if
you<00:03:11.819> go<00:03:11.910> from<00:03:12.090> doing<00:03:12.299> nothing<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.660> doing

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
you go from doing nothing to doing

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.750 
you go from doing nothing to doing
something<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.410> get<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> benefit<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.579> do<00:03:14.730> a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
something you get a benefit if you do a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.979 
something you get a benefit if you do a
little<00:03:14.910> bit<00:03:15.090> more<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.450> get<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.599> benefit<00:03:15.959> you

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
little bit more you get a benefit you

little bit more you get a benefit you
don't<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.350> go<00:03:16.470> crazy<00:03:16.500> with<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.370> you

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
don't have to go crazy with it like you

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.190 
don't have to go crazy with it like you
would<00:03:17.639> spots<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.180> that's<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> recommend

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
would spots and that's what I recommend

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.580 
would spots and that's what I recommend
for<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.440> exercise<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:20.519> will<00:03:21.470> train<00:03:22.470> your

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
for this exercise it will train your

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.039 
for this exercise it will train your
obliques<00:03:22.920> which<00:03:23.579> will<00:03:23.760> make<00:03:23.880> them<00:03:24.030> grow<00:03:24.209> which

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
obliques which will make them grow which

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.050 
obliques which will make them grow which
some<00:03:25.350> people<00:03:25.470> think<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.859> bad<00:03:26.040> your<00:03:26.760> obliques

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
some people think is bad your obliques

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.460 
some people think is bad your obliques
aren't<00:03:27.329> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.510> get<00:03:27.630> wider<00:03:28.019> than<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.410> hips
