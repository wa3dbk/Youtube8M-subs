00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
screen capture because of the

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.620 
screen capture because of the
limitations<00:05:32.310> of<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.610> software<00:05:33.180> I'm<00:05:33.300> using<00:05:34.550> so

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
limitations of the software I'm using so

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.520 
limitations of the software I'm using so
that's<00:05:36.630> pretty<00:05:36.870> much<00:05:36.990> everything<00:05:37.169> you<00:05:37.500> need

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
that's pretty much everything you need

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.060 
that's pretty much everything you need
to<00:05:37.800> know<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.460> emulator<00:05:39.330> itself<00:05:40.070> doesn't

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
to know the emulator itself doesn't

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.350 
to know the emulator itself doesn't
actually<00:05:42.080> require<00:05:43.080> much<00:05:43.710> configuration<00:05:44.699> but

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
actually require much configuration but

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.010 
actually require much configuration but
there<00:05:45.840> is<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.110> number<00:05:46.680> of<00:05:46.949> configurations<00:05:48.020> for

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
there is a number of configurations for

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.570 
there is a number of configurations for

frequency input options including
controller<00:05:57.300> support<00:05:59.210> but<00:06:00.210> you'll<00:06:00.389> need<00:06:00.570> to

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
controller support but you'll need to

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.279 
controller support but you'll need to
root<00:06:01.169> your<00:06:01.349> phone<00:06:01.770> for<00:06:02.039> that<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.220> believe<00:06:03.289> the
