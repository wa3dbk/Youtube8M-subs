 Shake state screw called Chakri

 Always take a line near the foot and acne, and try to explore the foot and feet 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.259
 We introduce 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 Since the line stuck would definition comes floating Tteyuu the last minute of the ring goes around the other 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.090
 By assumption 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.610
 Even if it comes before the event, it will take a little line and this will become a hit

 Because the video is also so that employees go the first time a little out
