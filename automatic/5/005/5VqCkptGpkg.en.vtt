lot more detail on there like that older

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.759 
lot more detail on there like that older
figures<00:03:07.820> did<00:03:08.060> head<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.260> pretty<00:03:09.560> much<00:03:09.680> just

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
figures did head so I pretty much just

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.940 
figures did head so I pretty much just
keep<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.160> inside<00:03:10.280> will<00:03:10.670> really<00:03:11.650> show<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.680> too

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
keep it inside will really show it too

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.770 
keep it inside will really show it too
often<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.790> got<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.269> will<00:03:14.480> cable

stick out there and is is the back part
of<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.220> spine<00:03:20.049> pigs<00:03:21.049> in<00:03:21.200> with<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.440> nice<00:03:21.560> sized

of the spine pigs in with a nice sized
peg<00:03:22.100> there<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.980> pick<00:03:25.190> right<00:03:25.370> there<00:03:25.400> as

peg there so just pick right there as
good<00:03:25.970> as<00:03:26.060> new<00:03:26.209> now<00:03:27.430> moving<00:03:28.430> down<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.880> back

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
good as new now moving down the back

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.440 
good as new now moving down the back
here<00:03:29.600> just<00:03:30.410> but<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:31.459> got<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.700> nice<00:03:31.850> bendy<00:03:32.299> wire

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
here just but you got a nice bendy wire

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.120 
here just but you got a nice bendy wire
tail<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:34.670> get<00:03:34.850> some<00:03:34.880> nice<00:03:35.829> ND<00:03:36.829> action

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
tail so you get some nice ND action

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.310 
tail so you get some nice ND action
going<00:03:37.340> on<00:03:37.459> there<00:03:37.700> now<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.600> goes<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.840> maybe

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
going on there now it goes to maybe

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.670 
going on there now it goes to maybe
about<00:03:39.590> right<00:03:40.250> here<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:41.180> tip<00:03:41.390> this<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.530> just

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
about right here the tip this is just

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.790 
about right here the tip this is just
rubbery<00:03:43.720> there's<00:03:44.720> no<00:03:44.870> bendy<00:03:45.140> wire<00:03:45.290> there<00:03:45.560> so

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
rubbery there's no bendy wire there so

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
rubbery there's no bendy wire there so
they<00:03:47.700> keep<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.120> mind<00:03:50.630> see<00:03:51.630> he<00:03:51.810> has

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
they keep that in mind see he has

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.560 
they keep that in mind see he has
shoulders<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.470> like<00:03:55.470> pinon<00:03:55.800> ball<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.270> I<00:03:57.300> get

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
shoulders on a like pinon ball so I get

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.290 
shoulders on a like pinon ball so I get
full<00:03:58.410> range<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:59.040> motion<00:03:59.100> there<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.120> got

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
full range of motion there and you got

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.840 
full range of motion there and you got
little<00:04:01.250> almost<00:04:02.250> ratchet<00:04:04.220> e-motion<00:04:05.220> movement

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
little almost ratchet e-motion movement

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.910 
little almost ratchet e-motion movement
going<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.840> he<00:04:07.230> has<00:04:07.760> double<00:04:08.760> jointed<00:04:09.000> elbow

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
going on and he has double jointed elbow

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.650 
going on and he has double jointed elbow
it's<00:04:10.920> like<00:04:11.130> two<00:04:11.460> balls<00:04:11.880> when<00:04:12.210> I<00:04:12.300> there<00:04:12.510> when

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
it's like two balls when I there when

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.100 
it's like two balls when I there when
aight<00:04:12.750> there<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.380> can<00:04:13.560> move<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:14.780> so<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.019> you

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
aight there you can move it so so you

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.890 
aight there you can move it so so you
get<00:04:16.230> a<00:04:16.260> good<00:04:16.380> down<00:04:16.590> over<00:04:16.920> there<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:18.720> got

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
get a good down over there and you got

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.960 
get a good down over there and you got
this<00:04:19.170> little<00:04:19.410> thing<00:04:19.709> right<00:04:19.739> here<00:04:19.920> which<00:04:20.760> isn't

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
this little thing right here which isn't

was done on the older figures so you

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.310 
was done on the older figures so you
could<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.580> lot<00:04:26.820> more<00:04:27.000> free<00:04:27.570> movement<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.290> of

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
could a lot more free movement out of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.150 
could a lot more free movement out of
the<00:04:28.610> hands<00:04:29.610> here<00:04:29.730> which<00:04:30.570> is<00:04:30.660> quite<00:04:30.840> nice<00:04:31.160> and

a nice little twisty year on the ankle
yeah<00:05:21.740> doesn't<00:05:22.740> really<00:05:23.340> move<00:05:23.700> back<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:24.840> forth

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
yeah doesn't really move back and forth

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.420 
yeah doesn't really move back and forth
too<00:05:25.260> much<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.710> just<00:05:25.890> feels<00:05:26.010> like<00:05:26.130> it's<00:05:26.220> on<00:05:26.370> a

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
too much it just feels like it's on a

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.800 
too much it just feels like it's on a
solid<00:05:26.669> peg<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:27.240> i<00:05:27.300> could<00:05:27.450> just<00:05:27.510> turn<00:05:27.600> around

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
solid peg so i could just turn around

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.750 
solid peg so i could just turn around
but<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.740> toes<00:05:28.950> do<00:05:29.280> move<00:05:29.580> up<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.000> down<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.900> that

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
but the toes do move up and down so that

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.950 
but the toes do move up and down so that
will<00:05:32.760> make<00:05:32.910> up<00:05:33.090> for<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.390> a<00:05:33.419> bit<00:05:33.570> in<00:05:33.750> the

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
will make up for it a bit in the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.450 
will make up for it a bit in the
articulation<00:05:34.710> area<00:05:35.160> down<00:05:35.370> there<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.190> that

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
articulation area down there so that

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.090 
articulation area down there so that
pretty<00:05:38.700> much<00:05:38.820> however<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.919> figure<00:05:40.919> is<00:05:41.070> a

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
pretty much however the figure is a

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.220 
pretty much however the figure is a
whole

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.320 

let's<00:05:45.230> just<00:05:45.320> stand<00:05:45.680> them<00:05:45.890> here<00:05:47.560> best<00:05:48.560> I<00:05:48.680> can

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
let's just stand them here best I can

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.580 
let's just stand them here best I can
now<00:05:50.330> he<00:05:50.390> will<00:05:50.600> have<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:50.810> bit<00:05:51.050> trouble<00:05:51.350> standing

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
now he will have a bit trouble standing

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.110 
now he will have a bit trouble standing
because<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:52.100> his<00:05:52.220> feet<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.670> this<00:05:52.910> little

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
because of his feet and this little

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.140 
because of his feet and this little
thing<00:05:53.360> is<00:05:53.480> a<00:05:53.510> little<00:05:53.570> loose<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:55.370> does<00:05:55.910> help

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
thing is a little loose so it does help

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.710 
thing is a little loose so it does help
to<00:05:56.210> have<00:05:56.420> the<00:05:57.220> tails<00:05:58.220> slightly<00:05:58.880> a<00:05:58.910> support<00:05:59.420> so

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
to have the tails slightly a support so

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.550 
to have the tails slightly a support so
when<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.020> have<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.230> on<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.410> shelf<00:06:02.380> maybe<00:06:03.380> do

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
when you have it on the shelf maybe do

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.720 
when you have it on the shelf maybe do
that<00:06:03.710> like<00:06:03.920> bend<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:04.220> knees<00:06:04.400> a<00:06:04.430> little<00:06:04.580> bit

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
that like bend the knees a little bit

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.570 
that like bend the knees a little bit
what<00:06:05.270> not<00:06:05.950> all<00:06:06.950> right<00:06:07.100> let's<00:06:07.280> have<00:06:07.400> a<00:06:07.460> little

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
what not all right let's have a little

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.800 
what not all right let's have a little
size<00:06:07.850> comparison<00:06:07.880> with<00:06:08.540> the<00:06:08.840> printer<00:06:10.750> now<00:06:11.750> the

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
size comparison with the printer now the

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.800 
size comparison with the printer now the
aliens<00:06:12.470> legs<00:06:12.890> are<00:06:13.070> slightly<00:06:13.310> bent<00:06:13.510> so<00:06:14.510> he

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
aliens legs are slightly bent so he

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.540 
aliens legs are slightly bent so he
would<00:06:14.930> be<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.110> little<00:06:15.290> bit<00:06:15.440> taller<00:06:15.470> I<00:06:15.980> things<00:06:16.400> be

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
would be a little bit taller I things be

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.340 
would be a little bit taller I things be
a<00:06:16.580> lot<00:06:16.730> a<00:06:16.760> bit<00:06:17.090> more<00:06:17.210> taller<00:06:17.420> than<00:06:17.660> the<00:06:17.840> knees

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
a lot a bit more taller than the knees

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.870 
a lot a bit more taller than the knees
right<00:06:18.470> now<00:06:18.530> to<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.860> per<00:06:18.980> degree<00:06:19.190> uh<00:06:19.960> he<00:06:21.880> was

the undetailed little mouthpiece that
sticks<00:06:51.410> out<00:06:51.850> slightly<00:06:52.850> weak<00:06:53.750> ankles<00:06:54.220> and<00:06:55.220> feet

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
sticks out slightly weak ankles and feet
