00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.010
 and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 ah 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.330
 well everything works here 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.939
 commenting and good today I bring you here what 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.900
 which is a scheme of how to improve the 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.180
 wind stick and how can you see there 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.370
 there are the steps 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.260
 and he who does not understand it, I'm going to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.810
 explain and you do not have to see again 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.420
 the video more only if you see it 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.940
 Once the first thing to do is go to 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.750
 pick up from your door the door is 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.910
 until this is the one of the titan and 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.559
 pick up the piece once we have 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.540
 picked up the piece we will have to go to 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.840
 assemble what is the cane work 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.840
 of dad 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.380
 once we take the cane we will have 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.270
 what to do next we'll have to go 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.750
 to the crazy world and in the fair part 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.600
 crazy world right as you can see 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.180
 that there are two there are two stairs and that the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.280
 right part and you have to put the 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.130
 next piece 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.159
 there is common but without the top stick 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.110
 and a little dot as you can see in the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.659
 scheme or I put stereo so you know 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 why you have to start and also 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.650
 I put inside so you know which one 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.040
 is the one that has to end and well what 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.320
 I'm slow for you to see 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.790
 the second is this is a little dot 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.790
 the third are two l 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 the truth is already written 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.590
 so that I saw it and well 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.110
 has installed him and the last one would be two 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.110
 sticks 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.819
 and nothing that you say how to talk to the girl 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:09.390
 and that is to say that you already have a part of what 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.120
 what 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.879
 of what the wind stick will improve 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.299
 and good then we will have to leave 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.940
 and shoot three pieces so there's 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.349
 to distribute on the map but usually 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.709
 be by the titan zone in the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.709
 first 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.200
 and right now I will say what they are once 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.200
 let's get out of here 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.970
 ok here is the first piece right in 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.550
 the titan in the generator number 4 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.050
 and once I shot him, you will follow 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.860
 the second piece that is right on the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.080
 trench 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.850
 and you can shoot him 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.900
 and the third one is right next to 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.810
 generated number 5 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.989
 is very close to the second and you will have 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.329
 to shoot you until you art like 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.329
 as a challenge like what you see is something 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.810
 different and once you have done 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.900
 that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 you have to go down the pack to pound and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.980
 you will have to put the four colors 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.840
 same in yellow and shoot at the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.880
 ball that once you have shot it to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.880
 the sphere that is expected to go to the crazy world 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.610
 where we can leave a cane once 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.099
 we see the cane and kill about 25-30 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.380
 I do not know how many are exact we can 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.700
 pick it up and we'll have the cane 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.620
 improvement 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.459
 and well I hope you liked it and 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.500
 Then I will upload the other canes and 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.780
 If you liked it, you already know how to vote 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.860
 like and good see you next 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.280
 kids 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.280
 a greeting
