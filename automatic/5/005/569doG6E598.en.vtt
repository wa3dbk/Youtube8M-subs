 x2014 second generation the only 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.529
 requirement is to have the bootloader 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.019
 unlocked ok 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.340
 I have not decided to do a tutorial about 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.529
 how to unlock the bootloader because 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.809
 youtube is already full of tutorials 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.090
 about that these carry the same 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 very simple procedure just look for yourself 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.750
 a tutorial 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.000
 understandable and it's very very fast ok 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
 then the only requirement and download 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.070
 these two files that I'll leave you in 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.620
 the description of the video would be the fast 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.050
 boot adb ok which is for flashing by adv 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.010
 this file that is an img point that is 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.879
 called moto x root ok now on my motorcycle x 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.750
 is running android 4.4 point 4 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.600
 kitkat and this is from the telcel version 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.030
 ok here gave me Mexico then already 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.680
 having these two files equal you 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.440
 you can try several versions 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 different and it will work ok is 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.190
 for kit kat in lollipop leads to another 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 another procedure then just for 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.000
 remove now already having these two 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:31.020
 files we are going to open the folder to dv 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.670
 and we are going to drag 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.609
 the img file called moto x root 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.770
 inside this folder ok already when it's 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:44.579
 inside the folder here we have it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.159
 selected we are going to select what 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.920
 that nothing is selected and we are going to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.079
 put our phone in facebook mode 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.479
 how are we going to do we are going to press 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.170
 the volume key minus the key 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.259
 volume down 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.590
 together with the power key ok now 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.990
 there are two ways one is since your 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.570
 phone is simply on 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.920
 you leave pressed it goes off and after 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.520
 about five seconds it goes into mode 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.060
 Facebook 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.250
 the other is to turn off your phone first and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.080
 already when it's off you press during 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.850
 two or three seconds like it gets to 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.230
 facebook is very simple 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.420
 I think most of us know how to do it 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.099
 you answer your phone in fast boot mode 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.620
 you connect it to the computer there is already 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.030
 he recognized me and here in this 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.040
 folder in this space that is in 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.790
 white let's press the shift key 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.890
 and we're going to right click on our 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.599
 mouse ok 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.549
 if you notice here it gives us an option that 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.379
 says open command window here 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.780
 let's open a command window md 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.700
 to flash 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.130
 a command that is the one that is going to 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.780
 shoot this file, let's open 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.100
 command window we select 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.100
 open the command window 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.740
 and now we have to put the command in 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.530
 This space 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:15.440
 ok what are we going to do we are going to 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:18.860
 put fast boot space boot 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.420
 space and we're going to put the name in 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.490
 this case of the file that we're going to 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.820
 flashing the debit that would be moto x 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.820
 root 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.400
 this goes without spaces like the name 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.640
 next to moto x route and that's why I said 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.710
 the importance of the point img here if not 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.930
 we put the point of m &amp; g not to flash already 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.230
 that they would not recognize it and we're going to 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.990
 put point and in axis and we are going to give 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.650
 enter ok 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.440
 there is your phone at this time 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.160
 restart with a crise power image 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.220
 android 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.220
 and this one starts with the wood animation 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.210
 ok there is 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.200
 can you start with the image of 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.830
 bootloader unlocked this already what 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.830
 we can close 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.100

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.560
 start normally there is what 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.200
 detected and we went to the phone to 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.630
 download the super zoom app and 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.210
