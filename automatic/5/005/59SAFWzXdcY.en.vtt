00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.940
 so start our video review 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 Duff 2 long-awaited new replacement 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.599
 the legendary dj g3 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.450
 which more than two years has been very 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.470
 popularity among our users 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:23.490
 among other buyers 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:26.189
 92 f2 looks like this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:34.649
 first it from the inside 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:39.270
 then immediately compare it with g3 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.540
 collapsible into the battery case of 3000 when 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.530
 stored battery reduced the case on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.059
 3 millimeters 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.840
 which is very useful here so it looks 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.440
 behind here we see a 4g antenna 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:01.850
 made in 3d printing two slots for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.850
 sim card sd card slot 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:14.170
 This is the most important building 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.320
 we know this is what distinguishes g and f 2 from 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:23.300
 models 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:26.390
 g3 g3s g3s so compare by design 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.700
 Of course, they are a bit like these 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.070
 there are panels here and there from above below 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.110
 but if you take the size of it of course 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.750
 the difference is big like this we see that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.479
 it is higher in the two above two 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.380
 wider but the biggest plus is that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.380
 2 much thinner 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.979
 if you can see so you can see 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.110
 much thinner by 3 millimeters thickness 8 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:02.270
 and 9 millimeters all the more he is a little 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:07.369
 this one is not so rounded 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.490
 It looks like the back in 2 came up with the top 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.010
 do 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.660
 micro usb connector like all 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.640
 the rest was from below 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.370
 Buttons also turn on and volume here 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.840
 all one side right 94 here 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.540
 main switch on volume 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 the differences are apart from the size let's 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.260
 turn on let's see the screen resolution 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.990
 they are of course the same but the size is quite 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.270
 different from this 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.160
 5 inches gucci 3 4 and a half inches here 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.860
 maybe in terms of brightness and contrast they 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.430
 similar in performance, of course 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:00.360
 although the processors also seem to have 4 cores and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:04.910
 this and that teach the rice processor what 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.650
 582 and in 2, too, the process that 582 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.730
 enough normal processor is possible 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.980
 it will soon be reset to pain but updated 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.090
 4 cores 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.980
 average user principle 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.020
 suits but f-22 16 2 gigabytes 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.930
 RAM and 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.740
 and then one gigabyte of RAM and everything 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.440
 four gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.570
 more here we can take pictures already 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.930
 without inserting the sd card as needed 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.930
 the rest 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:45.800
 phones here in principle 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.800
 the main difference is the size 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.700
 RAM memory is still in contrast to this 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.820
 front camera here she is already 5 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.800
 megapixels in the third te megapixel 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.250
 plus it is clearly visible the difference 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.770
 between these cameras 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.290
 and of course the difference as this 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:10.730
 the phone was simultaneously released by dj 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:16.670
 time try to dps he is already much better 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:19.910
 catches than g3 g-4 g-5 with 2 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:24.620
 go 6 all the other very phones 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.230
 now very good gps connection with dj 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.150
 3 Judea f2 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:33.110
 so here is such a light phone 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.350
 can advise antutu let's 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.490
 let's see how much the principle shows 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:45.440
 for this processor and antutu about 18,000 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.940
 shows that 1 is 2 phones because 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.419
 that the resolution is the same processors 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:56.950
 almost 19,000 are the same all information 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.950
 android 4 4 2 is already worth 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.220
 well principle 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.449
 batteries 3000 and there and there well thickness 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.280
 so different, of course, few 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.319
 will want to stay on the third or 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.160
 choose new che third there is a new climb 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.560
 gl2 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.449
 on screen size you can now 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.449
 see when they turned on the shoes 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.520
 here we see the difference 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.729
 where the screen ends where this on 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.729
 the width of the rims is much smaller here less 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.190
 and here we have a lot of vodka width therefore 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.280
 This phone is certainly much nicer 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.880
 sensations another interesting novel for dj 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.970
 This is the back cover 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.610
 grooved or call it too 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.620
 principle pleasant unusual but pleasant 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.620
 here we have the usual plastic behind 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.800
 therefore, we recommend taking gl2 already a lot 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.889
 There were pre-orders there will be many more 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.889
 thank you for your attention bye
