 stand up for protection from the village deputy 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.670
 Armenia more comfort and luxury 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.950
 as you probably thought that in tips 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 no big deal but these racers they they 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.740
 were created abandoned 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.340
 lab conditionally received 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.049
 a set that died in its walls like 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.549
 here the test zones must pass full 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.380
 the power to enslave the world 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.159
 then and then when you get to 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.899
 a certain point now i'm 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.030
 I will think that he will already prove that there is no and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.340
 descendants and then again an unexpected turn 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.349
 such a plot 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.969
 an assortment of screen tragedies performed in 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.989
 the same style as its predecessors 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.739
 the only difference is poor graphics and lack 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.279
 the plot of small locations and dialing 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:23.740
 diverse 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.020
 place unrelated 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.500
 but on the game there are pluses judge for yourself the more 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.890
 trimmed with 1 7 less bank in it I agree 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.349
 n 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.060
 at home for this exciting bodies 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.540

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.389
 after completion 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.930
 visitors in a year two 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.250
 exciting adventure in what 50 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.070

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.460
 deadly traps capable 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.170
 turn dodos notice 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.400
 for a dish teriyaki sauce of sticks 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.950
 cinnamon and a pinch of white sesame 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.209
 for piquancy hryvnia something I 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.330
 rejected then they already proceeded to 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.819
 power line 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.939
 Andrea berg it is almost like angry birds only 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.529
 Evil parade I played Volga in order not to 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.059
 Only there are developers 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.299
 argue that the game develops but what 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.519
 they are the ones who can arrange this island 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.620
 the task seems to be simple now 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.840
 to solve puzzles 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.769
 calculate moves in advance so as not to 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.870
 laptops fell into the abyss and 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.109
 scary control curve graphics 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.790
 the price of 10 bucks just does not give to go no 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.819
 the end i'm this game worth noting that if u 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.639
 you had a beard she was the most 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.049
 diverse protagonist of the game 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.199
 self defense 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.519
 that's why Iâ€™m getting round for tea 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.919
 chambers at the demand of our channel activists 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.219
 Shareholders Accredited Created 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:45.500
 as the god said 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.640
 how passes these big fingers can 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.010
 to stop the likes of my people so that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.300
 he flourished for some reason filled with joy 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.400
 for my blessing for this he 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.180
 earns before meeting
