00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.149 
powder filler deal and on the other side
it<00:01:43.409> says<00:01:43.439> cold<00:01:43.979> steel<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.610> Taiwan<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.040> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it says cold steel and Taiwan so it is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.710 
it says cold steel and Taiwan so it is
made<00:01:47.340> overseas<00:01:47.579> probably<00:01:48.420> while<00:01:48.570> they're

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
made overseas probably while they're

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
made overseas probably while they're
getting<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> two<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.200> cheap<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.829> far<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
getting the two is so cheap as far as a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
getting the two is so cheap as far as a
price<00:01:50.610> point<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.960> molded

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
price point on it it is just a molded

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
price point on it it is just a molded
handle<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> hundred<00:01:53.399> percent<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
handle I'm not a hundred percent if it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.609 
handle I'm not a hundred percent if it
has<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> full<00:01:54.420> tank<00:01:54.630> or<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.170> would<00:01:55.229> imagine

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
has a full tank or not I would imagine

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.260 
has a full tank or not I would imagine
that<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.670> probably<00:01:56.880> stop<00:01:57.240> somewhere

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that it would probably stop somewhere

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.270 
that it would probably stop somewhere
right<00:01:57.750> around<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.979> molded

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
right around here and just be molded

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.679 
right around here and just be molded
into<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> plastic<00:01:59.549> maybe<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.210> couple<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.509> holes

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
into the plastic maybe a couple of holes

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.050 
into the plastic maybe a couple of holes
drilled<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.200> metal<00:02:01.680> itself<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.850> blade

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
drilled in the metal itself of the blade

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.819 
drilled in the metal itself of the blade
and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.990> injection<00:02:04.439> molding<00:02:04.710> around

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
and then just injection molding around

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.709 
and then just injection molding around
there<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.180> bit<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
there you do have a little bit of a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.080 
there you do have a little bit of a
texture<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.530> handle<00:02:08.000> pretty<00:02:09.000> much

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
texture on the handle pretty much

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.460 
texture on the handle pretty much
comparable<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.020> would<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
comparable to what you would have on a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.589 
comparable to what you would have on a
regular<00:02:10.619> kitchen<00:02:11.129> knife<00:02:11.280> not<00:02:11.879> over<00:02:12.209> grippy

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
regular kitchen knife not over grippy

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.559 
regular kitchen knife not over grippy
but

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
but

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.559 
but
extremely<00:02:14.230> smooth<00:02:14.530> either<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.219> I<00:02:15.579> do<00:02:16.180> want<00:02:16.510> to

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
extremely smooth either so I do want to

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.239 
extremely smooth either so I do want to
say<00:02:16.749> that<00:02:16.959> if<00:02:17.049> you're<00:02:17.200> using<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.799> know<00:02:18.040> for

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:18.249 
say that if you're using it you know for

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.470 
say that if you're using it you know for
cutting<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.549> lot<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.760> meat<00:02:18.909> or<00:02:19.060> sausage

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
cutting a lot of meat or sausage

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.289 
cutting a lot of meat or sausage
something<00:02:19.719> kind<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:19.989> greasy<00:02:20.409> that<00:02:20.980> uh<00:02:21.299> your

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
something kind of greasy that uh your

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.489 
something kind of greasy that uh your
likelihood<00:02:22.659> of<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:23.019> slipping<00:02:23.200> out<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.379> your

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:23.499 
likelihood of just slipping out of your

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.259 
likelihood of just slipping out of your
hand<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.829> pretty<00:02:24.040> good<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.730> would<00:02:24.939> guess<00:02:25.120> if

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
hand is pretty good I would guess if

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.059 
hand is pretty good I would guess if
you're<00:02:25.389> not<00:02:25.510> careful<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.439> do<00:02:26.560> have<00:02:26.680> kind<00:02:26.859> of<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
you're not careful you do have kind of a

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.280 
you're not careful you do have kind of a
big<00:02:27.340> area<00:02:27.909> down<00:02:28.389> here<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.689> fit<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:28.959> your<00:02:29.049> palm

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
big area down here to fit in your palm

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.569 
big area down here to fit in your palm
so<00:02:29.319> that<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.769> kind<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:29.980> nice<00:02:30.159> you<00:02:30.189> can<00:02:30.400> see<00:02:30.519> how

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
so that is kind of nice you can see how

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.099 
so that is kind of nice you can see how
the<00:02:30.639> handle<00:02:31.060> bows<00:02:31.209> out<00:02:31.450> down<00:02:31.629> here<00:02:31.780> towards

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
the handle bows out down here towards

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.899 
the handle bows out down here towards
the<00:02:32.139> end<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:32.680> fits<00:02:33.579> in<00:02:33.670> your<00:02:33.730> hand

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
the end and just fits in your hand

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.369 
the end and just fits in your hand
pretty<00:02:34.060> good<00:02:34.329> you<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:35.049> some<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.319> that

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
pretty good you have some of that

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.170 
pretty good you have some of that
jumping<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.980> here<00:02:36.159> at<00:02:36.219> the<00:02:36.310> top<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:36.849> that<00:02:36.879> works

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
jumping up here at the top so that works

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.069 
jumping up here at the top so that works
out<00:02:37.299> pretty<00:02:37.540> nice<00:02:37.889> and<00:02:38.889> you<00:02:39.099> do<00:02:39.219> have<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.639> pretty

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
out pretty nice and you do have a pretty

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.050 
out pretty nice and you do have a pretty
steep<00:02:41.079> angle<00:02:41.560> here<00:02:41.919> it's<00:02:42.430> not<00:02:42.609> uncomfortable

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
steep angle here it's not uncomfortable

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.699 
steep angle here it's not uncomfortable
but<00:02:43.569> steep<00:02:43.780> enough<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.049> keep<00:02:44.169> your<00:02:44.319> hand<00:02:44.530> from

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
but steep enough to keep your hand from

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.920 
but steep enough to keep your hand from
riding<00:02:44.919> up<00:02:45.099> on<00:02:45.249> the<00:02:45.310> blade<00:02:45.579> so<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.840> an

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
riding up on the blade so this is an

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.869 
riding up on the blade so this is an
extra<00:02:47.169> little<00:02:47.349> feature<00:02:47.530> pretty<00:02:47.919> nice<00:02:48.129> and<00:02:48.400> a

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
extra little feature pretty nice and a

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.390 
extra little feature pretty nice and a
point<00:02:49.269> here<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:50.049> getting<00:02:50.530> piercing<00:02:51.099> kind<00:02:51.310> of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
point here for getting piercing kind of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.280 
point here for getting piercing kind of
digging<00:02:51.669> it<00:02:51.790> small<00:02:52.030> tasks<00:02:52.719> and<00:02:52.930> stuff<00:02:53.139> like

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
digging it small tasks and stuff like

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.770 
digging it small tasks and stuff like
that<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:53.949> don't<00:02:54.669> do<00:02:54.909> specifics<00:02:55.510> really

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
that so don't do specifics really

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.569 
that so don't do specifics really
anything<00:02:55.989> my<00:02:56.230> videos<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.099> specs<00:02:57.430> or

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
anything my videos you know specs or

anything my videos you know specs or
anything<00:02:57.760> like<00:02:57.969> that<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:59.260> one's<00:02:59.469> so<00:02:59.709> far

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
anything like that but this one's so far

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.949 
anything like that but this one's so far
pretty<00:03:00.099> good<00:03:00.400> not<00:03:00.760> sure<00:03:00.909> about<00:03:01.120> them<00:03:01.299> metal<00:03:01.780> or

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
pretty good not sure about them metal or

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.929 
pretty good not sure about them metal or
anything<00:03:02.109> probably<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.680> 420<00:03:03.280> or<00:03:03.400> something<00:03:03.790> you

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
anything probably a 420 or something you

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.209 
anything probably a 420 or something you
can<00:03:04.060> see<00:03:04.239> right<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:05.319> don't<00:03:05.799> think<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.099> can

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:06.219 
can see right here I don't think you can

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.500 
can see right here I don't think you can

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
see that with a naked eye but you can

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.720 
see that with a naked eye but you can
see<00:03:07.750> an<00:03:07.989> indent<00:03:08.379> where<00:03:08.769> they<00:03:08.949> most<00:03:09.219> likely<00:03:09.549> did

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
see an indent where they most likely did

it with a punch machine I would imagine

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.319 
it with a punch machine I would imagine
it's<00:03:14.980> probably<00:03:15.159> you<00:03:15.579> know<00:03:15.699> like<00:03:16.000> your<00:03:16.180> average

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
it's probably you know like your average

it's probably you know like your average
58<00:03:17.199> to<00:03:17.500> 60<00:03:17.859> kind<00:03:18.069> of<00:03:18.159> deal<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:19.090> let's<00:03:19.479> go<00:03:19.629> ahead

58 to 60 kind of deal and let's go ahead

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.499 
58 to 60 kind of deal and let's go ahead
and<00:03:20.169> start<00:03:20.470> cutting<00:03:20.909> right<00:03:21.909> here<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.239> just<00:03:22.389> got

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:22.509 
and start cutting right here we just got

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.210 
and start cutting right here we just got
a<00:03:22.540> regular<00:03:22.659> filled<00:03:23.049> onion<00:03:23.439> look<00:03:23.979> what<00:03:24.129> you

a regular filled onion look what you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.740 
a regular filled onion look what you
pick<00:03:24.400> up<00:03:24.519> at<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:24.699> grocery<00:03:24.819> store<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.599> it's

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
pick up at the grocery store but it's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.539 
pick up at the grocery store but it's
accents<00:03:26.139> for<00:03:26.259> like<00:03:26.379> salads<00:03:26.799> or<00:03:26.919> sandwiches<00:03:26.949> or

something<00:03:27.669> like<00:03:27.909> that<00:03:29.220> not<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.250> super<00:03:30.699> good

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
something like that not a super good

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.080 
something like that not a super good
chef<00:03:31.120> or<00:03:31.329> anything<00:03:31.509> but<00:03:32.109> you<00:03:32.650> know<00:03:32.970> I'll<00:03:33.970> do

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
chef or anything but you know I'll do

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.710 
chef or anything but you know I'll do
what<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.269> can

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
what I can

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.559 
what I can
so<00:03:34.989> dicing<00:03:35.889> skills<00:03:36.159> are<00:03:36.340> not<00:03:36.489> exactly<00:03:36.939> great

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
so dicing skills are not exactly great

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.059 
so dicing skills are not exactly great
but<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.959> can<00:03:38.079> see<00:03:38.199> that's<00:03:38.409> gotten<00:03:38.919> through

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
but you can see that's gotten through

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.309 
but you can see that's gotten through
pretty<00:03:39.310> effortlessly<00:03:39.879> and<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.079> kind<00:03:41.199> of

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
pretty effortlessly and that is kind of

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.559 
pretty effortlessly and that is kind of
nice<00:03:41.489> especially<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:42.970> kitchen<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.449> mean

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
nice especially in the kitchen I mean

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:44.580 
nice especially in the kitchen I mean

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
something like that you don't want to be

so let's go into small enough you can

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.199 
so let's go into small enough you can
throw<00:03:51.009> right<00:03:51.189> in<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.310> dishwasher<00:03:51.909> you<00:03:52.030> can<00:03:52.060> do

throw right in the dishwasher you can do

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.479 
throw right in the dishwasher you can do
whatever<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:52.599> want<00:03:52.840> with<00:03:53.049> it<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:54.310> know<00:03:54.370> we

whatever you want with it you know we

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.939 
whatever you want with it you know we
have<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.609> cucumber<00:03:54.849> here<00:03:55.469> already<00:03:56.469> cut<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.739> half

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
have a cucumber here already cut in half

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.629 
have a cucumber here already cut in half
for<00:03:57.340> ease<00:03:57.879> of<00:03:57.909> camera<00:03:58.449> use<00:03:58.889> so<00:03:59.889> going<00:04:00.340> push

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
for ease of camera use so going push

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.580 
for ease of camera use so going push
through<00:04:00.939> here<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.719> doesn't<00:04:01.989> have<00:04:02.319> a

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
through here it doesn't have a

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.780 
through here it doesn't have a
completely<00:04:03.159> I<00:04:04.739> guess<00:04:05.739> like<00:04:05.919> a<00:04:05.949> flat<00:04:06.250> brand<00:04:06.609> or

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
completely I guess like a flat brand or

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
completely I guess like a flat brand or
whatever<00:04:06.879> you<00:04:07.150> can<00:04:07.269> see<00:04:07.389> how<00:04:07.449> it<00:04:07.509> does<00:04:07.629> have<00:04:07.750> a

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
whatever you can see how it does have a

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.599 
whatever you can see how it does have a
beveled<00:04:08.139> edge<00:04:08.290> on<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:08.560> but<00:04:09.099> it<00:04:09.189> still<00:04:09.340> cuts

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
beveled edge on it but it still cuts

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.159 
beveled edge on it but it still cuts
pretty<00:04:09.789> good<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.329> know<00:04:10.449> a<00:04:10.539> lot<00:04:10.719> of<00:04:10.750> your<00:04:10.930> chef's

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
pretty good I know a lot of your chef's

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.170 
pretty good I know a lot of your chef's
knives<00:04:11.379> you<00:04:12.129> know<00:04:12.159> for<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.459> Dyson<00:04:12.879> just<00:04:12.909> make

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
knives you know for the Dyson just make

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.360 
knives you know for the Dyson just make
like<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.359> wedge<00:04:13.659> shape<00:04:14.019> but<00:04:14.439> you<00:04:14.680> can<00:04:15.219> get<00:04:15.340> a

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
like a wedge shape but you can get a

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.999 
like a wedge shape but you can get a
Purdy<00:04:16.359> thin<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:17.109> mean<00:04:17.409> you're<00:04:17.530> seeing<00:04:17.739> that

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
Purdy thin I mean you're seeing that

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.920 
Purdy thin I mean you're seeing that
we're<00:04:18.820> getting<00:04:18.909> a<00:04:19.030> pretty<00:04:19.209> good<00:04:19.299> cut<00:04:19.630> on<00:04:19.780> this

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
we're getting a pretty good cut on this

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.430 
we're getting a pretty good cut on this
here<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:22.090> that's<00:04:22.510> pretty<00:04:22.750> good<00:04:22.870> pretty<00:04:23.139> good

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
here so that's pretty good pretty good

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.469 
here so that's pretty good pretty good
slice<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.039> mean<00:04:24.190> much<00:04:24.550> thinner<00:04:24.789> for<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.029> cucumber

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
slice I mean much thinner for a cucumber

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.969 
slice I mean much thinner for a cucumber
I<00:04:25.539> can't<00:04:25.719> imagine<00:04:26.110> being<00:04:26.229> practical<00:04:26.830> for

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
I can't imagine being practical for

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:27.360 
I can't imagine being practical for
anything

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
anything

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.210 
anything
so<00:04:27.699> that<00:04:28.480> works<00:04:28.630> out<00:04:28.810> pretty<00:04:28.990> good<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:30.010> I'm

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
so that works out pretty good and I'm

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.470 
so that works out pretty good and I'm
not<00:04:30.310> going<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.490> be<00:04:30.610> doing<00:04:30.699> any<00:04:30.970> heavy<00:04:31.150> cutting

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
not going to be doing any heavy cutting

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.120 
not going to be doing any heavy cutting
this<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:31.990> vegetables<00:04:32.199> this<00:04:32.620> will<00:04:32.980> be<00:04:33.100> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
this is just vegetables this will be a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:41.900 
this is just vegetables this will be a
kitchen<00:04:33.430> knife<00:04:33.580> also<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.870> let's<00:04:35.770> see<00:04:36.010> here

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.909 

that's<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:43.000> pretty<00:04:43.180> pretty<00:04:43.960> thin<00:04:44.290> slice<00:04:44.620> I've

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
that's a pretty pretty thin slice I've

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.500 
that's a pretty pretty thin slice I've
seen<00:04:45.130> thinner<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.639> some<00:04:45.880> of<00:04:45.940> them<00:04:46.030> commercials

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
seen thinner on some of them commercials

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.050 
seen thinner on some of them commercials
and<00:04:46.690> stuff<00:04:46.720> like<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.260> but<00:04:47.440> no<00:04:47.560> doubt<00:04:47.710> they<00:04:47.860> do

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
and stuff like that but no doubt they do

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.570 
and stuff like that but no doubt they do
150<00:04:49.060> takes<00:04:49.479> on<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.560> don't<00:04:51.430> have<00:04:51.520> that

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580
