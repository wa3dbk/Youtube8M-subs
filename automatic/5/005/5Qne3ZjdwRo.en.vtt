00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.420
 I would like to participate in big heads regularly as 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.929
 that such and the story 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.309
 what do you think it would be possible there are only a few rules 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.800
 basic to respect some pitfalls to avoid at all it's to be funny 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.789
 it is complicated 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.560
 but since it is mainly by default, we must not privilege 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.569
 visual 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.509

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.730
 Sunday of the second line in a Las Vegas pharmacy 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.590
 so I stop there and we could quickly get to the hand 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.800
 but it's a serious setback and the list is not a classic one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.010
 will annoy anyone 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.650
 this is the story of the penguin who asked a good sister to help him 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.250
 help, for example 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.660

 I'm confusing middle east in the name of semenya culture also these skins 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.200
 essential 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.930
 I do not have to pass the certificate we will definitely think if with that the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.920
 culture it was the lybie had gone to the details of the university 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.470
 accompanied by david villa to rule this time it's his policy 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:39.270
 foreigner 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.970
 the tornado is because I'm made for him 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 here 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.280
 it's a bit l dressing up the only diploma that will stop the rescuers 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.050
 were pursuing for hearing this is superior to that of the wii would 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.579
 arrived would have explained 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.250

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 financial crises by pascal derible is collapsed 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.599
 before arriving at a party with the agreement of the authorities it should be 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.099
 there for frederic of this principal allowed indeed the four days 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.550
 after stopping this ministry and I went ahead 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.549
 President 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.199
 the irony the iboxx at the camp of m 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.599
 with one of the fathers of the world but it is because he is always crammed with 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.939
 cabinet why 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.939
 but while no party 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:42.009
 without waiting in the face of attacks by the judges of quotations it is always sacha 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.079
 guitry or jules fox unless a dating agreement will ask questions 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.080
 so 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 who wrote the miserable pm at 6:20 pm 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.230
 for that we will launch in the arena of the device I am stupid jules fox 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:59.469
 so then so then for once it's through the Senate on October 21st 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.210
 nothing to see there can be other causes 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.430
 victor hugo no victor-hugo ever knew unlike the current of 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.440
 the news it is necessary to know a foreign radius of the style launched 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.449
 philippe who did the hardest was commented because in general c 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:18.720
 so I can say c 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.350
 a study of the university of boston in the basin of this set then I'll 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.350
 warn of philips frans in this crazy match to backup heaters 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.859
 APRR 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.420
 but it will be necessary to resume it on the English words 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.150
 haytham not well in full teeth and German will seduce a look study 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.180
 focused on the behavior of crayfish in the marine environment and concluded 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.150
 that evil crayfish lose their sexual ways in the water was too much 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.709
 salty after 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.999
 and there I answer as my wife wal-mart provides the development of areas 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:54.199
 recreational building b 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.629
 the target brest and passionate is soon over wall street hardly 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.669
 been sold with real equality 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.549
 the war is declared between the thickets in the cabinet of m 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.560
 especially it is sometimes mentioned the neighboring niger since April 14 at 20 h 30 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.309
 as for safiya ishaq is the arrival of new glasses 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.849
 it's a political power and the political history the announced of the 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.579
 victory of alassane ouattara 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.400
 as they see it comes alone we remember what is good at 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.629
 the act we have among other measures announced in marseille 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.639
 you can then 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.490
 admit the place it takes is fast but he had especially those realized 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.849
 in a taxi you have to be heard wrong by the forces every day there 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.780
 had to break through but the game was in a cab that goes up to vincennes 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.980
 I hear the voice of loot 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.230
 I doubted that if you liked rtl he meets me src standards he had 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.250
 declared that he is riding a bicycle in Boulogne 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.330
 teammates 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.550
 because 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.500
 certainly while he will also be brought to arbitrate the part of the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.889
 part tennis so be careful must be diplomat 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.360
 it's the guest who will win but they must not be humiliated 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.460
 louise-marie even loser and must get out of the match why do 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.419
 a name certainly not to mention the straw Philippe Bouvard elsewhere 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.789
 so ridiculous this legend philippe bouvard and not at all small ballack 80 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.770
 employees a little side 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.440
 concretely at 1 meter 80 your mouth you want to go to wall street even the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.800
 riparian weathervanes granted a point and robert nouzaret the subject of a call 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.120
 besides when you talk about little ones to store those of my normal life 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.349
 gardner had been held since 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.279
 waterproof and shrubs systematically new balls philippe 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.639
 apple does not know why because I imagine that his never know 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.639
 what 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.270
 short is not bad for reasons 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:56.019
 after the last questions ie the small intestine so the speed 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.180
 the police called simone the moon 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.270
 who was director of the Observatoire de meudon came to talk to us about a 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.940
 new planet now it's the games the games directx I'd like 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.780
 show him my spot is nothing he makes good choice of hard tires for them 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.780
 builders 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.580
 it is true 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.040
 this is our detriment the roach with the ministerial commission put in 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.469
 evidence of sidelines
