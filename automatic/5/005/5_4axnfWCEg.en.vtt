00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 the project nerd mascots are welcome 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 again in the first episode of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.789
 our series of mascots being 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.730
 revised now, right? 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.100
 I've done a bunch of mascots already and here. 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 goes the first version of it the first 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.180
 first mascot being made this is a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 request that he had already made had 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.859
 Made for me a while ago I never 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.050
 I could do it and now here he 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.050
 wanted an escape style character 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.420
 bank or not did not see the movie right and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 I've never read anything about hair either 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.540
 stay I know it's black and white 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 caring and a very drawing style 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.829
 interesting, really cool and the idea 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.690
 was to give a replication in this add 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.230
 a mix between professionals 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 change stuff and create a version 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:03.030
 own and also using a sword to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:08.100
 Thief sword damn rays not 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.060
 so easy it seems jackson this looks lonely 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 that takes time and then he wanted that sword 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 I wanted this style of drawing a hair 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.100
 similar to that one with several things 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.540
 different is one thing and then it was easy 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.210
 apply this type because it is a style that 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.479
 I really like to see it is very nice 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 So it was not difficult, you had a way 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.920
 boring I wanted 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 and even more problems was very good 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.740
 This hand of God, I think you stay. 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.509
 quite satisfied with the hand 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.549
 what good it you think someone 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:44.070
 similar to something else is also this 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.690
 shield and also wanted a circular shield 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.909
 with the spine at the tips 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:54.360
 It is the inter b that is this in my own way and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.670
 also shoes a shoe stay in place of the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.960
 face and even with characters as well 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.539
 detailed in the nightmare of being a drawing 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.640
 simplified with sufficient detail I 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.479
 It was fought there what I was going to do this 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.100
 shield and I ended up leaving nothing on 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.690
 color that gave the end and I was with 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.530
 much doubt how to make this sword 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.880
 but it worked because it's too much 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.920
 long very fast very fast i 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.489
 I wanted to make a brush even I had 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 that looks active did not work out 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.230
 in colors o in colors o main 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.600
 idea is this cause or change things 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.540
 The main idea here was to put 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.989
 things only establish where is to have to 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.350
 kind of leather and after that I would go 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.390
 apply a shade and everything general and 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.500
 one thing I wanted to add is that 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.970
 inside his own naked body. 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.280
 reference has left have the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.890
 different color gradients 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.120
 legault 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.470
 apply this phenomenon also has this 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.300
 that this idea 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.100
 I fought battle battle of thinking 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.490
 because the loot had not defined anything 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.590
 what I was paying here I wanted to do 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.590
 with the exact colors equal cuts 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:24.390
 but eventually I got an album 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.340
 that you called your own was already 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.200
 to create a character that washed face 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.430
 from another 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.680
 are problems that things are 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.660
 different and has an essence be it today 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.330
 the sword will also ring you quite a bit 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.120
 choice was to be even more faithful the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.130
 shoes totally made in the hour design 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.830
 the idea of â€‹â€‹how I would do it but I 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.420
 I like it, it's not tennis, it's not that way. 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.269
 simplified is not so difficult to do 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.890
 and that color shine gray red that I 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.580
 like a lot for making metal spinning 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.350
 things I already used is you 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.120
 I do not know yet very well that the material is 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.260
 But it's something like this with 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.209
 steel and I hope to win up there to her 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.540
 Thank you. I wanted to say that. I'll go. 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.180
 be careful there a little more clearly in this 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.060
 a green glow in the pants or cold 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.540
 but of course also thing was so basic and 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.239
 the shadows I did also straight and for 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.370
 I used it several times pointed out that 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.330
 produces a very straight line in the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.880
 wizard i can give hesitated but 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.610
 I got stolen a job that the museum 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.010
 Brazil, but it continued to be very 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.900
 good 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.760
 with this application of shadows and I 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.000
 I am very satisfied with the result 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.190
 I really liked the colors of the 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.940
 I feel like I could apply 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.040
 well the style and I think we have 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.750
 someone there with the mascot dissatisfied 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.520
 anything anything by heart 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.230
 so I can change it later I can change it 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.620
 for changing the color tone is not something 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.990
 difficult 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.550
 I'm crazy for the next orders already 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:08.810
 They were made several I will 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:11.720
 a 1 to 1 was possible and this 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.900
 that's our first time mascot 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.140
 so that's it folks but your requests 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.340

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.610

 that's it, say stay there with the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.180
