00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.640
 so dear guild wars 2 friends again 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.470
 hide here from mose and de with the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.779
 next world in bars in ours 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.180
 collection of all worlds bosses and though 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.369
 This time it comes to the title sunless 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.599
 you look like my little one 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.060
 Elementalist gets on his way 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.340
 In this year I was high level 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.470
 at this time and not even 60 and 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.690
 Although the whole is in the splitter coast 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.670
 or score smoother so is called the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.270
 about the over region where the whole 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.370
 takes place 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.440
 you see a very brute brought 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.840
 here waiting for me along with the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.820
 community I was there and you will be on 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.260
 level 66 downgraded if you then 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.910
 is not ready it will stop 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.649
 you just stay out of the current 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.140
 level with me I think that was 59 60 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.339
 rum and the whole place you now have 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.660
 I just like the map where you 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.859
 This bus is indeed for the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.079
 most always the most important 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.699
 south of lionstone the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.260
 bloodstream coast once to live through and 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.740
 then you go a spark black swamp 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.540
 level 55 to 65 level range and below 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.020
 at the way with the coast there goes the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.420
 post off 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.500
 there you have to go and yes I'll let you in 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.690
 Bit alone with this boss fight 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.020
 I say a little something to the whole 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.970
 I have with velvet ets recordings once 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.350
 quickly captured for you so you 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.510
 You can see what awaits you there 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.400
 He has so little grips on the left and 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.470
 on the right, they appear ideally 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.540
 then do not kill the whole group 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.760
 is beaten back and it is still coming 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.240
 so little slow edge that one more 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.160
 little cause for concern these big ones 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.290
 I would like to resurrect the undead 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.240
 say and otherwise just hardworking 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.390
 beating the boss again at the end 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.800
 is there a really great box and luddles 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.660
 yes, with a few short sake of it 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.830
 At least where you are, you can 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.090
 I do not want to experience myself either 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.250
 too much to save 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.540
 and there I would say look in and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.680
 wanted to see big in the world 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.140
 meanwhile we already have a small one 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.700
 collection together also amazon.de 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.050
 drop by and of course in 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.880

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.280

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.640
 just want to design such events or 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.200
 Even professional people with us 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.269

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.160
