00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.380 

this<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.360> what<00:01:22.540> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this is what the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.230 
this is what the
these<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.020> hot<00:01:25.230> games<00:01:25.440> now

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.990 

okay<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:31.840> that's<00:01:32.840> pretty<00:01:33.229> much<00:01:33.320> it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
okay and that's pretty much it

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.899 
okay and that's pretty much it
switch<00:01:35.000> your<00:01:35.030> back<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.799> guess<00:01:36.979> if<00:01:37.190> you<00:01:37.369> do

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
switch your back and I guess if you do

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.120

disconnect<00:01:38.450> your<00:01:38.570> state<00:01:39.170> daytime<00:01:39.920> running

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
lights for when it gets dark like at

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.170 
lights for when it gets dark like at
dusk<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.110> just<00:01:45.320> have<00:01:45.440> your<00:01:46.180> halo

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.719 
dusk and you just have your halo
headlights<00:01:47.659> or<00:01:48.110> just<00:01:48.380> angel<00:01:48.740> eyes<00:01:48.979> on<00:01:49.190> this

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
probably what you can do is see I mean

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.660 
probably what you can do is see I mean
they're<00:01:54.200> not<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.619> bright<00:01:54.860> but<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.460> still

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
