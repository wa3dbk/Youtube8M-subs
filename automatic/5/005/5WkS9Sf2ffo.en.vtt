00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
little bit of its luster and then you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.240 
little bit of its luster and then you
see<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> success<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.680> other<00:01:01.829> games<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.190> go

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
see the success of other games you go

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.470 
see the success of other games you go
like<00:01:02.399> hey<00:01:02.550> should<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.730> chase<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.210> should<00:01:03.420> we

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
like hey should we chase that should we

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.000 
like hey should we chase that should we
chase<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.769> things<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
chase this and one of the things that

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.870 
chase this and one of the things that
related<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> stood<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.610> front<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
related to stood up in front of that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640 
related to stood up in front of that
team<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> went<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
team and I when I went up there to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.520 
team and I when I went up there to
Vancouver<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.790> lead<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.600> follow<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
Vancouver was like lead don't follow and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.109 
Vancouver was like lead don't follow and
so<00:01:10.710> let's<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.070> embrace<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.670> gears<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
so let's really embrace what gears is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.090 
so let's really embrace what gears is
and<00:01:12.360> maybe<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.659> means<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and maybe that means that we have a you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.770 
and maybe that means that we have a you
know<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> slightly<00:01:14.970> smaller<00:01:15.270> audience<00:01:15.689> but

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
know a slightly smaller audience but

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.179 
know a slightly smaller audience but
what<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.960> means<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.950> deep

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
what it means is we have much more deep

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
what it means is we have much more deep
in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> passion<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.270> mean<00:01:18.390> how

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
yeah I think you know it's to me it's a

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.660 
yeah I think you know it's to me it's a
it's<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.660> new<00:03:21.810> beginning<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.470> what<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.310> means

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
it's a new beginning so what that means

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.190 
it's a new beginning so what that means
in<00:03:23.850> terms<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.180> endings<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.570> don't<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.079> it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
in terms of endings I don't know but it

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.170 
in terms of endings I don't know but it
it<00:03:25.799> definitely<00:03:26.220> represents<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.790> us<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:27.060> new

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
it definitely represents to us a new

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.910 
it definitely represents to us a new
beginning<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.780> that's<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:28.709> this

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.160 
beginning and I think that's I like this
idea<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.280> sort<00:03:29.609> of<00:03:29.670> delivering<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.780> first<00:03:30.959> at

idea of sort of delivering the first at
its<00:03:31.290> best<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.680> idea<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.190> back<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.609> the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
its best this idea of going back to the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.520 
its best this idea of going back to the
roots<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.120> sort<00:03:33.359> of<00:03:33.390> getting<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.200> audience
