 so that in the streets and 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.969
 highways circulate freight transportation 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.559
 with greater security 15 years ago it was 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.629
 created driver training 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.910
 of heavy vehicles inside the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.710
 training institute evaluation and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 certification in competitions for the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.730
 work on your campus flower bog 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.470
 here the objective is that the drivers 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.020
 do not just learn to drive the unit 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000
 but respect the signs the 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.619
 indicated speed and develop 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.359
 reaction skills before some 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.940
 situation that occurs while they are 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.409
 circulating rubén quintanilla quintanilla 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 who is director of the institute in 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:41.729
 cienega de flores detailed that in this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.649
 complex offers a little over 500 hours 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.229
 of training of which around 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.489
 of 300 are of practice the rest what 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.839
 divide between theory and in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.789
 simulator laboratories where 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.489
 play in preset scenarios 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.260
 or require some in the classrooms of this 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.839
 school the drivers go to take 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 200 hours of theory 30 are done in 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.559
 the laboratories and simulators 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.940
 Interactive and 20 custom hours 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.920
 with an instructor on top of a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.880
 tractor truck in both facilities 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.680
 from the institute as in the street 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.770
 after that they must make a 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.479
 professional practice of 274 hours in 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.670
 any private company that has its 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.350
 own fleet or in some carrier 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.350
 where even most of the cases 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.060
 they end up hired quintanilla 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.009
 quintanilla said that the institute that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.630
 is open to the general public is 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.270
 regulated by the education secretariat 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.470
 public also has the recognition 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.569
 official of the secretariat of 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.250
 communications and transportation to operate 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.750
 as a training center and 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.270
 training of drivers 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.610
 federal motor transport with the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.549
 part of knowledge skills and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.929
 skills positive attitudes towards 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.490
 driving that are professionals in 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.890
 The entire extension of the lever is very 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.409
 important the practice so that they can 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.539
 and to be some professional operators in the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.789
 road in this school there are different 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.770
 modules one of them is the mechanics 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.149
 basic where the pieces show 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.920
 of the trucks with the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.200
 possible damages that a bad driver 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.810
 can cause if it exceeds the speed if 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.069
 falls into wells or also collides 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.140
 instruct to make inspections 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.759
 of their units to avoid 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.730
 possible accidents such as 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.989
 detachment of double trailers 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.750
 since its inception this institute has 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.690
 trained almost 3,200 drivers in 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.610
 courses of between 18 to 20 people 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.680
 the goal according to 15,000 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.750
 quintanilla is that the training does not 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.700
 be seen as an expense but as a 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.380
 investment since the driver is more 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.270
 prepared and aware of how you should 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.520
 handle what translates into savings 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.750
 economic costs due to minor accidents and 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.880
 what it means to leave out 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.700
 circulation a truck is a 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.710
 convenience that the students do not accept 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.230
 the correct functioning of a unit 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.610
 and if the units are currently very 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.010
 sophisticated previously they were very 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.500
 simple right now practically all 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.260
 on computer and electronic then 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.270
 here you see inside the basic course there 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.730
 a basic mechanics course for 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.830
 operators although it is not 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.630
 focused on mechanics is focused on 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.270
 operators is a theoretical-practical course 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.670
 programs of 40 hours the no more in the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.370
 basic mechanics part of the 200 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.050
 hours that the course has around 40 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.450
 are basic mechanics courses is 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.020
 mainly the purpose they know 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.090
