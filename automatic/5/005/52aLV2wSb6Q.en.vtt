00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.340
 how about youtube people on this occasion 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.530
 We will talk about how to recover a 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.200
 stolen device misplaced either 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.690
 windows mac linux or a mobile device 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.900
 ios or android for this task 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.520
 we will use the software called prime 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.980
 It is software that will allow us 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.840
 find our devices to the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.599
 time that we have lost them or in the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.620
 moment when someone has stolen us 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.089
 break as I mentioned was 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.510
 available for all platforms 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:42.229
 most popular you can download it 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.539
 from the downloads section in pride 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.819
 project dotcom I leave the link in 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.780
 the description here is the 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:53.680
 installer for windows 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.699
 linux and for android they can 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.769
 look for it 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.140
 in google play or directly the app 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.850
 store where you can download and install 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.649
 the software 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.190
 at this moment I am going to download the 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.190
 version for mac 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.140
 and save it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.020
 in the center we will open the installer 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.850
 What is it 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.409
 the installation process in others 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.869
 devices is 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.759
 relatively equal or always open 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.759
 double click give the application permissions 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.950
 and follow the steps of the installation in 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.380
 this case asks me if I have a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.020
 user or if I want to use an existing one 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.390
 in the case you must have a new user 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.850
 let's put our name of our 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.770
 email and our password I already have a 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.990
 user created so I'm just going 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.990
 to go to existing user 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.250
 following 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.250
 freixÃ¡ 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.640
 try to ask for the necessary permits 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.180
 to install and we will ask for the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.440
 password 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.260
 ah 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.970
 once finished play will not appear 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.490
 as an application within the system 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.620
 since it is installed as a service of 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.569
 some search on device 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.909
 windows 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.330
 or mac or linux will not appear any 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.490
 result 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.860
 and this is because we do not want anyone 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.840
 give up the pre program is one of those 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.390
 programs that we installed as a precaution 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.240
 and that truthfully we hope you do not need 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.220
 use once done that let's go around 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.650
 on the platform 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.120
 once we enter the platform we go to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.130
 find all the devices that 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.470
 we have connected to the application in this 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.690
 case I have a desktop pc and a 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.670
 phone in the case of the PC 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.010
 desktop then we click on each one 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.840
 from them the details will appear 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.580
 the hardware of my machine 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.800
 the amount of reports that are 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.810
 currently available in the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.940
 configuration in case you can 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.640
 put a name to the desktop pc other 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.709
 name other than the laptop other name 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.019
 unlike the work computer if 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.739
 it's a different computer and the types 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.739
 of devices 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.020
 What is important here is that we can activate 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.540
 or not activate the loss mode when 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.430
 I activate this mode and I will receive a 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.700
 report what happens on my machine 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.680
 every 10 minutes 15 20 30 40 seconds 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.840
 let's just define that we remember that the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.640
 system will only store the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.620
 last 10 reports since we are in 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.410
 a free version we have the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.820
 options for the report to include 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.920
 the geolocation that's important 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.560
 that tells us the exact point where 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.240
 find the person who has our 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.180
 phone or that we only have 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.530
 lost the place where the details are 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.090
 of the network the active connections 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.489
 Wi-Fi points that are close to 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.680
 place if it is trace or does not trace a route 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.739
 of the movement of the machine is going to 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.970
 define as long as you go 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.340
 checking pse in different points of 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.889
 Wifi 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.690
 the session you are logged in to take 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.919
 screenshots of what the person is 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.919
 doing at the moment in which 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.960
 we activate the alarm show us 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.000
 what programs are running the 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.130
 webcam in the event that the device 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.440
 have a webcam what is going to happen is 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.090
 that the system is going to take a picture 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.860
 of the person who stole the 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.470
 machine and of course we will be able to 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.479
 identify it we can also execute 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.010
 some actions like activating an alarm 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.440
 for example if we have lost the phone 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.210
 and we do not know where it is but it's in my 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.370
 house for saying something is in a place 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.080
 where I know that what was left nearby I activated 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.940
 the alarm and then the alarm will start 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.010
 to sound and I can know where my 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.470
 device we can also send you 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.090
 warning messages say for example 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.190
 to the thief 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.199
 this device is wrinkled in my 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.600
 property please contact and it's my 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.010
 email this in the case of 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.380
 that for example of stealing in the 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.840
 device and the thief sent it to 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.040
 someone else know that this 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.040
 device has been stolen 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.580
 we can also block the device 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.200
 in the case of computers not 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.270
 it's always so good to block it because 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.880
 if we need for example that people 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.070
 you connect to the Internet for the 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.240
 connection I can have reports of what 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.570
 what's going on in my machine and for 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.280
 course recover my device in the 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.410
 case of the phones the options 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.770
 they change a bit of course here too 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.810
 we have the geolocation the network to the 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.460
 that the webcam is connected so that 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.890
 take pictures of the person who is 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.680
 sounding the device the alarms the 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.260
 alerts and the option to hide the icon 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.820
 in the bottom of the device this stops 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.310
 do not desist in the application before 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.160
 that we make a request for 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.450
 a report to know who they are 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.970
 adriano where we have left the 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.280
 device when we have lost a 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.650
 device and we request reports the 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.960
 system will start according to the interval of 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.990
 time we have placed the amount 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.210
 of reports that are available 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.530
 currently on the machine those reports 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.870
 They can only be sent if the 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.980
 device is on and connects 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.840
 to Internet 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.790
 depending on the options we have 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.810
 configured in the control panel of 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.670
 each device will appear in this case 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.200
 the location of the person who has the 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.590
 device or where you leave it 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.290
 lost the photograph that is taken without 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.450
 that no alarm is triggered or any 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.450
 message that photograph takes it in 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.100
 automatic screenshot of what 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.350
 that the person is doing with our 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.230
 machine at that time the user in the 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.249
 which is logged the time of the report and 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.889
 the time of the ip from which it is sent 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:04.049
 with this information with five or four 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.909
 similar reports we could locate 

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:08.039
 easily the person who has taken 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.999
 our device or the place where 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.999
 we have left lost 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.700
 this has been all for now remember that 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.560

 to find out what else you would like 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.240
 let's talk in simple tech tips until the 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.240
 next
