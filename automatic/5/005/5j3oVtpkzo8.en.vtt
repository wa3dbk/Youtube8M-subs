00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to do this game similar to that but

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
to do this game similar to that but
instead<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> working<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.119> numbers<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.840> number

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
instead of working on numbers and number

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.740 
instead of working on numbers and number
recognition<00:01:07.640> they<00:01:08.640> could<00:01:08.880> work<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.240> colors

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
recognition they could work on colors

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
recognition they could work on colors
and<00:01:10.020> color<00:01:10.229> recognition<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.220> recognizing

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and color recognition so recognizing

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.600 
and color recognition so recognizing
different<00:01:12.180> colors<00:01:12.780> color<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> polar<00:01:14.280> bears
