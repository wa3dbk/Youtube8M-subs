want<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> change<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> chemistry<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.090> match

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
want to change the chemistry to match

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120 
want to change the chemistry to match
your<00:01:54.509> battery<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.530> example<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.100> am

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
your battery for this example I am

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
your battery for this example I am
charging<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.729> lipo<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.450> wanted<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
charging a lipo but if I wanted to use a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
charging a lipo but if I wanted to use a
different<00:01:58.490> chemistry<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> would<00:01:59.880> press<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
different chemistry I would press the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.880 
different chemistry I would press the
decrease<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.750> increase<00:02:00.780> buttons<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.710> browse
