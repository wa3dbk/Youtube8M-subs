00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
definitely not the most interesting of

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.580 
definitely not the most interesting of
accessories<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.870> still<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.379> that's

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
accessories I still think that that's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.069

doc<00:03:04.950> Ock's<00:03:05.310> backpack<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.450> he<00:03:06.569> has<00:03:06.780> but<00:03:07.049> that

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
doc Ock's backpack that he has but that

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.050 
doc Ock's backpack that he has but that
just<00:03:07.410> kind<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.709> goes<00:03:07.829> without<00:03:08.099> saying<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
just kind of goes without saying the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.880 
just kind of goes without saying the
figure<00:03:09.420> though<00:03:09.629> itself<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.230> actually<00:03:10.620> what<00:03:10.859> I

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
figure though itself is actually what I

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.680 
figure though itself is actually what I
really<00:03:10.980> think<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.849> most<00:03:11.970> impressive<00:03:12.390> I

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
really think is the most impressive I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.110 
really think is the most impressive I
love<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.620> coloring<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.760> black<00:03:15.090> and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
the kind of blue the way that it kind of

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.660 
the kind of blue the way that it kind of
blends<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.690> very<00:03:18.690> very<00:03:19.319> cool<00:03:19.620> looking<00:03:20.010> now<00:03:20.459> one

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
blends in very very cool looking now one

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.920 
blends in very very cool looking now one
thing<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:20.909> I'm<00:03:21.120> having<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.420> problem<00:03:21.599> with<00:03:21.810> his

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
thing that I'm having a problem with his

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.119 
thing that I'm having a problem with his
feet<00:03:22.349> kind<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.829> seemed<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.340> little<00:03:24.150> off<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.890> he

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
feet kind of seemed a little off so he

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.530 
feet kind of seemed a little off so he
doesn't<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:27.319> standing<00:03:28.319> very<00:03:28.890> well<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
doesn't like standing very well so the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.670 
doesn't like standing very well so the
feet<00:03:30.959> may<00:03:31.880> require<00:03:32.880> some<00:03:33.470> re<00:03:35.329> repositioning<00:03:36.329> I

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
feet may require some re repositioning I

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.479 
feet may require some re repositioning I
suppose<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:42.470> don't<00:03:43.470> even<00:03:43.739> know<00:03:43.950> which<00:03:44.099> way<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
suppose I don't even know which way the

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.740 
suppose I don't even know which way the
actual<00:03:44.730> arms<00:03:45.090> supposed<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.450> be<00:03:45.569> is<00:03:45.660> it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
actual arms supposed to be is it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.970 
actual arms supposed to be is it
supposed<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.079> this<00:03:46.230> way<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:47.730> way<00:03:48.980> maybe

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
supposed to be this way that way maybe

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:59.599 
supposed to be this way that way maybe
let's<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:55.760> either<00:03:56.760> way<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:58.099> the<00:03:59.099> feet<00:03:59.430> are

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
let's see either way so the feet are

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.250 
let's see either way so the feet are
really<00:03:59.790> kind<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.269> unfortunate<00:04:00.840> again<00:04:01.049> they<00:04:01.199> do

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.479 
really kind of unfortunate again they do
have<00:04:01.500> big<00:04:01.739> holes<00:04:01.949> so<00:04:02.069> if<00:04:02.129> you<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.400> those

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
have big holes so if you have those

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.740 
have big holes so if you have those
three<00:04:02.699> and<00:04:02.879> three-quarter<00:04:03.269> inch<00:04:03.419> figure

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
three and three-quarter inch figure

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.780 
three and three-quarter inch figure
stands<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.680> definitely<00:04:04.949> fix<00:04:05.579> that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
stands you can definitely fix that

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.270 
stands you can definitely fix that
problem<00:04:06.000> or<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.319> can<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.739> kind<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.069> heat

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
problem or you can just kind of heat

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.069 
problem or you can just kind of heat
this<00:04:08.430> up<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.879> then<00:04:09.000> put<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.239> in<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.419> freezer

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
this up and then put it in a freezer

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.680 
this up and then put it in a freezer
heat<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:10.949> up<00:04:11.069> then<00:04:11.639> kind<00:04:11.879> of<00:04:12.030> wiggle<00:04:12.389> this<00:04:12.480> how

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
heat it up then kind of wiggle this how

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.270 
heat it up then kind of wiggle this how
you<00:04:12.750> want<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.230> put<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.709> freezer<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.129> hope

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
you want it put it in a freezer and hope

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.710 
you want it put it in a freezer and hope
that<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.609> actually<00:04:14.790> stays<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.540> position

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
that it actually stays in that position

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.960 
that it actually stays in that position
but<00:04:16.169> he<00:04:16.680> definitely<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.220> having<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.549> hard<00:04:17.729> time

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
but he definitely is having a hard time

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.479 
but he definitely is having a hard time
standing<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:19.199> his<00:04:19.470> own<00:04:19.680> there<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.039> go<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:20.370> you

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
standing on his own there you go but you

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.939 
standing on his own there you go but you
kind<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.849> have<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.380> have<00:04:22.380> them<00:04:22.500> punching

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
kind of have to have them punching

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.279 
kind of have to have them punching
forward<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.460> little<00:04:23.580> bit<00:04:23.699> but<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.539> way<00:04:25.050> that

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
forward a little bit but the way that

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.589 
forward a little bit but the way that

colorings<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:41.009> a<00:04:41.520> spider-man<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.240> we've

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
colorings of a spider-man that we've

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.510 
colorings of a spider-man that we've
gotten<00:04:42.750> so<00:04:42.960> far<00:04:42.990> but<00:04:43.650> actually<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.400> the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
gotten so far but actually this is the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.429 
gotten so far but actually this is the
last<00:04:44.849> spider-man<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.300> have<00:04:45.509> Soviet<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.229> might

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
last spider-man I have Soviet it might

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.980 
last spider-man I have Soviet it might
just<00:04:46.620> be<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.860> best<00:04:47.210> period<00:04:48.210> but<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.569> just<00:04:48.719> weld

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
just be the best period but I just weld

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.059 
just be the best period but I just weld
the<00:04:49.110> way<00:04:49.199> he<00:04:49.289> looks<00:04:49.500> in<00:04:49.620> terms<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.979> his

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
the way he looks in terms of his

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.520 
the way he looks in terms of his
articulation<00:04:50.400> his<00:04:50.759> head's<00:04:51.090> on<00:04:51.210> a<00:04:51.240> ball-joint

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
articulation his head's on a ball-joint

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.869 
articulation his head's on a ball-joint
not<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.560> heck<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.949> a<00:04:53.039> lot<00:04:53.159> going<00:04:53.460> up<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.759> down

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
not a heck of a lot going up and down

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.719 
not a heck of a lot going up and down
you<00:04:54.030> can<00:04:54.090> see<00:04:54.419> that's<00:04:54.840> about<00:04:55.080> it

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
you can see that's about it

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.010 
you can see that's about it
left-right<00:04:56.939> all<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.360> kind<00:04:57.629> of<00:04:57.659> stuff<00:04:57.780> the

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
left-right all that kind of stuff the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.929 
left-right all that kind of stuff the
arms<00:04:58.319> aren't<00:04:58.500> peanuts<00:04:58.830> pin<00:04:59.219> in<00:04:59.340> sockets<00:04:59.759> so

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
arms aren't peanuts pin in sockets so

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.339 
arms aren't peanuts pin in sockets so
they<00:05:00.060> rotate<00:05:00.509> all<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.840> way<00:05:00.960> around<00:05:01.050> and

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
they rotate all the way around and

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.619 
they rotate all the way around and
actually<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:02.430> might<00:05:02.610> be<00:05:02.819> the<00:05:02.969> best<00:05:03.449> way

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
actually this might be the best way

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.920 
actually this might be the best way
because<00:05:03.960> that<00:05:03.990> kind<00:05:04.349> of<00:05:04.439> looks<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:05.930> can't

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
because that kind of looks I can't

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.320 
because that kind of looks I can't
honestly<00:05:07.319> can't<00:05:07.800> tell<00:05:07.919> which<00:05:08.370> which<00:05:08.819> way<00:05:09.090> it's

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
honestly can't tell which which way it's

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.240 
honestly can't tell which which way it's
supposed<00:05:09.719> to<00:05:09.810> be<00:05:10.020> that<00:05:10.590> kind<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.889> looked<00:05:11.099> yeah

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
supposed to be that kind of looked yeah

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.040 
supposed to be that kind of looked yeah
maybe<00:05:11.520> maybe<00:05:12.360> it's<00:05:12.539> supposed<00:05:12.599> to<00:05:12.750> be<00:05:12.870> like

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
maybe maybe it's supposed to be like

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.659 
maybe maybe it's supposed to be like
that<00:05:13.289> because<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:13.889> kind<00:05:14.099> of<00:05:14.190> looks<00:05:14.400> like<00:05:14.520> that

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
that because it kind of looks like that

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.240 
that because it kind of looks like that
yeah<00:05:15.150> I'm<00:05:15.300> gonna<00:05:15.419> go<00:05:15.599> like<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:15.990> that's<00:05:16.860> that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250

way<00:05:17.400> that's<00:05:17.699> how<00:05:17.940> we're<00:05:18.120> gonna<00:05:18.240> say<00:05:18.509> it's

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
way that's how we're gonna say it's

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.680 
way that's how we're gonna say it's
supposed<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.740> be<00:05:19.860> although<00:05:20.270> now<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.300> know<00:05:21.479> I

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
supposed to be although now I know I

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.140 
supposed to be although now I know I
don't<00:05:21.870> even<00:05:22.110> know<00:05:22.259> if<00:05:22.650> that's<00:05:23.039> right<00:05:23.250> is<00:05:24.000> that

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
don't even know if that's right is that

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.100 
don't even know if that's right is that
that<00:05:24.419> kind<00:05:24.659> of<00:05:24.690> looks<00:05:24.900> like<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:25.080> tricep<00:05:25.590> muscle

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
that kind of looks like a tricep muscle

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.540 
that kind of looks like a tricep muscle
yeah<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.379> think<00:05:28.560> it's<00:05:28.800> like<00:05:28.949> this<00:05:29.099> because

yeah I think it's like this because
those<00:05:29.759> are<00:05:29.969> those<00:05:30.270> are<00:05:30.330> tricep<00:05:30.870> muscles<00:05:31.259> so

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
those are those are tricep muscles so

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.100 
those are those are tricep muscles so

your<00:05:37.319> PIN<00:05:37.469> in<00:05:37.560> sockets<00:05:37.919> here<00:05:38.009> at<00:05:38.099> the

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
your PIN in sockets here at the

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.089 
your PIN in sockets here at the
shoulders<00:05:38.580> D<00:05:38.879> the<00:05:39.240> elbows<00:05:39.659> also<00:05:40.199> rotate<00:05:40.919> their

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099

pocket<00:05:41.460> they're<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:41.729> pinning<00:05:42.000> sockets<00:05:42.419> so

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
pocket they're on pinning sockets so

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:43.969 
pocket they're on pinning sockets so
they<00:05:42.690> move<00:05:43.020> forward<00:05:43.379> and<00:05:43.440> back<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.860> they<00:05:43.949> also

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
rotate so a good level of articulation

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.499 
rotate so a good level of articulation
nothing<00:05:47.039> at<00:05:47.129> the<00:05:47.250> waist<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.819> hips<00:05:48.060> just<00:05:48.210> go

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
knee and he also rotates Anthony so very

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.790 
knee and he also rotates Anthony so very
good<00:05:53.639> level<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.000> articulation<00:05:54.650> despite<00:05:55.650> the

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
good level of articulation despite the

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.790 
good level of articulation despite the
fact<00:05:56.069> that<00:05:56.159> the<00:05:57.060> smaller<00:05:57.360> figure<00:05:57.779> now<00:05:58.020> are

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
fact that the smaller figure now are

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.260 
fact that the smaller figure now are
there<00:05:59.009> better<00:05:59.250> versions<00:05:59.729> of<00:05:59.909> these<00:06:00.000> three

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
there better versions of these three

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.909 
there better versions of these three
three-quarter<00:06:00.659> inch<00:06:00.960> figures<00:06:01.560> out<00:06:01.770> there

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
three-quarter inch figures out there

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.920 
three-quarter inch figures out there
yeah<00:06:02.039> definitely<00:06:02.669> but<00:06:02.879> I<00:06:03.150> really<00:06:03.690> think<00:06:03.810> that

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
yeah definitely but I really think that

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.390 
yeah definitely but I really think that
for<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.319> money<00:06:04.560> like<00:06:04.889> I<00:06:05.009> said<00:06:05.190> you're<00:06:05.310> gonna

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
for the money like I said you're gonna

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.879 
for the money like I said you're gonna
pay<00:06:05.639> eight<00:06:05.879> to<00:06:06.150> ten<00:06:06.389> dollars<00:06:06.750> for<00:06:07.139> this<00:06:07.259> guy<00:06:07.500> if

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
pay eight to ten dollars for this guy if

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.290 
pay eight to ten dollars for this guy if
you<00:06:08.099> can<00:06:08.250> get<00:06:08.370> it<00:06:08.460> for<00:06:08.550> eight<00:06:08.699> bucks<00:06:08.940> I<00:06:09.060> think

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
you can get it for eight bucks I think

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.570 
you can get it for eight bucks I think
it's<00:06:09.449> definitely<00:06:09.839> a<00:06:10.139> good<00:06:10.440> price<00:06:10.620> it's<00:06:10.979> a<00:06:11.099> very

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
it's definitely a good price it's a very

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.430 
it's definitely a good price it's a very
cool-looking<00:06:11.930> representation<00:06:12.930> of<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.169> black

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
cool-looking representation of the black

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.469 
cool-looking representation of the black
suit<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:13.889> spider-man<00:06:14.460> and<00:06:14.669> well<00:06:15.300> worth

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
suit and spider-man and well worth

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:16.730 
suit and spider-man and well worth
picking<00:06:15.719> up<00:06:15.930> especially<00:06:16.319> if<00:06:16.560> you're<00:06:16.710> a

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
picking up especially if you're a

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.490 
picking up especially if you're a
spider-man<00:06:17.129> fan<00:06:17.520> so<00:06:17.819> it's<00:06:18.719> just<00:06:18.960> kind<00:06:19.379> of<00:06:19.409> a

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
spider-man fan so it's just kind of a

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.469 
spider-man fan so it's just kind of a
pain<00:06:19.800> in<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.949> butt<00:06:20.159> to<00:06:20.279> get<00:06:20.400> understand<00:06:20.909> so

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
pain in the butt to get understand so

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.040 
pain in the butt to get understand so
Stan<00:06:22.169> stand<00:06:22.710> state<00:06:23.550> stay<00:06:24.060> standing<00:06:24.300> okay

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
Stan stand state stay standing okay

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.059 
Stan stand state stay standing okay
we'll<00:06:25.289> see<00:06:25.409> how<00:06:25.529> that<00:06:25.680> works<00:06:25.860> but<00:06:26.129> oh<00:06:26.279> you<00:06:26.759> suck

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:28.069 
we'll see how that works but oh you suck

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.829 
we'll see how that works but oh you suck
so<00:06:29.069> spider-man<00:06:29.639> obviously<00:06:30.180> cannot<00:06:30.539> stand

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:30.839 
so spider-man obviously cannot stand

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.260 
so spider-man obviously cannot stand
because<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.469> symbionts<00:06:31.919> who<00:06:32.159> controls<00:06:33.060> him
