00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.930 
where you have the nipple inside the rim
we've<00:05:01.800> got<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.070> nipple<00:05:02.340> down<00:05:02.520> here<00:05:02.820> at<00:05:02.880> the

hub so that your centralizing your mass
you're<00:05:05.280> keeping<00:05:05.430> your<00:05:06.270> keeping<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.630> wheel<00:05:06.780> is

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
you're keeping your keeping the wheel is

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.920 
you're keeping your keeping the wheel is
light<00:05:07.260> at<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.800> rim<00:05:08.130> as<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.310> possibly<00:05:08.820> can<00:05:09.060> and

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
light at the rim as you possibly can and

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.260 
light at the rim as you possibly can and
another<00:05:10.200> perk<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:10.979> that<00:05:11.250> if<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.120> have

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
another perk of that is that if you have

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.969 
another perk of that is that if you have
to<00:05:12.479> you're<00:05:12.750> running<00:05:13.169> tubulars<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:13.860> need

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
to you're running tubulars and you need

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.620 
to you're running tubulars and you need
to<00:05:14.070> treat<00:05:14.250> your<00:05:14.370> wheel<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:15.240> don't<00:05:15.389> have<00:05:15.539> to

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
to treat your wheel you don't have to

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.390 
to treat your wheel you don't have to
unglue<00:05:15.960> your<00:05:16.139> tire<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.590> chew<00:05:16.740> your<00:05:16.889> wheel<00:05:17.100> it's

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
unglue your tire to chew your wheel it's

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.550 
unglue your tire to chew your wheel it's
all<00:05:17.490> done<00:05:17.729> right<00:05:17.970> there<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.110> keeps<00:05:19.229> things

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
all done right there so it keeps things

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.290 
all done right there so it keeps things
stiff<00:05:19.889> keeps<00:05:20.370> things<00:05:20.610> light<00:05:20.850> at<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.030> rim<00:05:21.270> and

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
stiff keeps things light at the rim and

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.909 
stiff keeps things light at the rim and
then<00:05:21.570> it<00:05:21.690> makes<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:21.960> very<00:05:22.080> easy<00:05:22.229> to<00:05:22.500> service

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
then it makes it very easy to service

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.510 
then it makes it very easy to service
your<00:05:23.039> wheel<00:05:23.220> sets

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520
