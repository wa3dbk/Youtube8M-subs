 in 1975 the premiere of the movie

 steven spielberg shark supposed no 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.130
 only an impressive success 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.500
 commercial but also the trigger for 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.810
 a profound psychological impact that 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.810
 led the population to feel authentic 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.230
 panic about getting into the water 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.060
 that summer of '75 will be remembered as 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.189
 the year when the population did not want 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.199
 bathe on the beach for many 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.059
 a terror began to germinate 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.980
 profound and irrational that 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.129
 would accompany during the rest of his 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.129
 lives 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.950
 to tell the truth the legends that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.750
 they inspired the novel first and 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.300
 later the movie had 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.520
 started a long time ago following 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.410
 true is that shark attacks to 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.750
 humans are something relatively little 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.940
 frequent is not less than these 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.440
 when they occur they are linked to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.170
 tremendous episodes of hysteria 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.260
 Collective which often 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.640
 unleashes panic and irrationality 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.280
 although it is fair to say that in some 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 only some specific moments 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.320
 hysteria is justified 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.690
 it was in the year 1916 in the state of new 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.690
 sweater 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.570
 europe was bleeding the bill 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.580
 of the first world war but this 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.220
 it echoed like a distant echo in the ears 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.620
 of the American citizens the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.440
 tight heat and the habit of going to 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.000
 bathing the beach had become popular 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.130
 recently what made the coasts 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.870
 of the state will be filled with visitors 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.240
 eager to fight the heat 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.070
 introducing the reflective waves of 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.050
 sea 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.940
 nothing could anticipate that that 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.940
 would become a real nightmare 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.070
 the series of events began on 1 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.440
 July 1916 saw her from pitch am in the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.150

 the coast when he was attacked by a 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.320
 shark that was thrown towards him when 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.670
 I returned to the shore less than a 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.160
 one and a half meters deep 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.890
 the young man was taken out of the water by several 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.140
 bathers but he died bleeding five 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.410
 days later on July 6 in spring 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.360
 line a hotel buttons &amp; set in your

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.459
 also a short distance from the coast 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.410
 as the previous time the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.800
 water before being devoured but died 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.860
 unable to receive medical attention 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.980
 later on Saturday , July 8 in 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.840
 asbury park a lifesaver that watered in 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.150
 a boat had another encounter with a 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.070
 shark he managed to chase away with a 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.920
 rowing but not before the panic 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.170
 on the beach that afternoon at the bay 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.500
 New York a floating platform 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.630
 located in front of the ball and there was a 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.519
 Lieutenant of the police fired several 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.600
 times at the head of a shark that 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.850
 approached or the child 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.250
 who won on the beach I could kill him 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.250
 but he managed to get him away from the coast 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.360
 local and national to the attacks caused 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.430
 a wave of panic that produced the hunt 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.460
 of sharks to eradicate the population 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.530
 of shark eats men started a 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.190
 massive hunting plan where he participated 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.950
 virtually the entire community 14 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.500
 July first thing in the morning a 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.780
 New York taxidermist killed with a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.780
 rowing a female of tucumÃ¡n with two 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.870
 one and a half meters long and 160 kilos 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.209
 of weight in his stomach he found a 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.690
 heap of flesh and bones supposedly 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.970
 human of about 7 kilos weight 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.580
 so it was concluded that this copy 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.580
 it was the cause of all the attractions 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.160
 the attacks of the Jersey Coast 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.160
 they immediately joined 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.290
 of American popular culture the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.380
 sharks became creatures 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.670
 that represent the danger also in 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.410
 the editorial columns of the 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.640
 newspapers 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.090
 They also inspired Peter's novel 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.920
 Weiss law of 1974 shark in which 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.859
 based movie style 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.320
 spielberg from that moment the 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.020
 Black legend of sharks would be born and 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.880
 he would never leave us again even though 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.040
 reality as we have said is that the 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.680
 sharks do not usually cause attacks 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.930
 humans habitually weighing the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.750
 legend has forged his stigma as 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.880
 authentic killers of many people 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.070
 experts have tried to mitigate this 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.290
 distorted image of these beautiful and 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.630
 formidable animals but it is difficult 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.790
 eradicate the aftermath of a terror that 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.790
 it is kept through the foot
