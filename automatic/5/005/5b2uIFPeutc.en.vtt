00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.230
 So I always put 1 rx in front of the 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.809
 we use that for a lionel 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.850
 agree that cedric consists of one 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.190
 hook with a curved hagen thigh 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.369
 which accelerates the haag effect so 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.410
 The turning say symbol of the fisherman that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.230
 We tie the whole of a coat of the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.550
 incidental material as already 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.679
 have addressed it here with shells 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.140
 and it will not do the make 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:37.010
 up from the models like yes not around 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.900
 band leader on materials as bait 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.540
 is your snowman to wear the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.970
 consists on the one hand of a 20 mm thick 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.040
 Bump topped by a new pink 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.050
 bolide for the visual appeal of the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.970
 the whole story makes sure we pull 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 now on the already prepared here 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.050
 bend in presale 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.620
 the whole thing is fixed by the bulli 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.620
 tamper 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.820
 so the whole story will look 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.180
 then we tie the hook now 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.950
 nevertheless assembly the day before 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.990
 this is done by the fold material once 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.080
 from behind in the hook, a bow in the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.750
 pant pulls the hair on the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:42.920
 desired length of fish mostly relative 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:45.560
 short about 0.5 cm was estimated then 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.710
 really the rest of the material and 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.229
 a few turns still about that way 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.229
 Eight if hagen give 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.829
 and for the whole again from behind 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.829
 through that he returns again 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.450
 already who this one rick of a lion 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.320
 hendrick finished but the haag 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.900
 put to further promote effective 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:28.260
 we have a smurf also the among themselves 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.260
 heat small piece off 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.990
 China from top fourfold on this 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:41.650
 small piece fixed that was again on 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:43.000
 lower hook give further 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.820
 take another small piece for the top 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.070
 shrink the angle of one 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.790
 changed around the mouth of the fish 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:58.090
 Let's cut ourselves a bit again 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:01.380
 Here the hose from the pull back 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.380
 from above on surfer up 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.159
 what the knot somewhat concealed 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.909
 or and now he got the whole 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.909
 history and that will shrink 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.110
 one piece 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.410
 then I always push the electric shock 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.230
 a bit forward so that's the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.230
 so that the hose takes the form 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.850
 and finished, our lionel agree 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.050
 many hooks in the fish can turn 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.270
 you do it well on yourself 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.209
 by putting that in front of over the finger 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.010
 pulls and in this case should be the 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.310
 no matter in which position of the hook 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:23.240
 turn the incident and stick it in your finger 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.389
 stay that works as you can see 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.410
 Well, I hope that would be this night 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.410
 one or two fishermen
