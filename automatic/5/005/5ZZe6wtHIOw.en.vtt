00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.880
 ah 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.620
 let's use pork chop 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.600
 plums we have butter common and 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.400
 current we have olive oil 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.260
 we have bee honey honey bee no 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.350
 cane honey we have corn starch 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.780
 we have dijon mustard and we have a 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.910
 blonde beer first we sealed the 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.550
 chops in a little butter and 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.070
 unwashed oil the pan we use 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.300
 that same pan we add beer and 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.870
 let it run alcohol 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.579
 we add the mustard honey and broth then 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.200
 the plums are cut in half 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.300
 discouraged in case they come with the 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.999
 seed and chops are added 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.999
 precooked until complete cooking 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 Y 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.739
 we have then our our 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.480
 corn starch well diluted in the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.579
 liquid that I told them we were 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.190
 using in the recipe and the second 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.720
 secret or the second point with which 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.600
 goes with which I was telling you that 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.940
 will use the corn starch is that the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.920
 liquid which we are going to thicken has 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.510
 that being boiling has to follow 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.400
 seeing immediately it is going to express 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.590
 you are to win account then what I 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.259
 I'll do then I'll put it to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.729
 little bit soon and I'm going to stir 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.050
 very fast 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.300
 I'm going to stir very fast if you 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.790
 they realize in the camera they are already seeing 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.080
 that the bubble is a little more durable 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.720
 this expresses 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.009
 Perez right there these fish right there 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.009
 let's put all the rest 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.530
 and now our sauce is ready 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.390
 you realize as this 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.070
 will go watching boiling boiling 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.770
 boiling more and more is expressing 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.720
 much more I will show you with the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.970
 spoon that spices are the sauce 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.350
 it's already fine then then what 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.200
 that I 'm going to do to not throw myself 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 dish and then turn off 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.149
 I'm not going to, I'm not going to expose myself to that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.670
 now just when I'm going to serve it 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.469
 I give it a last boil and you're ready 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.179
 explaining to you the difference between 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.469
 the faith that I was telling you that said 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.019
 explain the difference between starch 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.399
 of corn and flour what is the 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.230
 difference already saw how the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.550
 corn starch corn starch is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 acting perfectly on the n in the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.220
 thicken of the sauce now what's up 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.860
 with the flour the thick flour of equal 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.840
 way is perfect to express there is no 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.030
 no problem but the flour has a 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.640
 great let's say 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.250
 a great negative thing that is that as 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.620
 flour is heavy and she goes 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.709
 sits in the background and with the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.030
 fire so high it burns and blends 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.800
 immediately any preparation 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.220
 so that's why I've seen use 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.170
 flour also the flour is very heavy the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.660
 very heavy margarine then it does not fall 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.730
 well out of that also the flour tastes 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.620
 the flour they know there are people if you 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.540
 he has surely noticed it when they take 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.600
 a cream when they take a soup when 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.430
 they eat a meat with or something with sauce 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.290
 made with flour immediately you 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.050
 they say hey this stalin bears there was a lot 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.260
 flour and that's precisely why it's good 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.840
 and then let us 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.989
 to serve our home dish as they 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.640
 I said one last boil one last boil and 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.379
 I do not know if you can feel the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.959
 rain that is absolutely a 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.579
 downpour and streak but better 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.040
 here we prepare our perfect food 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.739
 for the perfect water for water is 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.599
 a somewhat heavy meal is very rich 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.280
 with these showers also more than 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.980
 picks eat with downpours that with the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 perfect family the good plan this already 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.020
 we gave it the last boil 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.120
 we can our tray this is going to be 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.880
 served on a tray because they are several 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.569
 chops I think I 'm going to turn it off already 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.569
 to avoid me 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.320
 it's also right at the end 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.760
 and we will serve as I told you if it is a 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.460
 tray so big by in you or 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.470
 chops here and put the puree here 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.440
 potatoes or rice and everything and what can 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.750
 perfectly combine another dish that 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.360
 you can serve another court of 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.640
 pig can also be to help them in 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.740
 the pork rib is spectacular 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.290
 with this with this preparation 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.840
 good little ribs or else a good cannon 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.199
 they also do very well 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.650
 We are going to serve you very well 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.650
 chops 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.760
 for you to enjoy them 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.220
 in their homes obviously not 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.740
 you are far 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.990
 and we're going to put the sauce on top of it 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.750
 sauce like it has some solids then 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.100
 it's perfect first it can be in 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.900
 decorative issue and second 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.910
 what gives us a lot gives me and gives us a 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.030
 extra flavor because the plums 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.520
 finally they are sweet it is not look that already 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.520
 the sauce is thick combines very well 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.610
 and it shows the final preparation very well 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.509
 and that's what they have here then you go 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.509
 to clean a moment lahm 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.420
 the tray 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.600
 you have already your final plate the 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:17.510
 chops to beer and plums here what 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.490
 they have to enjoy it prepare in their 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.170
 houses change the ingredients do not have 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.760
 no problem but they fit 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.210
 good that they have good profit and we 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.210
 we see the next
