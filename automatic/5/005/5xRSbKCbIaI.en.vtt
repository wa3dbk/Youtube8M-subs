 you give the best but go 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
 I'm 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.970
 there 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.820
 quite right 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.309
 in the early 1960s below 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 the administration of harold wilson 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.910
 Brits finally notice that 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.980
 war is over 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.570
 or perhaps it would be better to say wars 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.670
 when in 1947 lord mountbatten 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.079
 return to India to the newly elected black 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.739
 and that by the way has a full-blown 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.690
 relationship with lady mountbatten without that 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.089
 in the north, there are a lot of interests 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.879
 English can actually happen on 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.149
 message is strong and clear the new one 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.800
 Britain is no longer willing to displace 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.969
 militarily his children around the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.240
 world 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.039
 yes but this will have consequences 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.440
 explosions on English society because 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.360
 that of 60 is the first generation that 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.360
 he is at war he will not go there 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.400

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.000
 of years of albionic conventions up

 American roll to form new ones 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.990
 exciting bands with unexpected names that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.220
 will forever change the history of 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.120
 music with the name written on

 the canned meat that every Englishman has 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.770
 eaten during the war and after 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.290
 so uninviting to become 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.400

 stolen or at the mines or factories 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.930

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.370
 half 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.530
 he, on the other hand, was fun and irreverent 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.420
 he was irresistibly contemporary 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.280
 excessive and with the Hollywood chin of 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.970
 who does not need to ask and him 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.790
 when the man jumped he scored 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.829
 many goals more than a husband or a 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.450
 boyfriend mocked by his Don Juanismo
