00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello readers frou wind site in 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.930
 this video tutorial we'll talk on 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.719
 the computer does not see the flash drive what to do and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.320
 so there are several ways 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.920
 problem solving so let's all of them 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.740
 consider the first thing you need to connect 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.960
 device to any other computer 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.240
 or TV to make sure that she 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.060
 generally works well if on a flash drive 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.400
 there is an indicator if the light is flashing 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.390
 know the food is and most likely to wear 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.690
 it works that is, you need to make sure that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.489
 actually not a problem in the flash drive itself 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.730
 maybe your problem 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.399
 either i have no drivers 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.989
 either there the nest may be damaged and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.989
 so on, that is, if on the other 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.969
 device is ok 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.789
 then most likely you have a problem 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.460
 Seeds computer that is necessary either 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.320
 driver or something like that then the second and so but 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.329
 after installing the flash drive in one of 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.590
 usb connectors 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 try restarting your computer and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.939
 the media launch is blocked 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.610
 virus and antivirus restart 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.439
 should help that is for the price of this flash drive 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.010
 restart your computer maybe 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.650
 will help 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 3 if you are using an old computer 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.229
 then try to partially free up space 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.479
 option 4 on the flash card 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.110
 bios connection apps by maybe 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.869
 lit so check this moment 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.170
 that is, go to bios 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.240
 restart the computer itself you 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:41.180
 enter bios before entering species and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:46.229
 there select usb and make sure that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:50.310
 connected connected you connected 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:54.060
 yusbi there sometimes that is disabled 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.680
 so here's the same computer may not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.900
 see flash drives and so go ahead 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.220
 flash drive may not be open may not 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 open due to drivers 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.570
 try to update when 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.580
 motherboard drivers and also through 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.759
 device manager update driver 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.580
 connected device that is on 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.080
 flash drive says what kind of flash drive is there 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.209
 drive in google is the name of the flash drive and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.370
 write drivers find drivers 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.180
 install can also help but it 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.200
 carry you rarely but on the machine all is well 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.510
 this is if you have older windows 98 xp 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.600
 well on x pi you are ok and on 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.580
 seven here if you have 98 windows there 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.780
 may not be drivers and may be 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.140
 some problems site go further 6 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.610
 the rarest reason to refuse reading 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.520
 flash drives it break with me 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.230
 the port itself is even such cases 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.660
 when when installing a new computer 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.930
 all flash cards after connecting quickly 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.850
 breaks due to fault during assembly 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.709
 systems like the operating system can 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.370
 read their flash drive mistakenly assign
