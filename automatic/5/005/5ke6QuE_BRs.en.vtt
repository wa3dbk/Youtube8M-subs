you're going to be setting it up to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.870 
you're going to be setting it up to
block<00:01:31.950> calls<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.520> make<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.790> life

excited<00:01:35.490> about<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> has

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
excited about with this is that it has

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.130 
excited about with this is that it has
like<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.890> advanced<00:01:38.549> filtering<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
like really advanced filtering so if you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.940 
like really advanced filtering so if you
want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> block<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.810> numbers<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.680> start

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
want to block all on numbers that start

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.450 
want to block all on numbers that start
with<00:01:44.159> 1<00:01:44.549> 800<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.649> go<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> filters<00:01:47.250> and

can set certain numbers to go directly
to<00:02:53.670> voicemail<00:02:53.880> yeah<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.709> kind<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.550> works

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
to voicemail yeah so it kind of works

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
similar to that but with this right here

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.410 
similar to that but with this right here
you<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.489> actually<00:02:59.640> avoid<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> whole

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
you can actually avoid the whole
