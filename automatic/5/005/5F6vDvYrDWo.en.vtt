00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello, just a few minutes 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.920
 ago apple released the first public 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.610
 beta 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.690
 hp 8.4 if you want to install a new one 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.090
 ios version 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.849
 today you need to download the profile 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.160
 configurations there are two ways like this 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.199
 you can do the first official 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.449
 follow the link you are now 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.670
 see on the screen register 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.279
 a beta program or enter 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.900
 if already done after 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.880
 why follow a few simple steps 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.800
 and get your profile 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.600
 I actually did but practice 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 showed that this is far from 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 all so there is a second way which 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.629
 even easier first download this profile 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 directly from the Yandex disk 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.829
 look for all links in the description of this 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.289
 video and then reboot and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
 updated device by air like 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.640
 see everything is very simple now let's 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 let's see what appeared new combat 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 with 84 public beta 1 full list 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.239
 innovations apple does not yet lead 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 but with a quick look in the eyes rushes 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.059
 unless it is completely processed and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.770
 app music 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 true first acquaintance turned out 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.030
 pretty cool on startup 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.979
 applications and saw what turned out to be my 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.930
 the album and evaporated somewhere and everyone would 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.240
 nothing but only if you open statistics 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.350
 we will see that the song seems to have disappeared a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.630
 like no 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.670
 about 1 gigabyte of void is obtained 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.740
 true if you go to the settings and enable 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.740
 show all the music including and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 cloud then everything will return to its place 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.310
 true with some garbage which I already 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.990
 I do not remember when I downloaded and especially 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.020
 amusing feature to make available 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.329
 offline here thanks and nothing about mine 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 it's all already installed but Sarah is worth 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.630
 notice that even if again 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.369
 save with your song and then 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.040
 turn off the display of all music in the settings 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.140
 then everything will disappear again so I advise you not 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.270
 waste time as regards little 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.549
 the application is all the most necessary rendered 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.899
 on the main screen amen and player now 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 leaves in the form of a curtain 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.100
 that my opinion is a good solution 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.290
 the truth could have washed it normal 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 fullscreen mode because status 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.399
 the bar on top is not only not the city on the background 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260
 album covers in general development vector 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.660
 systems 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.350
 I like it when everything is finished 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.060
 sweetie 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.190
 Well, that's basically all I wanted for you 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.619
 today to tell heard that supposedly in 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.990
 this version with accelerated animations again 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.850
 but honestly I don't make any difference 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.550
 noticed as regards working time 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.130
 the system is hard to say but I think 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.630
 should be plus or minus 1st floor by the way y 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.240
 I'm on the channel is now drawing 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.910
 one very interesting game flight deck 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.490
 the rule is as simple as possible so that everyone 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.530
 I advise you to participate link look 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.530
 also in the description for now bye
