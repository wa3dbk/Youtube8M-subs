hi guys Jay Harris again from Isis power
in<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.380> video<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.710> want<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.920> talk<00:00:14.099> about<00:00:14.280> how

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
in this video I want to talk about how

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.269 
in this video I want to talk about how
you<00:00:14.849> most<00:00:15.210> effectively<00:00:15.900> place<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:16.800> master

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
you most effectively place your master

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.220 
you most effectively place your master
cells<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.850> your<00:00:17.940> power<00:00:18.150> cells<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.930> your

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
cells and your power cells in your

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.910 
cells and your power cells in your
vehicle

remember<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.850> Isis<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> different<00:00:21.750> from<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
remember that Isis is different from a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.900 
remember that Isis is different from a
traditional<00:00:22.080> wiring<00:00:22.560> system<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.580> don't<00:00:23.670> have

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
traditional wiring system you don't have

is to reduce the overall amount of
wiring<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> vehicle<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> first<00:00:50.010> thing

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
wiring in the vehicle so the first thing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.500 
wiring in the vehicle so the first thing
we've<00:00:50.250> done<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> truck<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.149> we've<00:00:51.300> spent

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
we've done with the truck is we've spent

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
we've done with the truck is we've spent
some<00:00:51.629> time<00:00:51.780> walking<00:00:51.989> around<00:00:52.140> looking<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
some time walking around looking at it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.590 
some time walking around looking at it

look at things and figure out that we

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.300 
look at things and figure out that we
need<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> Power<00:01:30.810> Cell<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.170> back<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:32.009> found<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
fuel pump and then an amp and a sub for
the<00:01:46.680> audio<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.030> case<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.299> rear

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the audio so in that case that rear

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
the audio so in that case that rear
power<00:01:49.020> cell<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.680> longest<00:01:50.130> run<00:01:50.340> aware<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> we

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
power cell the longest run aware that we

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.539 
power cell the longest run aware that we
have<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.350> right<00:01:52.649> corner<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
have is from the right corner of the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.969 
have is from the right corner of the
truck<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.570> turn<00:01:54.930> signal<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> left

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
truck to the turn signal in the left

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.859 
truck to the turn signal in the left
corner<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.880> about<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> four-foot<00:01:57.689> piece

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
corner so it's about a four-foot piece

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.020 
corner so it's about a four-foot piece
of<00:01:58.020> wire<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.439> then<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.369> looked<00:01:59.579> at<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> we

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
of wire and then we looked at it we

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
of wire and then we looked at it we
debated<00:02:00.450> putting<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> front<00:02:01.259> power<00:02:01.530> cell

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
debated putting the front power cell

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770 
debated putting the front power cell
made<00:02:02.310> behind<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> dash<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.360> actually<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
made behind the dash but actually the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
made behind the dash but actually the
best<00:02:03.990> place<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:05.159> actually<00:02:05.460> put<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.790> on

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
best place for it was actually put it on

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
best place for it was actually put it on
the<00:02:06.270> inner<00:02:06.420> fender<00:02:06.590> under<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> hood<00:02:07.829> now<00:02:08.729> an

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the inner fender under the hood now an

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.490 
the inner fender under the hood now an
important<00:02:09.209> comment<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
important comment here is that the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
important comment here is that the
master<00:02:10.830> cells<00:02:11.069> are<00:02:11.220> actually<00:02:11.400> rated<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
master cells are actually rated to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.340 
master cells are actually rated to
25<00:02:13.170> degrees<00:02:13.500> C<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> OEM<00:02:15.570> under

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
25 degrees C and that is the OEM under

electronics module it's okay to put into
the<00:02:21.030> hood<00:02:21.150> obviously<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.720> want<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.960> keep<00:02:22.020> it

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the hood obviously you want to keep it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.200 
the hood obviously you want to keep it
away<00:02:22.380> from<00:02:22.560> things<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.160> exhaust<00:02:23.640> headers<00:02:24.000> or

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
away from things like exhaust headers or

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.540 
away from things like exhaust headers or
turbos<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.110> excessive<00:02:25.620> heat<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.400> for

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
turbos we have excessive heat but for

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.800 
turbos we have excessive heat but for
the<00:02:26.610> general<00:02:26.880> environment<00:02:27.210> under<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.660> hood

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
the general environment under the hood

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
the general environment under the hood
the<00:02:28.170> power<00:02:28.380> cell<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.740> handle<00:02:28.980> that

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the power cell can handle that

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
the power cell can handle that
so<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.390> going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> sit<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.290> passenger

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
so it's going to sit on the passenger

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.920 
so it's going to sit on the passenger
fender<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.670> again<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> longest<00:02:33.540> run<00:02:33.720> aware

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
fender and again the longest run aware

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.810 
fender and again the longest run aware
we<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.470> either<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.490> headlight

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
we have is either going to the headlight

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.370 
we have is either going to the headlight
on<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.090> left<00:02:36.270> side<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.600> truck<00:02:36.840> we're

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
on the left side of the truck we're

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.260 
on the left side of the truck we're
actually<00:02:37.500> running<00:02:37.800> back<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.700> dash<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
actually running back to the dash to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.450 
actually running back to the dash to
power<00:02:39.450> our<00:02:39.600> gauge<00:02:39.750> illumination<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.920> that's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
power our gauge illumination so that's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.400 
power our gauge illumination so that's
the<00:02:41.610> best<00:02:41.760> place<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.000> put<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.390> we're<00:02:43.140> gonna<00:02:43.260> go

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
the best place to put it we're gonna go

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.040 
the best place to put it we're gonna go
off<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.530> fab<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.100> plates<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:45.030> mount<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
off and fab the plates to mount the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.840 
off and fab the plates to mount the
power<00:02:46.200> cell<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.650> front<00:02:46.890> now<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> powers<00:02:47.700> on

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
power cell up front now the powers on

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.940 
power cell up front now the powers on
the<00:02:47.970> rear<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.480> again<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.140> put<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.500> master

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the rear and again to put that master

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.890 
the rear and again to put that master
cell<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.340> our<00:02:50.430> center<00:02:50.730> console<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.750> again

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
cell in our center console so again

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
cell in our center console so again
we're<00:02:52.050> big<00:02:52.200> advocates<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.860> spend<00:02:53.820> some<00:02:53.970> time

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
we're big advocates of spend some time

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.760 
we're big advocates of spend some time
think<00:02:54.840> about<00:02:55.050> where<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> want<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.650> mount

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
think about where you want to mount

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.010 
think about where you want to mount
stuff<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.400> remember<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.300> want<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.810> put

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
stuff and remember that you want to put

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.980 
stuff and remember that you want to put
your<00:02:58.260> cells<00:02:58.560> where<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.730> have<00:03:00.000> again<00:03:00.390> switches

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
your cells where you have again switches

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.140 
your cells where you have again switches
for<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> master<00:03:01.530> cell<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.070> outputs<00:03:02.940> for<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
for the master cell and outputs for the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.360 
for the master cell and outputs for the
power<00:03:03.300> cell<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:04.530> keep<00:03:04.680> watching<00:03:04.860> we're<00:03:05.280> gonna

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
