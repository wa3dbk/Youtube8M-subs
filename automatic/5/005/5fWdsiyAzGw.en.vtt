00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.769
 to start our carved candle we're going 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:52.469
 to adhere the napkin with tape 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.469
 adhesive making sure to fix it well 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.760
 with a pen without ink let's go over 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.760
 all edges 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.390
 later we remark with a gouge 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.000
 with fine tip 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.909
 making sure we do not leave any edge without 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.290
 review what we are doing with this 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.930
 is to transfer the image to the candle because 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.259
 later we are going to withdraw the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 napkin to make way for 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.020
 carved with gouges already with cabas 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.970
 before you start carving the candle 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 Czech image if possible or if there is some 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.120
 the image that you do not want it to be because 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.460
 detailed the candle can not be corrected 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.370
 ok then let's proceed to withdraw 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.690
 the napkin and let's start 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:59.180
 use this gouge and those with layers to 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.180
 shaping our image in the candle 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.190
 here and the napkin was removed and the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.820
 remarked what scraping is already more 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.820
 deep 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.420
 you have to polish well do not leave edges not 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.390
 leave marks since at the time of 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.150
 paint it all those imperfections are 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.629
 they notice too much 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.510
 you must also use a brush to 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.360
 Remove excess wax that remains 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.810
 inside the edges is very important 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.670
 that do not remain because they turn to 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.110
 adhere to the candle so we use 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.510
 this brush for 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.780
 remove excess or excess that is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.150
 on the edges 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.990
 already when the candle was finished carving 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.790
 which is completely finished and dried 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.790
 that there is no edge this is the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.280
 result 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.280
 which must remain before painting 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.719
 that's how it's carved 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.180
 Now all that's left is to paint it 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:11.180
 let's give it what is in the image 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.879
 a black background and then all the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.980
 candle not including the top part is 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:20.620
 paint in white let dry and then 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.670
 let's 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.379
 and start to color our image 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.379
 based on the drawing we have 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.569
 here I am wearing a light blue 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.569
 the center is already painted yellow 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.510
 It is very important to let it dry between 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.820
 layer and layer of paint because then 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.740
 they begin to mix the colors and 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.840
 we have to start over 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.569
 painting everything 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.770
 after this I put a tone 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.190
 reddish 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.110
 the image does not really bring that much color 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.260
 to the image is more 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.269
 white 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.569
 but I wanted to give it a little bit more 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:13.280
 color to highlight what is the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.280
 painting and the candle already finished 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.390
 the whole image around what is the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.660
 background image I used some 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.050
 metallic colors in bronze and gold 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.400
 that is the day at the end obviously here 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.940
 the image is not what I wanted to show 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.870
 mainly in carving 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.590
 the painted 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.820
 something not totally and the final result 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.820
 what is this candle 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.860
 you have to mix colors that can not be seen 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:52.280
 very hard strokes very hard since it does not 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.550
 gives realism to the work already done 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.729
 when we finished painting the flower 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.289
 then let's proceed to paint what 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:05.399
 what is the sheet 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.619
 that I already realize much smaller than 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:09.409
 the one that brought the image because if 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:11.639
 I would have put the one I brought from the image 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.999
 only half of me would have left it 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.369
 What I did was put a leaf aside 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:20.399
 same but in a smaller size for 

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:22.259
 that it was complete here what I am 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:25.020
 doing is giving color with the brush a 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.469
 little lying down so that the lines that I 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.830
 had traced as much in the flower as in 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:34.830
 the sheet keep having that black background 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.130
 to give it that realism 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.950
 so the brush has to be put 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.020
 paint but you have to remove the excess 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:46.200
 the least paint you have for 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.340
 avoid that those slots that they have are 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.350
 paint the color that we are using 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.630
 here it is very important in given case that 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.380
 you have been stained what are the 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.320
 slots with a fine point brush a 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.880
 fine brush again highlights all those 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:08.120
 lines that are in the dark in black 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.520
 returns them to remark 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.919
 here we are mixing colors 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.040
 what is green light green green 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.350
 dark white yellow for the sheet nothing 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.240
 plus 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.550
 already when we finished doing this 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.910
 project we dry that paint well 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:28.240
 we painted all the rest of the 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:33.130
 of the candle in bronze and then the result 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.220
 you saw it at the beginning of what is the video 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.720
 the tutorial 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.290
 later since they dried well all 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.290
 the paintings 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:47.039
 to finish we give a layer of varnish 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.039
 let it dry and ready
