00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.139
 new trail 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.940
 there has been a lot to do about it 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 it's a bit of a family though 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 many beautiful technical passages 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.810
 which we actually on a natural 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.539
 way now where they used to be a lot 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 had to build bridges and many 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.240
 had to create obstacles 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.250
 they actually here and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 course course and I like it 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.310
 actually a beautiful location 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.890
 so give a cruise also near it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.890
 center and yet a piece of nature 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.910
 so completely different than we are going to worry 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.489
 absolutely when your name comes across 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.730
 outside the duckweed period then you get 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.559
 really a vast field but here 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.960
 have you really see for the piece 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.750
 which breed are and the evening there are many 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.970
 more cross than the old course so 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.550
 yes I am very enthusiastic and I think 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.800
 that this colossus is going to be a huge boost 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.839
 and there was already a lot of people and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.410
 it is neither going nor avoided 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.410
 to think 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.409
 the selective circulation is being expanded 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.299
 along the mountain bike party 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.460
 the skate pond point forest area the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.140
 durme work and mira bridge 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.210
 with some also some tourist 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.460
 toppers from hanging in the spotlight 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.899
 thanks to the flandria it also costs 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.759
 logistically it is a huge one 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.700
 positive evolution with a lot 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.700
 accommodations and sufficient and spacious 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 parking options 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.740
 no no 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.470
 we are standing here in front of the mirabrug 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.780
 you have it there then a piece 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.930
 history and has also played a role in 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.520
 the film more than willeke van ammelrooy 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.490
 and after Jan Decleir 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.260
 so if we can process that in the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.390
 old-fashioned crosse than that one does 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.310
 very happy with it and I am especially happy about that 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.020
 the spool can continue to exist 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 do you like that here about the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.610
 bridge is being driven 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.680
 absolutely i think that is way too much 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.500
 people will wake something up 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.450
 and that it is also extra publicity 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 for a scratch that already existed now 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.560
 scrolls up here 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.820
 but with a bit of history 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.610
 is going to get a lot of publicity 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.330
 we need that to cross this back 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.330
 and to give huge boost 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.080
 We are especially proud that we are the region 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.120
 cross can keep that there 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.099
 a lot of kross from sitting 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.099
 You saw that again and again every year 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.680
 come and because now be able to create here 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.480
 that it's beautiful 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.400
 You won the first edition in Hamme Zogge 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.560
 to the first edition of the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 flandriencross I'm definitely going my best 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.260
 to realize that because 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 I am very motivated to go on 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.110
 this trail again my best legs 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.700
 to come up 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.700
 it just seems to be a very beautiful one 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.100
 duckweed and yes that will still be back 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.180
 and as before maybe 14 15 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.260
 year has been crosted 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.680
 that I might be the first here 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.680
 can be
