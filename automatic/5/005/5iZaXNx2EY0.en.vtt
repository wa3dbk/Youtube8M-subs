00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
covered in smoke they'll be transported

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.510

to<00:00:55.060> the<00:00:55.180> assembly<00:00:55.570> line<00:00:55.660> and<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:57.190> will<00:00:57.400> allow

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
to the assembly line and this will allow

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.760 
to the assembly line and this will allow
players<00:00:57.880> to<00:00:58.060> run<00:00:58.690> against<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.200> conveyor<00:00:59.530> belt

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
players to run against the conveyor belt

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.980 
players to run against the conveyor belt
and<00:00:59.950> attack<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.610> parts<00:01:00.940> that<00:01:01.180> are<00:01:01.540> responding

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
and attack the parts that are responding

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.979 
and attack the parts that are responding
there<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.340> need<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.580> rotation<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.330> at

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
there now you need a rotation of at

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.749 
there now you need a rotation of at
least<00:01:05.290> two<00:01:05.799> different<00:01:06.159> groups<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.520> players

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
least two different groups of players

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.929 
least two different groups of players
because<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.840> stable<00:01:08.939> destabilization

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
because of the stable destabilization

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.959 
because of the stable destabilization
debuff<00:01:10.330> that's<00:01:10.990> applied<00:01:11.490> which<00:01:12.490> lasts<00:01:12.820> for<00:01:12.939> a

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
debuff that's applied which lasts for a

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.550 
debuff that's applied which lasts for a
minute<00:01:13.270> but<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.600> assembly<00:01:13.960> parts<00:01:14.229> come<00:01:14.439> out

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
minute but the assembly parts come out

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.609 
minute but the assembly parts come out
every<00:01:14.770> 30<00:01:14.979> seconds<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:16.780> when<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.109> attack<00:01:17.409> and

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
every 30 seconds now when you attack and

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.289 
every 30 seconds now when you attack and
kill<00:01:17.770> an<00:01:17.950> assembly<00:01:18.310> part<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.729> other<00:01:18.759> parts

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
kill an assembly part the other parts

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.480 
kill an assembly part the other parts
will<00:01:19.509> become<00:01:19.840> immune<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.200> damage<00:01:20.499> or<00:01:21.249> that

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
will become immune to damage or that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.669 
will become immune to damage or that
wave<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.969> they<00:01:22.689> will<00:01:22.869> continue<00:01:23.109> the<00:01:23.439> other

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
wave and they will continue the other

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.080 
wave and they will continue the other
side<00:01:23.979> where<00:01:24.189> they're<00:01:24.340> formed<00:01:24.670> up<00:01:24.789> into

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
side where they're formed up into

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.050 
side where they're formed up into
weapons<00:01:25.479> eventually<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.670> best<00:01:27.819> thing<00:01:27.909> you

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
weapons eventually so the best thing you

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.050 
weapons eventually so the best thing you
can<00:01:28.179> do<00:01:28.329> is<00:01:28.509> rotate<00:01:28.719> a<00:01:29.460> couple<00:01:30.460> groups<00:01:30.729> of

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
can do is rotate a couple groups of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.999 
can do is rotate a couple groups of
players<00:01:31.270> we<00:01:31.479> use<00:01:31.810> two<00:01:32.109> groups<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.590> two<00:01:32.740> players

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
players we use two groups of two players

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.429 
players we use two groups of two players
each<00:01:33.249> to<00:01:34.119> rotate<00:01:34.509> onto<00:01:34.749> the<00:01:34.929> assembly<00:01:35.409> line

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.179 
each to rotate onto the assembly line
every<00:01:35.859> 30<00:01:36.100> seconds<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.619> way<00:01:38.859> they<00:01:39.159> can

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
every 30 seconds and this way they can

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.550 
every 30 seconds and this way they can
always<00:01:39.520> kill<00:01:39.850> at<00:01:39.969> least<00:01:39.999> one<00:01:40.179> weapon<00:01:40.630> part<00:01:40.869> and

that explodes out in two waves kind of

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.990 
that explodes out in two waves kind of

and<00:02:28.100> players<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.630> see<00:02:29.750> there<00:02:29.900> it's

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
and players as you can see there it's

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.170 
and players as you can see there it's
kind<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.200> pulling<00:02:30.410> against<00:02:30.740> me<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.180> then

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
kind of pulling against me and then

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180 
kind of pulling against me and then
finally<00:02:32.569> we<00:02:33.110> have<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.230> crawler<00:02:33.560> mines<00:02:33.650> which

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
finally we have the crawler mines which

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.860 
finally we have the crawler mines which
are<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> most<00:02:34.610> important<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.510> probably<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
are the most important and probably the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.530 
are the most important and probably the
most<00:02:36.080> difficult<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.160> deal<00:02:37.340> with<00:02:37.550> these<00:02:38.240> will

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
most difficult to deal with these will

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.390 
most difficult to deal with these will
spawn<00:02:38.840> mines<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.319> will<00:02:39.560> chase<00:02:39.739> random<00:02:40.220> raid

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
spawn mines that will chase random raid

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.430 
spawn mines that will chase random raid
members<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.000> upon<00:02:41.750> reaching<00:02:41.930> them<00:02:42.230> it'll

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
members and upon reaching them it'll

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.260 
members and upon reaching them it'll
explode<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.220> deal<00:02:43.340> massive<00:02:43.640> damage<00:02:43.819> to<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
explode and deal massive damage to the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.559 
explode and deal massive damage to the
raid<00:02:44.480> these<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.530> be<00:02:45.709> cc'd<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:46.940> various<00:02:47.209> forms

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
raid these can be cc'd in various forms

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.210 
raid these can be cc'd in various forms
so<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.050> best<00:02:48.170> thing<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.410> do<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.800> stun<00:02:49.190> or

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
so the best thing to do is to stun or

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.640 
so the best thing to do is to stun or
slow<00:02:49.610> them<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.510> your<00:02:50.630> range<00:02:50.870> dps<00:02:51.110> kill

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
slow them and have your range dps kill

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.770 
slow them and have your range dps kill
the<00:02:51.770> mines<00:02:51.980> before<00:02:52.430> they<00:02:52.580> reach<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.819> targeted

this<00:03:55.160> does<00:03:55.370> very<00:03:55.670> heavy<00:03:55.940> consistent<00:03:56.600> damage

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
blades active then the tank should try

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.819

the shredder in addition to neo players
as<00:04:11.750> they<00:04:11.900> normally<00:04:12.049> would<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:12.910> it's<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:14.000> really

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
as they normally would so it's a really

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.180 
as they normally would so it's a really
good<00:04:14.269> idea<00:04:14.420> for<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.900> tank<00:04:15.109> to<00:04:15.620> quickly<00:04:16.010> pick

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
good idea for the tank to quickly pick

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.800 
good idea for the tank to quickly pick
up<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.459> new<00:04:16.640> shredder<00:04:16.940> when<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.180> swap<00:04:17.450> occurs

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
up that new shredder when a swap occurs

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.039 
up that new shredder when a swap occurs
and<00:04:18.169> then<00:04:18.769> immediately<00:04:19.190> pull<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.609> into<00:04:20.049> a

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
and then immediately pull it into a

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.290 
and then immediately pull it into a
blade<00:04:21.739> if<00:04:21.919> there<00:04:22.100> is<00:04:22.220> one<00:04:22.430> or<00:04:22.729> multiple<00:04:22.850> blades

if you can do it right or the fire if

if you can do it right or the fire if

there are no blades active the goal is

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.800 
there are no blades active the goal is
to<00:04:28.190> have<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.460> tank<00:04:28.729> focus<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.570> shredder

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
to have the tank focus on the shredder

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.130 
to have the tank focus on the shredder
solely<00:04:30.440> because<00:04:31.220> all<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.729> their<00:04:31.849> dps<00:04:32.150> do

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
solely because all of their dps do

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.080 
solely because all of their dps do
twenty<00:04:33.650> percent<00:04:33.950> normal<00:04:34.310> damage<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.940> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
twenty percent normal damage to the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.800 
twenty percent normal damage to the
shredder<00:04:35.360> be

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
shredder be

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.700 
shredder be
because<00:04:35.930> they<00:04:36.110> do<00:04:36.169> not<00:04:36.380> have<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
because they do not have the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.680 
because they do not have the
electrostatic<00:04:37.370> charge<00:04:38.090> buff<00:04:38.419> on<00:04:38.660> them<00:04:38.980> and

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
electrostatic charge buff on them and

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.240 
electrostatic charge buff on them and
believe<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.900> or<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.139> mechanically<00:04:43.040> that's

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
believe it or not mechanically that's

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.970 
believe it or not mechanically that's
the<00:04:43.490> entire<00:04:43.669> fight<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:45.080> basically<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.710> just

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
the entire fight so basically you just

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.180 
the entire fight so basically you just
get<00:04:46.340> your<00:04:46.460> your<00:04:47.240> couple<00:04:48.139> groups<00:04:48.320> assigned<00:04:48.980> to

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
get your your couple groups assigned to

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.450 
get your your couple groups assigned to
rotate<00:04:49.690> through<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.900> assembly<00:04:51.800> line<00:04:51.830> clean

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
rotate through the assembly line clean

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.100 
rotate through the assembly line clean
off<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.850> most<00:04:53.000> important<00:04:53.419> weapon<00:04:53.720> part<00:04:53.960> that

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
off the most important weapon part that

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.810 
off the most important weapon part that
you<00:04:54.169> want<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.350> get<00:04:54.500> rid<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.460> we<00:04:55.669> would

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
you want to get rid of so we would

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.520 
you want to get rid of so we would
always<00:04:55.970> kill<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.389> crawler<00:04:56.690> mine<00:04:56.930> weapon<00:04:57.320> part

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
always kill the crawler mine weapon part

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.090 
always kill the crawler mine weapon part
if<00:04:57.620> there<00:04:57.770> was<00:04:57.860> one<00:04:57.980> available<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:59.800> well<00:05:00.800> not

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
if there was one available and well not

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.670 
if there was one available and well not
always<00:05:01.250> but<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:01.669> tried<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.060> anyway<00:05:02.270> and

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
always but we tried to anyway and

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.159 
always but we tried to anyway and
otherwise<00:05:03.970> kind<00:05:04.970> of<00:05:05.030> just<00:05:05.180> left<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.510> laser<00:05:05.750> or

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
otherwise kind of just left the laser or

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.440 
otherwise kind of just left the laser or
the<00:05:06.430> missile<00:05:07.430> turret<00:05:07.669> alone<00:05:07.910> because<00:05:08.120> those

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
the missile turret alone because those

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.490 
the missile turret alone because those
are<00:05:08.570> pretty<00:05:08.690> easy<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:09.050> avoid<00:05:10.150> other<00:05:11.150> than<00:05:11.330> that

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
are pretty easy to avoid other than that

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.440 
are pretty easy to avoid other than that
just<00:05:12.500> handle<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.919> tanking<00:05:13.639> of<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:13.970> boss<00:05:14.120> and

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
just handle the tanking of the boss and

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.480 
just handle the tanking of the boss and
the<00:05:14.570> shredders<00:05:14.900> appropriately<00:05:15.500> most<00:05:16.220> of<00:05:16.400> the

the shredders appropriately most of the

the shredders appropriately most of the

assembly team fails to destroy one of

assembly team fails to destroy one of
the<00:05:34.310> weapon<00:05:34.580> parts<00:05:34.729> the<00:05:35.570> boss<00:05:35.750> will<00:05:35.960> become

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
the weapon parts the boss will become

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.070 
the weapon parts the boss will become
almost<00:05:37.250> immune<00:05:37.700> to<00:05:37.850> damage<00:05:38.000> for<00:05:38.360> 20<00:05:38.600> seconds

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
almost immune to damage for 20 seconds

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.870 
almost immune to damage for 20 seconds
he<00:05:39.260> takes<00:05:39.470> ten<00:05:39.710> percent<00:05:40.070> normal<00:05:40.310> damage<00:05:40.460> for

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
he takes ten percent normal damage for

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.029 
he takes ten percent normal damage for
the<00:05:40.940> duration<00:05:41.260> so<00:05:42.260> it's<00:05:42.410> really<00:05:42.590> important

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
the duration so it's really important

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.130 
the duration so it's really important
that<00:05:43.070> a<00:05:43.450> weapon<00:05:44.450> part<00:05:44.660> is<00:05:44.720> killed<00:05:44.990> every
