now<00:00:01.439> we'll<00:00:01.680> get<00:00:01.829> into<00:00:02.240> steaming<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.360> milk

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
now we'll get into steaming the milk

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.509 
now we'll get into steaming the milk
there<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.770> three<00:00:05.580> processes<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:07.519> preparing

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
there is three processes in preparing

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.249 
there is three processes in preparing
the<00:00:08.639> milk<00:00:09.559> for<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> single<00:00:11.070> cappuccino<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.259> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
the milk for a single cappuccino and the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.099 
the milk for a single cappuccino and the
first<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.799> after<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.570> after<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:17.930> have<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
first is after you after you have the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.080 
first is after you after you have the
pitcher<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.850> steam

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
pitcher like this and that the steam

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720 
pitcher like this and that the steam
wand<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.109> milk<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.590> after<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.460> turn

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
wand is in the milk and after you turn

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.929 
wand is in the milk and after you turn
on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.359> steam<00:00:24.900> wand<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.470> start<00:00:25.890> steaming<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
on the steam wand and start steaming the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
on the steam wand and start steaming the
first<00:00:27.180> process<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.840> you're<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.320> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
first process that you're going to do is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.980 
first process that you're going to do is
kind<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.490> hold<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.420> hold<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
kind of hold it I like to hold the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.130 
kind of hold it I like to hold the
pitcher<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:32.070> groove<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.000> hold<00:00:33.960> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
pitcher in this groove here and hold it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.860 
pitcher in this groove here and hold it
at<00:00:34.260> an<00:00:34.410> angle<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.010> get<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> milk<00:00:35.940> rolling<00:00:36.480> so

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
at an angle and get the milk rolling so

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
at an angle and get the milk rolling so
it's<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.320> spinning<00:00:37.710> inside<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> pitcher

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it's kind of spinning inside the pitcher

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
it's kind of spinning inside the pitcher
while<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.750> tip<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> steam<00:00:40.410> wand<00:00:40.620> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
while the tip of the steam wand is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.290 
while the tip of the steam wand is
submerged<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> milk<00:00:43.309> right<00:00:44.309> where<00:00:44.579> right

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
submerged in the milk right where right

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.350 
submerged in the milk right where right
when<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.780> feel<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.350> milk<00:00:46.590> break<00:00:49.039> into

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
when you can feel the milk break into

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.760 
when you can feel the milk break into
the<00:00:51.360> same<00:00:51.719> temperature<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.410> hand<00:00:52.590> which

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the same temperature as your hand which

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.350 
the same temperature as your hand which
is<00:00:52.890> about<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.309> hundred<00:00:53.520> degrees<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:54.180> when

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is about a hundred degrees right when

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.060 
is about a hundred degrees right when
you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.600> feel<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.870> warm<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.410> you'll<00:00:55.710> drop<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
you can feel it warm up you'll drop it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
you can feel it warm up you'll drop it
down<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.730> start<00:00:57.420> stretching<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.230> introducing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
down to start stretching or introducing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
down to start stretching or introducing
air<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.879> where<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.510> making<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
air and that's where you're making the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.770 
air and that's where you're making the
foam<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> milk<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.180> that's<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.510> you're

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
foam in the milk and that's what you're

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
foam in the milk and that's what you're
going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.260> you're<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
going to do you're not going to have to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.899 
going to do you're not going to have to
do<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.970> much<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:07.380> lighter<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> skim

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
do as much for a lighter like a skim

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.840 
do as much for a lighter like a skim
milk<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.360> something<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.610> foam<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
milk or something like that foam is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390 
milk or something like that foam is
created<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.840> even<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.500> foam<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> created

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
created more even more foam is created

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.270 
created more even more foam is created
more<00:01:14.580> evenly<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.900> lighter<00:01:16.170> milk<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
more evenly with a lighter milk then the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
more evenly with a lighter milk then the
third<00:01:17.490> process<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> push<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.810> pitcher

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
third process is you push the pitcher

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.010 
third process is you push the pitcher
back<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.860> submerge<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> steam<00:01:21.360> wand<00:01:21.600> once

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
back up submerge the steam wand once

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.090 
back up submerge the steam wand once
again<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> spinning<00:01:25.770> again

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
again and and then get it spinning again

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.359 
again and and then get it spinning again
and<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> blend<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:28.020> foam<00:01:28.799> with

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and that's going to blend your foam with

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.700 
and that's going to blend your foam with
your<00:01:29.549> steamed<00:01:29.820> milk<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> nice

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
your steamed milk and kind of get a nice

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.700 
your steamed milk and kind of get a nice
consistency<00:01:32.369> throughout<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> milk<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.110> I'll

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
consistency throughout the milk so I'll

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:57.910 
consistency throughout the milk so I'll
demonstrate<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.979 

you
