00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
supposed to be some sort of clue of

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.569 
supposed to be some sort of clue of
where<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.659> second<00:01:53.020> supposedly<00:01:53.799> bus<00:01:54.039> route<00:01:54.340> is

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
where the second supposedly bus route is

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.999 
where the second supposedly bus route is
and<00:01:54.850> maybe<00:01:55.359> it's<00:01:55.539> not<00:01:55.630> even<00:01:55.689> a<00:01:56.109> bus<00:01:56.560> route

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
and maybe it's not even a bus route

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.700 
and maybe it's not even a bus route
maybe<00:01:57.369> it's<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.880> train<00:01:58.270> route<00:01:58.509> or<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.560> maybe

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
maybe it's a train route or that maybe

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.069 
maybe it's a train route or that maybe
the<00:01:59.920> Train<00:02:00.189> is<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.429> second<00:02:00.969> bus<00:02:01.149> who<00:02:01.840> knows

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
the Train is the second bus who knows

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.870 
the Train is the second bus who knows
but<00:02:02.409> if<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.679> watch<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:02.950> derailed<00:02:03.549> train

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the Train loading station I don't know

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.940 
the Train loading station I don't know
where<00:02:28.120> they're<00:02:28.209> loading<00:02:28.599> in<00:02:28.720> there<00:02:29.140> but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
where they're loading in there but

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.800 
where they're loading in there but
there's<00:02:30.099> huge<00:02:30.250> vats<00:02:30.609> where<00:02:30.939> it<00:02:31.390> would<00:02:31.540> drop

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
there's huge vats where it would drop

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.839 
there's huge vats where it would drop
into<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.470> Train<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.010> load<00:02:33.220> stuff<00:02:33.519> in<00:02:33.670> there

into the Train and load stuff in there

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.309 
into the Train and load stuff in there
but<00:02:33.879> obviously<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.689> animation<00:02:35.170> doesn't

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
but obviously that animation doesn't

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.129 
but obviously that animation doesn't
happen<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:36.000> transit<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.239> it's<00:02:37.540> inaccessible

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
happen in transit and it's inaccessible

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.289 
happen in transit and it's inaccessible
but<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.950> rendered<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.670> there<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.120> that's

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
but it's rendered in there so that's

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.780 
but it's rendered in there so that's
what<00:02:40.480> makes<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.379> skeptical<00:02:42.069> but<00:02:42.280> if<00:02:42.459> there

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
what makes it so skeptical but if there

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.569 
what makes it so skeptical but if there
is<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> second<00:02:43.689> bus<00:02:43.870> route<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.829> being<00:02:45.310> either

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
is a second bus route it being either

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
the most elusive thing that I've ever

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.960 
the most elusive thing that I've ever
seen<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.230> lobbies<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.889> someone<00:02:54.400> were<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.579> find

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
seen in lobbies if someone were to find

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.259 
seen in lobbies if someone were to find
it<00:02:55.150> or<00:02:55.569> this<00:02:56.500> could<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.769> be<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.310> hardcore

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
it or this could just be a hardcore

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.080 
it or this could just be a hardcore
hardcore<00:02:58.720> troll<00:02:59.230> knowing<00:03:00.099> Jimmy<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.970> is

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
hardcore troll knowing Jimmy this is

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.699 
hardcore troll knowing Jimmy this is
what<00:03:01.239> I'm<00:03:01.450> thinking<00:03:01.500> considering<00:03:02.500> that

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
what I'm thinking considering that

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.789 
what I'm thinking considering that
everybody<00:03:03.609> has<00:03:03.970> gone<00:03:04.329> through<00:03:04.659> this<00:03:04.840> map<00:03:05.109> time

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
everybody has gone through this map time

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.369 
everybody has gone through this map time
and<00:03:06.040> time<00:03:06.220> again<00:03:06.269> doing<00:03:07.269> everything<00:03:07.930> they<00:03:08.319> can

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
and time again doing everything they can

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.270 
and time again doing everything they can
I<00:03:09.000> am<00:03:10.000> thinking<00:03:10.419> that<00:03:10.450> Jimmy<00:03:10.989> made<00:03:11.859> this<00:03:12.069> map

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
I am thinking that Jimmy made this map

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.719 
I am thinking that Jimmy made this map
as<00:03:12.669> a<00:03:13.239> troll<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.109> we're<00:03:14.829> all<00:03:14.979> just<00:03:15.280> kind<00:03:15.669> of

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:15.729 
as a troll and we're all just kind of

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.210 
as a troll and we're all just kind of
pawns<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.329> his<00:03:16.389> little<00:03:16.750> chess<00:03:16.930> game<00:03:17.199> so<00:03:17.919> this

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
pawns in his little chess game so this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.460 
pawns in his little chess game so this
is<00:03:18.280> what<00:03:18.459> I'm<00:03:18.669> thinking<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.359> every<00:03:20.109> now<00:03:20.260> and

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
is what I'm thinking and every now and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.159 
is what I'm thinking and every now and
then<00:03:20.530> Jimmy<00:03:20.859> will<00:03:21.099> when<00:03:21.849> he<00:03:22.120> feels<00:03:22.419> like<00:03:22.569> the

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
then Jimmy will when he feels like the

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.500 
then Jimmy will when he feels like the
people<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.680> are<00:03:23.859> dying<00:03:24.310> for<00:03:25.000> some
