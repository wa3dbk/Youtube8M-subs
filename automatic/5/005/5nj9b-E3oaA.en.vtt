00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.310
 or linguistics are you hope you are 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 great and today I bring you a day white 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.630
 delight of how to make shorts 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.210
 watermelon the truth also seems average 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.000
 super original and thus taking advantage of a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.369
 short that you no longer use ok buses 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.009
 how they are and can transform them into another 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.659
 Well, more originals I hope you like it 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.659
 the video and here you have it 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.529
 what we will mainly use 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.710
 They are a white shorts that we no longer use 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.769
 so that the dyes are better 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.290
 lots of gloves and tape what 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.750
 first thing we're going to do is put the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.730
 ribbon for this part of the sun ahead 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.559
 and behind this will prevent it from 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.780
 in contact the green dye with the dye 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.089
 red for the second step we need 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.890
 mostly gloves what we're going to do 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.960
 it is previously to have prepared the dye 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.460
 green and throw it in a jar that you have 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.890
 in your house the most important thing is that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.600
 have this type of dispenser we 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.070
 We will help expand it with our 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.059
 fingers we do it both in front and in 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.500
 from behind above the ribbon now 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.600
 we go with the red dye we have it 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.640
 be in a little bigger boat with 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.280
 this type of dispenser also what 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.530
 will be thrown down and has been 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.210
 super easy because these pants have been 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.250
 passed to the back so for 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.020
 it has been very easy for me to take this step 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.220
 The third thing we are going to do is remove 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.290
 the tape as you see has not been 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.900
 perfect since the watermelon is not perfect 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.930
 and we'll let it drain before we 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.250
 go to the clothesline where we have to 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.590
 Tender and leave for 8 hours 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.240
 once past 8 hours we collect the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.860
 pants and we have to do the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.220
 pipes that we will do with a marker 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.530
 permanent or black textile 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.200
 the first row we will do it with about two 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.300
 centimeters away and the second the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.880
 we have to do as if they were in 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.090
 middle of this row but on the part of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.090
 down 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.520
 I only did one part and I put it 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.200
 down a fold and I think I was left 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.850
 pretty good because so many pipes the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.620
 true that it does not look good me what 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 would combine with a shorter shirt 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.950
 ahead that behind color 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.410
 white or the same style but in black 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.720
 I hope you liked this idea and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.760
 that you put it into practice and if you put it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.660
 in practice you do it you have to send a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.660
 photo by twitter 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.829
 or by instagram 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.319
 You can also leave a like so that 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.569
 they know that these cool days I do 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.689
 more to decorate some clothes of 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.489
 different ways and do not forget 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.459
 share the video so that more people 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.840
 Sometimes you can subscribe us to see more 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.730
 videos but I hope that I have 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.400
 I really liked the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.219
 results did not think about staying too 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.230
 and well, I encourage you to do it, which is 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.659
 pretty easy yes I've done it all 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.389
 you can do it so I do not expect anything 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.269
 do it or that there is another design the 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.109
 originality is free and now we have in 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.109
 the next video
