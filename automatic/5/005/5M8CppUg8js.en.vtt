okay<00:00:01.469> here's<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:01.770> parts<00:00:02.100> we're<00:00:02.190> going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> be

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay here's the parts we're going to be

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.160 
okay here's the parts we're going to be
using<00:00:03.290> first<00:00:04.970> we're<00:00:05.970> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.270> need<00:00:09.139> so<00:00:10.139> i

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
color I bought these on ebay before I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.479 
color I bought these on ebay before I
put<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.720> instructable<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.340> an

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
put this instructable up I will have an

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.820 
put this instructable up I will have an
exact<00:00:38.880> link<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> source<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.620> these

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
exact link for the source because these

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.140 
exact link for the source because these
do<00:00:41.160> fit<00:00:41.460> perfectly<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> library<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:44.150> these

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
do fit perfectly in the library so these

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.630 
do fit perfectly in the library so these
are<00:00:45.210> five<00:00:45.630> millimeters<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.500> any<00:00:47.370> five

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
are five millimeters so any five

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.000 
are five millimeters so any five
millimeter<00:00:48.150> should<00:00:48.390> fit<00:00:48.980> with<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> 46<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.150> these

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
millimeter should fit with a 46 of these

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:02.280 
millimeter should fit with a 46 of these
these<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.070> green<00:00:53.519> by<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> way

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.220 

okay<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.340> then<00:01:03.670> along<00:01:04.360> with<00:01:04.420> those<00:01:04.809> LEDs

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
okay and then along with those LEDs

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.580 
okay and then along with those LEDs
we're<00:01:05.530> going<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.740> need<00:01:07.230> we're<00:01:08.230> doing<00:01:08.500> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
we're going to need we're doing the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.580 
we're going to need we're doing the
common<00:01:09.930> common<00:01:10.930> cathode<00:01:11.170> configuration

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
common common cathode configuration

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.930 
common common cathode configuration
we're<00:01:12.460> going<00:01:12.730> to<00:01:12.910> need<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.160> say<00:01:15.460> Oh<00:01:15.720> 12<00:01:16.720> 14

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
we're going to need what I say Oh 12 14

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:26.910 
we're going to need what I say Oh 12 14
call<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.060> 14<00:01:20.729> 100<00:01:21.870> ohm<00:01:24.750> resistors<00:01:25.770> these<00:01:26.770> are

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
call it 14 100 ohm resistors these are

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
call it 14 100 ohm resistors these are
just<00:01:27.160> standard<00:01:27.550> through<00:01:27.850> whole<00:01:28.050> quarter<00:01:29.050> wat

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
just standard through whole quarter wat

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.800 
just standard through whole quarter wat
resistors<00:01:31.780> those<00:01:32.170> are<00:01:32.350> super<00:01:32.530> cheap<00:01:33.810> we're

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
resistors those are super cheap we're

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.380 
resistors those are super cheap we're
going<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.080> need<00:01:35.320> some<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.790> of<00:01:36.850> sandpaper

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
going to need some kind of sandpaper

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.480 
going to need some kind of sandpaper
this<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.009> 320<00:01:39.009> block<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.850> 320<00:01:40.690> grit<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
this is 320 block of 320 grit and the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.080 
this is 320 block of 320 grit and the
reason<00:01:42.910> I'm<00:01:43.060> using<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:45.430> because<00:01:45.850> these

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
reason I'm using this is because these

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.450 
reason I'm using this is because these
LEDs<00:01:46.869> are<00:01:47.259> clear<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:49.259> whenever<00:01:50.259> clear<00:01:50.950> LEDs

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
LEDs are clear and whenever clear LEDs

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.070 
LEDs are clear and whenever clear LEDs
are<00:01:51.729> in<00:01:51.820> close<00:01:52.060> proximity<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.780> each<00:01:52.840> other

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
are in close proximity to each other

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.840 
are in close proximity to each other
they<00:01:53.259> tend<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.710> kind<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.009> light<00:01:54.250> each<00:01:54.400> other<00:01:54.640> up

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
they tend to kind of light each other up

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.109 
they tend to kind of light each other up
a<00:01:54.970> little<00:01:55.210> bit<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.430> want<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.790> do<00:01:57.970> is

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
a little bit and what we want to do is

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.480 
a little bit and what we want to do is
we<00:01:58.240> want<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.540> glow<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:58.960> stay<00:01:59.410> like<00:01:59.890> on<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.340> LED

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
we want the glow to stay like on the LED

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.930 
we want the glow to stay like on the LED
itself<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:01.899> we're<00:02:02.440> going<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.619> diffuse<00:02:03.220> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
itself so we're going to diffuse the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.300 
itself so we're going to diffuse the
outside<00:02:04.390> with<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.170> little<00:02:05.350> light<00:02:05.530> sanding<00:02:06.130> on

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
outside with a little light sanding on

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.340 
outside with a little light sanding on
the<00:02:06.909> sand<00:02:07.180> paper<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:07.750> don't<00:02:07.900> have<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.200> use

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
the sand paper so you don't have to use

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.830 
the sand paper so you don't have to use
a<00:02:08.380> sand<00:02:08.769> block<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.280> did<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:10.450> going<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.690> thought

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
a sand block I did just going to thought

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.710 
a sand block I did just going to thought
it'd<00:02:10.929> be<00:02:10.959> easier<00:02:11.350> but<00:02:11.920> uh<00:02:11.980> or<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:13.480> can<00:02:13.630> either

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it'd be easier but uh or you can either

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.830 
it'd be easier but uh or you can either
buy<00:02:13.989> your<00:02:14.560> LEDs<00:02:15.010> already<00:02:15.400> diffuse<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.720> can

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
buy your LEDs already diffuse so you can

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.990 
buy your LEDs already diffuse so you can
have<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.989> diffuse<00:02:17.380> glow<00:02:17.560> or<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.430> get<00:02:18.790> some

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
have a diffuse glow or you can get some

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.539 
have a diffuse glow or you can get some
real<00:02:19.959> fine<00:02:20.170> sandpaper<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.920> do<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> yourself

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
real fine sandpaper and do it yourself

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.050 
real fine sandpaper and do it yourself
but<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> 320<00:02:22.840> grit<00:02:24.510> sanding<00:02:25.510> block

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
but this is a 320 grit sanding block

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.229 
but this is a 320 grit sanding block
okay<00:02:28.060> my<00:02:29.049> Arduino<00:02:29.560> Uno<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.860> currently<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.940> use

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
okay my Arduino Uno is currently in use

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.789 
okay my Arduino Uno is currently in use
i<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.600> another<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.080> somewhere<00:02:32.320> else<00:02:32.560> but

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
i have another one somewhere else but

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.310 
i have another one somewhere else but
this<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> mega<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.620> do<00:02:35.739> not<00:02:35.860> need<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.220> mega

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
this is a mega you do not need a mega

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.440 
this is a mega you do not need a mega
we're<00:02:38.320> going<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.500> call<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.920> an<00:02:39.280> Arduino<00:02:40.120> Uno

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
we're going to call this an Arduino Uno

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.790 
we're going to call this an Arduino Uno
even<00:02:43.450> though<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.720> not<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:45.959> this

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.570 
press them and they stay on or off you
don't<00:03:02.260> want<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.770> know<00:03:02.860> they<00:03:03.040> click<00:03:03.340> on

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
don't want the you know they click on

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.320 
don't want the you know they click on
off<00:03:03.820> switch<00:03:04.030> we<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:04.930> want<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.170> momentary<00:03:05.740> push

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.210 

so<00:03:10.330> too<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.810> owes<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:11.500> go<00:03:11.740> along<00:03:12.010> with

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
so too it owes and then go along with

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.440 
so too it owes and then go along with
those<00:03:12.430> we're<00:03:12.880> also<00:03:13.030> going<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:15.450> these

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
those we're also going to have to these

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.180 
those we're also going to have to these
are<00:03:16.690> two<00:03:17.080> point<00:03:17.410> two<00:03:17.730> kilo<00:03:18.730> ohm<00:03:20.220> quarter<00:03:21.220> wat

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
are two point two kilo ohm quarter wat

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.790 
are two point two kilo ohm quarter wat
resistors

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.480 

so<00:03:28.460> those<00:03:28.670> are<00:03:28.700> going<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.030> be<00:03:29.090> some<00:03:30.280> those<00:03:31.280> are

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
so those are going to be some those are

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.770 
so those are going to be some those are
the<00:03:31.550> pull-up<00:03:31.940> resistors<00:03:33.340> for<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.460> switches

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.080 

and<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.770> don't<00:03:39.920> know<00:03:40.130> for<00:03:40.400> sure<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.730> that

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
and I don't know for sure that that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.670 
and I don't know for sure that that
resistance<00:03:41.600> level<00:03:41.960> is<00:03:42.020> going<00:03:42.050> to<00:03:42.230> work<00:03:42.410> I'm

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
resistance level is going to work I'm

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.890 
resistance level is going to work I'm
going<00:03:42.800> to<00:03:42.860> try<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.130> if<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.520> do<00:03:43.580> change<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:44.150> change

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
going to try it if I do change it change

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.390

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.570 
with the kind of hack this up that there
is<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:54.050> looks<00:03:54.230> like<00:03:54.350> bare<00:03:54.590> wire<00:03:54.830> but<00:03:55.100> there<00:03:55.280> is

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
is it looks like bare wire but there is

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.130 
is it looks like bare wire but there is
shrink<00:03:56.830> tubing<00:03:57.830> on<00:03:57.980> there<00:03:58.630> there's<00:03:59.630> nine<00:03:59.870> volt

one oh I just hacked up a a hacked up of

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.250 
one oh I just hacked up a a hacked up of
old<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.980> from<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.459> toy<00:04:16.670> or<00:04:16.700> something<00:04:17.150> oh<00:04:17.540> okay

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
old is from a toy or something oh okay

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.949 
old is from a toy or something oh okay
this<00:04:18.680> side<00:04:18.980> is<00:04:19.010> from<00:04:19.580> another<00:04:19.730> Arduino<00:04:20.690> power

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
this side is from another Arduino power

this side is from another Arduino power
supply<00:04:21.380> think<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.400> but<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.090> I'm<00:04:23.690> using<00:04:23.930> nine

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
supply think so but you I'm using nine

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.830 
supply think so but you I'm using nine
volt<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:24.680> can<00:04:24.950> use<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.580> know<00:04:25.610> double<00:04:26.510> A's<00:04:26.660> or

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
volt you can use you know double A's or

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.190 
volt you can use you know double A's or
whatever<00:04:27.170> but<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:27.800> something<00:04:28.220> uh<00:04:29.200> we'll

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
whatever but just something uh we'll

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.320 
whatever but just something uh we'll
just<00:04:30.350> call<00:04:30.560> this<00:04:30.590> external<00:04:31.630> power<00:04:32.860> for

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
just call this external power for

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.370 
just call this external power for
arduino<00:04:35.330> because<00:04:35.780> you're<00:04:35.930> not<00:04:36.020> going<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:36.320> go

be inside of the light bright okay this
is<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:42.550> some<00:04:43.550> writing<00:04:43.880> all<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.060> down<00:04:44.740> I'll

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
is a some writing all this down I'll

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.310 
is a some writing all this down I'll
swear<00:04:46.040> I'll<00:04:46.360> scratch<00:04:47.360> this<00:04:47.570> part<00:04:47.870> out<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.200> let

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
swear I'll scratch this part out and let

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.530 
swear I'll scratch this part out and let
go<00:04:48.410> write<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.650> twice

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.040 

I'll<00:04:53.380> give<00:04:53.590> them<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.740> little<00:04:53.920> view<00:04:54.190> on<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:54.580> is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
I'll give them a little view on this is

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
know how much or we're going to use when

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.080 
know how much or we're going to use when
I<00:05:04.870> might<00:05:05.260> not<00:05:05.410> use<00:05:05.560> any<00:05:05.830> but<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.940> should

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
I might not use any but you should

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.020 
I might not use any but you should
always<00:05:07.210> have<00:05:07.450> that<00:05:07.600> around<00:05:07.870> anyway<00:05:08.290> and<00:05:09.030> in

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
always have that around anyway and in

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.700 
always have that around anyway and in
addition<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.510> these<00:05:10.780> things<00:05:11.230> you<00:05:11.500> need<00:05:11.680> to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
addition to these things you need to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.670 
addition to these things you need to
have<00:05:11.950> your<00:05:12.100> standard<00:05:12.370> shop<00:05:13.150> tools<00:05:13.450> pan<00:05:14.410> over

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
have your standard shop tools pan over

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.330 
have your standard shop tools pan over
there<00:05:14.860> I've<00:05:15.550> got<00:05:15.730> a<00:05:15.760> helping<00:05:16.120> hands<00:05:17.340> soldering

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340

have that yeah that's pretty close to
probably<00:05:35.050> have<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.350> use<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.530> drill<00:05:35.950> at<00:05:36.130> some

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
probably have to use a drill at some

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.600
