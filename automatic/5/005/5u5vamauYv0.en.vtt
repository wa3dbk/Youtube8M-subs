00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.700 
painting I was helping a friend trim his
house<00:00:34.609> and<00:00:34.850> we're<00:00:35.000> using<00:00:35.149> Windsor<00:00:35.720> casing<00:00:36.260> and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
house and we're using Windsor casing and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.410 
house and we're using Windsor casing and
I<00:00:37.430> was<00:00:37.550> always<00:00:37.670> helping<00:00:37.910> my<00:00:38.000> buddy<00:00:38.239> out<00:00:38.329> I

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
I was always helping my buddy out I

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.870 
I was always helping my buddy out I
thought<00:00:38.780> well<00:00:39.559> I<00:00:39.590> think<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:40.100> Windsor<00:00:40.489> casing

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
thought well I think that Windsor casing

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.340 
thought well I think that Windsor casing
would<00:00:40.970> make<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.420> nice<00:00:41.660> frame<00:00:42.050> for<00:00:42.320> that

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
would make a nice frame for that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.049 
would make a nice frame for that
painting<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.890> Andy<00:00:43.190> did<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:43.910> that's

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
3/4 by 12 and 3/4 then the next step is

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.050 
3/4 by 12 and 3/4 then the next step is
to<00:01:11.869> decide<00:01:12.069> what<00:01:13.069> side<00:01:13.310> of<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.490> molding<00:01:13.909> I

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
to decide what side of the molding I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.419 
to decide what side of the molding I
want<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:14.450> be<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.689> inside<00:01:15.139> or<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.469> outside<00:01:15.740> of

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
the frame and in this case I decided I

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.699 
the frame and in this case I decided I
wanted<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.459> be<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:20.659> be<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.840> outside<00:01:21.499> of<00:01:21.619> the

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:21.709 
wanted to be to be the outside of the

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:23.889 
wanted to be to be the outside of the
frame<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.789> what<00:01:22.880> I'm<00:01:22.969> going<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.119> do<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.569> first

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.429 
with the moldings now cut the length I
can<00:02:00.159> assemble<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.670> frame<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.450> I'll<00:02:02.200> use<00:02:02.409> a

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
can assemble the frame and I'll use a

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.070 
can assemble the frame and I'll use a
little<00:02:02.830> wood<00:02:03.009> glue<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.460> corners<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.119> inch

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
little wood glue in the corners and inch

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.009 
little wood glue in the corners and inch
long<00:02:05.439> nails<00:02:05.770> on<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:07.030> outer<00:02:07.330> part<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:07.960> the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
long nails on the outer part of the

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.800 
long nails on the outer part of the
frame<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.649> then<00:02:09.160> I'm<00:02:09.280> going<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.459> put<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.940> larger

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
frame and then I'm going to put a larger

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.589 
frame and then I'm going to put a larger
nail<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.950> nail<00:02:12.130> gun<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.670> now<00:02:13.269> through

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
nail in the nail gun and now through

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.339 
nail in the nail gun and now through
this

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
this

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.350 
this
I<00:02:14.380> guess<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.220> inside<00:02:15.670> part<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.120> frame

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
I guess it's inside part of the frame

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.390 
I guess it's inside part of the frame
I'll<00:02:17.019> bring<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> camera<00:02:17.620> closer<00:02:17.980> when<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.310> do

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
I'll bring the camera closer when I do

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.039 
I'll bring the camera closer when I do
that<00:02:23.880> I'm<00:02:24.880> gonna<00:02:25.030> squeeze<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.840> frame

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
that I'm gonna squeeze the frame

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.400 
that I'm gonna squeeze the frame
together<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.769> little<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.370> glue<00:02:28.290> squeezes<00:02:29.290> out

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
together so little the glue squeezes out

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.970 
together so little the glue squeezes out
and<00:02:29.680> hold<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.160> miter<00:02:30.370> right<00:02:30.760> where<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:30.970> want<00:02:31.330> it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.440 

now<00:02:35.980> I've<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:36.310> changed<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.849> nails<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
now I've just changed the nails in the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.630 
now I've just changed the nails in the
nail<00:02:37.630> gun<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.049> an<00:02:38.200> inch<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.530> half<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.489> I'm

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
nail gun to an inch and a half and I'm

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.880 
nail gun to an inch and a half and I'm
going<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:40.030> nail<00:02:40.239> through<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.840> inside<00:02:41.530> part

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
going to nail through this inside part

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.390 
going to nail through this inside part
of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.430> corner<00:02:46.650> ok<00:02:47.650> well<00:02:47.830> that's<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.220> last

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
of the corner ok well that's the last

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.690 
of the corner ok well that's the last
nail<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.989> can<00:02:50.140> see<00:02:50.320> how<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.500> frame<00:02:50.829> well

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
nail and you can see how the frame well

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.580 
nail and you can see how the frame well
it<00:02:51.790> looks<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.000> it's<00:02:52.239> done<00:02:52.570> but<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:53.320> isn't

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
it looks like it's done but it isn't

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.870 
it looks like it's done but it isn't
there's<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.769> few<00:02:53.980> things<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.280> still<00:02:54.579> need<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
there's a few things that still need to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.539 
there's a few things that still need to
do<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.870> one<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.410> need<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.680> build<00:02:56.890> out<00:02:57.190> the

do and one is I need to build out the

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.840 
do and one is I need to build out the
back<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.959> will<00:02:59.350> be<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.370> structure<00:03:00.730> that

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
back so that will be the structure that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.690 
back so that will be the structure that
holds<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.299> painting<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:01.720> place<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:03.400> want

I'm<00:03:47.430> using<00:03:47.730> 1/2<00:03:48.150> inch<00:03:48.450> plywood<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:49.110> I've<00:03:49.260> cut

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
I'm using 1/2 inch plywood that I've cut

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.100 
I'm using 1/2 inch plywood that I've cut
to<00:03:49.650> 2<00:03:49.890> inch<00:03:50.040> strips<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:51.180> build<00:03:51.510> out<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.870> back

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
to 2 inch strips to build out the back

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.230 
to 2 inch strips to build out the back
of<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.380> frame<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.340> you'll<00:03:53.580> also<00:03:53.730> notice<00:03:54.060> that

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
of the frame and you'll also notice that

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.809 
of the frame and you'll also notice that
I'm<00:03:54.390> not<00:03:54.420> using<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:55.290> miter<00:03:55.530> joint<00:03:55.680> I'm<00:03:56.160> using<00:03:56.670> a

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
I'm not using a miter joint I'm using a

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.880 
I'm not using a miter joint I'm using a
straight<00:03:57.150> cut<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.690> what<00:03:58.260> that's<00:03:58.470> gonna<00:03:58.650> do<00:03:58.860> is

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
straight cut and what that's gonna do is

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.670 
straight cut and what that's gonna do is
help<00:03:59.250> strengthen<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.660> miter<00:04:00.930> joint<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.620> is

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
help strengthen the miter joint that is

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.980 
help strengthen the miter joint that is
already<00:04:02.160> there<00:04:02.430> because<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:03.000> overlaps<00:04:03.660> into

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
already there because it overlaps into

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.830 
already there because it overlaps into
the<00:04:04.170> next<00:04:04.440> piece<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.650> molding<00:04:05.450> I'm<00:04:06.450> adding<00:04:06.780> a

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
the next piece of molding I'm adding a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.390 
the next piece of molding I'm adding a
little<00:04:07.020> wood<00:04:07.350> glue<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:07.830> strength<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:10.400> you

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
little wood glue for strength and you

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.880 
little wood glue for strength and you
can<00:04:11.550> see<00:04:11.820> how<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.750> half-inch<00:04:13.500> piece<00:04:13.709> of

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
can see how the half-inch piece of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.640 
can see how the half-inch piece of
plywood<00:04:14.510> overlaps<00:04:15.510> into<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.019> second<00:04:16.440> piece

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650

plywood overlaps into the second piece
of<00:04:16.680> molding<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:18.810> will<00:04:18.959> strengthen<00:04:19.260> this

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
of molding and that will strengthen this

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.200 
of molding and that will strengthen this
miter<00:04:19.950> joint<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.900> then<00:04:22.230> to<00:04:22.740> attach<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
structure now I'm going to work on the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.900 
structure now I'm going to work on the
outside<00:04:53.690> inside<00:04:54.690> edge<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.620> basically<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.490> just

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
outside inside edge so basically I just

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.670 
outside inside edge so basically I just
want<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.180> beef<00:04:57.510> up<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.900> back<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.440> frame

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
want to beef up the back of the frame

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.550 
want to beef up the back of the frame
here<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.700> do<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.890> have<00:05:01.890> some<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.850> them

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
here and to do that I have some of them

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.530 
here and to do that I have some of them
some<00:05:04.560> of<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.770> back<00:05:05.010> band<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:06.000> we've<00:05:06.270> been

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
some of the back band that we've been

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.050 
some of the back band that we've been
using<00:05:06.780> on<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.169> job<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:07.979> what<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> backbend<00:05:08.790> is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
using on the job so what a backbend is

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.450 
using on the job so what a backbend is
when<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.780> run<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.140> casing<00:05:10.680> up<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.280> around

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
when you run the casing up and around

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.409 
when you run the casing up and around
the<00:05:11.669> door<00:05:11.910> if<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:13.110> want<00:05:13.380> a<00:05:13.560> heavier<00:05:14.120> side<00:05:15.120> to

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
the door if you want a heavier side to

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.420 
the door if you want a heavier side to
the<00:05:15.510> case<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:15.990> can<00:05:16.169> back<00:05:16.440> band<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:16.979> the

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
the case and you can back band it the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.340 
the case and you can back band it the
reason<00:05:17.580> why<00:05:17.760> I<00:05:17.790> like<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.210> do<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.870> that<00:05:19.169> way

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
reason why I like to do that is that way

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.940 
reason why I like to do that is that way
when<00:05:20.100> your<00:05:20.460> baseboard<00:05:21.530> dead-ends<00:05:22.530> into<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
when your baseboard dead-ends into the

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.550 
when your baseboard dead-ends into the
back<00:05:23.160> band<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:24.540> run<00:05:24.750> your<00:05:24.780> shoe<00:05:25.140> molding

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
back band and you run your shoe molding

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.620 
back band and you run your shoe molding
at<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.890> end<00:05:26.100> of<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.310> job<00:05:26.550> then<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.419> shoe

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
at the end of the job then the shoe

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.270 
at the end of the job then the shoe
molding<00:05:27.990> also<00:05:28.260> dead-ends<00:05:28.890> into<00:05:29.190> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
molding also dead-ends into the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.210 
molding also dead-ends into the
background<00:05:29.729> I'm<00:05:30.570> attaching<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.260> piece<00:05:32.010> of

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
background I'm attaching the piece of

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.050 
background I'm attaching the piece of
molding<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.850> back<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.450> frame<00:05:33.830> by

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
molding to the back of the frame by

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.170 
molding to the back of the frame by
nailing<00:05:36.060> through<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:37.020> front<00:05:37.380> of<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.560> frame

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
nailing through the front of the frame

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.730 
nailing through the front of the frame
it's<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.240> little<00:05:39.479> bit<00:05:39.600> easier<00:05:40.020> though<00:05:40.229> if<00:05:40.500> you

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
it's a little bit easier though if you

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.690 
it's a little bit easier though if you
can<00:05:40.979> first<00:05:41.250> get<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.180> nail<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.320> miter<00:05:43.700> and

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
can first get a nail in the miter and

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.020 
can first get a nail in the miter and
then<00:05:44.820> that<00:05:45.000> will<00:05:45.180> hold<00:05:46.190> this<00:05:47.190> end<00:05:47.460> in<00:05:47.610> place

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
then that will hold this end in place

00:05:49.030 --> 00:06:00.750 
then that will hold this end in place
and<00:05:49.150> then<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:49.990> can<00:05:50.230> stand<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.220> frame<00:05:51.460> up<00:05:59.760> well

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
and then you can stand the frame up well

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.730 
and then you can stand the frame up well
that's<00:06:00.940> it<00:06:01.090> for<00:06:01.270> now<00:06:01.450> I<00:06:01.810> am<00:06:01.870> going<00:06:02.200> to<00:06:02.260> fill<00:06:02.440> all

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
that's it for now I am going to fill all

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.380 
that's it for now I am going to fill all
the<00:06:02.980> nail<00:06:03.160> holes<00:06:03.370> though<00:06:03.610> before<00:06:03.790> I<00:06:03.970> call<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:04.330> a

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
the nail holes though before I call it a

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.510 
the nail holes though before I call it a
day<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:04.780> that's<00:06:05.470> just<00:06:05.740> so<00:06:05.890> when<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.100> come<00:06:06.400> in

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
day and that's just so when I come in

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.640 
day and that's just so when I come in
tomorrow<00:06:06.670> I<00:06:07.180> can<00:06:07.780> give<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.110> frame<00:06:08.320> of<00:06:08.470> quick

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
color is white up and I also should

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.870 
color is white up and I also should
mention<00:06:56.620> that<00:06:56.860> I've<00:06:57.130> thinned<00:06:57.340> the<00:06:57.430> painting

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
mention that I've thinned the painting

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.350 
mention that I've thinned the painting
at<00:06:58.000> the<00:06:58.570> painting<00:06:58.930> but<00:06:59.080> the<00:06:59.340> paint<00:07:00.340> the<00:07:01.090> paint

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
at the painting but the paint the paint

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.690 
at the painting but the paint the paint
out<00:07:01.450> a<00:07:01.510> little<00:07:01.750> bit<00:07:01.960> with<00:07:02.110> pencil<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:02.950> I<00:07:03.490> like

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
out a little bit with pencil and I like

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.060 
out a little bit with pencil and I like
to<00:07:03.820> do<00:07:03.940> that<00:07:04.120> because<00:07:04.300> the<00:07:05.050> paint<00:07:05.320> just<00:07:05.590> lays

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
to do that because the paint just lays

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:14.209 
to do that because the paint just lays
down<00:07:06.340> a<00:07:06.400> little<00:07:06.670> bit<00:07:06.790> nicer
