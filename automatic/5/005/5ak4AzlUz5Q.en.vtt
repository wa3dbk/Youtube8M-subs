benefit<00:04:44.940> from<00:04:45.270> being<00:04:45.510> cleaned<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.470> more

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
benefit from being cleaned the more

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.050 
benefit from being cleaned the more
expense<00:04:46.950> of<00:04:47.040> your<00:04:47.130> cassette<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.700> more

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
expense of your cassette the more

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.330 
expense of your cassette the more
difficult<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.140> actually<00:04:49.650> get<00:04:49.950> it<00:04:50.070> clean

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
difficult it is to actually get it clean

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.460 
difficult it is to actually get it clean
but<00:04:51.000> in<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:51.540> instance<00:04:51.750> I'm<00:04:52.050> just<00:04:52.260> going<00:04:52.410> to

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
but in this instance I'm just going to

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.010 
but in this instance I'm just going to
try<00:04:52.710> with<00:04:52.770> degreaser<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.640> then<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.390> rag<00:04:54.750> as

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
try with degreaser and then a rag as

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.840 
try with degreaser and then a rag as
well<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.680> can<00:04:55.830> just<00:04:55.979> fit<00:04:56.190> between<00:04:56.340> the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
well you can just fit between the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:14.700 
well you can just fit between the
sprockets<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.750> clean<00:04:58.110> it<00:04:58.260> like<00:04:58.440> so

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.469 

just<00:05:15.220> pop<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.460> wheels<00:05:15.580> back<00:05:15.820> in<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.270> bike

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
just pop the wheels back in the bike

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.820 
just pop the wheels back in the bike
should<00:05:16.570> be<00:05:16.660> pretty<00:05:16.840> much<00:05:16.930> spotless<00:05:17.470> now<00:05:17.620> so

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
should be pretty much spotless now so

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.409 
should be pretty much spotless now so
we're<00:05:17.979> going<00:05:18.070> to<00:05:18.130> do<00:05:18.280> is<00:05:18.460> replace<00:05:18.610> our<00:05:19.060> bucket

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
we're going to do is replace our bucket

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.750 
we're going to do is replace our bucket
of<00:05:19.600> dirty<00:05:20.080> soapy<00:05:20.800> water<00:05:20.949> with<00:05:21.280> clean<00:05:21.520> water

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
of dirty soapy water with clean water

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.159 
of dirty soapy water with clean water
and<00:05:21.970> rinse<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.270> bike<00:05:22.449> off<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.930> can<00:05:23.050> use<00:05:23.139> a

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
and rinse the bike off you can use a

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.840 
and rinse the bike off you can use a
hose<00:05:23.380> at<00:05:23.620> this<00:05:23.710> point<00:05:23.919> as<00:05:24.010> well<00:05:24.100> some<00:05:24.639> people

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
hose at this point as well some people

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.180 
hose at this point as well some people
do<00:05:25.000> use<00:05:25.030> power<00:05:25.449> washers<00:05:25.900> but<00:05:26.380> if<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.800> do<00:05:26.979> that

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
do use power washers but if you do that

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.350 
do use power washers but if you do that
just<00:05:27.699> be<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:27.820> little<00:05:28.060> bit<00:05:28.150> careful

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
just be a little bit careful

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.090 
just be a little bit careful
particularly<00:05:29.080> around<00:05:29.169> delicate<00:05:29.680> bearings

that you don't actually blast all the

completely<00:05:34.000> it's<00:05:34.419> not<00:05:34.510> necessarily<00:05:35.110> a

completely it's not necessarily a

completely it's not necessarily a
problem<00:05:35.350> but<00:05:35.680> it's<00:05:36.340> going<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.550> give<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.760> more

pretty<00:05:46.000> much<00:05:46.240> spotless<00:05:46.780> except<00:05:47.110> for<00:05:47.229> one

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
pretty much spotless except for one

pretty much spotless except for one
jarring<00:05:48.280> thing<00:05:48.580> now<00:05:49.449> you've<00:05:49.660> noticed<00:05:49.949> Tom

laughs riding around on filthy bar tape
now<00:05:53.500> there<00:05:53.620> isn't<00:05:53.740> much<00:05:54.010> you<00:05:54.550> can<00:05:54.580> do<00:05:54.820> to<00:05:54.970> get

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
now there isn't much you can do to get

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.400 
now there isn't much you can do to get
it<00:05:55.210> clean<00:05:55.419> particularly<00:05:55.900> for<00:05:55.990> running<00:05:56.199> white

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410

it clean particularly for running white
bar<00:05:56.650> tape<00:05:56.889> and<00:05:57.070> that's<00:05:57.220> what<00:05:57.370> most<00:05:57.580> people

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
bar tape and that's what most people

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.909 
bar tape and that's what most people
probably<00:05:58.120> use<00:05:58.389> black<00:05:58.660> but<00:05:59.169> you<00:05:59.380> do<00:05:59.740> want<00:05:59.889> to

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
probably use black but you do want to

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.740 
probably use black but you do want to
give<00:06:00.039> it<00:06:00.100> a<00:06:00.130> try<00:06:00.400> soap<00:06:01.090> isn't<00:06:01.389> going<00:06:01.539> to<00:06:01.600> work

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
give it a try soap isn't going to work

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.040 
give it a try soap isn't going to work
so<00:06:02.020> try<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.530> something<00:06:02.919> like<00:06:02.949> w4t<00:06:03.820> and<00:06:04.030> then

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
so try it something like w4t and then

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.570 
so try it something like w4t and then
elbow<00:06:05.470> grease<00:06:07.440> so<00:06:08.440> your<00:06:08.650> bike's<00:06:08.830> clean<00:06:09.220> but

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:00.870 
using carbon rims as well because that's
an<00:06:58.539> expensive<00:06:59.229> mistake<00:06:59.500> if<00:07:00.160> you<00:07:00.370> leave<00:07:00.610> any

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
an expensive mistake if you leave any
