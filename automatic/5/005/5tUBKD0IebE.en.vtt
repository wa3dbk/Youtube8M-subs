hint gameplay help and you know if you
keep<00:02:33.160> doing<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.060> essentially<00:02:34.450> keep

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
keep doing that you can essentially keep

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.030 
keep doing that you can essentially keep
