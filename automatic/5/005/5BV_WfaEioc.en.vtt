00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
last year and came up a bit short

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.820 
last year and came up a bit short
finished<00:02:11.910> second<00:02:12.239> but

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
finished second but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.010 
finished second but
it<00:02:13.670> was<00:02:13.850> really<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> positive<00:02:14.570> event<00:02:14.780> for<00:02:14.990> us

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
it was really a positive event for us

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.990 
it was really a positive event for us
and<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.100> well<00:02:16.250> received<00:02:16.550> by<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> fans

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and and it was well received by the fans

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.640 
and and it was well received by the fans
I<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.540> event<00:02:17.960> should<00:02:18.260> continue

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
I think that that event should continue

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.720 
I think that that event should continue
to<00:02:18.740> grow<00:02:18.980> as<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.120> gained<00:02:20.300> some<00:02:20.600> momentum<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
to grow as it gained some momentum and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.570 
to grow as it gained some momentum and
continuity<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.240> calendar
