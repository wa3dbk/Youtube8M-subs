not<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.370> best<00:00:11.610> at<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
not the best at this and this is a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.749 
not the best at this and this is a
foolproof<00:00:12.750> but<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.259> does<00:00:13.500> work<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> point

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
foolproof but it does work to a point

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.330 
foolproof but it does work to a point

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
memo pad you can add stuff to it this

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.580 
memo pad you can add stuff to it this
top<00:00:26.640> number<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.640> secure<00:00:30.590> it's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
top number right here is the secure it's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.430 
top number right here is the secure it's
the<00:00:31.769> number<00:00:32.149> I'm<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.420> under<00:00:33.960> each<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the number I'm just under each one of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.720 
the number I'm just under each one of
these<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.430> whole<00:00:35.730> tour<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.210> 1<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.809> 2<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.260> 3<00:00:37.730> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
these as a whole tour a 1 a 2 or 3 the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.330 
these as a whole tour a 1 a 2 or 3 the
number<00:00:38.910> beside<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> Volturi<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:41.129> amount

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
number beside the Volturi is the amount

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.979 
number beside the Volturi is the amount
of<00:00:41.489> Voltorb<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.480> each<00:00:42.660> row<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.989> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
of Voltorb that are in each row so this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.470 
of Voltorb that are in each row so this
the<00:00:46.320> number<00:00:46.559> 8<00:00:46.770> means<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.210> two

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the number 8 means that all the one two

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
the number 8 means that all the one two
and<00:00:48.719> three<00:00:49.020> add<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.010> eight<00:00:51.649> now<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.579> things

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and three add up to eight now the things

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
and three add up to eight now the things
you<00:00:54.120> don't<00:00:54.300> ones<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:55.140> useless<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> volt<00:00:55.980> orbs

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you don't ones are useless and volt orbs

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
you don't ones are useless and volt orbs
are<00:00:56.430> obviously<00:00:56.760> definitely<00:00:57.210> Yusuf<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
are obviously definitely Yusuf what you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.820 
are obviously definitely Yusuf what you
want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.780> concentrate<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:01.199> finding<00:01:02.270> is<00:01:03.830> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
want to concentrate on finding is the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.660 
want to concentrate on finding is the
twos<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.189> threes<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
twos and threes so if you have one and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.929 
twos and threes so if you have one and
four<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.540> means<00:01:09.750> there's<00:01:09.960> five<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
four that means there's five there the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.520 
four that means there's five there the
obvious<00:01:12.360> that's<00:01:12.540> five<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.110> five

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
obvious that's five but there's five

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
obvious that's five but there's five
squares<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:15.210> there's<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.509> rule<00:01:15.720> toward

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
squares here so there's one rule toward

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
squares here so there's one rule toward
plus<00:01:16.860> four<00:01:17.130> squares<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> mean<00:01:17.820> everything<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
plus four squares I mean everything in

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
plus four squares I mean everything in
this<00:01:18.540> row<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:19.650> Voltorb<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
this row is there a one or Voltorb so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
this row is there a one or Voltorb so
you're<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> go

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you're not going to need it so I go

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.969 
you're not going to need it so I go
ahead<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.340> Mark<00:01:23.700> these<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.560> when<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:25.680> going

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
ahead and Mark these out when I'm going

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
ahead and Mark these out when I'm going
on<00:01:26.330> oops<00:01:29.030> later<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.600> easier<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> work

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
on oops later on it's easier to work

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
on oops later on it's easier to work
with<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.860> actually<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.640> ahead<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
with I actually go ahead and when I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.539 
with I actually go ahead and when I
first<00:01:33.509> start<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> board<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.320> look<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.860> any<00:01:35.040> zeros

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
first start a board I look for any zeros

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.510 
first start a board I look for any zeros

at all in the row and you go ahead and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
at all in the row and you go ahead and
open<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.850> ahead<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> football

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
open that out go ahead and football

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749 
open that out go ahead and football
squares<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> safe<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
squares in that because it's safe the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.580 
squares in that because it's safe the
more<00:01:44.970> squares<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.659> flipped<00:01:45.960> over<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
more squares you have flipped over the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.100 
more squares you have flipped over the
more<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.790> better<00:01:47.820> chances<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
more the better chances of you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.499 
more the better chances of you
completing<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.040> board<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:53.640> two<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.390> three

completing the board this two and three

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.970 
completing the board this two and three
is<00:01:54.570> five<00:01:54.780> obviously<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:56.130> need<00:01:56.219> it
