00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I think that's where really the focus is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.429 
I think that's where really the focus is
everything<00:01:14.100> else<00:01:14.540> yeah<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.110> in

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
think you'd enjoy a lot as a driver when

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.710 
think you'd enjoy a lot as a driver when
you<00:01:47.490> feel<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.149> control<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you feel that you are in control of the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.789 
you feel that you are in control of the
car<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.070> important<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.579> set<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> car

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
car so it's important to set up the car

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.840 
car so it's important to set up the car
accordingly<00:01:53.420> yeah<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
accordingly yeah so I think we all as I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.880 
accordingly yeah so I think we all as I
said<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.270> look<00:01:57.450> forward<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.409> race<00:01:58.649> on

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
said we all look forward to just race on

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.399 
said we all look forward to just race on
that<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.369> track<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:01.259> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
that on that track because it is it is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.020 
that on that track because it is it is
something<00:02:01.619> special<00:02:01.850> also<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.000> very

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
something special also it's very

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.510 
something special also it's very
physical<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:04.229> obviously<00:02:04.409> through<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
physical because obviously through the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.819 
physical because obviously through the
high<00:02:05.670> speed<00:02:05.939> corners<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:07.409> loads<00:02:07.619> are

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
high speed corners the loads are

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.639 
high speed corners the loads are
extremely<00:02:08.280> high<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.090> very<00:02:09.209> tough<00:02:09.989> inside

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
extremely high so it's very tough inside

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
extremely high so it's very tough inside
the<00:02:10.979> car<00:02:11.190> but

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
