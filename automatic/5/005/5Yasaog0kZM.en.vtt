00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.450 
at it here but this right side top side
here<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.290> say<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.740> light<00:01:10.979> duty

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
here so I would say it's a light duty

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.630 
here so I would say it's a light duty
knife<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:14.570> smaller<00:01:15.710> liner<00:01:16.710> lock<00:01:16.979> not

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.550 
knife it has a smaller liner lock not
had<00:01:17.909> any<00:01:18.119> problems<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:20.420> but

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
had any problems with it at all but

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.649 
had any problems with it at all but
again<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.830> always<00:01:23.040> consider<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.640> light<00:01:24.119> duty

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659

that's<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.350> flipper<00:02:08.800> opening<00:02:09.400> here<00:02:10.150> the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
that's the flipper opening here the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.380 
that's the flipper opening here the
thunders<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.310> may<00:02:12.490> recall<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.360> previous

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
thunders you may recall in a previous

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.550 
thunders you may recall in a previous
video<00:02:14.940> they're<00:02:15.940> close<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.720> being<00:02:16.930> useless<00:02:17.380> to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
video they're close to being useless to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440 
video they're close to being useless to
me<00:02:17.590> they're<00:02:18.130> real<00:02:18.610> hard<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.940> use<00:02:19.090> they're<00:02:19.330> too

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
me they're real hard to use they're too

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.830 
me they're real hard to use they're too
small<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.800> push<00:02:21.640> back<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.210> knife<00:02:22.390> here

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
small to push back in the knife here

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.780 
small to push back in the knife here
so<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.590> flipper<00:02:23.950> opening<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
so it's this flipper opening and the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.000 
so it's this flipper opening and the
flipper<00:02:28.270> works<00:02:28.480> pretty<00:02:28.930> well<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.620> got<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.860> use

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
flipper works pretty well you got to use

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.980 
flipper works pretty well you got to use
a<00:02:30.340> time<00:02:31.030> some<00:02:31.630> wrist<00:02:31.900> movement<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.390> yeah<00:02:34.810> like

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
a time some wrist movement so yeah like

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.670 
a time some wrist movement so yeah like
that<00:02:37.530> again

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
that again

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.380

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
that's the stuff this is the blur so

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.240 
that's the stuff this is the blur so
close<00:03:32.280> close<00:03:33.280> do<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.970> same<00:03:34.890> overall<00:03:35.890> length

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
close close do the same overall length

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.229 
close close do the same overall length
maybe<00:03:36.989> 1/4<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.170> 1/2<00:03:38.380> inch<00:03:38.830> longer<00:03:39.700> for<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
maybe 1/4 to 1/2 inch longer for the

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.210 
maybe 1/4 to 1/2 inch longer for the
blur<00:03:43.080> but<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.230> weight<00:03:44.440> differences<00:03:45.010> is

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
blur but the weight differences is

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.880 
blur but the weight differences is
pretty<00:03:45.850> big<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.840> know<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:50.080> like<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.380> Kershaw
