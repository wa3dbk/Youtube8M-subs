like<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> fact<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.180> instead<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.840> being

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
like the fact that instead of just being

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
like the fact that instead of just being
a<00:01:49.259> regular<00:01:49.380> halter<00:01:49.920> she<00:01:50.460> has<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> criss<00:01:50.880> cross

a regular halter she has it criss cross

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
a regular halter she has it criss cross
I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.329> that's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> nice<00:01:51.810> touch<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:53.369> her

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I think that's a nice touch and for her

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
I think that's a nice touch and for her
bathing<00:01:53.729> suit<00:01:53.909> cover-up<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.600> course<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.990> have

to<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.409> some<00:01:55.649> kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.920> mummy<00:01:56.189> wrap<00:01:56.430> thing

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to have some kind of mummy wrap thing

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.249 
to have some kind of mummy wrap thing
here<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.630> kind<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.110> these

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
here so it is just kind of like these

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.990 
here so it is just kind of like these
blue<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.530> pink<00:01:59.100> mummy<00:01:59.369> wraps<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.820> think
