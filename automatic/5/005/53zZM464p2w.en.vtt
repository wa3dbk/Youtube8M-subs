00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.050 

ok<00:00:01.680> here's<00:00:02.100> another<00:00:02.190> demo<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.770> kannim

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
ok here's another demo of the kannim

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.940 
ok here's another demo of the kannim
wheeled<00:00:06.060> robots<00:00:09.710> ok<00:00:10.710> still<00:00:11.190> go<00:00:11.309> forward<00:00:11.610> back

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
wheeled robots ok still go forward back

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.740 
wheeled robots ok still go forward back
side<00:00:13.950> side<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:16.550> well<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> added<00:00:17.970> encoders<00:00:18.539> that

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
side side and well I added encoders that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.880 
side side and well I added encoders that
wasn't<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.080> main<00:00:19.230> problem<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
wasn't the main problem with the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800 
wasn't the main problem with the
rotation<00:00:20.400> there<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.119> problem<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.539> had<00:00:21.689> with

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
rotation there the problem I had with

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.810 
rotation there the problem I had with
the<00:00:21.960> rotation<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.699> had<00:00:24.150> two<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.230> wheels

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
the rotation was I had two of the wheels

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
the rotation was I had two of the wheels
rotating<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> wrong<00:00:27.119> direction<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> they

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
rotating the wrong direction so they

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.009 
rotating the wrong direction so they
were<00:00:29.670> fighting<00:00:30.119> each<00:00:30.269> other<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.750> they<00:00:30.840> went

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
were fighting each other and they went

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.360 
were fighting each other and they went
rotate<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.650> now<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.040> rotates<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.640> fine<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
rotate so now it rotates just fine but I

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.729 
rotate so now it rotates just fine but I
also<00:00:35.550> added<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> encoders<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:37.410> really

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
also added the encoders which really

00:00:37.739 --> 00:01:02.730 
also added the encoders which really
helps<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:39.000> maintain<00:00:39.270> its<00:00:39.570> speed

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.200 

so<00:01:03.740> I'd<00:01:04.070> say<00:01:04.220> that's<00:01:04.339> looking<00:01:04.730> pretty<00:01:04.760> good<00:01:05.150> so

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
so I'd say that's looking pretty good so

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.990 
so I'd say that's looking pretty good so
far<00:01:07.090> side<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.210> side<00:01:09.370> that<00:01:10.370> moves<00:01:10.610> with<00:01:10.700> more

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
far side to side that moves with more

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.780 
far side to side that moves with more
authority<00:01:11.090> now<00:01:11.540> oh<00:01:15.190> it's<00:01:16.190> right<00:01:16.340> all<00:01:16.520> wrongs

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
authority now oh it's right all wrongs

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:27.600 
authority now oh it's right all wrongs
with<00:01:17.000> linoleum

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.770 

there's<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.700> rotation<00:01:31.270> seems<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:32.539> working

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
there's a rotation seems to be working

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.630 
there's a rotation seems to be working
ok<00:01:35.590> find<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.649> cool<00:01:36.829> to<00:01:36.920> watch<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.280> sideways

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
ok find a cool to watch the sideways

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.190 
ok find a cool to watch the sideways
like<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:38.829> I'll<00:01:39.829> go<00:01:39.950> any<00:01:40.100> direction

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.780 

and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.409> let's<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.580> one

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and then let's see if I can with one

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.440 
and then let's see if I can with one
hand<00:01:48.030> forward<00:01:49.040> rotate<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.240> drive

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
hand forward rotate and then drive

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.469 
hand forward rotate and then drive
sideways<00:01:53.420> locate<00:01:54.420> some<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:56.270> let's<00:01:57.270> come

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
sideways locate some more let's come

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.200 
sideways locate some more let's come
back<00:01:57.509> here

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.080 

okay<00:02:07.770> there<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.099> looking<00:02:10.060> pretty

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
okay there you have it looking pretty

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.680 
okay there you have it looking pretty
good<00:02:10.479> so<00:02:10.539> far<00:02:10.890> rides<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.950> lot<00:02:12.099> better<00:02:12.250> now<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
good so far rides a lot better now and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.089 
good so far rides a lot better now and
of<00:02:13.780> course<00:02:14.170> really<00:02:14.319> helps<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.739> have<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
of course really helps to have the

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.410 
of course really helps to have the
wheels<00:02:15.250> go<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.580> right<00:02:15.670> direction<00:02:15.849> for

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
wheels go in the right direction for

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.490 
wheels go in the right direction for
rotation<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:18.670> also<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.959> just<00:02:20.020> strides<00:02:20.380> with

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
rotation but also it just strides with

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.520 
rotation but also it just strides with
more<00:02:20.709> authority<00:02:20.800> having<00:02:21.220> those<00:02:21.430> encoders<00:02:21.910> I

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
more authority having those encoders I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.070 
more authority having those encoders I
actually<00:02:24.810> implemented<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.959> PID<00:02:26.470> algorithm<00:02:28.080> but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
actually implemented a PID algorithm but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.990 
actually implemented a PID algorithm but
I<00:02:29.350> ended<00:02:29.680> up<00:02:29.800> only<00:02:30.010> needing<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> proportional

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
I ended up only needing the proportional

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
I ended up only needing the proportional
part<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.780> didn't<00:02:32.110> need<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.350> integral<00:02:32.739> or

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
part of it I didn't need the integral or

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.979 
part of it I didn't need the integral or
derivative<00:02:33.400> portion<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.300> algorithm<00:02:34.840> at

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
derivative portion of the algorithm at

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.130 
derivative portion of the algorithm at
least<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.470> far<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.709> haven't<00:02:36.069> used<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:37.660> tried

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
least so far I haven't used it I tried

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.870 
least so far I haven't used it I tried
it<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.590> made<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:38.860> oscillate<00:02:39.250> crazy<00:02:39.580> and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
it but it made it oscillate crazy and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.100 
it but it made it oscillate crazy and
that<00:02:40.060> didn't<00:02:40.300> work<00:02:40.330> didn't<00:02:40.840> improve

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
that didn't work didn't improve

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.400 
that didn't work didn't improve
anything's<00:02:41.640> anything<00:02:42.810> okay<00:02:43.810> well<00:02:44.110> that's<00:02:44.260> it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
anything's anything okay well that's it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.380 
anything's anything okay well that's it
for<00:02:44.560> now<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.459> guess<00:02:45.700> now<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.239> make

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
for now and I guess now I have to make

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.180 
for now and I guess now I have to make
it<00:02:46.510> smart<00:02:46.840> because<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.560> really<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.830> robot

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it smart because it's not really a robot

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.240 
it smart because it's not really a robot
now<00:02:48.400> it's<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.290> radio<00:02:50.290> controlled<00:02:50.440> vehicle

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
now it's just a radio controlled vehicle

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.229 
now it's just a radio controlled vehicle
robot<00:02:52.090> has<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.569> in<00:02:53.290> my<00:02:53.560> opinion<00:02:53.940> find<00:02:54.940> its<00:02:55.090> own

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
robot has to in my opinion find its own

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.900 
robot has to in my opinion find its own
way<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.720> avoid<00:02:56.200> obstacles<00:02:56.440> by<00:02:56.799> itself<00:02:57.069> so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
way and avoid obstacles by itself so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.660 
way and avoid obstacles by itself so
that<00:02:58.180> will<00:02:58.720> be<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.260> future<00:02:59.380> here<00:02:59.860> maybe

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
that will be in the future here maybe

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420 
that will be in the future here maybe
some<00:03:00.880> sort<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.180> machine<00:03:02.049> vision<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:03.100> the
