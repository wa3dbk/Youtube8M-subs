race against each other in ghosts
yeah<00:00:10.860> took<00:00:11.099> me<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> bit<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> working<00:00:11.759> out<00:00:12.000> but

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
yeah took me a bit of working out but

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.509 
yeah took me a bit of working out but
it's<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.599> too<00:00:12.780> bad<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.160> from

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
it's not too bad and this is from

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.060 
it's not too bad and this is from
scratch<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.660> show<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.139> actually<00:00:16.350> stores

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
scratch to show that it actually stores

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.769 
scratch to show that it actually stores
it<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.900> internal<00:00:20.300> online<00:00:21.300> community

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it on the internal online community

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.679 
it on the internal online community
because<00:00:22.560> that's<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.830> only<00:00:22.980> problem<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.689> as

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
because that's the only problem is as

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.540 
because that's the only problem is as
long<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.960> you're<00:00:25.050> online<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.920> will<00:00:26.099> store<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
long as you're online it will store it

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.279 
long as you're online it will store it
obviously<00:00:26.789> makes<00:00:26.970> sense<00:00:27.330> okay<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:27.900> gonna<00:00:28.080> boot

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
obviously makes sense okay so gonna boot

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:43.000 
obviously makes sense okay so gonna boot

okie dokie skip all this right so
there's<00:01:05.970> our<00:01:06.060> main<00:01:06.330> menu<00:01:07.880> if<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.970> could<00:01:09.119> just

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
there's our main menu if I could just

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.920 
there's our main menu if I could just
zoom<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:09.900> bit<00:01:11.570> I'm<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
zoom in a little bit I'm in just a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.630 
zoom in a little bit I'm in just a
fraction<00:01:14.330> essentially<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.310> dry

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
fraction essentially you go for dry

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.870 
fraction essentially you go for dry
which<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.240> top<00:01:18.450> left<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.729> three

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
which is top left you then have three

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.200 
which is top left you then have three
options<00:01:21.119> you've<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.720> tall<00:01:22.729> single<00:01:23.729> event<00:01:23.970> or

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
options you've got tall single event or

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.780 
options you've got tall single event or
multiplayer<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> you'd<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.610> it'd<00:01:26.759> be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
multiplayer now you'd think it'd be

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.190 
multiplayer now you'd think it'd be
multiplayer<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> isn't<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.900> actually

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
multiplayer it isn't it's actually

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.120 
multiplayer it isn't it's actually
single<00:01:28.590> event<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> then

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
single event you go for that and then

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
single event you go for that and then
you<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.280> two<00:01:32.400> options<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.210> race<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.869> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you have two options you have race so I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
you have two options you have race so I
actually<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.200> three<00:01:34.350> options<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.860> so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
actually have three options actually so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually have three options actually so
you've<00:01:35.729> got<00:01:35.820> race<00:01:36.060> time<00:01:36.689> trial<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.380> drift<00:01:38.180> go

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you've got race time trial or drift go

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.520 
you've got race time trial or drift go
for<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.630> trial<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.259> middle<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.710> here

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
for time trial at this middle one here

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530 
for time trial at this middle one here
and<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.000> where<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> gets<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.329> bit

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and this is where it gets a little bit

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
and this is where it gets a little bit
more<00:01:45.600> interesting<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.460> obviously<00:01:47.460> I've

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
more interesting because obviously I've

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.380 
more interesting because obviously I've
got<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.390> set<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.850> challenge<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
got to have set a challenge on one of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
got to have set a challenge on one of
these<00:01:51.509> races<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.290> we'll<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.890> each

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
these races but we'll just go for each

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
these races but we'll just go for each
one<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.399> turn<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.880> apply<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.450> I've<00:01:54.930> done

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
one in turn as we apply it but I've done

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.330 
one in turn as we apply it but I've done
the<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:55.350> first<00:01:55.649> one<00:01:55.890> Canada<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:58.340> there's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the very first one Canada and there's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580 
the very first one Canada and there's
all<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> various<00:01:59.880> tracks<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.899> again<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> went

part the same Club then it's really

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.100 
part the same Club then it's really
simple<00:02:58.760> would<00:02:59.030> find<00:02:59.240> each<00:02:59.360> other<00:02:59.570> straight

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
simple would find each other straight

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.410 
simple would find each other straight
away<00:03:01.510> okay<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:05.110> all<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:07.430> come<00:03:08.300> out

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
away okay so all you do is you come out

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.330 
away okay so all you do is you come out
of<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:11.150> could<00:03:11.620> play<00:03:12.620> at<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:12.950> know

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
of that and you could play at you know

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.310 
of that and you could play at you know
it<00:03:13.400> was<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:13.790> buddy<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.090> select<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:15.160> again<00:03:17.320> as

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
it was so buddy to select that again as

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.080 
it was so buddy to select that again as
you<00:03:18.470> tells<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.830> what<00:03:19.010> car<00:03:19.340> I'm<00:03:19.520> using<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:19.940> is

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
you tells you what car I'm using this is

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.060 
you tells you what car I'm using this is
quite<00:03:20.269> important<00:03:20.750> because<00:03:20.870> if<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.350> select<00:03:21.890> a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
quite important because if you select a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.310 
quite important because if you select a
different<00:03:22.550> car<00:03:22.910> than<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.420> one<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.570> scored<00:03:24.230> two

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
different car than the one I scored two

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.430 
different car than the one I scored two
time<00:03:24.560> trial<00:03:24.830> on<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.940> will<00:03:26.239> not<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.810> ghost<00:03:27.230> will

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
time trial on it will not the ghost will

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.949 
time trial on it will not the ghost will
not<00:03:27.590> appear<00:03:27.950> on<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:29.030> obvi<00:03:29.269> on<00:03:29.420> racing<00:03:29.750> same

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
not appear on this obvi on racing same

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.690 
not appear on this obvi on racing same
car<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.530> that's<00:03:30.709> something<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.160> figured<00:03:31.519> out<00:03:31.550> as

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
car so that's something I figured out as

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.820 
car so that's something I figured out as
well<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.239> pretty<00:03:32.450> much<00:03:32.600> makes<00:03:32.840> sense<00:03:33.110> so

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
well just pretty much makes sense so

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:42.540 
well just pretty much makes sense so
it's<00:03:33.950> an<00:03:34.010> Audi<00:03:34.280> r8<00:03:34.600> v10<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:39.850> let's<00:03:40.850> go<00:03:40.970> play

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
it's an Audi r8 v10 so let's go play

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.240 
it's an Audi r8 v10 so let's go play
pick<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.730> Audi

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.860 

let's<00:03:48.250> find<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.909> down<00:03:49.120> here

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
let's find it down here

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.280 
let's find it down here
I<00:03:51.599> definitely<00:03:52.599> unlocked<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.409> though<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.040> a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
I definitely unlocked it though it is a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:06.899 
I definitely unlocked it though it is a
D<00:03:56.290> r8<00:03:57.129> v10<00:03:59.970> where<00:04:00.970> we<00:04:01.090> go<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.590> I'll<00:04:06.579> just<00:04:06.610> go

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
D r8 v10 where we go and I'll just go

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:17.340 
D r8 v10 where we go and I'll just go
factory<00:04:15.539> and<00:04:16.539> again<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.019> brings<00:04:17.079> up<00:04:17.289> another

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
factory and again it brings up another

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.439 
factory and again it brings up another
leaderboard<00:04:17.949> you<00:04:18.160> guys<00:04:18.789> are<00:04:18.940> gonna<00:04:19.030> get<00:04:19.180> two
