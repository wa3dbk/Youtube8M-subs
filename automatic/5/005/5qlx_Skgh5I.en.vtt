00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
change these together and just make

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.510 
change these together and just make
multiple<00:06:17.630> movements<00:06:17.930> in<00:06:18.260> between<00:06:18.650> that<00:06:19.130> fives

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
multiple movements in between that fives

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:28.990 
multiple movements in between that fives
and<00:06:19.790> ones<00:06:19.820> are<00:06:20.180> you<00:06:20.240> go<00:06:20.390> from<00:06:24.550> three
