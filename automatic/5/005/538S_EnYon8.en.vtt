00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
where he's in the greatest danger or to

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.699 
where he's in the greatest danger or to
stay<00:03:13.849> where<00:03:14.180> he's<00:03:14.359> relatively<00:03:14.840> safe

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
stay where he's relatively safe

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.819 
stay where he's relatively safe
you<00:03:16.639> think<00:03:17.000> Graff<00:03:17.299> is<00:03:17.629> trying<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.230> get<00:03:18.379> us<00:03:18.590> to

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
you think Graff is trying to get us to

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.670 
you think Graff is trying to get us to
tell<00:03:19.069> him<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:20.150> keep<00:03:20.329> ender<00:03:20.780> with<00:03:21.019> him<00:03:21.379> out

tell him to keep ender with him out

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.689 
tell him to keep ender with him out
there<00:03:22.099> in<00:03:22.280> space

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
there in space

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.140 
there in space
I<00:03:23.709> think<00:03:24.709> Graff<00:03:24.949> cares<00:03:25.370> what<00:03:25.699> happens<00:03:26.060> to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
I think Graff cares what happens to

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.170 
I think Graff cares what happens to
ender<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:26.720> he's<00:03:27.470> letting<00:03:27.680> us<00:03:27.889> know<00:03:28.180> without

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
ender and he's letting us know without

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.420 
ender and he's letting us know without
actually<00:03:29.750> saying<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.349> because<00:03:30.799> every<00:03:31.250> letter

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
actually saying it because every letter

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.400 
actually saying it because every letter
he<00:03:31.669> sends<00:03:32.180> can<00:03:32.389> be<00:03:32.540> used<00:03:32.750> against<00:03:33.169> him<00:03:33.260> in

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
he sends can be used against him in

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.020 
he sends can be used against him in
court<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:34.310> ender<00:03:34.819> is<00:03:35.209> in<00:03:35.810> terrible<00:03:36.260> danger
