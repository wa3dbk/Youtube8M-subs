00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.160
 that box this is a current cauliflower with limited nutritional potential nobody 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.110
 about 900 grams of weight and this is a human brain doubt and snow lost 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.750
 weight around 500 thousand grams samoa may seem similar in excess 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.710
 the interior of this tiny and fragile mass jam is the most 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 complex known in the universe 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.460
 the country as many cells in the brain as stars in our galaxy 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.249
 around 10 trillion 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.150
 despite the more than two hundred kinds of cells that make up the brain 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.930
 known as piglia neurons 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.100
 They are designed to perform three functions 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.600
 receive information from other cells 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 profess the cpi transmit it to the rest of the body 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.290
 the behavior begins with the actions of the neuron 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.330
 first one of its ends I received the information from the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.170
 receivers 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.370
 distributed around the branched extensions 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.420
 oden shreds 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.600
 pl magnifying glass then the information is sent to the nucleus of the neuron 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 rest maps where it is combined with other information 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.000
 subsequently all the information received is transmitted throughout the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.340
 action in the form of an electric shock today nervous impulse 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.159
 the momentum ends here 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.590
 in the terminal buttons 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.910
 that is, these buttons contain chemicals that 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.210
 subsequently they are segregated in order to send a chemical message to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.210
 neurons to what agents 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.790
 although apparently it may seem that they are in contact 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.560
 Neurons do not touch each other 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.409
 they have to send their messages through spaces that contain a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.479
 liquid substance 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.010
 and that is called synapse 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.920
 these chemical messages are called in turn nor euro transmitters 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.510
 When a black transmitter is released at the synapse, bills that are acquired 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.340
 the specific receivers 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.330
 in the dentists' membrane in the adjacent neurons 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
 in a process similar to that of a key in a lock 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.079
 some of these ideas and their are ex-citations 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.329
 the neurotransmitters cause in the neuron that is in the other 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.570
 end of the synapse 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.570
 an electric charge 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.649
 another inhibitory itson synapse 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.649
 and reduce or prevent the formation of nerve impulses 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.209
 since he fled from the receiver channels located in the dendrites 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.419
 determine what the neurotransmitter effect will be 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.349
 in the same way that the set of all excitatory stimuli follow up 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.780
 they 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.079
 determine if the next neuron in the cabin 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.079
 drink to shoot and at what speed 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.109
 this constant flow of nerve impulses and chemical transmissions 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.759
 through our organism confers to human behavior its 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.759
 extraordinary complexity 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.579
 regulates our metabolism 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.049
 body temperature 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.049
 and breathing 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:22.969
 it allows us to learn 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.969
 remember it and make decisions 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:33.129
 shorter what is really hard to understand you know what somehow 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.489
 inside these nerve cells and the synapse is found 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.509
 the basis for communicating everything we can get to know and experience 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.159
 the functioning of this system is a puzzle for all scientists who 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.949
 they study the brain and human behavior the year but to form a new 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.709
 generation of researchers who are commonly referred to in euros 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.119
 scientists who come from more than 20 different disciplines including the 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.469
 psychology 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.219
 Neuroscientists based their work on the conviction that all 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.079
 Brain functions can be explained as biological and chemical functions 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.459
 that take place in him 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.459
 either in the whole brain or only in one area 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.709
 murphy 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.900
 for these researchers the understanding of human behavior 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.900
 it implies knowing their biological bases 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.880
 the brain is an essential part of the nervous system and works from a 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.289
 holistic way 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.240
 with all its constituent elements in interaction 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.250
 although some parts are specialized in the realization of 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.419
 some specific tasks that run in the most efficient way 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:42.829
 let's follow this brief tour through our system to understand with 

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:43.909
 greater depth 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.960
 how our brain works 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.539
 our first stop will be the brainstem 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.710
 that connects the brain with the nerves and the spinal cord 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.410
 is the center for the basic support of life base breathing the heart beat 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.059
 heart or the dream or the awakening 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:03.069
 connected to the brain stem and located in the back of the skull is 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.349
 find the cerebellum 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.020
 you have to coordinate the movements of our body controls the posture and 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.599
 keeps the balance 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.460
 then and in the depths of the brain is the system 

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:17.770
 limbic that contains several structures common to other mammals since 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.259
 everyone 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.809
 They have a similar brain structure 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.259
 from this system the maintenance of internal functions is regulated 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.139
 of the organism 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.770
 the temperature the blood pressure and the sugar levels among others 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.979
 Many also regulate emotions and powerful impulses such as desire 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.330
 sexual and the survival instinct 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.810
 the four most important parts of our limbic system are will regret 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.909
 the hippocampus 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.960
 the thalamus 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.240
 and tobacco 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.139
 the amygdala are the path that leads to the limbic system for 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.379
 sensory impulses 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.300
 the hippocampus is a basic information processor 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.180
 and its function is to contrast the new information with data that is already 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.369
 they find stored in the brain 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:08.369
 also stores certain types of memory 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.599
 the thalamus peak acts as a link between the body and him 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:13.749
 the rest of the brain 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.669
 segregating at least seven types of hormones 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.340
 that are driven back the pituitary 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.340
 which in turn releases hormones into the bloodstream 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.729
 influencing the development of growth and sexual behavior 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:32.469
 the thalamus functions as a kind of withdrawal signaling from the rest 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:33.110
 of the body 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.659
 towards the appropriate brain regions 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.939
 surrounding the most primitive structures from an evolutionary point of view that 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.749
 make up the limbic system is the brain 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:46.199
 that being a human is the biggest part of what usually 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.139
 we call brain 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:48.939
 it's here 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.780
 where nerve impulses are transformed into images 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.610
 villegas words symbols 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.849
 the brain is divided into two halves 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.159
 the cerebral hemispheres that are connected by millions of fibers 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.009
 nervous that make up the corpus callosum 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.019
 and a conduit for messages that move from one hemisphere to another 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:16.159
 the outer layer of the brain is the cerebral cortex 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.960
 the most characteristic image of the brain 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.249
 the center of conscious thought the perception 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:25.120
 where all the sensations and responses are integrated 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.950
 and that occupies the highest place in the hierarchy of brain activities
