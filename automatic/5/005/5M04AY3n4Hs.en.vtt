over<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> Year<00:01:58.560> headphones<00:01:58.950> I've<00:01:59.159> tested<00:01:59.549> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
over the Year headphones I've tested in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
over the Year headphones I've tested in
the<00:01:59.700> past<00:02:00.079> with<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.200> being<00:02:01.380> said<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.799> do

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the past with that being said they do

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.679 
the past with that being said they do
block<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.490> quite<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> bit<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.969> sound<00:02:03.210> even

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
block out quite a bit of sound even

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.300 
block out quite a bit of sound even
though<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.990> aren't<00:02:04.170> noise<00:02:04.590> cancelling

headphones<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.210> wire<00:02:06.390> actually<00:02:06.630> goes<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.079> of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
headphones the wire actually goes out of

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.109 
headphones the wire actually goes out of
only<00:02:07.409> one<00:02:07.619> side<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.369> headphones<00:02:08.640> which<00:02:09.030> is

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
only one side of the headphones which is

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.119 
only one side of the headphones which is
a<00:02:09.149> plus<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.989> resists<00:02:10.410> any<00:02:10.530> tangling

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
a plus because it resists any tangling

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.979 
a plus because it resists any tangling
and<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.670> braided<00:02:11.879> design<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.450> indeed<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and the braided design is indeed a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.030 
and the braided design is indeed a
highlight<00:02:13.410> here

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
highlight here

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.830 
highlight here
taking<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> look<00:02:14.849> at<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> microphone<00:02:15.599> here

taking a look at the microphone here
instead<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.470> traditional<00:02:16.680> volume<00:02:17.640> rocker

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.759 
instead of a traditional volume rocker
there's<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.390> volume<00:02:18.720> slider<00:02:18.870> which<00:02:19.439> is<00:02:19.560> kind<00:02:19.739> of

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
there's a volume slider which is kind of

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.860 
there's a volume slider which is kind of
interesting<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.400> i<00:02:20.489> zoom<00:02:20.519> hollow<00:02:21.329> in<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
interesting if i zoom hollow in here you

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.780 
interesting if i zoom hollow in here you
can<00:02:21.989> see<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.530> change<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:22.890> volume<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.280> slide<00:02:23.610> this

far<00:02:24.090> up<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.510> down<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.049> practice<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.799> works

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
far up and down and practice it works

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.470 
far up and down and practice it works
pretty<00:02:26.189> well<00:02:26.459> even<00:02:26.760> though<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.180> may<00:02:27.269> be<00:02:27.299> if

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
not the most intuitive control set it

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.750 
not the most intuitive control set it
takes<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.620> bit<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:31.890> acclamation<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.579> get

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
a classical piece of music you'll

a classical piece of music you'll
definitely<00:03:31.530> hear<00:03:31.769> some<00:03:32.129> thumps<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.699> the

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
background as far as clarity is

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.349 
background as far as clarity is
concerned<00:03:35.220> they<00:03:35.370> could<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> bit<00:03:36.120> better

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
concerned they could be a bit better

however<00:03:36.780> these<00:03:37.139> headphones<00:03:37.709> are<00:03:38.040> very

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
however these headphones are very

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.800 
however these headphones are very
three-dimensional<00:03:38.669> sounding<00:03:39.419> so<00:03:39.629> they<00:03:39.750> are

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
three-dimensional sounding so they are

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.420 
three-dimensional sounding so they are
great<00:03:39.989> for<00:03:40.169> watching<00:03:40.560> movies<00:03:40.949> such<00:03:41.400> as

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
thrillers or suspense films that really

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.559 
thrillers or suspense films that really
brings<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:44.040> movie<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.459> life<00:03:44.669> but<00:03:45.449> there
