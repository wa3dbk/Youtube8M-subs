00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
hi and welcome to this tutorial on how

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.570 
hi and welcome to this tutorial on how
to<00:00:03.570> create<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.080> particle<00:00:04.380> tornado<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.190> Maya<00:00:07.580> to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
to create a particle tornado in Maya to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.310 
to create a particle tornado in Maya to
get<00:00:08.730> started<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.510> actually<00:00:09.929> use<00:00:10.110> any

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
get started you can actually use any

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.799 
get started you can actually use any
version<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.980> Maya<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.639> want<00:00:11.820> I've

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
version of Maya that you want I've

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.230 
version of Maya that you want I've
tested<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.250> Maya<00:00:14.460> 5<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.150> it

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
tested this is this in Maya 5 and it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.090 
tested this is this in Maya 5 and it
works<00:00:15.420> perfectly<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> version<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
works perfectly but the version that I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.470 
works perfectly but the version that I
use<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.580> Maya<00:00:18.060> 2010<00:00:19.730> alright<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.180> let's<00:00:21.359> get

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
use is Maya 2010 alright so let's get

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.870 
use is Maya 2010 alright so let's get
started

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
started

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.950 
started
first<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.420> need<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.869> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
first of all what you need to do is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.390 
first of all what you need to do is
you're<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.500> go<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.859> create<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you're going to have to go and create a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.910 
you're going to have to go and create a
particle<00:00:27.150> emitter<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.740> whether

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
particle emitter you can do this whether

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.580 
particle emitter you can do this whether
going<00:00:29.220> into<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> dynamics<00:00:30.599> tab<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> go<00:00:31.560> to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.350 

once<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.720> did<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.930> your<00:02:44.030> particles<00:02:45.030> will

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
once you did that your particles will

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.440 
once you did that your particles will
look<00:02:45.620> like<00:02:46.940> stripes<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.010> change<00:02:50.160> it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
look like stripes so you can change it

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.610 
look like stripes so you can change it
actually<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.630> change<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.990> from<00:02:52.110> anything

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
actually you can change it from anything

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.740 
actually you can change it from anything

just make it a Maltese trick just to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.590 
just make it a Maltese trick just to
flip<00:03:04.650> let<00:03:05.370> us<00:03:05.490> be<00:03:05.610> able<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.910> see<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.360> little

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
flip let us be able to see it a little

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.350 
flip let us be able to see it a little
bit<00:03:06.750> better<00:03:12.110> but<00:03:13.110> yeah<00:03:13.290> um<00:03:14.210> basically<00:03:15.210> what

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
bit better but yeah um basically what

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.060 
bit better but yeah um basically what
happens<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.990> was<00:03:16.290> trying<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.890> figure

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
happens is that I was trying to figure

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.580 
happens is that I was trying to figure
out<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> way<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.580> create<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.000> tornado<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.630> just

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
out a way to create a tornado and just

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.840 
out a way to create a tornado and just
started<00:03:19.920> playing<00:03:20.040> around<00:03:20.340> with<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
started playing around with the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.990 
started playing around with the
particles<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.840> fields<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.220> other<00:03:23.580> effects

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
particles and fields and other effects

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.440 
particles and fields and other effects
and<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.210> actually<00:03:25.050> came<00:03:25.380> up<00:03:25.440> with<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:26.450> okay

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
and I actually came up with this okay

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.500 
and I actually came up with this okay
once<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.930> done<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.940> remind<00:03:29.940> your<00:03:30.090> animation

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
once you done that remind your animation

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.550 
once you done that remind your animation
select<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.230> emitters<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:33.440> move<00:03:34.440> it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
select all of the emitters and move it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.500 
select all of the emitters and move it
slightly<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> x-axis<00:03:38.090> what<00:03:39.090> will<00:03:39.210> happen

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
slightly in the x-axis what will happen

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.680 
slightly in the x-axis what will happen
now<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.350> if<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.650> play<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:42.240> particles

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
now is that if you play it the particles

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.920 
now is that if you play it the particles
will<00:03:42.870> bend<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.560> little<00:03:44.520> bit<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:45.240> gives<00:03:45.780> us<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
will bend a little bit that gives us a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.250 
will bend a little bit that gives us a
little<00:03:46.140> bit<00:03:46.260> better<00:03:46.650> effect<00:03:48.080> okay

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
little bit better effect okay

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.710 
little bit better effect okay
that's<00:03:49.500> about<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.920> um<00:03:50.480> thank<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.570> for
