just<00:05:58.320> well<00:05:58.770> that<00:05:59.010> could<00:05:59.250> work<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.880> maybe<00:06:00.420> it'd

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
just well that could work and maybe it'd

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.350 
just well that could work and maybe it'd
be<00:06:00.630> easier<00:06:00.770> so<00:06:01.770> what<00:06:02.580> I'll<00:06:02.670> do<00:06:02.880> is<00:06:02.910> I'll<00:06:03.090> try

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
be easier so what I'll do is I'll try

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.970 
be easier so what I'll do is I'll try
these<00:06:03.420> first<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.380> then<00:06:04.950> I'll<00:06:05.370> try<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:05.910> hinges

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
these first and then I'll try the hinges

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.970 
these first and then I'll try the hinges
