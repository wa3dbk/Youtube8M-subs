is how the white back looks like so you

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.990 
is how the white back looks like so you
can<00:00:21.720> see<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> has<00:00:22.230> kind<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> same

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
can see that it has kind of the same

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.730 
can see that it has kind of the same
form<00:00:24.000> factor<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.050> get<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.350> five

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
form factor and you get this five

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.529 
form factor and you get this five
thousand<00:00:26.160> two<00:00:26.369> hundred<00:00:26.400> million<00:00:26.970> battery

same material as this one maybe a little

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.789 
same material as this one maybe a little
bit<00:01:55.819> more<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.060> different<00:01:56.450> texture<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.560> tiny

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
bit more a different texture it's a tiny

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
tiny bit different texture but other

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.109 
tiny bit different texture but other
than<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:01.970> if<00:02:02.770> ELC<00:02:03.770> says<00:02:03.979> smooth<00:02:04.280> as<00:02:04.579> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
than that if ELC says smooth as the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.050 
than that if ELC says smooth as the
original<00:02:05.570> one<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.039> sure<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.490> little<00:02:07.939> bit

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
original one and sure it is a little bit

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.680 
original one and sure it is a little bit
bigger<00:02:08.320> sure<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.579> my<00:02:11.209> brother<00:02:11.480> actually

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
bigger sure and but my brother actually

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.420 
bigger sure and but my brother actually
did<00:02:11.989> try<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.290> out<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.769> hold<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.310> his<00:02:13.370> hand

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
did try it out it hold it in his hand

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.720 
did try it out it hold it in his hand
and<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.570> mean<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.280> when<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.370> buy<00:02:16.519> big

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and I mean this is when you buy big

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.849 
and I mean this is when you buy big
about<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:17.209> this<00:02:17.329> of<00:02:17.510> course<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.900> you

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
about it like this of course you you

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.400 
about it like this of course you you
will<00:02:19.459> know<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.359> will<00:02:20.600> be<00:02:20.840> bigger<00:02:21.109> on<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
will know that it will be bigger on the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.190 
will know that it will be bigger on the
back<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:22.060> he<00:02:23.060> did<00:02:23.269> say<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.780> was<00:02:23.840> smooth

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
back and he did say that it was smooth

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.900 
back and he did say that it was smooth
so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.549> of<00:02:25.850> course<00:02:26.450> pretty<00:02:26.720> cool<00:02:27.910> so

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so that is of course pretty cool so

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:37.640 
so that is of course pretty cool so
those<00:02:29.090> try<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.870> put<00:02:30.079> this<00:02:30.200> one<00:02:30.410> on

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.970 

so<00:02:38.650> if<00:02:39.189> you<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.700> lost<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.870> two<00:02:41.170> days<00:02:41.379> with<00:02:41.950> a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
so if you can lost to two days with a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.000 
so if you can lost to two days with a
normal<00:02:42.400> s4<00:02:43.299> battery<00:02:43.689> then<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:44.349> will<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.680> four

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
normal s4 battery then this will be four

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.059 
normal s4 battery then this will be four
days<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:46.560> madness<00:02:47.560> oh<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:52.000> have<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> code<00:02:52.889> you<00:02:53.889> can

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069
