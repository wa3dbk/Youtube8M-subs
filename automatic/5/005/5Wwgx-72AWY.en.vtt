well not only Indo Chinese noodles in
itself<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.550> found<00:00:17.760> anywhere<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.359> this

itself can be found anywhere in this

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.120 
itself can be found anywhere in this
world<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.230> everybody<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> own

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
world but everybody is own

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.490 
world but everybody is own
interpretation<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> basics<00:00:21.930> always

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
interpretation but the basics always

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.310

remains<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.130> same<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:25.140> going

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
remains the same all right so I'm going

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.380 
remains the same all right so I'm going
to<00:00:25.380> start<00:00:25.650> by<00:00:25.859> slicing<00:00:26.340> my<00:00:26.699> chicken<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.210> I'm

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
to start by slicing my chicken so I'm

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
to start by slicing my chicken so I'm
going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> cut<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> half<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.619> slice<00:00:29.340> my

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
going to cut it in half and slice my

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910 
going to cut it in half and slice my
chicken<00:00:29.880> diagonally<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:30.779> at<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> 45<00:00:31.890> degree

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
chicken diagonally or at a 45 degree

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620 
chicken diagonally or at a 45 degree
angle<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.880> you're<00:00:33.000> thinking<00:00:33.329> why<00:00:33.600> am

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
angle so if you're thinking why am

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
angle so if you're thinking why am
slicing<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.620> way<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.190> basically<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
slicing in this way so basically the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.160 
slicing in this way so basically the
fibers<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> chicken<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.809> stacked

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
fibers of the chicken are stacked

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
fibers of the chicken are stacked
together<00:00:37.440> they'll<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.100> able<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> retain<00:00:38.700> more

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
together they'll be able to retain more

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.880 
together they'll be able to retain more
moisture<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.410> make<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> chicken

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
moisture and this will make the chicken

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
moisture and this will make the chicken
more<00:00:41.250> juicier<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.390> point<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.840> gonna

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
more juicier at this point we're gonna

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.369 
more juicier at this point we're gonna
take<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> bowl<00:00:43.500> add<00:00:43.860> 2<00:00:44.370> tbsp<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> water<00:00:45.379> some

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
take a bowl add 2 tbsp of water some

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.770 
take a bowl add 2 tbsp of water some
salt<00:00:47.390> some<00:00:48.390> sugar<00:00:49.550> some<00:00:50.550> white<00:00:50.850> pepper<00:00:51.300> powder

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
salt some sugar some white pepper powder

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.560 
salt some sugar some white pepper powder
and<00:00:52.280> finally<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.610> vinegar<00:00:53.850> we're<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and finally some vinegar we're going to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
and finally some vinegar we're going to
mix<00:00:54.809> everything<00:00:54.960> together<00:00:55.320> until<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.980> sugar

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
mix everything together until the sugar

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
mix everything together until the sugar
dissolves<00:00:56.480> then<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:57.780> add<00:00:57.989> our

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
dissolves then we're gonna add our

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
dissolves then we're gonna add our
chicken<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> marinade<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.430> keep<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
chicken to the marinade and keep it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.540 
chicken to the marinade and keep it
inside<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.750> refrigerator<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.800> around<00:01:02.010> half<00:01:02.340> an

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
inside a refrigerator for around half an

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
inside a refrigerator for around half an
hour<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.930> I've<00:01:03.989> taken<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.500> walk<00:01:04.769> now

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
hour all right so I've taken a walk now

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
hour all right so I've taken a walk now
you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.309> any<00:01:05.549> large<00:01:05.939> utensil<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.630> add

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you can use any large utensil and add

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.780 
you can use any large utensil and add
some<00:01:07.229> water<00:01:07.260> now<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> boil<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> noodles

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
some water now to boil the noodles

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.609 
some water now to boil the noodles
perfectly<00:01:09.479> we'll<00:01:09.750> wait<00:01:09.960> until<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.380> water

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
perfectly we'll wait until the water

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
perfectly we'll wait until the water
boils<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.549> soon<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> water<00:01:12.330> boils

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
boils and as soon as the water boils

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
boils and as soon as the water boils
we're<00:01:13.110> gonna<00:01:13.229> add<00:01:13.439> some<00:01:13.470> salt<00:01:13.710> now<00:01:14.159> by<00:01:14.460> adding

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
we're gonna add some salt now by adding

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
we're gonna add some salt now by adding
salt<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.270> boiling<00:01:15.299> water<00:01:15.689> it'll<00:01:16.259> dissolve

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
salt in boiling water it'll dissolve

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.249 
salt in boiling water it'll dissolve
quickly<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.580> salt<00:01:18.150> has<00:01:18.420> sodium<00:01:18.780> which<00:01:19.140> will

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
quickly and salt has sodium which will

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
quickly and salt has sodium which will
marginally<00:01:19.979> elevate<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> boiling<00:01:20.939> point<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
marginally elevate the boiling point of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.710 
marginally elevate the boiling point of
water

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
water

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.240 
water
now<00:01:21.900> since<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> noodles<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> different

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
now since the noodles are at a different

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.039 
now since the noodles are at a different
temperature<00:01:23.610> than<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.119> boiling<00:01:24.630> water<00:01:24.810> so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
temperature than the boiling water so

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.300 
temperature than the boiling water so
when<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> add<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.770> noodles<00:01:25.920> through<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
when you add the noodles through the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.530 
when you add the noodles through the
water<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> temperature<00:01:26.850> water<00:01:27.299> will

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
water the temperature water will

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.810 
water the temperature water will
decrease<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> therefore<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.220> even

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
decrease and therefore for an even

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.210 
decrease and therefore for an even
cooking<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.270> noodles<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.930> added<00:01:31.350> sodium<00:01:32.009> in

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
cooking of noodles we added sodium in

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
cooking of noodles we added sodium in
the<00:01:32.369> form<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> salt<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.810> temperature

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the form of salt so that the temperature

the form of salt so that the temperature
of<00:01:34.350> water<00:01:34.500> doesn't<00:01:34.829> decrease<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.610> now

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
of water doesn't decrease a lot now

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090 
of water doesn't decrease a lot now
under<00:01:36.360> any<00:01:36.630> circumstances<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:37.890> want

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
under any circumstances we don't want

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440 
under any circumstances we don't want

through<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:40.049> overdone<00:01:40.530> instead<00:01:41.159> we've<00:01:41.430> warned

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
through or overdone instead we've warned

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.030 
through or overdone instead we've warned
them<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.600> underdone<00:01:43.380> itay<00:01:43.860> around

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.740 
85 to 90 percent
it<00:01:45.899> took<00:01:46.049> me<00:01:46.200> exactly<00:01:47.040> about<00:01:47.280> 210<00:01:48.060> seconds<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it took me exactly about 210 seconds to

it took me exactly about 210 seconds to
reach<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.950> case<00:01:50.130> you'll<00:01:50.369> have

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
reach there but in your case you'll have

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
reach there but in your case you'll have
to<00:01:50.640> check<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.030> timing<00:01:51.390> according<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> your

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to check your timing according to your

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
to check your timing according to your
noodles<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.979> keep<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.399> noodles<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
noodles so we keep the noodles and the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
noodles so we keep the noodles and the
cold<00:01:54.180> running<00:01:54.360> water<00:01:54.630> basically<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.649> stop<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
cold running water basically we stop the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
cold running water basically we stop the
cooking<00:01:56.159> process<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> remove<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.630> excess

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
cooking process and remove the excess

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.719 
cooking process and remove the excess
starch<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.740> you're<00:01:58.920> gonna<00:01:59.009> add<00:01:59.219> some<00:01:59.460> oil

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
starch then you're gonna add some oil

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
starch then you're gonna add some oil
and<00:02:00.090> mix<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> oil<00:02:00.509> thoroughly<00:02:01.140> throughout

and mix the oil thoroughly throughout
the<00:02:01.649> noodles<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.399> oil<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.880> prevent<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the noodles now oil will prevent the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.149 
the noodles now oil will prevent the
noodles<00:02:03.659> from<00:02:03.689> sticking<00:02:03.869> together<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.860> in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
noodles from sticking together and in

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.620 
noodles from sticking together and in
the<00:02:05.280> end<00:02:05.430> your<00:02:05.670> noodle<00:02:06.030> should<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> little

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the end your noodle should be a little

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.350 
the end your noodle should be a little
firm<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.409> they<00:02:07.799> should<00:02:08.009> break<00:02:08.340> like

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.090 
cooking so I want you to keep this in
mind<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.600> their<00:04:37.870> burners<00:04:38.139> release<00:04:38.590> almost

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
mind that their burners release almost

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.400 
mind that their burners release almost
10<00:04:39.400> times<00:04:39.639> more<00:04:39.940> heat<00:04:40.270> than<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.780> bonus<00:04:41.199> that

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
10 times more heat than the bonus that

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.620 
10 times more heat than the bonus that
we<00:04:41.620> have<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.039> our<00:04:42.160> homes<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.699> that's<00:04:43.180> why<00:04:43.479> they

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
we have in our homes and that's why they

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.330 
we have in our homes and that's why they
are<00:04:43.660> able<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.900> cook<00:04:44.199> so<00:04:44.530> quickly<00:04:44.770> therefore

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
are able to cook so quickly therefore

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.490 
are able to cook so quickly therefore
when<00:04:45.759> we<00:04:45.880> cook<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.300> noodles<00:04:46.660> our<00:04:46.870> vegetables

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
when we cook the noodles our vegetables

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.560 
when we cook the noodles our vegetables
will<00:04:47.680> take<00:04:47.889> a<00:04:47.919> little<00:04:48.280> longer<00:04:48.729> time<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.419> cook

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
will take a little longer time to cook

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.540 
will take a little longer time to cook
so<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.870> save<00:04:50.320> our<00:04:50.560> chicken<00:04:50.919> from<00:04:51.070> overcooking
