00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.539
 and found 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.670
 minecraft version of 20 legs write that i'm not 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.449
 there is a myth and others write that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.060
 this is an april fools but Iâ€™m for sure 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.890
 I do not know who and did it at all or mod 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.779
 any way to do it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 well let's create a world see 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.250
 what's new there so creative mode 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:45.940
 create a new world so wait for now 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:49.320
 the world is generated here so 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 long generation 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:59.290
 so here it is generated the world immediately 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:07.130
 a long lightning all over this it is with us that 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:09.729
 that is, nobody is piggy in leather cows 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.729
 leather armor 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.600
 slaughter cow so okay look 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.600
 farther 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.840
 Firstly, it is unrealistic to fps it 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.300
 first time so well, I 'll show you all quietly 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:37.890
 inventory so block we have any so 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.910
 we have a demigod tnt 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 the entire repair base explodes whether it downloaded 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.440
 I recently literally 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.710
 yes it explodes and come in as usual 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.710
 etc. 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.810
 I think this should not be even 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:06.380
 from nt anvil appeared and so on 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.429

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:15.579

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:21.040
 wolf that it is so all see what's here 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:23.319
 should be maybe so well 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.950
 okay, let's see what we have 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:31.889
 added more protection here we add 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.340
 still blocks new glass blocks 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:39.209
 Well, let's take four cycles here with us 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:45.489
 black us red 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:48.000
 green and brown so still what not 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.000
 added 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:03:00.160
 yes again asked fu tests and what's new 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:05.630

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.870
 burning so it is a burnt torch here it is 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.870
 extinguished 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.079
 what else do we have 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:21.570
 we have nothing here, too, nothing 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.000
 maybe up to no new food is not added 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.490
 so to take the golden apple look 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.230
 maybe she does 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:34.920
 can i rather read what i can 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:38.180
 feed him no animal do not eat him 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.670
 throw everything 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.409
 and if there is no such golden apple 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:50.750
 also do not see so well, that look so 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:54.829
 there is nothing new here, too, we have nothing 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.739
 no, and here we have nothing surprising that 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.829
 for garbage 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:04.299

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:08.989
 unexpectedly when all these mobs appeared 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:13.609
 let's make it easy now 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:16.250
 take them all so here they all disappeared yes 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:20.269
 so it was unexpected and when they 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.669
 all appeared in the armor well, think for yourself 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.889
