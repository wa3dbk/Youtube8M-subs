00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.140
 hi girls today we talk about cons 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.940
 Inter whats the ring account 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.949
 then the con touring is a place of 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.540
 shadows and lights used to shake face a 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.670
 minimize some flaws we can 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.680
 that is, to sanction we have 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.780
 unfortunately pronounced here we live 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.690
 the illusion that these little flaws 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.030
 there are not and how to do it with 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:18.270
 touring is done using a land 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.149
 just to give for the shadows we used 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 a land or even an eye shadow that 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.649
 perhaps of three darker shades of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.190
 your skin or you can do it too 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.770
 as a dark concealer or even with the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.619
 foundation loan of your skin 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.070
 I often on the earth anyway if you have to 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.990
 6 use the land a break in the product 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.060
 dusty make sure it is but 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.579
 technician is not brillantino zoe why 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.190
 if we do contouring for example 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.950
 signed see 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.230
 also where I don't think it's a thing 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.440
 nice 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:58.490
 then I'll show you right away how to make a 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.790
 naturally contouring with touring is 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.220
 different from disabled if therefore the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.750
 problems you have 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.990
 we therefore only have quite a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.240
 plump we try to make a little more 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.760
 thin if we have our biggest one 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.920
 let's try to thin the nose or 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.050
 even maybe minimizing the one anyway 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.270
 a bit too pronounced but the same thing 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.250
 the forehead we have the founded we seek 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.320
 to limit them to make it seem narrower 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.130
 as for the nose for example 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.490
 I'll show you let's try now a 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.440
 thin my nose eyeshadow 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.050
 favorite because I'm umberto per 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.960
 doing this work is this of the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.960
 palettes or for better banning of gays and it is 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.349
 I do n't know if you can see this 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.690
 ok will have to take with a small brush from 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.690
 negative shade 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:15.099
 and I draw two lines then I start from 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.099
 base and I'm going to trace 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.870
 this is especially good 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:36.010
 when shooting photo shoots and that 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:40.390
 maybe it's the model or the model the nose 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.040
 a little too pronounced or too much but the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.910
 model photo from known model I think 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:52.239
 however difficult these are 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.060
 lines naturally we leave so man 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.299
 let them fade because they remember that the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.849
 always contouring always 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.050
 Estimated is never leave the companies lines 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:07.690
 come to mind 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.690
 let's go to the sea 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:56.690
 ok low what my nose should now 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:59.050
 look thinner regarding 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.450
 the cheekbones how to do the counter thing 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:08.890
 then touch your bone of evil and 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.660
 then apply the ground just below 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:19.960
 in this case its a brush 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.960
 angled so I take the earth from them 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:30.129
 to facilitate you, I suggest you do the 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.129
 boccuccia therefore interests 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:39.570
 started with the application of 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:42.420
 earth and fade well remember one 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.150
 what both blush and earth 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.620
 don't go too close to the mouth not 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.870
 get too close in this area 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.190
 because anyway maybe the fact that with 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.430
 as for the with touring e 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.590
 servants too much the mouth of between that 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.960
 they would be too masculine and therefore 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.740
 they don't want this and then apart from that 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.800
 is the face the video would seem to fall 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:11.150
 and therefore the lender always look for 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.150
 keeping you is blurred in everything 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:36.150
 let's go a bit even to the fashion shows on the forehead 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.150
 so it will all be more topic 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.669
 after that we're going to blush 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:49.120
 blush applies just above where 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.919
 we have always put the earth in 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.409
 my art nuanced way why not 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:57.689
 they went to separate roads and lines 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.689
 so let's apply a bit of blush 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:15.029
 and finally the illuminant the illuminant goes 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:17.339
 guided right here yes seconds 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:20.819
 productive 

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:25.610
 I have done this will have to have the illusion 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:25.610
 more prominent black zygones 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:31.629
 I walk 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:43.239
 ok this is a with touring is 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:46.479
 very simple you can do 

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:49.539
 they do everything besides their internal too 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:52.029
 very healthy or simply sculpted 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:53.979
 cheekbones and studied a little bit 

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:56.259
 undermined even if we in practice love the 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:58.449
 throw in anyway to show you 

00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:00.879
 but come back yesterday because there are so many 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:02.919
 types of with touring and if you have any 

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:05.349
 question I have some problems and more 

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:07.689
 peaceful write to me and I will answer you 

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:09.959
 I hope I was pleased and therefore 

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:09.959
 to the next
