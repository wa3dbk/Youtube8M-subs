00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.249 
colleges will have a new mu set I'm
really<00:01:37.340> hoping<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.729> hash<00:01:38.030> Adama<00:01:38.420> gets<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:39.110> new

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
really hoping that hash Adama gets a new

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.560 
really hoping that hash Adama gets a new
mu<00:01:39.439> set<00:01:39.710> because<00:01:40.040> in<00:01:40.250> comparison<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:41.210> mother

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
mu set because in comparison to mother

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.780 
mu set because in comparison to mother
it's<00:01:42.080> like<00:01:42.290> night<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.590> day<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.549> shouldn't

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
it's like night and day and it shouldn't

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.130 
it's like night and day and it shouldn't
be<00:01:43.850> like<00:01:44.000> that<00:01:44.030> because<00:01:44.420> they<00:01:44.840> are<00:01:44.960> both

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
be like that because they are both

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.990 
be like that because they are both
pretty<00:01:45.380> much<00:01:45.560> on<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.860> same<00:01:46.040> level<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.640> also

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
pretty much on the same level I also

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.179 
pretty much on the same level I also
think<00:01:47.360> b2<00:01:47.689> Minato<00:01:48.110> should<00:01:48.290> get<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> new<00:01:48.740> mu<00:01:48.890> set

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
think b2 Minato should get a new mu set

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.249 
think b2 Minato should get a new mu set
since<00:01:49.579> he<00:01:49.759> has<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.060> b2<00:01:50.390> cloak<00:01:50.600> over<00:01:50.750> him<00:01:51.049> I

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
since he has that b2 cloak over him I

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.590 
since he has that b2 cloak over him I
want<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.650> see<00:01:51.799> him<00:01:51.950> faster<00:01:52.460> more<00:01:53.060> flashy<00:01:53.420> er

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
want to see him faster more flashy er

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600 
want to see him faster more flashy er
