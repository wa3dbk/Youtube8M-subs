00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
olympic bar here I have a hose clamp and

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.740 
olympic bar here I have a hose clamp and
this<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.400> climbers<00:00:20.730> line<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.630> will

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
this is some climbers line it will

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290 
this is some climbers line it will
support<00:00:22.160> way<00:00:23.160> more<00:00:23.400> than<00:00:23.550> outer<00:00:23.670> left<00:00:24.029> that

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
support way more than outer left that

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.240 
support way more than outer left that
piece<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.599> tape<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.349> a<00:00:25.380> loading<00:00:25.859> pin<00:00:26.039> down

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
piece of tape have a loading pin down

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.380 
piece of tape have a loading pin down
here<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.410> i<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.769> weights<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.189> line

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
here and i have my weights on the line

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.619 
here and i have my weights on the line
so<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:30.810> thing<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:35.390> I'll<00:00:36.390> put<00:00:36.539> the

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
so the first thing I do I'll put the

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:49.639 
so the first thing I do I'll put the
hose<00:00:36.780> clamp<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:47.329> put<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> middle<00:00:49.050> on

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
hose clamp on put it about the middle on

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.389 
hose clamp on put it about the middle on
the<00:00:49.710> other<00:00:49.890> side<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> bar<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.910> have

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
the other side of the bar I have

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
the other side of the bar I have
245-pound<00:00:53.399> plates<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.269> counterbalance

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
245-pound plates just a counterbalance

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.000 
245-pound plates just a counterbalance
so<00:00:55.320> those<00:00:55.500> flip<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:57.530> write<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.739> nice<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so those flip over write it up nice and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
so those flip over write it up nice and
tight<00:01:02.449> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:03.929> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.199> Magnus

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
tight this is the way I think Magnus

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.030 
tight this is the way I think Magnus
seamlessly<00:01:05.309> did<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:06.090> his<00:01:06.210> video<00:01:07.009> put<00:01:08.009> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
seamlessly did it on his video put a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.690 
seamlessly did it on his video put a
piece<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> tape<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
piece of tape here so that when you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.620 
piece of tape here so that when you
unwind<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.420> doesn't<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:12.869> caught<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.939> and

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.710 

you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:18.869> backwards<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.979> forwards<00:01:20.720> they

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you can go backwards or forwards they

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:56.249 
you can go backwards or forwards they
should<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:27.259> ok<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:31.670> here<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.759> go

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:06.399 

1<00:01:57.259> 2<00:01:57.679> 3<00:01:57.979> 4<00:01:58.340> plate<00:02:03.220> that's<00:02:04.220> it
