00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 today I would like to tell you about 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.379
 what are the smartest birds in the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.410
 world birds that have shown through 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.750
 of scientific tests that are capable 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.630
 to do some things that we 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.490
 we are able to do and it is curious 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.520
 taking into account the size of your 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.939
 brain so you can see that the human being 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.449
 It is not the only animal that is capable of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.400
 perform smart acts we go there 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.619
 with the list is that it will certainly surprise you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.649
 because they are birds that are capable of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.110
 perform things that do not even 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.899
 suspected and we will not see first 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 place with cormorants the cormorants 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.629
 they are incredible birds that hunt fish 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.670
 are dying in the water are 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.430
 used by the Chinese who 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 domestic to hunt up to seven fish 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.379
 once reached that number of fish 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.710
 they hunt to feed themselves and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.050
 they refuse to continue fishing 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.640
 As you can see they learn just like 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:08.570
 would learn a dog then we have the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.670
 Famous macaws that are good birds 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.470
 indigenous to the tropics and can 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.330
 differentiate perfectly between 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.300
 left and right when 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.140
 trained with positive reinforcement are 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.000
 able to perfectly differentiate the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 words that we teach them not 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.790
 what they mean on the other hand we have 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.490
 the crows that are not very attractive 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.679
 aesthetically but nevertheless they are 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.890
 called by scientists as 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.050
 feathered primates because of their great 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.690
 ability and skill at the time of 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 solve a problem they have a 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.259
 intellectual development so great that 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.090
 the studies that biologists did 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.940
 they saw that these birds were capable of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.289
 memorize and then recognize images that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.289
 they had previously shown 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.330
 impressive we do not have also the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.190
 tits that formerly when the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.350
 milk used to be distributed from home in 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.330
 house were these birds able to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.310
 identify which drink was the one 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.460
 distributed thanks to the colors of the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.110
 bottle caps and because of that 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.310
 for the tits flew to the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.620
 bottles and they drank the nutritious milk 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.110
 we also have the cockatoos at 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.550
 which they like to dance, let's say 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.520
 that have a great dose of creativity 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.410
 as the human being and in fact can 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.870
 recognize several rhythms very rhythms 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.530
 musical and dance over time 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.319
 of his life 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.090
 we also have the hummingbirds a 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.700
 small and fast bird with a tiny 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.709
 brain and that despite this is capable 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.390
 to recognize all the flowers that are 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.180
 they find in their territory that they can 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.540
 include up to 1000 different species 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.180
 of flowers permanently watches his 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.330
 territory and so knows which flowers 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.120
 they have nectar and which flower according to 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.989
 season of the year 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.730
 we also have pigeons good 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.580
 pigeons did a study three 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.440
 researchers and discovered after 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.420
 do what the pigeons are capable of 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.709
 differentiate between the paintings of 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.450
 picasso and de monet although they could not see 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.910
 the difference when the pictures of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.160
 monet were placed in inverted position 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.290
 apparently pigeons pigeons 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.590
 they are also able to distinguish the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.959
 art 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.569
 we also have the Japanese crows 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.360
 another body as not also known 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.280
 as a three-legged crow that lives in 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.340
 the urban areas of Japan where 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.080
 they enjoy the food of the streets 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.849
 these amazing birds hope that the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.459
 that pedestrians drop to the street 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.319
 the nuts that they usually consume and 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.260
 that the shell is destroyed by the 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.849
 cars that circulate once the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.849
 red light of the traffic light stops the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.120
 transit the crows fly fast 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:59.739
 in search of the pulp that is to say they catch what 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.000
 that would be nuts and leave them 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.950
 so they get caught in the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.230
 highway or on the road to the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.180
 they get caught in cars so they can eat 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.609
 the later 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.790
 and lastly we have the bird 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:16.489
 finch carpenter a small bird of the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.949
 Galapagos Islands that good is very 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.440
 known for using sticks to hunt 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:25.900
 worms and other invertebrate insects 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.050
 so let's say this last bird is 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.040
 is able to use instruments when 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.780
 just as a human would use them 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.150
 awesome you know that show that 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.410
 also in the world of birds there 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.410
 a high level of intelligence
