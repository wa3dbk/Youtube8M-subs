00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:08.170
 hello guys and girls good this tutorial 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.849
 is going to go about how I plan my hair 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.440
 and well after showering I have put 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.720
 to eat and well I have approached a 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.870
 little but we're going to finish drying it with 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.060
 this heat 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.660
 I'm going to use this heat protector 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.820
 13 m 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.879
 and the normal 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.879
 [Music] 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:44.579
 let's do it first in the hand 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.579
 [Music] 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.220
 good 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.070
 after drying I'm going to start 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.990
 good to tell you that especially what 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.390
 try to mold are the back parts 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.240
 that always good to me I still have cook 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.470
 up and with the iron is very 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.030
 hard to do so my hair is 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.640
 very curly but 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.340
 if you let me wash it after 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.710
 Melo combed very tight then at the end 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.350
 I'm a bit off the wave that I have 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.180
 then he finished it off with the sinner and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.630
 Then, since it starts, it's because of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.539
 griddle 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 and let's start by making it I 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.930
 removed from the middle I have a lot the amount 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.210
 of hair and especially if here I have left 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.159
 Very curly 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.150
 my hair is very stylish helmet 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.370
 military and it's something that I hate 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.290
 so good the one above 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.040
 we are going to catch him 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.040
 yes it's worth 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.560
 I'm going to use it 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.439
 brawn if you see the good thing about the brown is that 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.899
 it says when when it's hot 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.179
 say it and well then let's start 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.350
 plant to plant crisis of the same 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.890
 protector and I give 2 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.400
 we truth the sun 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 and nothing and start planting 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.990
 at the beginning when you use the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.500
 the curler yes it is true that I mean 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.240
 I forgive the plant if you are protective 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.080
 Well what do all the 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.000
 plants 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.230
 It is in the noise and it is as if you 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 I was learning the hair 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.000
 nothing is not happening 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.719
 those from canada more good I 'm going to plant 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.139
 the two profiles I'm going to plant one for 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.139
 that you see 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.890
 Let's see 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.530
 to buy the iron for always 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.990
 good as the ads that pass it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.200
 well and they already have a form a shine and 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.379
 good 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.590
 I stayed in pelas and broom then 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.550
 What do I do? What I do is catch it with 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.660
 the comb not to burn me and 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.430
 and in the end I give it a little back and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.760
 principle is like that but good then you 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.510
 I will give a trick so that it is not so 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.360
 wavy ok I'm going to pose the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.470
 other part 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.810
 good regret 23 partitions though 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.240
 well it does not look very good and I'm going to start 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.810
 especially because of the fringe but then 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.120
 I would go back, you know, I had some text 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.890
 here yes for the back I do not 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.980
 like 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.980
 and above all I will give a lot of shape 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.750
 because if I do not have here a whirlpool and 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:18.600
 is always there and I want the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.600
 bangs is well worth it 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.299
 then I give shape to the beginning 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.460
 he planted it by the tips 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.809
 [Music] 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.060
 well we have the first 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.530
 let's go for the second 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.530
 If some hair is bad 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.710
 wavy by the root or something not 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.330
 worry then then go back to see what 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.260
 that was done before he stayed 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.520
 canceled 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.520
 once and you will see 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.750
 here but good you take the comb 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:28.030
 and I'm going to cancel 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.030
 to plant for line 

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.999
 for the last profession 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.219
 good as it was beginning to be done 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.449
 a little run good I have to tell you 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.710
 what 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.990
 it's good that I'll explain it 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.590
 in the video that I will do about my name 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.090
 although I have to say this a video 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.280
 before I know what my name will be and 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.920
 my channel 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.770
 but hey he did not tell me he has to be 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:05.830
 there with my friends and such because 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.830
 it's really hard not to repeat and good 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.400
 so it's worth 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.210
 we have all the ironed hair that happens 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.080
 the bangs good apart from that I 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.210
 I cut and good and everything starts to grow 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.129
 we have been very square, and that 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.490
 problem that I see many ticos with my 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.530
 hair or also many girls with hair 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.419
 short that on the part they have cut and 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.900
 then very long that is that all this 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:37.110
 it is very stiff and it 's what 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.960
 does the truth is ugly then what are we going 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:44.880
 to do let's take again our 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.730
 dryer but let's put cold 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:53.319
 yes 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:53.319
 [Music] 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.569
 but this is how we have a little bit of you and 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.610
 you 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.349
 and I was 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.250
 This is a look that you can take to 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.560
 any side many people say that 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.560
 we have 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:15.130
 and I say no what 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:18.790
 that not what is normal is half said 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:22.120
 also but I like it and that's what 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.610
 you have to import so well no 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.610
 I will be here 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.610
 OK
