00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
going to be there until the end what did

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
going to be there until the end what did
you<00:01:32.280> felt<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> difference<00:01:33.119> between<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you felt was a difference between the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.630 
you felt was a difference between the
first<00:01:33.689> set<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> two<00:01:34.920> sets<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> want

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
first set and the two sets that you want

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060 
first set and the two sets that you want
and<00:01:35.880> did<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.240> made<00:01:36.390> any<00:01:36.540> adjustments<00:01:37.070> after

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and did you made any adjustments after

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.740 
and did you made any adjustments after
the<00:01:38.310> first<00:01:38.549> set<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.420> may<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the first set that you think may get it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
the first set that you think may get it
made<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> difference<00:01:41.090> yeah<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.540> are

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
made a difference yeah I think there are

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.160 
made a difference yeah I think there are
a<00:01:42.720> few<00:01:42.750> key<00:01:43.740> moments<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> match<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.790> think

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
a few key moments in the match I think

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.510 
a few key moments in the match I think
getting<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.409> break<00:01:46.649> back<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> first<00:01:47.340> was

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
getting that break back in the first was

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
getting that break back in the first was
important<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.500> giving<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.649> back

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
important but then giving it right back

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
important but then giving it right back
to<00:01:50.189> her<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:51.329> sloppy<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.810> my<00:01:51.990> part<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.930> not

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
to her was was sloppy on my part and not

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.859

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.740 
to do things much better and and return
better<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.479> more<00:02:00.689> aggressive<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:02.009> then<00:02:02.310> I

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
better be more aggressive and then I

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.209 
better be more aggressive and then I
after<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.780> lost<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.200> game<00:02:04.439> obviously<00:02:05.040> she

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
after I lost that game obviously she

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.150 
after I lost that game obviously she
didn't<00:02:05.399> feel<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.670> pressure<00:02:05.909> anymore<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.160> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
didn't feel that pressure anymore so you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.490 
didn't feel that pressure anymore so you

and<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.969> third<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.420> thought<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.019> was

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and in the third I thought that I was

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.380 
and in the third I thought that I was
the<00:02:19.290> aggressive<00:02:19.859> one<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.670> stepped<00:02:21.239> up

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the aggressive one and I I stepped up

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.059 
the aggressive one and I I stepped up
and<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:21.659> was<00:02:21.750> doing<00:02:21.989> things<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.439> had<00:02:22.590> wanted

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
and I was doing things that I had wanted

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.800 
and I was doing things that I had wanted
to<00:02:23.219> do<00:02:23.370> which<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.700> feel<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.299> should<00:02:24.420> maybe

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
to do which I feel that I should maybe

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.319 
to do which I feel that I should maybe
should<00:02:25.049> have<00:02:25.079> done<00:02:25.290> earlier
