00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
here as you can see in my hand right now

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.470 
here as you can see in my hand right now
and<00:00:21.990> it'll<00:00:22.800> basically<00:00:23.039> tell<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.850> how<00:00:24.180> far

and it'll basically tell you how far
away<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.410> diamond<00:00:25.800> or<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:27.060> you

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
away you are from a diamond or so as you

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.540 
away you are from a diamond or so as you
can<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.480> here<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> made<00:00:27.930> nice<00:00:28.380> woods<00:00:28.769> like

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
can see here I made nice woods like

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.400 
can see here I made nice woods like
different<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.359> color<00:00:30.570> planks<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.050> like

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
different kind of color planks to like

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380 
different kind of color planks to like
basically<00:00:31.830> represent<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.850> different<00:00:33.000> colors

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
basically represent the different colors

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880 
basically represent the different colors
will<00:00:33.600> change<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.260> see<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.680> I'm

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
will change so as you can see if I'm

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920 
will change so as you can see if I'm
eight<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.489> six<00:00:35.730> blocks<00:00:35.940> away<00:00:36.059> it'll<00:00:36.420> turn<00:00:36.630> red

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
eight to six blocks away it'll turn red

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660 
eight to six blocks away it'll turn red
which<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.500> darker<00:00:37.890> wood<00:00:38.100> if<00:00:38.250> I'm<00:00:38.399> any

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
which is this darker wood if I'm any

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
which is this darker wood if I'm any
distance<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.600> away<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> diamond

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
distance like this away from the diamond

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
distance like this away from the diamond
it'll<00:00:41.190> turn<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> could<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> dis

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it'll turn right so I could be a dis

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
it'll turn right so I could be a dis
much<00:00:42.750> above<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.230> could<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.890> much

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
much above it I could be this this much

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
much above it I could be this this much
below<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> diagonal<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.780> from<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.110> over

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
below it diagonal you know from way over

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.959 
below it diagonal you know from way over
here<00:00:46.620> something<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.160> red<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
here something it's red you get the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.119 
here something it's red you get the
general<00:00:48.239> idea<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.500> now<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
general idea there so now if you go to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
general idea there so now if you go to
the<00:00:50.370> lighter<00:00:50.550> colored<00:00:50.879> wood<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.390> five<00:00:51.660> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the lighter colored wood now in five to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
the lighter colored wood now in five to
four<00:00:52.079> blocks<00:00:52.350> away<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.039> diamond<00:00:53.219> door

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
four blocks away from the diamond door

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
four blocks away from the diamond door
itself<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:54.960> 3<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.410> 2<00:00:55.620> blocks

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
itself and then this one 3 to 2 blocks

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
itself and then this one 3 to 2 blocks
and<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.449> turn

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and if I get to this one it will turn

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.970 
and if I get to this one it will turn
green<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.199> means<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:58.559> completely

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
green and that means I'm completely

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
green and that means I'm completely
adjacent<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> diamond<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.329> basically

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
adjacent to the diamond so basically

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
adjacent to the diamond so basically
this<00:01:00.809> means<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> diamond<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
this means you could see the diamond and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
this means you could see the diamond and
you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.850> collect<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.270> nice<00:01:03.510> reward<00:01:03.930> here

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you know collect your nice reward here

you know collect your nice reward here
so<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.860> showed<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.460> functionality<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so I'm showed you the functionality of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.580 
so I'm showed you the functionality of
the<00:01:06.479> device<00:01:06.750> itself<00:01:06.960> I'll<00:01:07.290> show<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> how<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the device itself I'll show you how to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.190 
the device itself I'll show you how to
craft<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.299> basically<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.720> recipe

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
craft it basically it is this recipe

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.649 
craft it basically it is this recipe
it's<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.710> redstone<00:01:10.920> torch<00:01:11.430> 11<00:01:11.909> diamonds<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's one redstone torch 11 diamonds that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.539 
it's one redstone torch 11 diamonds that
is<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.049> regular<00:01:13.409> diamonds<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.920> diamond<00:01:14.340> block

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
is to regular diamonds one diamond block

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.899 
is to regular diamonds one diamond block
and<00:01:14.790> three<00:01:15.780> regular<00:01:16.350> stone<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.250> craft<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and three regular stone to craft the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.490 
and three regular stone to craft the
diamond<00:01:18.659> Demeter<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.470> right

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
diamond Demeter as you can see right

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.190 
diamond Demeter as you can see right
here<00:01:19.710> they<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.189> stack<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.240> would

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
here they do not stack which I would

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.539 
here they do not stack which I would
dream<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.470> sack<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.070> only<00:01:23.189> need<00:01:23.280> one

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
dream to sack you really only need one

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
dream to sack you really only need one
of<00:01:23.580> these<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.119> time<00:01:24.630> there's<00:01:24.900> no<00:01:24.990> reason<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of these at a time there's no reason to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
of these at a time there's no reason to
you<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.360> mod<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
