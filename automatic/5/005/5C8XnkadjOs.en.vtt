00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
3 by 3 door maybe not so to build this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
3 by 3 door maybe not so to build this
you're<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> want<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> start<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.620> 3

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you're going to want to start with a 3

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
you're going to want to start with a 3
by<00:00:44.309> 3<00:00:44.340> hallway<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
by 3 hallway just like this with a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.619 
by 3 hallway just like this with a
little<00:00:46.530> piston<00:00:46.950> set<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.879> looks<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.300> bit

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
little piston set up that looks a bit

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
little piston set up that looks a bit
like<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.800> these<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.190> sticky

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
like this so these are all sticky

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
like this so these are all sticky
pistons<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.680> come<00:00:52.860> over

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
pistons just right here then come over

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.529 
pistons just right here then come over
to<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.430> side<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.090> place<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.920> sticky<00:00:55.920> piston

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
to this side and place a sticky piston

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
to this side and place a sticky piston
diagonal<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.530> block<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
diagonal of that block right there and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
diagonal of that block right there and
I'm<00:00:59.910> gonna<00:01:00.030> grab<00:01:00.300> my<00:01:00.329> redstone<00:01:00.660> dust<00:01:00.960> black

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
I'm gonna grab my redstone dust black

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.000 
I'm gonna grab my redstone dust black
back<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.879> place<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.420> movable<00:01:04.320> movable

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
back and then place a movable movable

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
back and then place a movable movable
block<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:06.710> then<00:01:07.710> diagonal<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
block right there then diagonal of that

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
block right there then diagonal of that
or<00:01:09.299> across<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.430> place<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.640> redstone

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
or across with that place a redstone

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.539 
or across with that place a redstone
dust<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> then<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.470> block<00:01:13.799> against<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
dust there and then a block against the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
dust there and then a block against the
piston<00:01:14.970> movable<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.470> redstone<00:01:16.799> torch

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
piston movable and then a redstone torch

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.539 
piston movable and then a redstone torch
there<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.390> piston<00:01:19.229> extends<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
there so that that piston extends and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
there so that that piston extends and
place<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> block<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.390> top<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.380> torch<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
place a block on top of that torch and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
place a block on top of that torch and
then<00:01:23.369> quickly<00:01:23.670> remove<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.630> block<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
then quickly remove this block here and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.620 
then quickly remove this block here and
then<00:01:26.040> place<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.430> redstone<00:01:26.610> torch<00:01:27.030> there

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
then place a redstone torch there

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.749 
then place a redstone torch there
they'll<00:01:27.960> pull<00:01:28.229> stat<00:01:28.530> piston<00:01:28.950> it'll<00:01:29.189> grab<00:01:29.640> it

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
they'll pull stat piston it'll grab it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
they'll pull stat piston it'll grab it
back<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.570> no<00:01:30.720> worries<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.470> replace

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
back but no worries you can just replace

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.760 
back but no worries you can just replace
that<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.630> place<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.079> block<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.740> here

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that now if we place a block right here

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.840 
that now if we place a block right here
with<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> lever<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.360> top<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:38.520> should

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
with a lever on top of it it should

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.929 
with a lever on top of it it should
extend<00:01:39.270> those<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:40.200> blocks<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
extend those two blocks now for the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
extend those two blocks now for the
retraction<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.590> quickly

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
retraction what we want to do is quickly

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.300 
retraction what we want to do is quickly
extend<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.820> piston<00:01:45.390> after<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.350> been<00:01:46.590> it's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
extend this piston after it's been it's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.359 
extend this piston after it's been it's
been<00:01:47.490> retracted<00:01:48.079> to<00:01:49.079> make<00:01:49.350> sure<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.189> can

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
been retracted to make sure that it can

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
been retracted to make sure that it can
grab<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.850> block<00:01:51.210> from<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.930> pushing<00:01:52.829> double

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
grab this block from the pushing double

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.010 
grab this block from the pushing double
piston<00:01:53.369> extender<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.450> let's<00:01:54.689> work<00:01:54.840> on

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
piston extender there so let's work on

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.709 
piston extender there so let's work on
that<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.479> fairly

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that now and that is fairly

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
that now and that is fairly
straightforward<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.920> put<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.280> dropper

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
straightforward you just put a dropper

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.270 
straightforward you just put a dropper
right<00:02:00.000> there<00:02:00.350> facing<00:02:01.350> into<00:02:01.710> where<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
right there facing into where you just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.969 
right there facing into where you just
put<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.610> lever<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.869> hopper<00:02:04.320> facing<00:02:04.770> back

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
put your lever then a hopper facing back

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.690 
put your lever then a hopper facing back
into<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.490> dropper<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:05.969> then<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
into that dropper and then a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.850 
into that dropper and then a
redstone<00:02:07.030> comparator<00:02:07.259> facing<00:02:08.259> out<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.709> that

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
redstone comparator facing out of that

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.670 
redstone comparator facing out of that
straight<00:02:09.700> into<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.119> piston<00:02:10.690> or<00:02:10.840> into<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
straight into the piston or into the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.559 
straight into the piston or into the
block<00:02:12.099> which<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.430> next<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:12.940> piston<00:02:13.360> rather

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
block which is next to the piston rather

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.670 
block which is next to the piston rather
and<00:02:13.870> then<00:02:14.650> place<00:02:15.040> any<00:02:15.370> old<00:02:15.730> item<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.170> upper

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and then place any old item in the upper

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.530 
and then place any old item in the upper
right<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:18.129> so<00:02:18.730> now<00:02:18.879> it<00:02:19.150> should<00:02:19.390> look

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
right there so now it should look

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
right there so now it should look
something<00:02:19.599> like<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.459> quickly

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
something like this see it quickly

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.580 
something like this see it quickly
pulsed<00:02:25.150> there<00:02:25.300> after<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.080> block<00:02:26.380> was

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
pulsed there after that block was

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.729 
pulsed there after that block was
retracted<00:02:27.630> alright<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:28.930> next<00:02:29.170> up<00:02:29.380> we're<00:02:29.560> going

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
retracted alright so next up we're going

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.199 
retracted alright so next up we're going
to<00:02:29.800> start<00:02:29.980> working<00:02:30.160> on<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.700> double<00:02:31.030> piston

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
to start working on the double piston

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.960 
to start working on the double piston
extender<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:32.080> over<00:02:32.410> there<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.610> get<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
extender right over there so to get a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.550 
extender right over there so to get a
signal<00:02:34.150> over<00:02:34.569> there<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.959> just<00:02:35.200> want<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.380> place

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
signal over there you just want to place

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
tick repeater going out and then one

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.160 
tick repeater going out and then one
block<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.110> with<00:02:53.920> which<00:02:54.400> has<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:55.000> redstone<00:02:55.720> dust

block up with which has a redstone dust
on<00:02:56.440> top<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.910> remove<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.900> floor<00:02:59.290> block<00:02:59.560> and

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
on top then remove this floor block and

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.280 
on top then remove this floor block and
replace<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:01.090> block<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.720> can<00:03:02.049> place

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
replace it with a block you can place

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.830 
replace it with a block you can place
something<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.099> side<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.819> we're<00:03:04.690> going

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
something on the side of and we're going

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.509 
something on the side of and we're going
to<00:03:04.870> use<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.079> trip<00:03:05.410> wire<00:03:05.620> hook<00:03:05.950> but<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.400> also

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
to use a trip wire hook but you can also

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.789 
to use a trip wire hook but you can also
use<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.910> lever<00:03:07.299> but<00:03:08.170> I'm<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.500> gonna<00:03:08.590> stick

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
use a lever but I'm just gonna stick

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.729 
use a lever but I'm just gonna stick
with<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:09.010> trip<00:03:09.400> wire<00:03:09.579> hook<00:03:09.849> for<00:03:10.090> now<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.350> then

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
with a trip wire hook for now so then

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.580 
with a trip wire hook for now so then
out<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.579> redstone<00:03:12.970> dust<00:03:13.329> just<00:03:13.870> take<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.230> to

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
out of this redstone dust just take a to

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.490 
out of this redstone dust just take a to
take<00:03:14.769> repeater<00:03:15.100> output<00:03:15.549> right<00:03:15.880> there<00:03:16.180> and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
take repeater output right there and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.740 
take repeater output right there and
that<00:03:17.500> repeater<00:03:18.069> actually<00:03:18.670> goes<00:03:18.910> into<00:03:18.940> this

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that repeater actually goes into this

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.140 
that repeater actually goes into this
redstone<00:03:20.200> dust<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:20.920> that'll<00:03:21.250> extend<00:03:21.549> the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
redstone dust so that'll extend the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.190 
redstone dust so that'll extend the
double<00:03:22.959> piston<00:03:23.079> extender<00:03:23.319> right<00:03:23.769> there<00:03:24.010> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
double piston extender right there and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.590 
double piston extender right there and
then<00:03:26.200> place<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.889> redstone<00:03:27.160> repeater<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:27.940> for

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
then place a redstone repeater on for

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.720 
then place a redstone repeater on for
ticks<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.470> out<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.100> other<00:03:30.310> side<00:03:30.700> of

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
ticks going out of the other side of

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.199 
ticks going out of the other side of
that<00:03:31.060> redstone<00:03:31.389> dust<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.100> then<00:03:33.100> go<00:03:33.340> up<00:03:33.670> one

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
that redstone dust and then go up one

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.809 
that redstone dust and then go up one
block<00:03:34.540> then<00:03:35.170> place<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.500> redstone<00:03:35.650> dust<00:03:36.489> right

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
block then place a redstone dust right

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.180 
block then place a redstone dust right
there<00:03:37.150> then<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:38.049> block<00:03:38.410> in<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.769> middle<00:03:38.980> there

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
there then a block in the middle there

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.879 
there then a block in the middle there
and<00:03:39.400> then<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.910> block<00:03:40.269> on<00:03:40.510> top<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.380> four<00:03:41.709> tech

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
and then a block on top of the four tech

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.759 
and then a block on top of the four tech
repeater<00:03:42.250> right<00:03:42.519> there<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.060> then<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.109> to<00:03:44.590> tick

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
repeater right there and then a to tick

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.000 
repeater right there and then a to tick
repeater<00:03:45.190> facing<00:03:45.850> into<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.560> front<00:03:47.560> paste<00:03:47.829> in

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
repeater facing into the front paste in

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.520 
repeater facing into the front paste in
there<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.489> then<00:03:49.060> simply<00:03:49.480> just<00:03:49.690> place<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.170> block

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
there and then simply just place a block

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.629 
there and then simply just place a block
right<00:03:51.040> there<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.930> now<00:03:53.440> everything<00:03:54.190> should<00:03:54.220> be

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
right there so now everything should be

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.420 
right there so now everything should be
working

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
working

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.869 
working
there<00:03:57.239> we<00:03:57.390> go<00:03:57.569> extension<00:03:58.200> works<00:03:58.469> fine<00:03:58.879> our

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
there we go extension works fine our

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.000 
there we go extension works fine our
attraction<00:04:00.689> works<00:04:00.870> perfectly<00:04:01.439> fine<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.859> well

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
attraction works perfectly fine as well

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.009 
attraction works perfectly fine as well
so<00:04:02.790> now<00:04:02.969> you<00:04:03.030> can<00:04:03.329> just<00:04:03.540> cover<00:04:03.750> up<00:04:03.989> your

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
so now you can just cover up your

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.220 
so now you can just cover up your
hallway<00:04:05.010> or<00:04:05.579> drop<00:04:06.209> down<00:04:06.420> chute<00:04:06.780> however<00:04:07.140> you
