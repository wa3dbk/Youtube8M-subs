00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
five and that's five percent so now well

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.110 
five and that's five percent so now well
that<00:05:26.509> is<00:05:26.630> how<00:05:26.750> much<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:28.340> five<00:05:28.550> percent<00:05:28.849> is<00:05:28.969> one

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
that is how much the five percent is one

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.180 
that is how much the five percent is one
of<00:05:29.210> these<00:05:29.360> 700<00:05:30.050> which<00:05:30.440> was<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.710> puppet<00:05:30.889> and

one<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:31.520> worth<00:05:31.639> 35<00:05:32.029> so<00:05:32.630> it's<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.900> puffer

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
one is that worth 35 so it's the puffer

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.920 
one is that worth 35 so it's the puffer
per<00:05:33.529> play<00:05:33.800> up<00:05:33.979> that<00:05:34.159> including<00:05:35.029> tax<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:35.779> that
