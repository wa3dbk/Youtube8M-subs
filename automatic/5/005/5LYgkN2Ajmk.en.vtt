00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that was it was a fight more terrible

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.230 
that was it was a fight more terrible

what<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.900> getting<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.210> people

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
what I'm getting at here is that people

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.490 
what I'm getting at here is that people
used<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.960> terrified<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:20.030> artists<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.500> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
used to be terrified of artists and I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.899 
used to be terrified of artists and I
personally<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.630> good<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.909> we

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
personally think it would be good if we

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520 
personally think it would be good if we
brought<00:01:27.360> back<00:01:27.630> those<00:01:27.869> times

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
brought back those times

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.160 
brought back those times
well<00:01:29.070> no<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.840> would<00:01:31.020> mean

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
well no not just because that would mean

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.710 
well no not just because that would mean
that<00:01:31.229> always<00:01:31.829> worshipped<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> god

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.850 

mainly<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:37.860> artists<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:39.650> they'd<00:01:40.650> have

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
mainly because artists would they'd have

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.819 
mainly because artists would they'd have
a<00:01:40.890> better<00:01:41.130> self-image<00:01:42.259> they<00:01:43.259> wouldn't<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
a better self-image they wouldn't just

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.200 
a better self-image they wouldn't just
feel<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:45.270> were<00:01:45.329> lucky<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.590> work

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
feel that they were lucky to be in work

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
feel that they were lucky to be in work
they<00:01:48.210> wouldn't<00:01:48.840> grovel<00:01:49.619> before<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.759> people

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
they wouldn't grovel before the people

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.710 
they wouldn't grovel before the people
who<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.659> paying<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.320> money<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.509> refused<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
who are paying the money and refused to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.679 
who are paying the money and refused to
ever<00:01:55.140> make<00:01:56.070> any<00:01:56.280> kind<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.759> stand<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.360> oh

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
ever make any kind of stand because oh

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.480 
ever make any kind of stand because oh
well<00:01:57.930> I've<00:01:58.170> got<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> family<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.950> support<00:01:58.979> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
well I've got a family to support I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.450 
well I've got a family to support I
don't<00:01:59.729> want<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> lose<00:02:00.119> my<00:02:00.299> job<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:01.460> artists

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
don't want to lose my job if artists

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.760 
don't want to lose my job if artists
actually<00:02:03.000> remembered<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.049> power<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.590> they

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
actually remembered the power that they

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
actually remembered the power that they
used<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:06.020> then<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:09.030> they

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
used to have then I think that if they

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
used to have then I think that if they
treated<00:02:10.280> their<00:02:11.280> art<00:02:11.610> as

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
treated their art as

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.400 
treated their art as
if<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:12.770> world<00:02:13.160> magic<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.900> don't<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.290> to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
if it's world magic you don't have to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.850 
if it's world magic you don't have to
believe<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.310> magic<00:02:16.760> actually<00:02:16.970> exists<00:02:17.900> if

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
believe that magic actually exists if

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700 
believe that magic actually exists if
they<00:02:19.160> treated<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.850> as<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.480> were<00:02:20.780> magic<00:02:21.500> if

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
they treated it as if it were magic if

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.320 
they treated it as if it were magic if
they<00:02:22.700> gave<00:02:23.330> their<00:02:23.780> creativity<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.760> respect

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
they gave their creativity the respect

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.430 
they gave their creativity the respect
that<00:02:26.900> they<00:02:27.140> would<00:02:27.410> give<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.250> God<00:02:29.560> then<00:02:31.030> sorry

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that they would give and God then sorry

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.210 
that they would give and God then sorry
even<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.500> plumber

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
even a plumber

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.320 
even a plumber
yeah<00:02:34.670> then<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.990> think<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.800> they<00:02:37.010> would<00:02:37.330> that

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
yeah then I think that they would that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.150 
yeah then I think that they would that
would<00:02:38.540> make<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.290> would<00:02:39.470> solve<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.830> lot<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:39.980> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
would make it would solve a lot of the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.970
