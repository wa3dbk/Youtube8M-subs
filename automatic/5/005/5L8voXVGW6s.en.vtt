00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
with this hydroponic giant pumpkin why

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.740 
with this hydroponic giant pumpkin why
don't<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.250> take<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.519> look<00:00:11.790> see<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:12.599> it's

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
so as you can see I haven't killed this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.970

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
I've gotten a lot of growth out of it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.360 
I've gotten a lot of growth out of it
over<00:00:44.570> just<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.809> past<00:00:44.840> week<00:00:45.200> there's<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.160> couple

weeks there where it's been nothing but
rain<00:00:48.110> clouded<00:00:49.010> skies<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.030> now<00:00:50.180> that<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.449> Sun

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
rain clouded skies but now that the Sun

rain clouded skies but now that the Sun
is<00:00:50.810> out<00:00:50.930> this<00:00:51.200> thing's<00:00:51.470> really<00:00:51.800> taken<00:00:52.250> off

I've<00:00:53.840> had<00:00:54.050> some<00:00:54.410> concern<00:00:54.890> with<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.130> bit<00:00:55.340> of

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
I've had some concern with a bit of

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.950 
I've had some concern with a bit of
yellowing<00:00:55.910> that's<00:00:56.090> been<00:00:56.270> happening<00:00:56.420> along

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
yellowing that's been happening along

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.350 
yellowing that's been happening along
the<00:00:57.260> leaf<00:00:57.470> just<00:00:57.860> yellowing<00:00:58.790> more<00:00:58.970> along<00:00:59.210> the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
the leaf just yellowing more along the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.900 
the leaf just yellowing more along the
veins<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.840> leaf<00:01:00.079> not<00:01:00.980> too<00:01:01.160> sure<00:01:01.340> if<00:01:01.370> that

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
veins of the leaf not too sure if that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.610 
veins of the leaf not too sure if that
was<00:01:02.030> from<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.480> pH<00:01:02.720> being<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.110> little<00:01:03.320> bit<00:01:03.440> high

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
was from the pH being a little bit high

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.249 
was from the pH being a little bit high
at<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.920> start<00:01:04.220> maybe<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:05.420> over<00:01:05.600> watering<00:01:06.170> I

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
at the start maybe it's over watering I

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.810 
at the start maybe it's over watering I
don't<00:01:06.440> think<00:01:06.710> it's<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.950> pest<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:07.399> if<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:07.700> guys

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
don't think it's a pest but if you guys

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.270 
don't think it's a pest but if you guys
have<00:01:08.090> any<00:01:08.240> ideas<00:01:08.630> on<00:01:08.810> what<00:01:09.080> that's<00:01:09.649> about<00:01:09.830> and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
have any ideas on what that's about and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.950 
have any ideas on what that's about and
if<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.390> can<00:01:11.540> correct<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:12.020> please<00:01:12.950> let<00:01:13.160> me<00:01:13.220> know

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
if I can correct it please let me know

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.030 
if I can correct it please let me know
one<00:01:14.960> of<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.110> most<00:01:15.200> exciting<00:01:15.740> things<00:01:15.920> that's

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
one of the most exciting things that's

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.560 
one of the most exciting things that's
been<00:01:16.280> going<00:01:16.490> on<00:01:16.610> with<00:01:16.729> this<00:01:16.850> plant<00:01:17.149> isn't

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
been going on with this plant isn't

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.300 
been going on with this plant isn't
what's<00:01:17.720> going<00:01:17.960> on<00:01:18.080> at<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.350> top<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:19.100> what's

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
what's going on at the top but what's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.280 
what's going on at the top but what's
going<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:19.700> underneath<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.660> that's<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.020> roots

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
going on underneath and that's the roots

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.620 
going on underneath and that's the roots
not<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.009> lot<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.310> roots<00:01:22.610> put<00:01:22.850> some<00:01:23.030> really<00:01:23.300> long

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
not a lot of roots put some really long

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.300 
not a lot of roots put some really long
roots<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.259> are<00:01:24.319> coming<00:01:24.500> off<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.800> this<00:01:25.009> thing

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
roots that are coming off of this thing

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:35.710 
roots that are coming off of this thing
take<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:25.940> look

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.750 

I've<00:01:36.720> also<00:01:36.990> started<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> process<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
I've also started the process of

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.080 
I've also started the process of
preparing<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.660> soil<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.230> for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.550> vine<00:01:41.820> when

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
preparing a soil a bit for the vine when

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.550 
preparing a soil a bit for the vine when
it<00:01:42.180> grows<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.290> get

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it grows out I can actually get

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.280 
it grows out I can actually get
secondary<00:01:44.160> roots<00:01:44.490> growing<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.480> this<00:01:45.660> plant<00:01:45.990> if

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
secondary roots growing on this plant if

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.370 
secondary roots growing on this plant if
I<00:01:46.440> bury<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.980> vine<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.490> soil<00:01:47.870> so<00:01:48.870> I<00:01:48.900> just<00:01:49.170> threw

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I bury the vine and soil so I just threw

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.810 
I bury the vine and soil so I just threw
on<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.980> bit<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:51.200> manure<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.820> some

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
on a bit of manure on there some

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.120 
on a bit of manure on there some
eggshells<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.420> had<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.260> lot<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.770> soil<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
eggshells I had not a lot this soil is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.940 
eggshells I had not a lot this soil is
pretty<00:01:56.370> fertile<00:01:56.580> itself<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.930> went<00:01:58.860> ahead

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
pretty fertile itself so I went ahead

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.780 
pretty fertile itself so I went ahead
and<00:01:59.220> wrote<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.670> tilled<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.790> hoping

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and wrote or tilled all that in hoping

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.020 
and wrote or tilled all that in hoping
that<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.540> plants<00:02:03.870> gonna<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.230> that<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.190> just

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that the plants gonna like that so just

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
that the plants gonna like that so just
waiting<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> grow<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.229> once<00:02:08.130> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
waiting it for it to grow out once it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.240 
waiting it for it to grow out once it
grows<00:02:08.490> out<00:02:08.670> bury<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.510> vines<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.250> hopefully

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
grows out bury the vines and hopefully

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.280 
grows out bury the vines and hopefully
get<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> bit<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:11.970> growth<00:02:12.600> out<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.080> thing

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
get a bit more growth out of this thing

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.470 
get a bit more growth out of this thing
than<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> should<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.980> realized<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.300> not<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
than I should I realized then it's not a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.330 
than I should I realized then it's not a
hundred<00:02:15.750> percent<00:02:15.870> hydroponic<00:02:16.800> as<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.040> will<00:02:17.190> be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
hundred percent hydroponic as I will be

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.970 
hundred percent hydroponic as I will be
using<00:02:17.700> soil<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:19.200> kind<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.440> boost<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.890> growth

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
using soil to kind of boost the growth

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.550 
using soil to kind of boost the growth
of<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.340> plant<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> want<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> try<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> get

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
of this plant but I want to try to get

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.860 
of this plant but I want to try to get
something<00:02:22.920> big<00:02:23.100> going<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.480> that's<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:24.840> I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
something big going here so that's all I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.570 
something big going here so that's all I
really<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.440> update<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.310> far

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
really have to update you with so far

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.610 
really have to update you with so far
I'm<00:02:27.000> slowly<00:02:27.360> increasing<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> concentration

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
I'm slowly increasing the concentration

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.660 
I'm slowly increasing the concentration
of<00:02:29.459> nutrient<00:02:30.120> for<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.480> plant<00:02:31.550> seeing<00:02:32.550> how

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
of nutrient for this plant seeing how

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.390 
of nutrient for this plant seeing how
much<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.209> get<00:02:33.360> away<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.680> aside<00:02:35.340> from

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
much I can get away with but aside from

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.970 
much I can get away with but aside from
that<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:36.090> looking<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.320> doing<00:02:37.500> fairly

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that it's looking like it's doing fairly

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.340 
that it's looking like it's doing fairly
well<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:39.090> I'll<00:02:39.300> keep<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.480> guys<00:02:39.570> posted<00:02:39.720> when

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
well so I'll keep you guys posted when

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990 
well so I'll keep you guys posted when
we<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.590> some<00:02:40.739> more<00:02:40.830> changes<00:02:41.250> here<00:02:41.520> and

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
we get some more changes here and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.640 
we get some more changes here and
hopefully<00:02:42.360> we'll<00:02:42.660> see<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.900> plant<00:02:43.200> growing<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
hopefully we'll see this plant growing a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.309 
hopefully we'll see this plant growing a
lot<00:02:43.860> more<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.370> next<00:02:44.489> time<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.060> thanks
