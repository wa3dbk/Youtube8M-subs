Bluehost and Hostgator is those are the
two<00:00:56.730> best<00:00:57.390> companies<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.020> experienced<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.710> now

two services and then make a selection
on<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.680> best<00:01:04.920> but

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
on which one I think it's best but

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
on which one I think it's best but
honestly<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.450> experience<00:01:07.200> I've<00:01:07.320> had<00:01:07.350> with

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
honestly the experience I've had with

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
honestly the experience I've had with
both<00:01:07.920> both<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> companies<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.510> been<00:01:09.869> very

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
both both of the companies has been very

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
both both of the companies has been very
good<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.270> go<00:01:12.420> wrong

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
good so I don't think you can go wrong

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.550 
good so I don't think you can go wrong
either<00:01:12.689> way<00:01:15.080> first<00:01:16.080> we're<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> take<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
either way first we're going to take a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
either way first we're going to take a
look<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:16.860> pricing<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.759> from<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.090> pricing

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
look at pricing and from a pricing

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
look at pricing and from a pricing
perspective<00:01:19.049> Hostgator<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
perspective Hostgator I think it's a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
perspective Hostgator I think it's a
little<00:01:20.369> bit<00:01:20.549> better<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.049> has<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
little bit better just because it has a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
little bit better just because it has a
monthly<00:01:22.860> pricing<00:01:23.100> option<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.360> monthly

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
monthly pricing option so the monthly

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.210 
monthly pricing option so the monthly
pricing<00:01:24.900> option<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.950> bit<00:01:26.070> more

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
pricing option is a little bit more

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.370 
pricing option is a little bit more
expensive<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.939> there's<00:01:27.479> discounts<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.229> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
expensive and there's discounts as you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
expensive and there's discounts as you
can<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.700> discounts<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.659> sign<00:01:30.869> up

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
can see this discounts when you sign up

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.010 
can see this discounts when you sign up
for<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.950> year<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.250> two<00:01:32.579> year<00:01:32.790> plans<00:01:33.119> but

Hostgator officers a little bit better

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.010 
Hostgator officers a little bit better
than<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.000> price<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> you're<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> get

WordPress<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.769> think<00:03:37.430> one<00:03:37.639> of<00:03:37.669> the<00:03:38.239> things<00:03:38.269> that

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
WordPress I think one of the things that

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.119 
WordPress I think one of the things that
I<00:03:38.900> kind<00:03:39.139> of<00:03:39.229> look<00:03:39.379> for<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.859> um<00:03:41.620> how<00:03:42.620> easy<00:03:42.889> they

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
I kind of look for is um how easy they

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.830 
I kind of look for is um how easy they
make<00:03:43.280> their<00:03:43.430> control<00:03:43.790> panels<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.299> use<00:03:44.540> and

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
make their control panels to use and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.929 
make their control panels to use and
this<00:03:45.199> is<00:03:45.319> why<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:45.949> is<00:03:46.370> one<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.699> things

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 
this is why this is one of the things

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.289 
this is why this is one of the things
that<00:03:47.030> I've<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.599> choosing<00:03:48.489> chosen<00:03:49.489> Bluehost

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
that I've to choosing chosen Bluehost

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.849 
that I've to choosing chosen Bluehost
and<00:03:50.509> Hostgator<00:03:50.900> because<00:03:51.259> their<00:03:51.500> control

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
and Hostgator because their control

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.159 
and Hostgator because their control
panel<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.370> much<00:03:52.849> more<00:03:53.030> intuitive<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.840> easy<00:03:54.049> to

you'll<00:05:19.850> see<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.330> then<00:05:20.450> it's<00:05:20.720> not<00:05:20.780> in<00:05:21.020> the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
you'll see it and then it's not in the

bluehost blue bar you'll see they also
have<00:05:25.100> a<00:05:25.160> knowledge<00:05:25.400> base<00:05:25.790> which<00:05:26.390> both<00:05:26.630> of

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
have a knowledge base which both of

these have a knowledge base you know

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.930 
these have a knowledge base you know
which<00:05:29.990> is<00:05:30.110> basically<00:05:30.380> like<00:05:30.470> a<00:05:30.560> wiki<00:05:31.010> type

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
which is basically like a wiki type

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.480 
which is basically like a wiki type

up some of the frequently asked
questions<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:37.190> lot<00:05:37.220> of<00:05:37.400> times<00:05:37.670> can<00:05:37.850> find

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
questions and a lot of times can find

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.280 
questions and a lot of times can find
solutions<00:05:38.540> to<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.750> problems<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:39.110> you're

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
solutions to the problems that you're

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.140 
solutions to the problems that you're
having<00:05:39.350> which<00:05:39.740> saves<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.130> lot<00:05:40.250> of<00:05:40.310> time<00:05:40.460> you

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
having which saves a lot of time you

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.900 
having which saves a lot of time you
don't<00:05:41.330> have<00:05:41.450> to<00:05:41.600> go<00:05:41.720> through<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.110> support

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
don't have to go through the support

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.780 
don't have to go through the support
process<00:05:43.910> of<00:05:44.030> contacting<00:05:44.270> somebody<00:05:44.990> at<00:05:45.230> the

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
process of contacting somebody at the

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.670 
process of contacting somebody at the
hosting<00:05:46.790> company<00:05:46.940> so<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.930> knowledge<00:05:48.290> base<00:05:48.440> is

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
hosting company so the knowledge base is

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.650 
hosting company so the knowledge base is
very<00:05:48.710> important<00:05:49.280> in<00:05:49.370> theirs<00:05:49.550> is<00:05:49.790> developed

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
very important in theirs is developed

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.140 
very important in theirs is developed
very<00:05:50.960> well<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:51.560> if<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:52.310> know<00:05:52.400> very<00:05:52.790> thorough

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
very well and if you know very thorough

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.730 
very well and if you know very thorough
so<00:05:53.480> it<00:05:53.570> covers<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:53.930> lot<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.110> things<00:05:54.350> and<00:05:54.590> let's

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
so it covers a lot of things and let's

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.680 
so it covers a lot of things and let's
go<00:05:54.860> for<00:05:55.040> them<00:05:55.220> because<00:05:55.430> they<00:05:56.180> really<00:05:56.480> want<00:05:56.630> to

actually<00:06:12.170> that's<00:06:12.440> my<00:06:12.650> last<00:06:12.950> slide<00:06:13.130> but<00:06:13.810> when

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
actually that's my last slide but when

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.150 
actually that's my last slide but when
it<00:06:14.900> comes<00:06:15.080> down<00:06:15.140> to<00:06:15.260> it<00:06:15.500> like<00:06:15.590> I<00:06:15.680> said<00:06:15.890> both

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
it comes down to it like I said both

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.570 
it comes down to it like I said both
solutions<00:06:16.640> are<00:06:17.290> very<00:06:18.290> good<00:06:18.500> solutions<00:06:18.950> the

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
solutions are very good solutions the

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.880 
solutions are very good solutions the
answer<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.090> best<00:06:20.390> one<00:06:20.960> that<00:06:20.990> I<00:06:21.230> found<00:06:21.590> and

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
answer the best one that I found and

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.820 
answer the best one that I found and
works<00:06:22.070> best<00:06:22.310> for<00:06:22.550> me<00:06:22.580> is<00:06:22.730> Bluehost<00:06:23.450> is<00:06:24.410> not<00:06:24.800> a

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
works best for me is Bluehost is not a

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.380 
works best for me is Bluehost is not a
huge<00:06:25.130> differentiating<00:06:25.790> factor<00:06:26.150> from

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
huge differentiating factor from

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.800 
huge differentiating factor from
Hostgator<00:06:26.870> but<00:06:27.680> I<00:06:27.950> think<00:06:28.460> that<00:06:28.580> even<00:06:29.480> though

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
Hostgator but I think that even though

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.390 
Hostgator but I think that even though
it's<00:06:29.990> a<00:06:30.050> couple<00:06:30.260> of<00:06:30.350> bucks<00:06:30.530> more<00:06:30.770> is<00:06:30.980> just<00:06:31.010> then

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
it's a couple of bucks more is just then

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.700 
it's a couple of bucks more is just then
a<00:06:31.640> lot<00:06:32.120> more<00:06:32.300> reliable<00:06:32.930> I've<00:06:33.230> like<00:06:33.590> the

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
a lot more reliable I've like the

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.220 
a lot more reliable I've like the
response<00:06:34.130> time<00:06:34.460> from<00:06:34.850> their<00:06:35.180> support<00:06:35.720> when

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
response time from their support when

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.960 
response time from their support when
I've<00:06:36.350> had<00:06:36.560> to<00:06:36.740> reach<00:06:36.980> out<00:06:37.160> and<00:06:37.310> contact<00:06:37.460> them

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
I've had to reach out and contact them

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.740 
I've had to reach out and contact them
and<00:06:38.240> overall<00:06:39.140> I<00:06:39.170> just<00:06:39.500> like<00:06:39.920> the<00:06:40.160> up

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
and overall I just like the up

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.370 
and overall I just like the up
time<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.350> the<00:06:42.510> lack<00:06:43.510> of<00:06:43.540> failures<00:06:44.080> that<00:06:44.110> my

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
time and the lack of failures that my

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.530 
time and the lack of failures that my
websites<00:06:44.800> have<00:06:44.980> I<00:06:45.220> probably<00:06:45.490> have<00:06:45.760> over<00:06:46.480> a

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
websites have I probably have over a

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.390 
websites have I probably have over a
dozen<00:06:46.690> websites<00:06:47.140> on<00:06:47.530> each<00:06:47.710> of<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:47.920> host<00:06:48.130> and

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
dozen websites on each of the host and

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.820 
dozen websites on each of the host and
I've<00:06:48.580> had<00:06:48.760> a<00:06:48.790> good<00:06:49.150> experience<00:06:49.390> with<00:06:49.830> Bluehost

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
I've had a good experience with Bluehost

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.700 
I've had a good experience with Bluehost
