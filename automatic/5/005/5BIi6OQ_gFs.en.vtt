00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
over and over in the map is also a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.799

little<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.030> repetitive<00:00:39.239> when<00:00:39.570> you're<00:00:39.690> back

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809

little bit repetitive when you're back
at<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> base<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.290> other<00:00:40.440> than<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.829> think

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
at the base but other than that I think

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.410 
at the base but other than that I think

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
setup for multiplayer in my opinion but

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
setup for multiplayer in my opinion but
then<00:01:33.720> there's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> whole<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.439> base<00:01:34.740> system

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
then there's a whole like base system

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.890 
then there's a whole like base system
now<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> base<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> full<00:01:36.390> range<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.720> ways

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
now the base has a full range of ways

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.630 
now the base has a full range of ways
for<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> customize<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:38.009> strategy
