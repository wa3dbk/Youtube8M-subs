 this video shows the correct procedure for applying our strips 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.249
 adhesive on a porous surface 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.049
 the operation is very simple 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.830
 the surface must be shoot free of grease because it has a temperature 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.410
 greater than 10 degrees centigrade for application on a porous surface 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.930
 as a concrete stone in wood we recommend the use of ours 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.930

 apply the premier with a panel as for the paint on the whole area 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.050
 interested in the quantity necessary to seal the surface the premier acts 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.700
 also by anchoring clinging people improving adherence where necessary 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.330
 the drying time of the prana varies depending on the temperature from a 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.010
 maximum of 10 minutes in moderate temperature conditions to a maximum of 20 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.720
 minutes if the coldest temperature the trainner is ready when it turns out 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.720
 dry to the touch 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.010
 to remove the rear paper cover and press on the surface 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.250
 after 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.720
 sion it is recommended to apply firm and uniform pressure manually 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.090
 boh by means of a special roller supplied by neskens at a modest price 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.340
 hope very busy or with a high probability of rubbing the villages 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.020
 we recommend the use of our adhesive for edges kh 35 0 2 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.770
 consisting of a preparation that helps prevent wrinkles from being damaged 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.220
 the container similar to a toothpaste tube 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.100
 just apply a very small amount along the bottom edge of the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.430
 adhesive strips so that it touches both the adhesive strips and the surface 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.569
 not only a limited quantity is required 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.849
 after application the product dries quickly leaving the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.849
 almost invisible edge protection 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.709
 the material can be walked on immediately after installation 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.680
 will guarantee a very durable and effective non-slip surface
