i'm<00:03:26.469> sort<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.739> using<00:03:27.129> this<00:03:27.219> as<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.790> co-wash<00:03:28.390> as

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
i'm sort of using this as a co-wash as

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.259 
i'm sort of using this as a co-wash as
well<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.469> i'm<00:03:29.590> using<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.430> multiple<00:03:31.000> ways

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.240 
the water only method and our auntie
thought<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.709> was<00:04:05.799> going<00:04:05.889> to<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:06.069> something

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
thought it was going to be something

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.610 
thought it was going to be something
that<00:04:06.430> loose<00:04:07.030> or<00:04:07.180> texture<00:04:07.540> not<00:04:07.719> true<00:04:07.930> naturals

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
that loose or texture not true naturals

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.250 
that loose or texture not true naturals
were<00:04:08.709> doing<00:04:09.010> but<00:04:09.389> surprisingly<00:04:10.389> i<00:04:10.480> managed<00:04:11.230> to

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
find a lot of 4c naturals so that's what

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.749 
find a lot of 4c naturals so that's what
I'm<00:04:16.030> doing<00:04:16.060> with<00:04:16.449> my<00:04:16.509> hair<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.609> thanks<00:04:18.609> for
