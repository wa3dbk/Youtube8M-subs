00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.249 

that's<00:02:00.539> from<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.970> original<00:02:03.140> one<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that's from the original one of the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.750 
that's from the original one of the
early<00:02:04.530> launch<00:02:04.740> batches<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.640> got<00:02:06.179> that<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:07.819> early

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
early launch batches I got that in early

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.220 
early launch batches I got that in early
in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> early<00:02:12.120> nineties<00:02:12.569> when<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.840> came<00:02:12.989> out<00:02:13.200> I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.470 
in the early nineties when it came out I
think<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.560> was<00:02:13.680> about<00:02:13.970> about<00:02:14.970> six<00:02:15.239> months

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480

think it was about about six months
