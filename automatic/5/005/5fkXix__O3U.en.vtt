00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
oh hey I didn't see you coming in there

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.200 
oh hey I didn't see you coming in there
well<00:00:25.869> yeah<00:00:26.650> no<00:00:26.710> wonder<00:00:27.039> what's<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.579> deepest

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
well yeah no wonder what's the deepest

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.900 
well yeah no wonder what's the deepest
smallest<00:00:28.899> level<00:00:29.169> of<00:00:29.410> living<00:00:29.769> things<00:00:30.009> they're

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the next cell on our list is muscle

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.940 
the next cell on our list is muscle
cells<00:01:58.310> they<00:01:59.150> go<00:01:59.330> from<00:01:59.540> long<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.050> skinny<00:02:00.230> short

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
cells they go from long and skinny short

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.690 
cells they go from long and skinny short
vet<00:02:02.020> muscle<00:02:03.020> snow<00:02:03.170> has<00:02:03.440> lots<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.890> mitochondria

vet muscle snow has lots of mitochondria

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.020 
vet muscle snow has lots of mitochondria
so<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.330> will<00:02:05.570> get<00:02:05.780> tired<00:02:06.110> fast<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.580> too<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:07.910> has

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
so it will get tired fast and too it has

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:31.350 
so it will get tired fast and too it has
a<00:02:08.060> lot<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.330> energy

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.150 

the<00:02:32.360> nerve<00:02:32.569> cell<00:02:32.930> has<00:02:33.380> very<00:02:33.650> long<00:02:33.920> and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
the nerve cell has very long and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.010 
the nerve cell has very long and
branching<00:02:34.550> arms<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.120> transports<00:02:35.930> and

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
branching arms and transports and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.080 
branching arms and transports and
messages<00:02:36.500> across<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.010> body<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.910> body

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
messages across the body so the body

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:48.850 
messages across the body so the body
knows<00:02:38.330> what<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.569> do<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.930> nerve<00:02:48.140> cell<00:02:48.440> was<00:02:48.590> very

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
knows what to do the nerve cell was very

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.620 
knows what to do the nerve cell was very
large<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.340> has<00:02:49.459> lots<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.910> long<00:02:50.150> branching

arms that way the message doesn't have

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.850 
arms that way the message doesn't have
to<00:02:53.209> go<00:02:53.300> through<00:02:53.540> many<00:02:53.750> nerve<00:02:53.959> cells<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.590> get<00:02:54.709> to
