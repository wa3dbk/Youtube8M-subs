00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
one brain but it's divided into two

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.309 
one brain but it's divided into two
hemispheres<00:02:28.709> are<00:02:29.430> right<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.720> left<00:02:33.319> there

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
hemispheres are right and the left there

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.729 
hemispheres are right and the left there
are<00:02:34.349> two<00:02:34.739> large<00:02:35.220> cords<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.150> nerve<00:02:36.450> fibers<00:02:36.739> that

are two large cords of nerve fibers that

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.400 
are two large cords of nerve fibers that
go<00:02:37.980> through<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.370> spine<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.360> they<00:02:39.989> are<00:02:40.079> where

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
go through your spine and they are where

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.400 
go through your spine and they are where
the<00:02:41.310> brain<00:02:41.579> sends<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.360> receives<00:02:42.390> messages

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.819 

research<00:03:15.150> has<00:03:15.389> shown<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.750> different<00:03:16.530> parts

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
research has shown that different parts

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.979 
research has shown that different parts
of<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.040> brain<00:03:17.310> have<00:03:17.760> different<00:03:18.209> jobs<00:03:18.480> for<00:03:18.840> us

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
of the brain have different jobs for us

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.470 
of the brain have different jobs for us
so<00:03:19.709> we've<00:03:19.920> mapped<00:03:20.250> our<00:03:20.579> different<00:03:21.060> areas<00:03:21.450> of
