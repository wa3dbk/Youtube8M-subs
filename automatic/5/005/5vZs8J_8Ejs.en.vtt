00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.779
 Today I will tell you about the story of a 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:08.500
 woman who was more than 40 years old 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:11.110
 living with a capuchin monkey let's say 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.929
 who treated him as he treated his son 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.090
 he wanted and they loved each other 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.510
 that the Brazilian authorities decided 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.760
 take this woman the monkey say 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.680
 who discovered that this woman was 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.439
 living with a monkey and that there is 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.560
 illegal monkeys you have to take them to the 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.670
 nature reserve the woman is called the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.280
 isset farias carmona owner 71 years 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.270
 I already had, as I said before, 40 years with 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.360
 this animal had a bed the fed 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.820
 with milk and fruits I had attention for 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.920
 part of the whole town and when the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.340
 authorities took this monkey to 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.170
 this capuchin monkey because all the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.230
 population manifested thousands of 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.140
 inhabitants sent their complaint so that the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.570
 Monkey returned with his former owner 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.360
 The truth is that it does not make any sense 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.790
 for being or going back to this mode 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.330
 its natural habitat after carrying 40 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.250
 years with a family, that is, 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.280
 it was good to do it the first year but 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.240
 already 40 years old if this monkey is worn 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.520
 to any place 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.159
 will not be able to survive and in 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.750
 second place because it will not fall on 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.360
 a deep depression that is going to 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.790
 stop eating and do anything 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.700
 because we should not forget that the monkeys 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.289
 they are very intelligent beings in fact it is 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.350
 the smartest thing on the planet 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.420
 land next to the human being and like 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.929
 that we, as they catch affection, take 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.360
 love your family members well 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.850
 that right now this capuchin monkey 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.100
 will be tremendously sad for his 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.560
 loss will hopefully return it to 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.890
 its legitimate owner and let's also hope 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.679
 that justice be done, do not take the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.619
 justice because it is not fair to remove a 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.030
 mascot who has been poor for 40 years 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.130
 old woman 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.979
 without any problem if the town has 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.560
 accepted and if the woman comes well I do not see 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.930
 reason to do this bitch to a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.640
 This person is proof that the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.220
 animals many times if they are 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.840
 domesticated by the human being 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.120
 they can become happy they can 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.830
 get to lead a life can reach 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.800
 lead a life similar to that of a being 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.590
 human with a bed with the chair 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.780
 eating a chair or is it amazing 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.780
 what this old woman did with her monkey
