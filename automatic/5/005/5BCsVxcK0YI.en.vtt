00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
like the gravitation to body rock is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.640 
like the gravitation to body rock is

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
because it's very new to Austin but the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.530 
because it's very new to Austin but the
new<00:02:03.890> influx<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.580> people<00:02:04.790> that<00:02:05.090> are<00:02:05.210> coming<00:02:05.330> to

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
Austin are looking for this also because

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.330 
Austin are looking for this also because
