to<00:02:43.810> show<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:43.959> some<00:02:44.079> issues<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.409> had<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.620> this

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
to show you some issues I had with this

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.949 
to show you some issues I had with this
the<00:02:45.430> style<00:02:45.670> case<00:02:45.849> so<00:02:46.090> obviously<00:02:46.599> basically

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
the style case so obviously basically

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.360 
the style case so obviously basically
way<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.109> just<00:02:47.290> do<00:02:47.409> is<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.739> slide<00:02:48.040> your<00:02:48.069> phone

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
way you just do is just slide your phone

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.970 
way you just do is just slide your phone
into<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.849> like<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:49.510> okay<00:02:49.930> you're<00:02:50.829> starting

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
into it like so okay you're starting

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.410 
into it like so okay you're starting
from<00:02:51.189> so<00:02:51.400> then<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.609> holds<00:02:51.879> your<00:02:52.000> funnel<00:02:52.239> place

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
from so then it holds your funnel place

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.390 
from so then it holds your funnel place
and<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.260> while<00:02:53.469> it's<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.709> there<00:02:53.889> you<00:02:54.040> basically

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
and so while it's in there you basically

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.970 
and so while it's in there you basically
have<00:02:54.669> a<00:02:54.730> ear<00:02:55.419> days<00:02:55.719> accessibly<00:02:56.379> if<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.709> switch

scanned<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:11.709> let's<00:03:11.980> have<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.159> accessible<00:03:12.639> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
scanned so let's have it accessible and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.189 
scanned so let's have it accessible and
the<00:03:13.239> one<00:03:13.359> issue<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.569> have<00:03:13.780> with<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.049> I

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199 
the one issue I have with this is I

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.629 
the one issue I have with this is I
think<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.680> they<00:03:14.859> could<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.189> they<00:03:15.430> could've

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
think that they could do they could've

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.550 
think that they could do they could've
done<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.790> better<00:03:15.819> job<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.329> maybe<00:03:16.750> because<00:03:17.199> you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
done a better job of maybe because you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.080 
done a better job of maybe because you
can<00:03:17.680> tell<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:17.949> it's<00:03:18.129> pinched<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.730> little<00:03:18.969> bit

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
can tell you it's pinched a little bit

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.369 
can tell you it's pinched a little bit
the<00:03:19.180> way<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.389> leathers<00:03:19.629> I<00:03:19.870> gets<00:03:20.049> pinched

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
the way the leathers I gets pinched

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.929 
the way the leathers I gets pinched
around<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.769> iphone<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.280> hold<00:03:21.430> in<00:03:21.549> place<00:03:21.730> I

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
around the iphone to hold in place I

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.129 
around the iphone to hold in place I
think<00:03:22.480> they<00:03:22.569> could<00:03:22.719> have<00:03:22.810> done<00:03:22.870> something

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
think they could have done something

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.569 
think they could have done something
different<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.769> keep<00:03:23.949> the<00:03:24.099> iphone<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.400> place

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
different to keep the iphone the place

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.209 
different to keep the iphone the place

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.850 
thing to keep in mind guys wanting to be
aware<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:34.690> would<00:04:34.810> be<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:34.960> really<00:04:35.139> bad

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
aware of that would be a really bad

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.350 
aware of that would be a really bad
it<00:04:35.979> would<00:04:36.219> be<00:04:36.370> really<00:04:36.610> bad<00:04:36.789> if<00:04:36.849> you<00:04:37.060> were<00:04:37.180> using

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
it would be really bad if you were using

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.939 
it would be really bad if you were using
this<00:04:37.569> in<00:04:37.719> your<00:04:37.780> phone<00:04:38.050> fell<00:04:38.259> off<00:04:38.409> and<00:04:38.680> hit<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
this in your phone fell off and hit the

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.679 
this in your phone fell off and hit the
floor<00:04:39.189> because<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.819> wasn't<00:04:40.300> keeping<00:04:40.419> it<00:04:40.629> in

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
floor because it wasn't keeping it in

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.360 
floor because it wasn't keeping it in
there<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.500> like<00:04:41.650> maybe<00:04:41.770> if<00:04:42.069> there<00:04:42.250> was

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
there so like maybe if there was

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.100 
there so like maybe if there was
somewhere<00:04:42.639> for<00:04:42.819> them<00:04:42.909> to<00:04:43.060> make<00:04:43.509> sure<00:04:43.840> that

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
somewhere for them to make sure that

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.529 
somewhere for them to make sure that
either<00:04:44.680> make<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.460> a<00:04:45.520> little<00:04:45.729> bit<00:04:45.879> tighter<00:04:46.120> so

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
either make this a little bit tighter so

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.959 
either make this a little bit tighter so
it's<00:04:46.689> really<00:04:46.930> tight<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.580> holds<00:04:48.699> it<00:04:48.879> in

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
it's really tight but it holds it in

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:50.459 
it's really tight but it holds it in
place<00:04:49.000> or<00:04:49.330> maybe<00:04:49.479> some<00:04:49.719> type<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:49.960> strap<00:04:50.319> or

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:50.469 
place or maybe some type of strap or

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:51.659 
place or maybe some type of strap or
something<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.830> keep<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.099> phone<00:04:51.250> from<00:04:51.370> sliding

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669
