want to but just the smallest bit and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.360 
want to but just the smallest bit and
then<00:02:44.480> what<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.690> do<00:02:45.019> is<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:45.739> brush

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
then what you do is you just brush

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.339 
then what you do is you just brush
backwards<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.180> forth<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.989> almost<00:02:48.080> like<00:02:48.260> a

take a light color like a bone or a
cream<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.950> look<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.760> just<00:03:12.790> go<00:03:13.120> straight<00:03:13.420> over

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
cream and look you just go straight over

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.750 
cream and look you just go straight over
the<00:03:13.900> top<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.680> just<00:03:15.010> mutes<00:03:15.490> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the top of it and that just mutes the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.309 
the top of it and that just mutes the
whole<00:03:16.060> thing<00:03:16.480> out<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.569> other<00:03:19.750> thing<00:03:20.110> you

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
whole thing out but the other thing you

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.490 
whole thing out but the other thing you
need<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.530> do<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.850> not<00:03:22.150> actually<00:03:22.810> judge<00:03:23.170> that

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
need to do is to not actually judge that

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.320 
need to do is to not actually judge that
eyeshadow<00:03:23.860> until<00:03:24.340> you've<00:03:24.489> come<00:03:24.730> back<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.239> how

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
eyeshadow until you've come back and how

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.500 
eyeshadow until you've come back and how
to<00:03:25.390> look<00:03:25.660> at<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:26.010> from<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.190> distance<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.850> also

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
to look at it from a distance and also

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.510 
to look at it from a distance and also
clicking<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.230> discard<00:03:29.680> one<00:03:29.950> makes<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.310> big

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
clicking the discard one makes a big

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:44.059 
clicking the discard one makes a big
difference<00:03:30.910> as<00:03:31.090> well

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.309 

so<00:03:44.670> an<00:03:44.790> eyeshadow<00:03:45.180> look<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.840> looks<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.200> little

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
so an eyeshadow look that looks a little

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.379 
so an eyeshadow look that looks a little
bit<00:03:46.590> strong<00:03:47.099> when<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.489> first<00:03:47.760> look<00:03:47.969> at<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.209> in

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
bit strong when you first look at it in

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.709 
bit strong when you first look at it in
the<00:03:48.510> mirror<00:03:48.689> once<00:03:49.439> you've<00:03:49.650> got<00:03:49.859> your<00:03:49.889> lipstick

difference<00:05:06.469> is<00:05:07.159> just<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.789> pop<00:05:08.209> of<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.259> cream

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:09.709
