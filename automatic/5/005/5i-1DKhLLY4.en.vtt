hand now Chris East and went a little

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.410 
hand now Chris East and went a little
bit<00:01:30.100> too<00:01:30.280> much<00:01:30.429> angle<00:01:30.880> there<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.240> had<00:01:31.330> to

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
bit too much angle there and had to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.120 
bit too much angle there and had to
catch<00:01:31.659> it<00:01:31.840> at<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.050> end<00:01:32.200> slowed<00:01:32.560> him<00:01:32.740> right<00:01:32.920> up

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
catch it at the end slowed him right up

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.680 
catch it at the end slowed him right up
let's<00:01:33.580> see<00:01:33.729> if<00:01:33.880> he<00:01:33.970> can<00:01:34.000> improve<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.570> the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
let's see if he can improve on the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.149 
let's see if he can improve on the
second<00:01:34.990> half<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.409> circuit<00:01:35.860> he's<00:01:36.009> got<00:01:36.130> a

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
second half of this circuit he's got a

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.919 
second half of this circuit he's got a
pretty<00:01:36.369> big<00:01:36.580> lead<00:01:36.820> coming<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.479> from<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.720> first

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
pretty big lead coming in from the first

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.270 
pretty big lead coming in from the first
leg<00:01:38.229> but<00:01:38.500> he<00:01:38.590> doesn't<00:01:38.800> want<00:01:38.920> throw<00:01:39.069> it<00:01:39.190> away

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280

you'd<00:01:39.880> have<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.119> ignore<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.780> mirrors<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.289> would

then<00:01:45.429> man<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.330> think<00:01:46.600> he<00:01:46.690> starts<00:01:46.960> going<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.170> win

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289

this<00:01:47.409> battle<00:01:47.649> I<00:01:47.830> really<00:01:48.159> do<00:01:48.340> he<00:01:48.520> looked<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.789> lot

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
this battle I really do he looked a lot

this battle I really do he looked a lot
better<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.420> last<00:01:49.630> half<00:01:49.929> but<00:01:50.200> let's<00:01:50.679> have<00:01:50.860> a

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
better to the last half but let's have a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.469 
better to the last half but let's have a
look<00:01:51.069> great<00:01:51.429> drift<00:01:51.759> battle<00:01:51.940> in<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.330> end

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
look great drift battle in the end

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.930 
look great drift battle in the end
though<00:01:52.720> here's<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.770> Toyo<00:01:54.069> replay<00:01:54.670> once<00:01:54.970> more

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
that could be the telling blow there for

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.200 
that could be the telling blow there for
Chris<00:01:57.590> Easton<00:01:57.980> big<00:01:58.220> straighten<00:01:58.700> up<00:01:58.820> there<00:01:59.090> and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
basically lost the drift and that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.160 
basically lost the drift and that
