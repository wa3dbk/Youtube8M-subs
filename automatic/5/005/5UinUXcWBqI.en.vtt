about<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.850> before<00:00:32.910> cobra<00:00:33.480> could<00:00:33.630> show<00:00:33.840> me

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
about it before cobra could show me

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.260 
about it before cobra could show me
online<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.940> didn't<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.000> it'd<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
online and I didn't think it'd be that

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.440 
online and I didn't think it'd be that
responsive<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.190> something<00:00:38.550> else<00:00:38.670> too

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
responsive it was something else too

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
responsive it was something else too
there's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> lot<00:00:40.440> more<00:00:40.469> responsible<00:00:41.040> i<00:00:41.129> thought

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
there's a lot more responsible i thought

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.700 
there's a lot more responsible i thought
of<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> especially<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.000> horn<00:00:42.239> sections<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.530> we

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
of it especially the horn sections so we

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.049 
of it especially the horn sections so we
were<00:00:43.770> able<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> workers<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> mesh

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
were able to get the workers to the mesh

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
were able to get the workers to the mesh
together<00:00:45.350> there's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> lot<00:00:46.590> different<00:00:46.950> than

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
together there's a lot different than

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.580 
together there's a lot different than
trying<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:48.000> sample<00:00:48.300> piano

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
trying to get a sample piano

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.670 
trying to get a sample piano
to<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.340> without<00:00:50.670> foot<00:00:51.570> pedals<00:00:51.990> and<00:00:52.200> mod<00:00:52.350> wheels

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
to do without foot pedals and mod wheels

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.320 
to do without foot pedals and mod wheels
and<00:00:53.130> instead<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.700> stood<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.060> of<00:00:54.240> my

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
and instead I can stood all of my

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.530 
and instead I can stood all of my
fingertips<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.180> different

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
fingertips it's just so so different

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.910 
fingertips it's just so so different
than<00:00:57.630> anything<00:00:57.750> I've<00:00:58.050> ever<00:00:58.140> experienced<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
than anything I've ever experienced and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.710 
than anything I've ever experienced and
especially<00:00:59.220> because<00:00:59.760> there's<00:01:00.120> such<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
especially because there's such a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.930 
especially because there's such a
response<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> biggest

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
response I think that's the biggest

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
response I think that's the biggest
thing<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.809> name<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.050> Jessie<00:01:04.379> Fisher<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:05.070> the

in<00:01:08.860> New<00:01:09.040> York<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.760> actually<00:01:10.090> opens<00:01:10.390> up<00:01:10.510> totally

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
in New York it actually opens up totally

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.530 
in New York it actually opens up totally
new<00:01:11.350> window<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:12.070> would<00:01:12.760> want<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:13.270> create

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
new window I would want to create

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.240 
new window I would want to create
something<00:01:13.630> specially<00:01:14.380> for<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.680> instrument

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
something specially for this instrument

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.160 
something specially for this instrument
and<00:01:15.460> actually<00:01:15.700> maybe<00:01:15.850> programs<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.660> new<00:01:16.780> sounds

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and actually maybe programs a new sounds

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.530 
and actually maybe programs a new sounds
work<00:01:17.410> it's<00:01:18.190> different<00:01:18.370> from<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.850> piano<00:01:19.270> or<00:01:19.420> a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
work it's different from a piano or a

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.780 
work it's different from a piano or a
clavinet<00:01:20.020> because<00:01:20.470> those<00:01:21.190> instruments<00:01:21.610> have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
clavinet because those instruments have

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.120 
clavinet because those instruments have
an<00:01:21.940> attack<00:01:22.240> whereas<00:01:22.960> this<00:01:23.110> one<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:24.100> can

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
an attack whereas this one you can

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.370 
an attack whereas this one you can
modify<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.820> attack<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.360> can<00:01:25.540> swell<00:01:25.930> into<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
modify the attack you can swell into the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.060 
modify the attack you can swell into the
know

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
know

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.490 
know
you<00:01:27.580> can<00:01:27.820> kind<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.210> let<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.420> note<00:01:28.690> breathe<00:01:29.050> and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
you can kind of let the note breathe and

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.370 
you can kind of let the note breathe and
and<00:01:30.040> it's<00:01:30.250> almost<00:01:30.370> more<00:01:30.700> like<00:01:30.909> a<00:01:31.030> choir<00:01:31.510> like

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
and it's almost more like a choir like

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.680 
and it's almost more like a choir like
more<00:01:32.650> vocal<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.060> might<00:01:34.240> want<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.570> do

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
more vocal so I might want to do

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.920 
more vocal so I might want to do
