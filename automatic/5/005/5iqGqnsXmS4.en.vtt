00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.639 
kind of stupid if I burn pretty long as
well<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.869> pretty<00:02:00.990> much<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.409> whole

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
well this is pretty much like a whole

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
face turn and then I thought they would

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300

personally<00:02:07.320> bring<00:02:07.469> Christian<00:02:07.890> back<00:02:08.099> but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
personally bring Christian back but

since they aren't Brooklyn it's might as

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.020 
since they aren't Brooklyn it's might as
