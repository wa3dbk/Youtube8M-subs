00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hey people and welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.060
 video thanks the turn on my name 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.980
 is mad and today i want to show you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 how to handle the new fendt in the bow 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.610
 fine stand can unlock 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 to do that as fast as possible 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.389
 I have prepared my list here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.609
 and indeed you need all the windows 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.800
 tasks that means every player there 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.930
 wants to take down and not during 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.900
 the elevator ride to be killed 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.760
 Who wants all the fans you can 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.199
 at battlelog or in the game 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.090
 look console directly 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.130
 It takes a bit but if you have it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.380
 then you have the first requirement 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.450
 you also need one of the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.790
 four new jobs one on the new 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.770
 Final stand cards can be found by chance 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 in the description here from the video have 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.700
 I also have a link to the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.590
 locations that is not easy 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.329
 just want to run around aimlessly through the area 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.120
 you can look into the description 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.469
 and based on this one clues 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.210
 help a little bit further 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.879
 You also need at least four 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 All four players have to play together 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.539
 new dock tags are present that is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.820
 it can not be that much now 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.129
 You really need something like that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.439
 every card so to speak active in the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.630
 Lift every player needs as well 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.070
 before the phantom camouflage starts 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.170
 his weapon and the soldier 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.049
 if you have it all that means that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.210
 fans of the seed the 49 dog tags and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 In addition, the teeth on his weapon 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.520
 and the soldier then off to the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.259
 lift down in hangar at hangar 21 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.729
 Once there, you just have to 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.280
 You can see the light coming on 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.790
 press the button and off you go 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.560
 below 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 the stupid thing is that you are here now 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 not quite finished because you need 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.950
 still the access code for this great 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.360
 building here you have the plasma 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.579
 shield or what that should be and who 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.439
 Code you need it for now 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.540
 only one person has to go in, that is to say 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.960
 one of you four gives the whole code 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.430
 on 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.259
 The coach is also on here again 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.329
 screen and of course in the description 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.649
 yes and if the code is correct then 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.720
 entered then you hear one more 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.860
 small noise that signals you 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.079
 now that the door opens 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.909
 or the sign just gone 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.920
 is done and that happens too 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.939
 quite fast and then it was in the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 principle already goes one only 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.689
 there and collect the part up and up 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 is already directly indicated that 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.209
 you have unlocked the fans in the bow 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.280
 the whole unlock is gone 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.750
 complicated that must 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.270
 say and of course that's not all 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.010
 grown on my crap I am one 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.660
 many of them have been there somehow 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.069
 finally tried 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.290
 it was then I would say that 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.480
 great cooperation just on reddit 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.800
 There was a lot going on there 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.010
 Information was collected 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.790
 and analyzed and decrypted 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.290
 processed and that was very 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.360
 amazing that you come back here 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.550
 those of the siemens huge tasks 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.050
 they just need a lot of work 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.920
 again the cohesion of the community 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.989
 looks very nice 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.819
 the cohesion for a video is too 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.730
 legally in that case we tie that up 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.090
 package and pack the car here 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.620
 down 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.330
 that means we are here at the end of 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.920
 Thank you for watching and you video 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.120

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.530
 information in the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.390
 description read 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.920
 There are really as many as possible 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.000
 people mentioned here helped 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.130
 and of course all 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.239
 There is also information there 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.580
 to read 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.940
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.940
