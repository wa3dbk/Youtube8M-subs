00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.059
 talking and flash sync 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.700
 on the first on the tendon school yes 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:11.100
 he always risks falling into the classic 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.530
 example of snowfall with flakes of 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.090
 snow that seems to fall from the bottom towards 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.510
 the top the place that from the top to the 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.640
 bass 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.289
 this is a bit I'll show type but it makes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.860
 very well the idea of ​​what happens 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.970
 inside a reflex camera 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.520
 mainly in the municipalities we go to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.680
 to choose the exact moment of both 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.279
 the internal functioning of the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.010
 analog or digital camera 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.470
 with tendon is more or less the same 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.239
 towards the amp generation 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.579
 you must choose the exact moment in which 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.440
 start this very fast impulse 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.750
 electric that will illuminate the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 scene at the time of exposure 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.840
 it is made not only for labor and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.140
 flash but also for the environment 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 this choice has a direct impact 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.440
 now on the final image we see the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.579
 because and above all how to regulate it are 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.579
 cameras available 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 we are in a somewhat complicated situation 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.810
 interior light is poor or is it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 very varied depending on the position 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.520
 in which we find ourselves given that it is provided 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.070
 from farere to tungsten positioned on the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 ceiling and oriented to illuminate areas 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.119
 different of the house in this case 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 probably a shot of flash it 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.670
 we would like to give but the flash shot goes 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.280
 regulated we have a nikon d3000 and two 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.869
 let's go to raise the flash via the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.130
 button placed on the body data 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.659
 machine 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.909
 but we have to tell the car what 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.009
 does that term in terms if only 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.659
 to set the activation of fashion 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.509
 the first on the second curtain 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.520
 clearly flash works on fractions of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.439
 thousandth of a second accordingly 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.150
 moment when it will start flash is a 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.310
 decisive moment within one 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.130
 click that the manual in this case 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.500
 we set at half a second 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 and about f 4 and 5 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 this because we would certainly have anyway 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.250
 of the donkey moved by a bit of the flash 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.380
 to see what the difference is between 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.390
 setting on first or on 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.549
 Depending on the drop down there is so much 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.200
 simple very empirical even if out 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.909
 it doesn't snow since the classic example 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.020
 is that of the falling snowflake 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.330
 from top to bottom 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.490
 low up we can take the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.170
 camera aim at ourselves and 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.110
 go for a very rapid one 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.750
 rotary movement so that we will have 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.810
 the background blurred compared to the first 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.770
 plan in this case the photographer himself 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.580
 absolutely firm because illuminated 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.770
 from the flash flash 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.350
 at this time we have positioned 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.120
 we set the flash to work 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.250
 then the flash on the first curtain 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.930
 will start immediately followed by the display 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.100
 for the long time 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.380
 we try immediately we set fire is 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.950
 just make a quick move 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.450
 rotary and the camera will have snapped 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.660
 launching the first flash of the flash 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.280
 followed by the blur we are going to press the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.550
 flash adjustment button on the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.840
 nikon 3200 car body 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.480
 we choose to activate this time the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.790
 second rendina we carry out the same 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.610
 operation this time we noticed 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.880
 that flash flash in addition to a first 3 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.710
 flash for exposure is launched 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.350
 at the end of the time display 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.540
 along this will cause the presence on the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.850
 frame of blur followed then 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.560
 ending with the flash lock a 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.820
 much more natural movement however more 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.530
 complex to manage precisely because 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.630
 flash does not start immediately at the time of 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.080
 click or simply to the conclusion 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.080
 exposure
