notification on the screen and basically

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.779 
notification on the screen and basically
it's<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.329> installer<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it's just an installer for you know a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.270 
it's just an installer for you know a
non<00:00:45.059> jailbroken<00:00:45.329> device<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.230> mean<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> only

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
non jailbroken device I mean the only

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.650 
non jailbroken device I mean the only
bad<00:00:47.399> part<00:00:47.550> about<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> different

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.510 
bad part about it is in a different
language<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.410> guess<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.370> for

but one day I'm d I'm just testing it
out

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.569 

I<00:02:56.909> was<00:02:57.909> just<00:02:58.030> taking<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.480> little<00:02:58.540> minute<00:03:02.579> of

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
I was just taking a little minute of

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
to download free you know full

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.089 
to download free you know full
applications<00:03:08.019> huh<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.439> think<00:03:11.500> primer<00:03:11.950> is

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
applications huh and I think primer is

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.770 
applications huh and I think primer is
why<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.549> slowing<00:03:12.939> down<00:03:13.150> duty<00:03:13.599> factor

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
why this is slowing down duty factor

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.119 
why this is slowing down duty factor
grab<00:03:14.049> my<00:03:14.140> computer<00:03:14.500> on<00:03:14.739> at<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.069> moment<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:17.129> but
