00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:08.170
 we are going to present this new product of 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.009
 electronic fence is called booster hb and 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 Its function is to improve the power of the 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:19.590
 current from the magnet to the cdi 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.620
 this is to produce a spark of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.160
 greater power 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.380
 It is a device with only three cables 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.730
 has one red 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.050
 that goes to cdi 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 one green that is connected to massa and one 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.920
 black that is connected precisely to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920
 magneto 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.300
 here on the bike we have placed a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.040
 small gadget to the effects of power 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.970
 measure the spark of the cde and original 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.550
 we will separate the current jump and 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.059
 there to be observed as far as we can 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.180
 give until the bike starts to fail 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:09.520
 and here we have the bike pinned with 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.090
 it looks and original that we are proceeding 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.090
 do not 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.960
 to elevate the turns 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.600
 good below we will show you 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:37.520
 increase the stay wants more happy 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.520
 a current will be cut 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.800
 as you can see there more 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.800
 highlighting the bike in that offer 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.930
 final 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.899
 and finally it is impossible to work 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.490
 we are going to leave just what is that and go 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.840
 to proceed to the installation of the taste 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.250
 good below we're going to interest 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.069
 look as you see we have 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.930
 cut the black wire with a band 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.630
 red which is the one that comes directly 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.480
 from the magnet to the tab that 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.650
 then it will go connected from the factory to the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.069
 cdi we are going to place the red wire of the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.230
 booster and we will place it on the cable 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.950
 that goes to the card ie on the cable 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.510
 which feeds the cdi and the black cable what 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.610
 let's put the black with the band 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.770
 red that comes from the magnet 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.680
 well done this we are also going to 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.920
 show that we have placed in a 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.940
 picture screw the mass is 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.220
 important to previously sand the paint 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.350
 to make good dough because it is very 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.450
 common that there are problems in the 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.970
 moto electronics and 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.350
 vehicles in general because of bad 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.150
 masses is very important in the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.390
 electronic that the masses are 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.590
 students well done well and is 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.069
 all soon we will connect a tab 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:18.739
 and we will start the engine 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.989
 to check the benefits of this 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.769
 this little box that has 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.450
 electronic components that really 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.410
 they potentize 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.970
 the spark allowing in this way with 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.099
 higher pressures on the engines than 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.940
 they have been modified of displacement or already 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.950
 they have been reduced in their cover and good 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.380
 and also for street vehicles and 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.890
 that by having a more powerful spark 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.180
 let's get better burned out of the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.459
 mixture that in the end is also going to 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.230
 result in fuel savings 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.750
 as you can see the booster 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.540
 It also comes included in this care with 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.049
 the indications of how it should 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.049
 connect 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.650
 to deal with in five thousand laps 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.409
 approximate this is not very important 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.519
 only and lucrative and now we're going to 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.850
 proceed to activate again if at 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.580
 get in 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.880
 and let's see how you can be them 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.880
 giving 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:35.100
 will increase and increase we do not have 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.850
 Failures of the girl thanks to you woman 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.850
 plant 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.800
 where the city the 6 minutes the cases 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.900
 we are talking about it is almost double 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.660
 of the power of the girl who had 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.660
 breathe and start to fail
