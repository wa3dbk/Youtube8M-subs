be<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.170> too<00:00:52.350> much<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.590> minigun<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> handle

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
be a bit too much for minigun to handle

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.970 
be a bit too much for minigun to handle
so<00:00:53.850> there<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.149> go<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.110> once<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:55.500> game

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
number three and let's see how this ends

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.910 
number three and let's see how this ends
up<00:00:57.539> playing<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.320> far<00:00:58.530> been<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> pretty

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
up playing out so far been a pretty

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
up playing out so far been a pretty
fantastic<00:00:59.190> series<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.020> minigun<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
fantastic series we can see minigun it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
fantastic series we can see minigun it
will<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.739> starting<00:01:02.100> off<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.609> base<00:01:02.820> play

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
will be starting off on one base play

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.149 
will be starting off on one base play
here<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:03.570> forge<00:01:03.840> fast<00:01:04.110> expand<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.650> possible

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
here now forge fast expand is possible

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.590 
here now forge fast expand is possible
but<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> best<00:01:05.729> decision<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.420> map

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
but not the best decision on this map

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.899 
but not the best decision on this map
the<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.950> expansion<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.700> way<00:01:08.850> too

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the the the expansion is just way too

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.820 
the the the expansion is just way too
wide<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.659> able<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.930> effectively<00:01:10.350> defend

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
wide to be able to effectively defend

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.490 
wide to be able to effectively defend
early<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.630> cannons<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
early on with the the cannons and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
early on with the the cannons and
especially<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.979> strong<00:01:14.310> roach<00:01:14.549> spilling<00:01:15.030> push

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
especially a strong roach spilling push

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210 
especially a strong roach spilling push
early<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.570> from<00:01:16.229> Missouri<00:01:16.500> player<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:17.009> really

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
early on from Missouri player can really

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.130 
early on from Missouri player can really
break<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.580> pretty<00:01:17.790> bad<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.900> expect

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
break you pretty bad so I do expect

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.570 
break you pretty bad so I do expect
Adrian<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> start<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.189> base<00:01:20.369> play

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
Adrian to start off with one base play

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.859 
Adrian to start off with one base play
this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> same<00:01:21.210> mentality<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.720> we've

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
this is the same mentality as we've

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.410 
this is the same mentality as we've
talked<00:01:22.080> about<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.409> past<00:01:23.060> when<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.180> scout

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
talked about in the past when your scout

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600 
talked about in the past when your scout
scouted<00:01:24.990> first<00:01:25.229> by<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.619> Protoss<00:01:26.130> opponent

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
scouted first by your Protoss opponent

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
scouted first by your Protoss opponent
it<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.299> hard<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> pull<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.080> quick

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it is really hard to pull off that quick

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
it is really hard to pull off that quick
hatch<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> given<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.000> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
hatch and given that this is just a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.390 
hatch and given that this is just a
two-player<00:01:30.689> map<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.650> very<00:01:31.890> small

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
two-player map and it is so very small

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.730 
two-player map and it is so very small
it<00:01:32.700> almost<00:01:33.090> necessitates<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.229> pool<00:01:34.439> first

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it almost necessitates going pool first

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.710 
it almost necessitates going pool first
it<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.790> impossible<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.479> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it just it's not impossible but it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
it just it's not impossible but it's
just<00:01:36.869> difficult<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.130> put<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
just difficult and can really put you in

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
just to scout out whether or not this is

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.730 
just to scout out whether or not this is
actually<00:04:25.720> happening

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
actually happening

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.200 
actually happening
and<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.069> century<00:04:27.400> will<00:04:27.550> be<00:04:27.639> taking<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.940> couple

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
and that century will be taking a couple

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.670 
and that century will be taking a couple
shots<00:04:28.240> from<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.690> circling<00:04:29.110> but<00:04:29.259> it<00:04:29.349> should<00:04:29.650> be

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
shots from the circling but it should be

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.170 
shots from the circling but it should be
okay<00:04:30.069> there<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.250> go<00:04:30.460> just<00:04:30.669> losing<00:04:31.030> some

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
okay there you go just losing some

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.230 
okay there you go just losing some
shields<00:04:31.539> there<00:04:31.919> few<00:04:32.919> more<00:04:33.099> zerglings<00:04:33.550> moving

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
shields there few more zerglings moving

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.150 
shields there few more zerglings moving
out<00:04:34.360> for<00:04:34.599> Edra<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.139> try<00:04:35.319> to<00:04:35.380> continue<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:35.979> that

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
out for Edra to try to continue up that

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.620 
out for Edra to try to continue up that
scouting<00:04:36.460> once<00:04:36.729> more<00:04:36.940> he<00:04:37.060> needs<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.479> really

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
scouting once more he needs to really

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.120 
scouting once more he needs to really
confirm<00:04:38.080> whether<00:04:38.319> or<00:04:38.410> not<00:04:38.530> this<00:04:38.710> is<00:04:38.770> coming

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
confirm whether or not this is coming

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.249 
confirm whether or not this is coming
and<00:04:39.220> there<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:40.270> dark<00:04:40.539> shrine<00:04:40.870> from

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
and there it is the dark shrine from

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.379 
and there it is the dark shrine from
minigun<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.009> he's<00:04:42.130> also<00:04:42.340> dropping<00:04:43.150> the

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
minigun and he's also dropping the

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.930 
minigun and he's also dropping the
expansion<00:04:43.870> at<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.289> same<00:04:44.560> time<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.220> just<00:04:45.520> one

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
expansion at the same time so just one

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.909 
expansion at the same time so just one
gateway<00:04:46.270> there's<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.810> second<00:04:47.259> gateway<00:04:47.440> finally

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
gateway there's a second gateway finally

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.580 
gateway there's a second gateway finally
coming<00:04:48.220> down<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:49.180> then<00:04:49.449> getting<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.900> expo<00:04:50.410> as

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
coming down but then getting the expo as

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.800 
coming down but then getting the expo as
well<00:04:50.830> very<00:04:51.280> interesting<00:04:51.400> here<00:04:52.210> from<00:04:52.419> minigun

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
well very interesting here from minigun

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.990 
well very interesting here from minigun
very<00:04:53.139> interesting<00:04:53.710> indeed<00:04:53.889> now<00:04:54.699> the<00:04:54.759> one

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
very interesting indeed now the one

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.969 
very interesting indeed now the one
thing<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.270> realize<00:04:55.569> is<00:04:55.599> when<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.139> go<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.500> Dark

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
thing to realize is when you go the Dark

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.490 
thing to realize is when you go the Dark
Templar<00:04:57.190> route<00:04:57.699> really<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.750> biggest<00:04:58.960> problem

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
Templar route really the biggest problem

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.379 
Templar route really the biggest problem
early<00:05:00.159> on<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.520> just<00:05:00.639> not<00:05:00.849> having<00:05:01.090> enough

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
early on is just not having enough

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.270 
early on is just not having enough
espeon<00:05:01.870> that's<00:05:02.229> really<00:05:02.470> all<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.680> is<00:05:02.889> you<00:05:03.099> just

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
espeon that's really all it is you just

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.890 
espeon that's really all it is you just
really<00:05:03.490> lack<00:05:03.729> vest<00:05:04.030> being<00:05:04.300> so<00:05:04.479> having<00:05:04.810> those

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
really lack vest being so having those

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.360 
really lack vest being so having those
extra<00:05:05.199> resources<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.830> be<00:05:05.919> able<00:05:05.949> to<00:05:06.099> comment

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
extra resources to be able to comment

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
just to confirm that the Nexus has gone

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.260 
just to confirm that the Nexus has gone
through<00:05:17.830> as<00:05:18.009> we<00:05:18.460> can<00:05:18.580> see<00:05:18.669> that<00:05:18.789> dark<00:05:19.000> shrine
