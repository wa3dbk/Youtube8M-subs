00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.370
 telepizza launches the triple now you 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.139
 We take three pizzas wherever you want 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.969
 medium for seven euros each the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.889
 triple telepizza and we take them 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.619
 seven euros each one telepizza the 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.270
 secret is in the mass I think that almost 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.850
 a shame in the end you start the game 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.550
 losing 1 to 0 at minute 1 and it's and you're 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.830
 it's uphill we tried to do 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.560
 our game we have found 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.800
 tell a team very very solid and very 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.820
 complete that they have made their game also 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.910
 we have not generated as many occasions as 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.579
 other days they have generated themselves 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.680
 and I think it's good that they have 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.300
 been superior no help does not help the goal 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.210
 initial does not help and start uphill 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 because it is always a job but 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.980
 well I think later that we did not go to bed 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.570
 the 15th minute 20 we have started to have 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.430
 more the ball to have a little more 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.129
 spaces to force them to play backwards 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.290
 and good of some occasion we have had 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.360
 also that with a tie you always 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.250
 can give a little more of life to 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.049
 vitality to the party and we have not 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.430
 got and from there then good 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.520
 I think the second part we have started 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.289
 good but 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
 immediately we have closed pass lines 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.079
 They have been very strong, especially for 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.950
 the center and then we have the 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.950
 Superior silence 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.030
 yes I think that especially the lack of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.970
 Antoine before rest could be 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.380
 something also good then well that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.490
 I could mark the game a bit but 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.200
 But it has not been that way 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.580
 it has not been like that then then we have not 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 we have not had many 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.020
 Clear occasions like other days but 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 I think we tried to do our 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.060
 game we finished the game empty 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.920
 and with that feeling it's also not the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.920
 all good but it's positive 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 so I think you said before I think 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.210
 that coming here the effort that they have 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.479
 made the displacement and feel the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.450
 heat of your hobby here is a lot is not 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.789
 a lot and it is very significant that yes the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.550
 others who have not been able to come do not think 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.619
 that the real as players as a team 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.569
 as a club and a hobby, especially I think 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.030
 we have to be proud that we are 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.860
 today we have shown him a big club and 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.670
 that moves a lot of people and I think that 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.560
 that's how we get important things 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.560
 we continue without adding 26 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.640
 so it's a short league it's a league of 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.010
 6 matches and in the end 3 matches already 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.560
 showed points is complicated but 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.150
 well I think the illusion to me the team 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.260
 no one is going to take it away now let's go 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.910
 to focus on the league and save time 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.710
 to prepare the return game 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.220
 and what you have to follow, there are 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.780
 continue with the illusion because if loose is 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.810
 true that has been 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 We had a Manchester front in the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.349
 first minutes we are fine 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.459
 well defensively we were not comfortable 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.030
 and in attack, and we have also been 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.340
 at your pace when we had the ball 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.489
 we wanted to get there very quickly and there was 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.010
 to combine much more then we have 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.770
 had good minutes minutes too 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.110
 but not today comes as good to them 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.930
 I think they are worthy of the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.790
 victory above all in a field like that 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.740
 you do not know what they are going to happen to you 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.320
 over you are going to do many times and 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.160
 can start at minute 1 as they are in 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.990
 against it is very hard but other times 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.240
 It has also happened to us and we give it 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.580
 We turned around and could not be 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.550
 but we have tried 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.970
 I am made to dust the others also and 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.850
 we have the car not yes yes yes and there in 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.620
 these occasions there has not been a crossbar 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.250
 anything else 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.140
 but hey it's very very complicated 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.500
 it would have to be a lot of carom for 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.450
 happen right now I'm not thinking about 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.239
 we are tired 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:13.300
 but for us and up to us 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.960
 now think about Sunday's game 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:22.430
 fair 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.430
 and not just watch the game 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.470
 while here you have to think that the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.540
 functions in giving everything in the field and 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.820
 that's already what we tried not to 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.710
 has gone well has been superior and up 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.080
 now as I say do not think about the league and 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.020
 then return for that the other photo 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.990
 yes stronger than us and you see that 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.810
 you know already know how to put the good thing 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:51.080
 We, as I said, will give everything 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.080
 in each game and we will do the cars
