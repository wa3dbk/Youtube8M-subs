00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
a great primer so it is that's why it

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.260 
a great primer so it is that's why it
may<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> little<00:00:19.740> darker<00:00:20.250> than<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> but

that's quite it's a deep of red that

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.910 
that's quite it's a deep of red that
looks<00:04:03.549> on<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.760> screen<00:04:03.970> as<00:04:04.720> far<00:04:04.989> as<00:04:05.109> one

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
looks on the screen as far as one

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.670 
looks on the screen as far as one
comparing<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.639> and<00:04:07.329> as<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.109> think<00:04:08.349> you<00:04:08.470> ready

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
comparing it and as you think you ready

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.589 
comparing it and as you think you ready
the<00:04:08.799> bike<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.519> almost<00:04:09.970> an<00:04:10.150> exact<00:04:10.450> match

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
the bike it is almost an exact match

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.500 
the bike it is almost an exact match
from<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.139> box<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.650> slightly<00:04:12.099> darker<00:04:12.730> but<00:04:13.389> I'd

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
from the box is slightly darker but I'd

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.259 
from the box is slightly darker but I'd
rather<00:04:13.660> be<00:04:13.870> darker<00:04:14.230> than<00:04:14.260> lighter<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.880> well

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
rather be darker than lighter so well

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.080 
rather be darker than lighter so well
