00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.730
 which is for racing games a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.980
 steering wheel for the playstation move and for 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.650

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.260

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.210
 for this system here a photograph 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.550
 as you see it tells us that this requires the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.610
 playstation move and the camera to be able 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.120
 use it and well let's open it 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.850
 so that they see more or less how is I 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.429
 I bought this control do not control this 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.620
 accessory for control to play the 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.019
 game of living planit parking that 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.089
 I just bought a few days ago at 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.100
 we bought with my daughter to play it the 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.839
 truth that is really fun and it 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.390
 Well I decided to go out and buy this 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.010
 accessory since it is compatible for this 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.350
 game and I said well let's buy it 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.519
 to see how it is and the truth that I 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.160
 like a lot 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:08.320
 well here we are going to take it out of your package 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.830
 it's very simple there is simply the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.870
 accessory and a manual as you can see 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.830
 here the truth that not even myself 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.330
 I have seen it since it is not not much 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.760
 what is needed is simply a 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.070
 accessory you connect the playstation 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.200
 mobile and ready 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.990
 comes to us inside this bag 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.990
 plastic here another manual I think this 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.360
 is the current specifications buttons 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.750
 has and all that and for the truth that I 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.790
 really liked this this control does 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.100
 mind that it is as if it were a control 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.380
 regular playstation 3 but for the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.740
 playstation move the only thing that does not have 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.530
 are the palanquita if you do not have the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.080
 analog levers all the buttons the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.660
 they have and it's very beautiful as you can see 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.330
 something that I really liked are the triggers 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.869
 these are are very good here has the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.119
 button the e1 r1 all buttons are 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.660
 levers that you have here outside the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.790
 of this ring are other buttons has the 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.420
 accelerator as if you're going to do it for 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.060
 one 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.349
 a motorcycle since you can open it 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.720
 as you can see here as a 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.810
 motorcycle and play that way 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.459
 also which I think is very good and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.000
 Well , here I bring you a shot 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.310
 de dÃ©jÃ  with the control installed with the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.890
 playstation so they can see how it looks and 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.200
 as I said it feels great was 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.120
 a little big but I think that that 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.489
 It helps more to feel like a 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.390
 Fly the buttons as I had said 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.430
 very very well they have a lot of the trigger 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.840
 is very very broad I do not know how to say it 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.510
 but you can have very good 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.209
 precision buttons start select the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.390
 levers are here that are out here 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.250
 of this ring are in the book and plans are 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.319
 use to hit your opponent that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.049
 be on that side when you open it as 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.090
 motorcycle you can accelerate like this 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.060
 the dog feels the only thing you can not 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.690
 do when in motorcycle mode is 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.030
 reach the Latvians of the hoop as 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.100
 you can see here you can not reach it like this 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.560
 that for them obtained that having the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.110
 central closed in this way but then 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.170
 good in the same way 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.760
 and one thing that he was put to do 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.900
 motorcyclists we took it down later and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.900
 have a happy day
