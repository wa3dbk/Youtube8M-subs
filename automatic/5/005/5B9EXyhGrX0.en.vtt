two<00:01:54.009> bolts<00:01:54.220> on<00:01:54.430> each<00:01:54.700> side<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.470> can<00:01:56.649> see

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
two bolts on each side that you can see

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.020 
two bolts on each side that you can see
in<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.220> wheel<00:01:57.369> well<00:01:57.580> here<00:01:57.759> I'm<00:01:57.880> going<00:01:57.970> to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
in the wheel well here I'm going to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.480 
in the wheel well here I'm going to
point<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:58.450> one<00:01:58.660> out<00:01:59.009> and<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:00.220> kind<00:02:00.430> of

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
point this one out and you can kind of

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.740 
point this one out and you can kind of
see<00:02:00.670> in<00:02:00.789> there<00:02:00.910> and<00:02:01.030> it's<00:02:01.210> kind<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.420> dark<00:02:01.600> and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
see in there and it's kind of dark and

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.200 
see in there and it's kind of dark and
hard<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.020> see<00:02:02.200> but<00:02:02.470> there's<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.430> bolt<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.970> goes

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
hard to see but there's a bolt that goes

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.760 
hard to see but there's a bolt that goes
straight<00:02:04.750> up<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.080> down<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.440> each<00:02:05.560> side

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
straight up and down and each side

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.840 
straight up and down and each side
they're<00:02:05.950> going<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.310> remove<00:02:06.580> and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
they're going to have to remove and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.389 
they're going to have to remove and
we're<00:02:07.750> actually<00:02:07.869> going<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.200> start<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.709> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
we're actually going to start on the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.139 
we're actually going to start on the
driver's<00:02:09.789> side

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
driver's side

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.040 
driver's side
and<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.709> bolt<00:02:11.950> was<00:02:12.489> actually<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:12.970> pain<00:02:13.450> for<00:02:13.900> me

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
and this bolt was actually a pain for me

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.949 
and this bolt was actually a pain for me
to<00:02:14.260> remove<00:02:15.060> because<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.269> clip<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.630> holds<00:02:16.750> it

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
to remove because the clip that holds it

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.340 
to remove because the clip that holds it
in<00:02:17.050> place<00:02:17.170> ended<00:02:18.070> up<00:02:18.220> spinning<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.600> not

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
in place ended up spinning and not

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.350 
in place ended up spinning and not
holding<00:02:20.830> like<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.070> should<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.519> as<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.239> can

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
holding like it should and as you can

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.940 
holding like it should and as you can
see<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.600> bolt<00:02:22.870> didn't<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.620> very<00:02:23.650> much

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
see this bolt didn't like it very much

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.880 
see this bolt didn't like it very much
so<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.610> took<00:02:24.820> awhile<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:26.440> what<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.590> ended<00:02:26.799> up

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
so it's took awhile so what I ended up

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.830 
so it's took awhile so what I ended up
doing<00:02:27.010> here<00:02:27.310> was<00:02:27.400> pushing<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.330> screwdriver<00:02:28.600> in

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
doing here was pushing a screwdriver in

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.199 
doing here was pushing a screwdriver in
there<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.110> keep<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.440> clip<00:02:29.620> from<00:02:29.769> spinning<00:02:30.209> and

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
there to keep the clip from spinning and

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.600 
there to keep the clip from spinning and
while<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.560> remove<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.829> bolt<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.000> clip

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
while I remove the bolt that the clip

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.690 
while I remove the bolt that the clip
thread<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.730> into<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.170> now<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.340> see<00:02:39.549> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
thread it into and now you can see the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.100 
thread it into and now you can see the
clip<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.180> holds<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.900> bolt<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.230> place<00:02:43.110> so

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
clip that holds the bolt in place so

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.960 
clip that holds the bolt in place so
basically<00:02:44.380> once<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.680> remove<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.400> bolt<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
basically once you remove that bolt and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.470 
basically once you remove that bolt and
there's<00:02:46.540> another<00:02:47.320> plastic<00:02:47.940> kind<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.030> bolt<00:02:49.239> in

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
there's another plastic kind of bolt in

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
there's another plastic kind of bolt in
there<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.079> need<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.320> remove<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:51.190> should

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
there that you need to remove you should

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.690 
there that you need to remove you should
be<00:02:51.400> able<00:02:51.459> pullets<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:51.910> don't<00:02:52.120> loosen<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.420> up<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
be able pullets I don't loosen it up and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.270 
be able pullets I don't loosen it up and
now<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:55.480> are<00:02:55.810> actually<00:02:56.019> back<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
now we are actually back on the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.860 
now we are actually back on the
passenger<00:02:57.760> side<00:02:57.910> removing<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.420> same<00:02:58.630> bolt

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
passenger side removing the same bolt

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.900 
passenger side removing the same bolt
and<00:02:59.079> we<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.350> remove<00:02:59.560> from<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.070> driver<00:03:00.400> side

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
and we just remove from the driver side

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
and we just remove from the driver side
so<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.480> got<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.840> one<00:03:03.960> out<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.230> one<00:03:04.410> went<00:03:04.560> a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
so we got that one out that one went a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.290 
so we got that one out that one went a
lot<00:03:04.770> easier<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:05.850> just<00:03:06.030> below<00:03:06.150> that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
lot easier and then just below that

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.930 
lot easier and then just below that
there<00:03:06.840> was<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.950> other<00:03:08.160> bolt<00:03:08.460> holding<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
there was this other bolt holding the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.960 
there was this other bolt holding the
plastic<00:03:09.540> guard<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> front<00:03:11.430> bumper<00:03:11.610> and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
plastic guard in to the front bumper and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.540 
plastic guard in to the front bumper and
here's<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.990> little<00:03:13.260> trick<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.130> you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
here's a little trick for you if you

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.130 
here's a little trick for you if you
ever<00:03:14.940> dealt<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.210> these<00:03:15.420> before<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.020> know

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
ever dealt with these before you know

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.620 
ever dealt with these before you know
that<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.980> threads<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.820> these<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> lot<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.480> times

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
that the threads on these a lot of times

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.030 
that the threads on these a lot of times
don't<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:18.990> anything<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.440> try<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.620> screw<00:03:19.950> them

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
don't do anything to try to screw them

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
don't do anything to try to screw them
out<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:20.400> don't<00:03:20.580> screw<00:03:20.880> up

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
out and they don't screw up

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.460 
out and they don't screw up
well<00:03:21.210> basically<00:03:22.020> if<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.200> can<00:03:22.260> get<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
well basically if you can get a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.840 
well basically if you can get a
screwdriver<00:03:22.770> behind<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.490> put<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> little

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
screwdriver behind it and put a little

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910 
screwdriver behind it and put a little
pressure<00:03:24.000> on<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:25.050> then<00:03:25.230> try<00:03:25.410> screwing<00:03:25.800> it

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
pressure on it and then try screwing it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.790 
pressure on it and then try screwing it
again<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.460> am<00:03:26.580> here<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.720> helps<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.680> lot

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
again like I am here that helps a lot

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.770 
again like I am here that helps a lot
then<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.130> will<00:03:29.220> actually<00:03:29.490> screw<00:03:29.760> out<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.120> then

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
then it will actually screw out and then

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.650 
then it will actually screw out and then
you<00:03:30.870> should<00:03:31.050> be<00:03:31.200> able<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.410> pull<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.280> out<00:03:32.660> so

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you should be able to pull it out so

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.090 
you should be able to pull it out so
next<00:03:34.020> we<00:03:34.170> should<00:03:34.230> be<00:03:34.410> able<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.620> pull<00:03:34.770> this<00:03:34.920> side

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
next we should be able to pull this side

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.530 
next we should be able to pull this side

reason I guess this video is done for
you<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.560> if<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:05.010> had<00:04:05.190> any<00:04:05.520> headlight

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
you but if you had any headlight

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.240 
you but if you had any headlight
problems<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.320> is<00:04:07.470> where<00:04:07.590> we<00:04:07.680> continue<00:04:08.100> on

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
problems this is where we continue on

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.280 
problems this is where we continue on
you<00:04:08.880> can<00:04:09.000> see<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.570> are<00:04:09.600> two<00:04:09.900> bolts

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
you can see that there are two bolts

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.500 
you can see that there are two bolts
holding<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.340> headlight<00:04:11.610> on<00:04:11.910> up<00:04:12.180> top

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
holding the headlight on up top

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.020

underneath with underneath the hood and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.199 
underneath with underneath the hood and
then<00:04:15.830> there<00:04:16.830> are<00:04:17.070> actually<00:04:17.489> two<00:04:17.669> other<00:04:17.700> bolts

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
then there are actually two other bolts

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
inside that I'm removing here and

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.560 
inside that I'm removing here and
there's<00:04:23.280> one<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.610> actually<00:04:23.820> forgot<00:04:24.270> to

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
well again kind of right in front of the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.650 
well again kind of right in front of the
tire<00:04:28.650> there's<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.160> fourth<00:04:29.910> one

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.590 

those<00:04:34.750> four<00:04:35.020> bolts<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.560> then<00:04:35.800> unplug<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
those four bolts and then unplug the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.090 
those four bolts and then unplug the
connectors<00:04:38.200> going<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.770> back<00:04:38.890> of<00:04:39.040> the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
connectors going to the back of the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.460 
connectors going to the back of the
headlight<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.940> should<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:40.300> able<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.660> pull

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
headlight you should be able to pull

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.590 
headlight you should be able to pull
your<00:04:41.620> headlight<00:04:41.950> out<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:48.090> then<00:04:49.090> this<00:04:49.420> is

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
your headlight out and then this is

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.450 
your headlight out and then this is
basically<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:50.650> back<00:04:50.860> view<00:04:51.070> of<00:04:51.130> what<00:04:51.340> your

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
basically the back view of what your

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.530 
basically the back view of what your
headlight<00:04:51.730> will<00:04:52.180> look<00:04:52.480> like<00:04:54.270> show<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.330> how<00:04:55.480> to

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
headlight will look like show you how to

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.980 
headlight will look like show you how to
access<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.400> HID<00:04:57.400> bulbs<00:04:58.060> basically<00:04:58.840> there's

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
access the HID bulbs basically there's

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.120 
access the HID bulbs basically there's
one<00:04:59.170> screw<00:04:59.410> that<00:04:59.560> we're<00:04:59.680> going<00:04:59.800> to<00:04:59.890> remove

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
one screw that we're going to remove

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.300 
one screw that we're going to remove
here<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.700> then<00:05:01.600> after<00:05:02.050> we<00:05:02.170> remove<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.920> screw

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
here and then after we remove that screw

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.930 
here and then after we remove that screw
this<00:05:04.060> cap<00:05:04.480> should<00:05:05.230> twist<00:05:05.950> counterclockwise

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
this cap should twist counterclockwise

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.050 
this cap should twist counterclockwise
and<00:05:07.770> then<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.920> should<00:05:09.070> be<00:05:09.130> able<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.520> pop<00:05:09.850> off

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
and then it should be able to pop off

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.030 
and then it should be able to pop off
and<00:05:10.510> it<00:05:10.900> will<00:05:10.960> expose<00:05:11.470> your<00:05:11.740> HID<00:05:12.160> bulb<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.860> once

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
and it will expose your HID bulb so once

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.820 
and it will expose your HID bulb so once
we<00:05:15.220> remove<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:16.030> connection<00:05:16.420> here<00:05:16.740> there<00:05:17.740> are

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
we remove the connection here there are

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.110 
we remove the connection here there are
two<00:05:17.950> screws<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.280> hold<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:18.730> clip<00:05:18.970> in

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
two screws that hold the clip in

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.390 
two screws that hold the clip in
basically<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.750> holds<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.110> bulb<00:05:20.320> down<00:05:20.530> so

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
basically that holds the bulb down so

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.110 
basically that holds the bulb down so
we're<00:05:21.520> going<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.670> move<00:05:21.790> that<00:05:21.940> clip

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.640 

you

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.540 

you<00:05:32.220> can<00:05:32.340> see<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.610> for<00:05:32.820> a<00:05:32.850> quick<00:05:33.060> second<00:05:33.419> there

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
you can see it for a quick second there

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.020 
you can see it for a quick second there
and<00:05:35.550> here's<00:05:36.480> our<00:05:36.750> bad<00:05:37.080> bulb<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:38.310> this<00:05:38.760> is<00:05:38.880> what

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
and here's our bad bulb so this is what

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.750 
and here's our bad bulb so this is what
we<00:05:39.120> needed<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.510> change<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:40.110> just<00:05:40.310> in<00:05:41.310> case<00:05:41.460> you

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
we needed to change and just in case you

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.260 
we needed to change and just in case you
had<00:05:42.600> a<00:05:42.630> bad<00:05:43.050> ballast<00:05:43.710> this<00:05:44.130> is<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.940> piece<00:05:45.120> on

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
had a bad ballast this is the piece on

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.810 
had a bad ballast this is the piece on
removing<00:05:45.690> now<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.290> ballast<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.919> these

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
removing now is the ballast and these

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.270 
removing now is the ballast and these
rarely<00:05:48.270> fail<00:05:48.780> if<00:05:49.380> they're<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.919> original

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
rarely fail if they're the original

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.280 
rarely fail if they're the original
Mitsubishi<00:05:50.730> ones<00:05:51.000> but<00:05:51.870> if<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.139> have

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
Mitsubishi ones but if you have

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.710 
Mitsubishi ones but if you have
aftermarket<00:05:53.040> kit<00:05:53.820> you<00:05:54.120> may<00:05:54.240> need<00:05:54.419> to<00:05:54.540> change

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
aftermarket kit you may need to change

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.070 
aftermarket kit you may need to change
your<00:05:54.990> ballast<00:05:55.380> or<00:05:55.620> something<00:05:56.280> like<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:57.080> so

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
your ballast or something like that so

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050 
your ballast or something like that so
this<00:05:58.380> is<00:05:58.440> just<00:05:58.830> showing<00:05:59.040> how<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.460> remove<00:05:59.820> the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
this is just showing how to remove the

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:10.670 
this is just showing how to remove the
ballast<00:06:00.389> in<00:06:00.570> case<00:06:00.780> your<00:06:01.560> ballast<00:06:01.919> is<00:06:02.160> bad

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.959 

and<00:06:11.700> basically<00:06:12.700> install<00:06:13.300> would<00:06:13.600> be

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:13.969 
and basically install would be

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.359 
and basically install would be
obviously<00:06:14.509> doing<00:06:15.349> everything<00:06:15.649> reverse<00:06:16.099> order

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:16.369 
obviously doing everything reverse order

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.039 
obviously doing everything reverse order
here<00:06:16.639> so<00:06:16.819> it's<00:06:17.389> actually<00:06:17.599> not<00:06:17.719> the<00:06:17.869> best

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:18.049 
here so it's actually not the best

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:20.829 
here so it's actually not the best
design<00:06:18.399> since<00:06:19.399> you<00:06:19.579> have<00:06:19.729> to<00:06:19.939> remove<00:06:20.389> your

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839 
design since you have to remove your

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.719 
design since you have to remove your
entire<00:06:21.110> front<00:06:21.409> bumper<00:06:21.709> just<00:06:21.979> to<00:06:22.189> change<00:06:22.610> a

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
entire front bumper just to change a

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.819 
entire front bumper just to change a
headlight<00:06:23.059> but<00:06:23.299> if<00:06:23.509> you<00:06:24.019> have<00:06:24.229> the<00:06:24.499> HID

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:24.829
