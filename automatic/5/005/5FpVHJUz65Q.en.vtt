right there so that's marching for the
lock<00:01:58.950> screen<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.869> our<00:02:01.229> overlay<00:02:01.799> so

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
lock screen so this is our overlay so

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.069 
lock screen so this is our overlay so
this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> overlay<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.719> weather

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this is the overlay the weather

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.950 
this is the overlay the weather
overlaying<00:02:05.009> over<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.670> background<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.479> then

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
overlaying over your background and then

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.370 
overlaying over your background and then
you<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> option<00:02:08.690> for<00:02:10.849> date<00:02:11.849> conditions

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you have the option for date conditions

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.290 
you have the option for date conditions
the<00:02:13.440> day<00:02:13.650> condition<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.490> basically<00:02:15.060> the
