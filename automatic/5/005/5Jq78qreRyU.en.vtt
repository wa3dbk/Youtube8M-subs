00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.349
 in this place the river narrows almost always 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.179
 here we were lucky 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.500
 the cookie was not strong 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.730
 and very much here is the flow of everything in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.730
 ten meters from the run 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.710
 under water it is impossible to go against 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 currents 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.230
 and you have to be on the surface 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.230
 constantly on the move 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.840
 I have found something interesting on one of them 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.600
 but it is not normal to examine the place 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.600
 it turned out the cookies were blown down 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.979
 here I stopped fighting with me 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.979
 just carries about cookies 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.260
 three hour route 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.050
 was one in 40 minutes 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.050
 second attempt to raise the differences 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.760
 can now catch up with buyuk 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.900
 fish currents hid the farthest 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.900
 corners 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.750
 struggled to catch up with black 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.050
 pike perch small on pond 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.920
 back pawn everyone thanks for your attention
