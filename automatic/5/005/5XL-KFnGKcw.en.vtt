 year 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.439
 in the year that was hard for me 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 because I was finishing high school 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.330
 3rd year of high school so I had 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 than to taste much in the tubes then 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 sometimes let the channel 100 videos leave 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 the 23 days in video sometimes did not see by 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.380
 that she attends sometimes we do not see 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 those videos plus one because they had not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.680
 much time and such but still the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.540
 channel has grown a lot and I have to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.600

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.399

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.310

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.079
 Wow, it's a good beginning of the year, the people. 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.890

 I became totally strange and the galera liked it 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.710

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.700
 Also the challenge almost died but I did 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.950
 and the difference was that we 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.990
