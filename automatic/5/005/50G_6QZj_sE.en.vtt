00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.429 
can't show you that many game benchmarks
since<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.330> didn't<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.810> many<00:00:21.900> games<00:00:22.140> back

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
since it didn't have so many games back

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.340 
since it didn't have so many games back

and<00:02:09.300> let's<00:02:09.720> say<00:02:09.899> every<00:02:10.350> single<00:02:10.560> CPU<00:02:10.860> power

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
aim this chip is a lot better in fact if

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.350 
aim this chip is a lot better in fact if
you<00:02:19.290> decide<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.650> go<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.070> AI<00:02:20.190> GPU<00:02:20.850> then

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
you decide to go with the AI GPU then

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.510 
you decide to go with the AI GPU then
the<00:02:21.540> 810<00:02:21.930> 50<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.320> turnkey<00:02:22.710> definitely<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.490> the

the 810 50 a turnkey definitely is the

the 810 50 a turnkey definitely is the

able to max out the game settings but

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.930 
able to max out the game settings but
you<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.710> surely<00:02:32.070> go<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.520> good<00:02:32.700> enough

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940

performance<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:36.480> lets<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.930> down<00:02:37.170> but

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
performance really lets you down but

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.260

then<00:02:37.830> again<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.400> better<00:02:38.640> CPU

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
then again you get better CPU

chip<00:03:03.239> uses<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> older<00:03:03.989> 32<00:03:04.590> nanometer<00:03:05.040> process

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
chip uses the older 32 nanometer process

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.150 
chip uses the older 32 nanometer process
while<00:03:06.000> entrance<00:03:06.570> uses<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.989> new<00:03:07.110> 22<00:03:07.650> nanometer

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160

technology<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.510> lower<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.750> nanometer

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
technology so the lower the nanometer

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
technology so the lower the nanometer
the<00:03:10.620> lower<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.040> power<00:03:11.310> consumption<00:03:11.730> but

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the lower the power consumption but

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.390 
the lower the power consumption but
overall<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.020> power<00:03:13.230> consumption<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.010> 810

overall the power consumption of the 810
5800<00:03:15.209> can<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.720> considered<00:03:16.170> as<00:03:16.350> bad<00:03:16.590> at<00:03:16.769> alpha

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
5800 can be considered as bad at alpha

5800 can be considered as bad at alpha
32<00:03:17.670> nanometer<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.360> course<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.080> higher<00:03:19.350> than

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
32 nanometer of course it's higher than

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800 
32 nanometer of course it's higher than
the<00:03:19.680> i3<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.670> also<00:03:20.820> have<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.180> keep<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.570> mind

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
the i3 but you also have to keep in mind

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.210 
the i3 but you also have to keep in mind
that<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.110> get<00:03:22.290> powerful<00:03:22.800> integrated

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
that you get powerful integrated

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.970 
that you get powerful integrated
graphics<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.170> end<00:03:25.320> it's<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.590> choice

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
graphics so in the end it's your choice

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.210 
graphics so in the end it's your choice
whether<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.370> go<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.670> D<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.450> D<00:03:27.510> 810<00:03:27.930> 5800<00:03:28.769> K<00:03:28.950> or

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
whether you go for D and D 810 5800 K or
