your instrument license and from there

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.900 
your instrument license and from there
they<00:00:30.270> allow<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.720> use<00:00:30.810> simulators<00:00:31.560> to

simulate the environment you'll be

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.119 
simulate the environment you'll be
around<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.079> instrument<00:00:34.620> conditions<00:00:34.739> which

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.059 
around and instrument conditions which
means<00:00:35.370> clouds<00:00:36.089> fog<00:00:36.809> anything<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.530> doesn't

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
park at the flight training center so we

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.949 
park at the flight training center so we
did<00:00:58.799> he<00:00:59.489> gets<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.879> tells<00:01:00.149> me<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.329> stay<00:01:00.479> in<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
bit but my first solo was definitely a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.100 
bit but my first solo was definitely a
good<00:01:17.880> experience<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.450> being<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:18.960> air

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
good experience just being in the air

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.680 
good experience just being in the air
yourself<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.070> worked<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:21.120> like<00:01:21.480> you

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
yourself you worked all that like you

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.200 
yourself you worked all that like you
worked<00:01:21.840> hard<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.230> one<00:01:22.320> moment<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.210> just

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
worked hard for that one moment and just

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480 
worked hard for that one moment and just
knowing<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.510> you're<00:01:25.350> piloting<00:01:25.800> an<00:01:26.040> airplane

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
knowing that you're piloting an airplane

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
knowing that you're piloting an airplane
in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> air<00:01:26.730> like<00:01:27.360> by<00:01:28.260> yourself<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.800> really

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
in the air like by yourself was a really

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460

good experience so my experience in the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
good experience so my experience in the
flight<00:01:31.650> program<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.460> somewhat<00:01:33.120> different

flight program is somewhat different

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.900 
flight program is somewhat different

started

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
started

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.950 
started
for<00:04:53.510> now<00:04:53.660> their<00:04:54.850> aviation<00:04:55.850> program<00:04:56.510> is<00:04:56.780> going

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
for now their aviation program is going

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.500 
for now their aviation program is going
to<00:04:57.020> keep<00:04:57.230> evolving<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.390> producing<00:04:59.390> more

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
to keep evolving and producing more

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.860 
to keep evolving and producing more
students<00:05:00.020> into<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.830> industries<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.870> will

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
students into the industries that will

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.510 
students into the industries that will
but<00:05:03.260> then<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.530> will<00:05:03.650> benefit<00:05:04.070> from<00:05:04.220> because

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
but then I will benefit from because

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.680 
but then I will benefit from because
I'll<00:05:04.670> be<00:05:04.820> working<00:05:05.120> with<00:05:05.150> those<00:05:05.360> who<00:05:05.570> come

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
I'll be working with those who come

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.900 
I'll be working with those who come
alongside<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:07.130> I<00:05:07.160> guess<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.520> last<00:05:07.640> thing<00:05:07.760> I

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
alongside so I guess the last thing I

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:17.640 
alongside so I guess the last thing I
have<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.120> say<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.360> go<00:05:09.110> Devils
