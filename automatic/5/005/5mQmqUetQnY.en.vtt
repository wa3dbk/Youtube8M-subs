a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.950> longer<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> legs<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
a little bit longer for the legs that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.179 
a little bit longer for the legs that
has<00:01:39.900> something<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.259> stand<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> ground

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
has something to stand on on the ground

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.310 
has something to stand on on the ground
and<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> also<00:01:41.729> suggest<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> want<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and you also suggest it if you want to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740 
and you also suggest it if you want to
make<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.860> Center<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.030> thicker<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
make this Center a little bit thicker a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.590 
make this Center a little bit thicker a
trick<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.100> add<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.549> extra<00:01:47.970> layer<00:01:48.540> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
trick would be to add an extra layer of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
trick would be to add an extra layer of
batting<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.439> start<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.040> extra<00:01:50.369> layer

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
batting or start with that extra layer

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
batting or start with that extra layer
of<00:01:50.549> batting<00:01:50.909> around<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> center<00:01:52.619> inside

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
of batting around just the center inside

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
of batting around just the center inside
and<00:01:53.460> leave<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> border<00:01:54.149> open<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.689> since<00:01:55.079> we

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and leave the border open right since we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.929 
and leave the border open right since we
are<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> add<00:01:55.710> upholstery<00:01:56.340> decorative

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
are going to add upholstery decorative

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.340 
are going to add upholstery decorative
upholstery<00:01:57.270> nails<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> outside

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
upholstery nails to the outside

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.530 
upholstery nails to the outside
sometimes<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.490> nice<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.479> little

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
sometimes it's nice to have that little

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.770 
sometimes it's nice to have that little
bit<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.500> edge<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.579> come<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> looks

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
bit of the edge to come up so it looks

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
bit of the edge to come up so it looks
like<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.590> upholstery<00:02:05.130> nails<00:02:05.399> are<00:02:05.670> really

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
like the upholstery nails are really

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
like the upholstery nails are really
pushing<00:02:06.810> down<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.229> fabric<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.459> reality

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
pushing down the fabric but in reality

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
pushing down the fabric but in reality
it's<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.420> hard<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.259> happen

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
it's really hard to get that to happen

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's really hard to get that to happen
so<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.400> create<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> false<00:02:12.239> border<00:02:12.810> by

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so if we just create a false border by

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.400 
so if we just create a false border by
putting<00:02:13.740> defatting<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.840> interior

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
putting defatting just on the interior

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.270 
putting defatting just on the interior
then<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.570> simply<00:02:18.570> do<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:20.010> makes

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
then we can simply do that and it makes

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.650 
then we can simply do that and it makes
it<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.490> lot<00:02:20.610> easier<00:02:20.790> when<00:02:21.210> you're<00:02:21.360> putting<00:02:21.570> your

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
it a lot easier when you're putting your

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.850 
it a lot easier when you're putting your
nails<00:02:22.020> in

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.620 

okay<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:25.920> we're<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.400> point<00:02:26.460> now<00:02:26.910> where<00:02:27.240> we

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
okay so we're to the point now where we

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.230 
okay so we're to the point now where we
have<00:02:28.020> created<00:02:28.650> our<00:02:28.710> frame<00:02:29.100> we've<00:02:29.700> laid<00:02:30.000> down

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
have created our frame we've laid down

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.450 
have created our frame we've laid down
the<00:02:30.450> batting<00:02:30.840> underneath<00:02:31.650> us<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.160> what<00:02:32.400> are

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
the batting underneath us and what are

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.400 
the batting underneath us and what are
we<00:02:32.520> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.820> do<00:02:32.910> next<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.480> we're<00:02:33.990> simply<00:02:34.200> just

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
we going to do next so we're simply just

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.370 
we going to do next so we're simply just
going<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.070> pull<00:02:35.580> our<00:02:35.910> batting<00:02:36.360> towards<00:02:37.230> us

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
going to pull our batting towards us

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.430 
going to pull our batting towards us
around<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.250> frame<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.900> staple<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
around the frame and staple it to the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.050 
around the frame and staple it to the
frame<00:02:40.650> what<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.460> key<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.790> doing<00:02:41.910> this

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
frame what is the key to doing this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.660 
frame what is the key to doing this
right<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.780> what<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.350> do<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.460> like<00:02:44.610> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
right so what I like to do is I like to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
right so what I like to do is I like to
take<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> batting<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.600> start<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.110> middle

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
take the batting and start in the middle

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.320 
take the batting and start in the middle
so<00:02:46.980> I'll<00:02:47.040> start<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.640> middle<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> head

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
so I'll start in the middle of the head

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.800 
so I'll start in the middle of the head
Bart<00:02:48.600> pull<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.320> back<00:02:49.970> staple<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.060> go<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
Bart pull it back staple it go to the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.140 
Bart pull it back staple it go to the
sides<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.530> middle<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:53.430> my<00:02:53.580> work<00:02:53.910> my

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
sides to the middle and then my work my

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.480 
sides to the middle and then my work my
way<00:02:54.390> around<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.800> corners<00:02:56.130> can<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.459> a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
way around and the corners can be a

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.130 
way around and the corners can be a
little<00:02:56.790> bit<00:02:56.910> tricky<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.930> want<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
little bit tricky but you just want to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.220 
little bit tricky but you just want to
make<00:02:58.290> sure<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.709> do<00:02:59.010> small<00:02:59.580> amounts<00:03:00.390> stapling

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
make sure you do small amounts stapling

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.550 
make sure you do small amounts stapling
so<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.620> don't<00:03:01.830> get<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> bunch<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:03.560> batting

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
so that you don't get a bunch of batting

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.250 
so that you don't get a bunch of batting
or<00:03:04.770> fabric<00:03:05.220> all<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.610> one<00:03:05.790> spot<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.050> do

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
or fabric all in one spot and if you do

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260 
or fabric all in one spot and if you do
have<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> bunch<00:03:07.860> up<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.250> batting<00:03:08.610> or<00:03:08.820> fabric

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
have a bunch up of batting or fabric

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.970 
have a bunch up of batting or fabric
feel<00:03:09.570> free<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.870> cut<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.320> out<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.890> you

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
feel free to cut it out so that you

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.130 
feel free to cut it out so that you
don't<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.400> too<00:03:11.730> much<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.150> triangles<00:03:12.750> or

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
don't have too much in triangles or

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.250 
don't have too much in triangles or
whatever<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.830> have<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.370> make<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:16.110> we

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
whatever you have to do to make it so we

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.979 
whatever you have to do to make it so we
have<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.680> batting<00:03:17.130> now<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:17.910> place<00:03:18.330> what's<00:03:18.750> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
have the batting now in place what's the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.740 
have the batting now in place what's the
next<00:03:19.170> step<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.610> have<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.030> decide<00:03:21.300> how<00:03:21.600> much

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
next step so you have to decide how much

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.540 
next step so you have to decide how much
batting<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.320> want<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.590> use<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:23.160> could<00:03:23.370> go

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
batting you want to use you could go

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.580 
batting you want to use you could go
ahead<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.060> put<00:03:24.390> another<00:03:24.780> layer<00:03:25.200> fatter

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
ahead and you put another layer fatter

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.259 
ahead and you put another layer fatter
if<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.100> wanted<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.519> be<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> little<00:03:26.880> bit<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.180> a

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
if you wanted it to be a little bit of a

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.330 
if you wanted it to be a little bit of a
fuller<00:03:27.540> look<00:03:27.840> or<00:03:28.440> if<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.800> like<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> little<00:03:29.160> bit

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
fuller look or if you like a little bit

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.770 
fuller look or if you like a little bit
more<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.610> firm<00:03:29.850> look<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.420> just<00:03:30.600> go

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
more of a firm look then you just go

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.600 
more of a firm look then you just go
ahead<00:03:30.900> lay<00:03:31.500> your<00:03:31.620> fabric<00:03:31.860> down<00:03:32.280> make<00:03:32.580> sure

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
ahead lay your fabric down make sure

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.030 
ahead lay your fabric down make sure
it's<00:03:32.790> ironed<00:03:33.360> or<00:03:33.600> steamed<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.290> then<00:03:34.350> do<00:03:34.920> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
it's ironed or steamed and then do the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.310 
it's ironed or steamed and then do the
exact<00:03:35.519> same<00:03:35.600> what's<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.750> number<00:03:37.110> one<00:03:37.140> thing

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
exact same what's the number one thing

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.650 
exact same what's the number one thing
that<00:03:37.739> can<00:03:37.920> take<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.340> from<00:03:38.610> looking<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.239> DIY

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
that can take it from looking like a DIY

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.500 
that can take it from looking like a DIY
to<00:03:40.530> looking<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.730> bought<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.239> store

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
to looking like you bought it in a store

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.199 
to looking like you bought it in a store
I<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:43.140> say<00:03:43.350> making<00:03:43.950> sure<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.180> a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
I would say making sure if you have a

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.720 
I would say making sure if you have a
print<00:03:45.810> or<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.049> pattern<00:03:46.350> that's<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.459> is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
print or a pattern that's that it is

diagonal at all but if you just have a

diagonal at all but if you just have a
solid<00:03:53.370> fabric<00:03:53.970> probably<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.110> corners

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
solid fabric probably just the corners

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.350 
solid fabric probably just the corners
to<00:03:56.100> make<00:03:56.220> sure<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.459> spend<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:56.760> lot<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:56.970> time

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
to make sure you spend a lot of time

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.130 
to make sure you spend a lot of time
make<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.049> good<00:03:58.519> fold<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.850> edge<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
make a good fold and edge so that it

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.570 
make a good fold and edge so that it
doesn't<00:04:01.440> look<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.860> just<00:04:01.890> stapled<00:04:02.430> some

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
doesn't look like you just stapled some

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.509 
doesn't look like you just stapled some
fabric<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.090> forth<00:04:03.440> okay<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.650> also<00:04:05.010> pulling<00:04:05.310> it

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
fabric so forth okay and also pulling it

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.539 
fabric so forth okay and also pulling it
taut<00:04:05.790> yes<00:04:06.390> exactly<00:04:06.780> because<00:04:07.320> if<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.280> don't

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
taut yes exactly because if you don't

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.370 
taut yes exactly because if you don't
get<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.910> tight<00:04:09.150> enough<00:04:09.450> then<00:04:09.900> you'll<00:04:10.140> have<00:04:10.320> a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
get it tight enough then you'll have a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.830 
get it tight enough then you'll have a
little<00:04:10.680> bit<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:10.920> tag<00:04:11.820> inside<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.570> middle

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
little bit of tag inside of the middle

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.490 
little bit of tag inside of the middle
of<00:04:12.930> before<00:04:13.290> okay<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.100> let's<00:04:14.400> talk<00:04:14.670> about<00:04:14.730> and

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
of before okay so let's talk about and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.229 
of before okay so let's talk about and
the<00:04:16.500> nail<00:04:16.739> trim<00:04:17.220> now<00:04:17.459> this<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> little<00:04:18.030> bit

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
the nail trim now this is a little bit

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.240 
the nail trim now this is a little bit
different<00:04:18.750> than

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
different than

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.490 
different than
just<00:04:20.430> regular<00:04:21.150> nails<00:04:21.450> this<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:21.989> quite<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> bit

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
just regular nails this is quite a bit

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.330 
just regular nails this is quite a bit
easier<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.950> use<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.360> with<00:04:25.170> regular<00:04:25.770> nail

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
easier to use it is so with regular nail

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.910 
easier to use it is so with regular nail
trim<00:04:26.790> or<00:04:27.030> just<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.420> standard<00:04:27.690> nail<00:04:28.050> trim<00:04:28.410> you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
trim or just the standard nail trim you

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.210 
trim or just the standard nail trim you
actually<00:04:29.520> know<00:04:29.700> in<00:04:30.000> each<00:04:30.390> one<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.830> nail

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
actually know in each one of the nail

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.580 
actually know in each one of the nail
heads<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.660> kind<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:33.960> nice<00:04:34.230> because

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
heads but this is kind of nice because

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.770 
heads but this is kind of nice because
you<00:04:34.950> only<00:04:35.190> nail<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.970> believe<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.450> is<00:04:36.540> every

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
you only nail and I believe it is every

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.830 
you only nail and I believe it is every
seventh<00:04:37.440> now<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.060> helps<00:04:39.390> making<00:04:39.600> it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
seventh now and so it helps making it

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.600 
seventh now and so it helps making it
straight<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.470> it's<00:04:40.620> just<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.860> lot<00:04:41.040> easier<00:04:41.460> when

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
straight and it's just a lot easier when

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.700 
straight and it's just a lot easier when
you're<00:04:41.790> doing<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.150> yourself<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.350> actually

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
you're doing it yourself so it actually

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.670 
you're doing it yourself so it actually
comes<00:04:43.980> in<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.610> chain<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:46.170> just<00:04:46.380> lay<00:04:46.650> that

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
comes in a chain and you just lay that

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.130 
comes in a chain and you just lay that
out<00:04:46.950> on<00:04:47.340> your<00:04:47.670> headboard<00:04:48.330> making<00:04:48.840> sure<00:04:48.990> it's

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
out on your headboard making sure it's

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.840 
out on your headboard making sure it's
as<00:04:49.290> straight<00:04:49.500> as<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.680> can<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.190> then<00:04:50.460> you<00:04:50.640> use

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
as straight as you can and then you use

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.050 
as straight as you can and then you use
your<00:04:51.060> rubber<00:04:51.210> mallet<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.440> nail<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.680> in

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
your rubber mallet and you nail it in

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.690 
your rubber mallet and you nail it in
every<00:04:54.060> seventh<00:04:54.510> because<00:04:55.230> otherwise<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:56.520> can

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
every seventh because otherwise you can

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.900 
every seventh because otherwise you can
have<00:04:57.169> nails<00:04:58.169> going<00:04:58.590> all<00:04:58.950> over<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.340> place<00:04:59.640> and

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
have nails going all over the place and

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.640 
have nails going all over the place and
that<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.360> one<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.780> hardest<00:05:01.200> parts<00:05:01.410> about

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that is one of the hardest parts about

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.800 
that is one of the hardest parts about
making<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.580> not<00:05:02.820> look<00:05:03.030> like<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> DIY<00:05:03.570> is

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
making this not look like a DIY is

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.350 
making this not look like a DIY is
making<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.680> straight<00:05:05.100> so<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.940> might<00:05:06.120> have<00:05:06.210> to

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
making it straight so you might have to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.420 
making it straight so you might have to
spend<00:05:06.450> a<00:05:06.660> little<00:05:06.780> extra<00:05:06.960> time<00:05:07.350> on<00:05:07.410> it<00:05:07.770> but<00:05:08.010> the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
spend a little extra time on it but the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.550 
spend a little extra time on it but the
high-end<00:05:09.270> look<00:05:09.480> that<00:05:09.660> you<00:05:09.810> get<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.230> end<00:05:10.350> is

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
high-end look that you get in the end is

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.840 
high-end look that you get in the end is
well<00:05:10.950> worth<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.220> time<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.730> spend<00:05:13.580> okay<00:05:14.580> and

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
well worth the time you spend okay and

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.990 
well worth the time you spend okay and
you<00:05:15.000> have<00:05:15.150> done<00:05:15.360> quite<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.690> few<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.230> these<00:05:16.470> and

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
you have done quite a few of these and

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.409 
you have done quite a few of these and
what's<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.180> reaction<00:05:18.480> when<00:05:18.870> people<00:05:19.230> see<00:05:19.950> a

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
what's the reaction when people see a

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.350 
what's the reaction when people see a
DIY<00:05:21.419> headboard<00:05:22.260> dust<00:05:22.950> well<00:05:23.460> typically<00:05:24.060> when

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
DIY headboard dust well typically when

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.200 
DIY headboard dust well typically when
people<00:05:24.660> can't<00:05:24.870> afford<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.560> bedroom<00:05:25.979> set<00:05:26.280> or<00:05:26.700> a

people can't afford a bedroom set or a

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.240 
people can't afford a bedroom set or a

headboard or a bed they just have
nothing<00:05:29.490> there<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:30.960> it's<00:05:31.140> kind<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.440> fun<00:05:31.650> to

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
nothing there and so it's kind of fun to

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.159 
nothing there and so it's kind of fun to
have<00:05:32.070> be<00:05:32.610> able<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.850> have<00:05:33.090> all<00:05:33.390> my<00:05:33.600> bedrooms<00:05:33.990> for
