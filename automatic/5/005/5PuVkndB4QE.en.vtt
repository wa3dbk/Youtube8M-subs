hello<00:00:01.079> everyone<00:00:01.709> that's<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.220> slim<00:00:02.520> from<00:00:02.879> 20<00:00:03.330> bug

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hello everyone that's a slim from 20 bug

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.050 
hello everyone that's a slim from 20 bug
and<00:00:03.929> today<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.740> thought<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.250> showing<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:05.850> the

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
and today I thought of showing you the

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.880 
and today I thought of showing you the
differences<00:00:06.629> between<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.230> file<00:00:07.470> effect

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
differences between the file effect

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.690 
differences between the file effect
Saffiano<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.150> macaron<00:00:09.719> planner<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.700> am

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
Saffiano and the macaron planner I am

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.020 
Saffiano and the macaron planner I am
doing<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.420> voice<00:00:12.750> over<00:00:13.070> because<00:00:14.070> silly<00:00:14.460> me<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
doing a voice over because silly me I

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.620 
doing a voice over because silly me I
forgot<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.960> switch<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.830> mic<00:00:17.130> when<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.060> was

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
forgot to switch on the mic when I was

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
forgot to switch on the mic when I was
recording<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.380> video<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.689> anyway<00:00:21.689> let's<00:00:22.380> move

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
recording the video so anyway let's move

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.790 
recording the video so anyway let's move
on<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:25.140> reason<00:00:25.289> why<00:00:25.470> I'm

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
on with this the reason why I'm

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.740 
on with this the reason why I'm
comparing<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> two<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.420> feel

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
comparing the two is because they feel

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.070 
comparing the two is because they feel
similar<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.619> looks<00:00:28.859> somewhat<00:00:29.189> similar<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
similar and looks somewhat similar to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.560 
similar and looks somewhat similar to
they<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.170> both<00:00:31.439> made<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.250> PU<00:00:32.850> leather<00:00:33.090> which

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
they are both made with PU leather which

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.660 
they are both made with PU leather which
is<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:34.050> genuine<00:00:34.620> leather<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
is not genuine leather and is a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
is not genuine leather and is a
synthetic<00:00:36.510> material<00:00:36.829> they<00:00:37.829> both<00:00:38.100> feel

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
synthetic material they both feel

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.560 
synthetic material they both feel
relatively<00:00:38.879> lightweight

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
relatively lightweight

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840 
relatively lightweight
although<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.260> Saffiano<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.370> tad<00:00:41.610> bit

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
although the Saffiano is a tad bit

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.260 
although the Saffiano is a tad bit
heavier<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.320> Saffiano<00:00:43.530> has<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.340> crosshatch

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
heavier the Saffiano has a crosshatch

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.709 
heavier the Saffiano has a crosshatch
design<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> cover<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:48.270> macaron

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
design on the cover and the macaron

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.950 
design on the cover and the macaron
planar<00:00:49.050> has<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> smoother<00:00:49.890> texture<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> they

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
planar has a smoother texture so they

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.889 
planar has a smoother texture so they
both<00:00:52.230> look<00:00:52.680> similar<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> front<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
both look similar on the front and on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.849 
both look similar on the front and on
the<00:00:54.930> back<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.530> well<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.199> macaron<00:00:58.199> planner<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the back as well the macaron planner is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.000 
the back as well the macaron planner is
actually<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> bit<00:01:00.359> smaller<00:01:01.020> than<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> Saffiano

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
actually a bit smaller than the Saffiano

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.500 
actually a bit smaller than the Saffiano
and<00:01:03.979> but<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> can't<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.519> tell<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.270> big

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and but you can't really tell a big

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.090 
and but you can't really tell a big
difference<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.020> both<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> personal<00:01:07.830> size

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
difference there both in personal size

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.870 
difference there both in personal size
or<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> six<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> let's<00:01:10.860> take<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> look<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
or a six so let's take a look on the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.929 
or a six so let's take a look on the
inside<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> both<00:01:13.350> planners<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
inside of both planners and see what the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:24.370 
inside of both planners and see what the
differences<00:01:15.540> are

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.679 

the<00:01:25.159> macaron<00:01:25.729> planner<00:01:26.119> has<00:01:26.720> four<00:01:28.420> credit<00:01:29.420> card

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
the macaron planner has four credit card

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.870 
the macaron planner has four credit card
slots<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.710> left<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:32.900> long<00:01:33.350> vertical

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
slots on the left and a long vertical

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.719 
slots on the left and a long vertical
chocolate<00:01:34.880> as<00:01:35.720> well<00:01:36.350> as<00:01:36.920> another<00:01:37.280> long

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
chocolate as well as another long

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.560 
chocolate as well as another long
vertical<00:01:38.030> pocket<00:01:38.780> on<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.229> right<00:01:40.180> or<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.390> back

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
vertical pocket on the right or the back

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.240 
vertical pocket on the right or the back
of<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.899> planner<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:46.670> has<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.299> fairly<00:01:47.869> large<00:01:48.530> pen

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
of the planner it has a fairly large pen

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.740 
of the planner it has a fairly large pen
loop<00:01:49.580> on<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.390> top<00:01:50.420> left<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:53.240> can<00:01:53.570> actually

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
loop on the top left and I can actually

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.950 
loop on the top left and I can actually
insert<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.009> know<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.399> five<00:01:55.759> barrel<00:01:56.299> multi<00:01:56.720> pen

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
insert you know a five barrel multi pen

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.919 
insert you know a five barrel multi pen
quite<00:01:57.289> comfortably<00:01:57.979> into<00:01:58.789> that<00:01:59.360> pen<00:01:59.690> loop

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
quite comfortably into that pen loop

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.809 
quite comfortably into that pen loop
which<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.440> really<00:02:00.800> nice<00:02:02.920> as<00:02:03.920> for<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.460> Saffiano

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
which is really nice as for the Saffiano

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.779 
which is really nice as for the Saffiano
it<00:02:05.390> has<00:02:05.720> three<00:02:06.110> credit<00:02:06.679> card<00:02:06.950> slots<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.670> the

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
it has three credit card slots to the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.449 
it has three credit card slots to the
left<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.690> secretarial<00:02:09.350> pocket<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:12.459> it

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
left and a secretarial pocket and it

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.309 
left and a secretarial pocket and it
also<00:02:13.640> has<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.360> note<00:02:14.870> pad<00:02:15.680> slot<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.910> suppose<00:02:17.480> where

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
also has a note pad slot I suppose where

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.050 
also has a note pad slot I suppose where
you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.680> insert<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> note<00:02:19.730> pad

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.650 

and<00:02:26.060> although<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.810> has<00:02:27.020> an<00:02:27.230> elastic<00:02:27.530> pen<00:02:28.069> loop

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
and although it has an elastic pen loop

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.610 
and although it has an elastic pen loop
it<00:02:29.660> cannot<00:02:30.560> really<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:32.120> know<00:02:32.240> fit<00:02:32.690> very<00:02:33.290> very

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
it cannot really you know fit very very

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.970 
it cannot really you know fit very very
big<00:02:33.860> pens<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:35.600> fit<00:02:35.959> most<00:02:36.410> three

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
big pens in it it can fit most three

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.430 
big pens in it it can fit most three
barrel<00:02:37.400> multi<00:02:37.850> pens<00:02:38.150> but<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.230> five

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
barrel multi pens but with the five

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.510 
barrel multi pens but with the five
barrel<00:02:39.890> once<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.580> bit<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.940> tight<00:02:41.180> fit

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
size as the one on the left so you can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.680 
size as the one on the left so you can
fit<00:02:53.840> two<00:02:54.110> FET<00:02:54.920> pens<00:02:55.310> into<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.910> macro<00:02:56.120> planner

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
fit two FET pens into the macro planner

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.860 
fit two FET pens into the macro planner
if<00:02:57.020> you<00:02:57.230> want<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.520> ring<00:02:58.760> on<00:02:58.970> both<00:02:59.209> planners

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
if you want to the ring on both planners

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.530 
if you want to the ring on both planners
are<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.230> bit<00:03:00.530> different<00:03:00.980> as<00:03:01.130> well<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:02.060> macaron

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
are a bit different as well the macaron

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.110 
are a bit different as well the macaron
planner<00:03:02.870> is<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.680> bit<00:03:04.160> smaller<00:03:04.640> than<00:03:04.820> the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
planner is a bit smaller than the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.699 
planner is a bit smaller than the
Saffiano<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.620> believe<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.550> measures<00:03:07.970> around<00:03:08.709> 19

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
Saffiano I believe it measures around 19

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.160 
Saffiano I believe it measures around 19
millimeters<00:03:10.550> where<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.120> Saffiano<00:03:11.450> measures

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
millimeters where the Saffiano measures

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.780 
millimeters where the Saffiano measures
around<00:03:12.440> 23<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.709> bit<00:03:15.860> bigger<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.250> you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
around 23 so it's a bit bigger and you

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.020 
around 23 so it's a bit bigger and you
can<00:03:17.030> insert<00:03:17.510> more<00:03:18.170> pages<00:03:18.830> into<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.640> Saffiano

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
can insert more pages into the Saffiano

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.530 
can insert more pages into the Saffiano
