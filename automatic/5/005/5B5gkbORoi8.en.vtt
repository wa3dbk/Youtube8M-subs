00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.770
 now let's make the adjustments this 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.930
 image we are going to retouch it in white and 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.790
 black and we will touch it in color but 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.820
 all these adjustments is better always 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.470
 make them in color and then at the time of 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.660
 finish giving the final look 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.300
 we make one in color and one in white and 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.250
 black the first thing we're going to do is going to 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.710
 be in color and then let's move on to 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.500
 black and white but we need to make a 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.019
 small adjustment before deciding the dow 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.630
 end let's make a background copy and 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:39.030
 here we are going to put a mark 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.100
 marked what we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.400
 define a little bit these eyes in this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.970
 case I'm going to take the freedom of 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.300
 flick these eyes I make a 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.450
 curves layer 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.910
 with the brush 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.150
 he cleared them lightly 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.890
 too exaggerated a little bit but 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.920
 then we are going to value and we are going to 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.130
 touch to see if it is pertinent to do it or 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.680
 not here we have removed different brightness 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.330
 in the nose and on the forehead with the same 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.520
 procedure that we have seen in 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.200
 video how to remove the forehead but 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.770
 of the nose is removed exactly the same 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.960
 we have the marking layer we're going to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.890
 high pass filter 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.890
 and we accept 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.110
 now blending mode of soft and in what 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.330
 soft 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.270
 we see how all this has been quite 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.820
 more defined then simply command 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.550
 there 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.950
 I now I'm just worrying about these 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.960
 eyes 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.700
 I'm not worrying about all the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.090
 image later I'm going to apply a little 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.899
 to the whole image but I want to highlight 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.280
 the eyes and in this case also highlight 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.280
 the lips 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.479
 we see when they have a little more 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.959
 focus 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.740
 the same on the lips later we can 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.610
 make another pass but basically 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.030
 with this 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.810
 g command 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.180
 we put you high 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.849
 in this case we are going to step high 1 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.000
 and we already have more or less defined a 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:39.310
 little bit more eyes and lips in 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.310
 these lips we could have also 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.550
 define them slightly 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.240
 we make a layer of curves and apply 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.920
 brightness 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.350
 and dark moss slightly 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.120
 darkens mos 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.120
 let's go to the outside 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.800
 to lightly mark the lips 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.840
 same a tad less and as we see 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.210
 we have marked our eyes a lot more and 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.040
 lips in a moment if we see that it is 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.110
 exaggerated because we simply correct and 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.140
 we lower the opacity of each one for 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.040
 adjust that value we have given to the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.040
 eyes and lips
