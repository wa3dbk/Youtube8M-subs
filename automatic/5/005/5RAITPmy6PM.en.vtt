 hello you love it is just great 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hot outside and of course here too 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.099
 upstairs with me in the attic apartment 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.230
 but I still wanted to be with you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 Cook together and that is it 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530

 this is an Indian one 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.730
 staple if you ever had 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.470
 have heard and based on red lenses 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 and is therefore also low carb vehicle 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.240
 should be interested after the oil here 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.720
 we went to the pot 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.650
 first the onions and the two 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.179
 put cloves of garlic in and let them 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.179
 sweat a little golden brown 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.440
 next comes this one 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.409
 spice blend windows are a half 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.110
 teaspoon kurth rendel 1 teaspoon garam 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.330
 Masala a fourth culprit for chili 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.570
 powder and a teaspoon of ground 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.490
 coni with the yarn masala is this year 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.590
 that's already a spice mix 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.070
 we can now you the ingredients 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.320
 read 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.369
 I think it's great and it fits 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.369
 Great in the business 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.940
 the spices are now about 30 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.940
 seconds with connections 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.930
 here are the 100 grams red lentils added 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.080
 about 600 grams of tomato 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:19.099
 300 possibility toko finally and 300 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.099
 milliliters of water 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.019
 it should now boil briefly then 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.000
 I turn the heat down and it should 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.170
 then again about 20 to 30 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.360
 continue cooking for a few minutes 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.790
 that the lenses are through and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.010
 you should do that and of course not 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.010
 forgot that fighters had for 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.080
 Cooked for about 30 minutes 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.569
 can most of the liquid be too 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.209
 Already evaporated the lenses are already 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.640
 great and try it if it is still 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.349
 want to have a little thicker can you 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.540
 of course , continue to cook 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.190
 I think of the consistency like that 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.680
 actually quite good that I have such a 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.880
 I remember a little sugar 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 of course, that still has to be done now 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.670
 Slimming something down there is something else 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.670
 seasoned field and add salt 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.720
 something vettel 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.469
 taste again now 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.090
 tastes quite good but there is 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.090
 some more time 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.820
