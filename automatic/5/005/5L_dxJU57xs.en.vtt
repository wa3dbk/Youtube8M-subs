00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.349
 hello to all of us today 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.869
 see talk about accessories that can 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.239
 find for the faye or so be for 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.430
 the g3 or g4 so it's accessories 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.980
 that I personally bought and that 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.590
 I find it really cool so already 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.629
 for starters I introduced you to the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.969
 extension faye or not that is compatible 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.579
 with the g3 and there I have 4 except that on the 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.390
 g3 you need an adapter that costs 1 95 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.149
 believe something like that 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.500
 and this pair horses 19 euros so in 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.810
 Basically you clip the tour is you 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.250
 around and basically you're going to have 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.960
 really something very long and 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.270
 to make plans for a little higher 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.410
 who make and times very very well so 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.140
 we can put several to put 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.030
 2 3 etc and for 19 euros I find it 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.829
 really cheap and and I'm using 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.269
 quite often and in addition that in carbon 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.439
 it's light enough to wear so I 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.759
 the saying people see me these 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.380
 products it's me who got me 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.840
 so we can see that we have precisely 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.299
 on both sides we can put 2 3 4 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.119
 as I said thanks to the screw 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.799
 it's ram brand manz so these 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.789
 Americans can I tell you 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.090
 already that it is a product 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.459
 fabulous because already it's really 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.380
 no plastic is really good 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.119
 my skills are all that is because in 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.469
 what is it in any case it's great 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.450
 well look mint or slash on 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.619
 wood and it's great and basically 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.389
 it's a sucker that allows you to put 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.060
 the sheet or so you slipped it 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:38.170
 receipt so you have overlooked and there 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.670
 I will not do it live otherwise it 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.409
 takes too much time we will take you 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.959
 your little key here is a small group 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.719
 pro who falls you take your little 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.789
 roeulx small key you will be the species 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.840
 dano we put the faye or is actually 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.369
 if you do not mind, you're going to have 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.380
 something very stable very tight 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.329
 so already there there was slightly tight 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.759
 you will be able to see that when I 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.200
 let's move there we can settle down and 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.609
 at the top thanks to the balls 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.619
 hop there can really put like we 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.880
 want it's like we want in if I want 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.520
 put it like that I put it like that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.990
 ok I'm serving so I did a test on 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.399
 a car I put myself away after the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.090
 test what it gives you will see 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.770
 it's really top 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.300
 that's how you see the age and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.400
 the faye or outside so there is the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.530
 I'm still bumps 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.090
 supporters end of the little holes that's 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.720
 also not very very stable and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.390
 yet look 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.810
 thanks to allah so to the ram accessory 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.430
 min 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.790
 I really have this stability so here we go 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.610
 we serve on 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.200
 it's very simple really i really 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.939
 Well liked this product I think 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.439
 serve quite often because we can 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.319
 put on motorcycles for example etc 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.409
 and speaking about bike bikes 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.540
 et cetera I presented the same 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.150
 mark so ram world is a species of 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.980
 ram the mark like that you have this 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.540
 so it's actually like the role bar 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.540
 basically if you see a little bit 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.030
 how come you have these 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.409
 So that's the Plastiki mingled and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.420
 big you knew if you task and at 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.829
 big bars or small ones 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.170
 bars you have other possibilities 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.189
 like those this little metal piece 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.900
 in any case it's the same as the 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.280
 other and beloved manager has occurred 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.439
 because it's really metal 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.519
 solid it holds very well and for the 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.049
 Philo it's really top 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.280
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.280
