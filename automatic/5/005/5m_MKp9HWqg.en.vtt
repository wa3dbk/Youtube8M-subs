00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.889
 and well that's all according to wineries 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.809
 commenting and I bring you new gameplay of 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.309
 whites 2 as you are looking at the map of 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:12.969
 hydro and 170 is one of the maps that 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.139
 they always give this as I do not know that 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.540
 I have more desire not to play so that 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.040
 play it but usually it really is 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.230
 one of the maps where best games 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.250
 and they take me out I do not know why simply 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.780
 because it's symmetrical because only 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.550
 We are already in three places by which 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.920
 and more or less go people are always 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.200
 leave by the same sides or because not 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.550
 I know what follows is true and I do not know if you 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.740
 will happen and wang imagine if it is that 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.440
 each and every one of the games as 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.329
 that by theme I always go to the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.530
 same sites ie they start to 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.800
 from running a site to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.470
 to go to the other side and pointed to it 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.510
 side and we've taken a little bit a bit 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.130
 strange but I do not know I just wanted to 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.600
 masters say that if he run me 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.610
 or not but it ended up going as I say 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.040
 always to the same sides when starting the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.200
 departure and sunset and on the other hand 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.790
 suddenly they burst me in the objective 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.789
 my mother please to go out there not 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.560
 one more year not then will happen to us what 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:08.090
 same as I say 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.880
 although it is true that many people will say 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.649
 oysters after prayer or same memory 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.450
 let's say they played in the living room and marked 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.520
 half to see if this the same time 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.460
 map does not simply have nothing to 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.560
 see why it depends a lot on with 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.820
 who you play that even if you have same 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.009
 which is always not going to be 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.689
 let's say always enemy the same 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.220
 site encourages you to always do the same or 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.500
 be it has its charm but good 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.090
 as I tell myself personally when 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.679
 to think of oysters is that always 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.439
 with on the same side on the same map 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.090
 so that shows if it works and is the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.159
 best route because after all and 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.080
 tried all and that's where it has better 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.640
 gone why I'm going to change them but 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.439
 well just simply tell me 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.119
 as curiosity as you are seeing 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.009
 lately I have stopped using the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.240
 Thank you high for several reasons first 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.619
 because I got bored you know that always 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.929
 I put to change that if one thing that yes 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.030
 another and in the first place that's what bored me 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.130
 the truth of illustrating high time 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.929
 dryly a streak to take out the wizard 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.110
 and others and on the other hand because 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.580
 It seems that it seems good to me that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.950
 videos then it's more entertaining from time to time 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.200
 when I see the odd streak 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.569
 different and also to do thank you well 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 how to stay bastian 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.900
 I do not know how 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.630
 it's kind of weird to explain how he looks 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.730
 angels oakland we all take it out 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.230
 but then grace is chained to 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.580
 the best 66 a little but 34 hairston that 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.560
 after all it's how I wanted to do 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.600
 a streak of twenty-odd visits is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.160
 a 20-pointer streak only pulling 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.290
 external agents in the end you end up giving 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.480
 very much in fact good does not do more than 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.580
 nothing more than watch the video just that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.340
 I went up yesterday with the sniper that 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.660
 I started killing with the collector had 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.480
 hellstrom and he had 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.860
 the lightning attack and I got blown up because 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.960
 simply because I started throwing one and 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.660
 another and another and another and another and in the end I 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.780
 reason was that it was crazy there are times 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.100
 to kill two with the waves 3 4 3 3 there 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.680
 with the waves that move is like seeing 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.300
 you do not hear the horn that I think I think 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.520
 do not understand but it is challenging and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.260
 saying in plan correct runs that 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.210
 I would have dropped the water people are still 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.580
 dying although it already leads as 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.070
 two months 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.870
 after Tuesday or whether people 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.580
 he also does not know that there is water and 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.690
 water kills you or maybe 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.580
 well so see what we're going for 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.260
 deceive half and kill me 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.910
 cable cars snow map and I know that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.410
 they always happen but good is what there is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.860
 They are the cable cars and they load them 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.560
 Devil 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.100
 so how do I tell you to go back a little 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.930
 topic 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.270
 if I'm using the one of gusts more or 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.270
 sometimes even less low he carried 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.950
 radar counterespionage or took radar the 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.870
 manager or a package help I can not well 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.030
 super super absurd but nevertheless 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.380
 like he's loose pulling things is not 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.030
 to make apart super super 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.210
 play it is called if it is playing 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.310
 the normal game and you're all the time 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.470
 trying here a lot what you see 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.600
 is the gaz is the game 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.090
 started as jerks some as I said 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.610
 if you're trying to play and trying 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.600
 take a super high streak and such and such 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.720
 and when he kills you he says 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.280
 However, I know how to get a gel 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.750
 storm and others that the best can not be 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.180
 take out 3 100 chains the systems of 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.310
 in between so good but let's say 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.810
 you're also going to get a bit of a game 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.420
 normal you will not take the games 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.790
 normal instead of those not so 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.560
 good and a very good not good then 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.609
 as I say to my personally good of 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.480
 he has suddenly changed what he does not want 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.070
 say maybe tomorrow 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.320
 suddenly they should make me put 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.940
 play to be received without gusts or so of 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.160
 madness or me that only with the 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.470
 swarm again with the swarm the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.210
 dogs and the event who knows what also 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.650
 it is true that it is borderlands I know that 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.990
 yes only helicopters but good 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.720
 trying out a little more 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.040
 variety because it is very true you did not have 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.560
 said the comments because I imagine that 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.900
 the right does not know how to get the dogs 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.060
 with a weapon with another weapon and others but 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.560
 yes, not just when it comes to playing 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.910
 Well, as you know, I always got bored 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.950
 to use a bunch of weapons 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.960
 different understand using what I know 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.750
 of advantages and accessories I always do 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.730
 something different then good this time 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.470
 I decide to change the stripes and the 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.060
 truth is that in a moment that you start 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.820
 to chain one streak and another and another and 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.380
 other then you end up feeling like you 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.330
 I say it seems you are not killing 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.510
 too much because it goes to a manager you kill 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.610
 three good one lightning attack you kill 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.890
 another two our pick up all two 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.990
 but at the end of the day this has been loaded 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.450
 seven and seven cards this you take that 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.760
 twice you have more or less let's say that 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.880
 a story streak of 14 per shoe 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.890
 it's done for you're 15 and another 14 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.660
 gift that is the end of the day is what 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.990
 same that maybe you get a swarm 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.670
 how late is it to kill 14 15 so you do not 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.490
 Let it be said simply vary 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.780
 I hope you liked the gameplay with 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.610
 half consider ziad or that is a 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.500
 of my weapons that I like the most 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.820
 lately he is not using too much 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.330
 and by the way I'm using it with 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.150
 east desert camouflage 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.860
 crappy or something strange the new ones that 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.660
 they pulled the ugliest of all because the 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.400
 I had in fact good if you like the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.790
 vice bouncing and see you next one a 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.790
 just all
