00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:09.129 

ok<00:00:06.379> Emily<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.099> way<00:00:07.220> this<00:00:07.460> works<00:00:07.790> is<00:00:08.209> I<00:00:08.840> have<00:00:09.110> a

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
ok Emily the way this works is I have a

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.140 
ok Emily the way this works is I have a
drawing<00:00:09.619> tablet<00:00:09.950> here<00:00:10.459> and<00:00:10.639> whatever<00:00:10.789> I<00:00:11.000> write

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
drawing tablet here and whatever I write

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.260 
drawing tablet here and whatever I write
on<00:00:11.840> this<00:00:12.139> tablet<00:00:12.500> will<00:00:12.920> both<00:00:13.129> see<00:00:13.520> and<00:00:13.820> we<00:00:14.090> can

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
on this tablet will both see and we can

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.769 
on this tablet will both see and we can
solve<00:00:14.510> problems<00:00:15.789> the<00:00:16.789> source<00:00:17.240> of<00:00:17.539> the

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
solve problems the source of the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.779 
solve problems the source of the
problems<00:00:18.350> they<00:00:18.680> can<00:00:18.859> either<00:00:18.980> be<00:00:19.250> verbalized

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
problems they can either be verbalized

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.720 
problems they can either be verbalized
or<00:00:20.269> you<00:00:20.990> can<00:00:21.260> take<00:00:21.590> a<00:00:21.619> picture<00:00:22.039> of<00:00:22.070> them<00:00:22.400> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
or you can take a picture of them and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.939 
or you can take a picture of them and
send<00:00:23.000> them<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.480> me<00:00:23.750> like<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:24.410> see<00:00:24.619> on<00:00:24.650> my

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
send them to me like you see on my

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.170 
send them to me like you see on my
screen<00:00:24.980> here<00:00:25.369> that<00:00:25.940> particular<00:00:26.270> problem<00:00:27.039> if

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
screen here that particular problem if

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.550 
screen here that particular problem if
we're<00:00:29.180> going<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:29.420> verbalize<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:29.930> problem

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
we're going to verbalize a problem

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.189 
we're going to verbalize a problem
either<00:00:30.770> one<00:00:31.190> of<00:00:31.220> us<00:00:31.430> could<00:00:31.699> verbalize<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.239> for

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
either one of us could verbalize it for

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.799 
either one of us could verbalize it for
example<00:00:33.890> let's<00:00:33.920> take<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.809> exponential

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
example let's take the exponential

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.180 
example let's take the exponential
expression<00:00:36.680> eight<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.239> 2x<00:00:39.550> times<00:00:40.839> for<00:00:42.190> to

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
expression eight to the 2x times for to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.389 
expression eight to the 2x times for to
the<00:00:43.429> 3x<00:00:44.949> how<00:00:45.949> would<00:00:46.159> we<00:00:46.309> simplify<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:48.399> um

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
the 3x how would we simplify that um

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.809 
the 3x how would we simplify that um
we'd<00:00:50.389> start<00:00:50.719> by<00:00:50.960> finding<00:00:51.289> a<00:00:51.530> common<00:00:51.829> base<00:00:52.190> so

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
we'd start by finding a common base so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.860 
we'd start by finding a common base so
it<00:00:53.089> would<00:00:53.239> be<00:00:53.420> two<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.679> third<00:00:55.359> ok<00:00:56.359> so<00:00:56.719> we're

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
it would be two to the third ok so we're

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.529 
it would be two to the third ok so we're
going<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.079> write<00:00:57.319> eight<00:00:57.649> as<00:00:58.069> 2<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.999> the<00:00:59.030> third

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
going to write eight as 2 to the third

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.740 
going to write eight as 2 to the third
and<00:00:59.899> parentheses<00:01:01.780> here's<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.989> 2x<00:01:03.379> times<00:01:04.750> 2

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
and parentheses here's the 2x times 2

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.470 
and parentheses here's the 2x times 2
squared<00:01:07.479> Bishop<00:01:08.479> 3x<00:01:10.240> ok<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.540> then<00:01:11.660> what<00:01:12.460> um

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
squared Bishop 3x ok and then what um

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.670 
squared Bishop 3x ok and then what um
and<00:01:14.480> then<00:01:14.750> we<00:01:15.710> did<00:01:16.420> two<00:01:17.420> suspects<00:01:18.260> in<00:01:18.470> both

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
and then we did two suspects in both

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.820 
and then we did two suspects in both
cases<00:01:22.810> applying<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.200> rules<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.680> exponents

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
cases applying the rules of exponents

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.680 
cases applying the rules of exponents
and<00:01:25.610> then<00:01:26.480> what's<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.080> final<00:01:27.380> simplified

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
and then what's the final simplified

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.550 
and then what's the final simplified
expression<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:31.280> would<00:01:31.460> go<00:01:31.640> into<00:01:31.760> 12<00:01:32.560> now

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
expression that would go into 12 now

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.950 
expression that would go into 12 now

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
that me to the plus side we would add

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.160 
that me to the plus side we would add
