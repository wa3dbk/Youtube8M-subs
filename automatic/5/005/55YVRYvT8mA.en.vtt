the ability to change what what you want

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.420 
the ability to change what what you want
and<00:04:09.570> everything<00:04:09.780> but<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.830> know<00:04:10.860> those<00:04:11.160> kind

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
and everything but you know those kind

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.730 
and everything but you know those kind
of<00:04:11.520> situations<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.570> setup<00:04:13.020> from<00:04:13.350> quality

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
of situations that setup from quality

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.490 
of situations that setup from quality
for<00:04:14.010> forced<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.820> gunplay<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:16.230> think

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
for forced the gunplay and I think

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.199 
for forced the gunplay and I think
people<00:04:16.770> have<00:04:17.130> gone<00:04:17.459> away<00:04:17.640> from<00:04:17.940> in<00:04:18.060> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
people have gone away from in and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.990 
people have gone away from in and
they're<00:04:18.330> so<00:04:18.750> reliant<00:04:19.230> on<00:04:19.590> on<00:04:19.920> kill<00:04:20.609> streaks

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
they're so reliant on on kill streaks

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.840 
they're so reliant on on kill streaks
and<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.720> forth<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.710> have<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.950> good<00:04:23.220> game<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.760> I

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and so forth to have a good game and I

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.190 
and so forth to have a good game and I
think<00:04:23.910> that's<00:04:24.210> weakened<00:04:24.570> players<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.080> has

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
think that's weakened players and it has

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.480 
think that's weakened players and it has
allowed<00:04:25.470> people<00:04:25.950> like<00:04:26.100> myself<00:04:26.340> these

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
allowed people like myself these

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.909 
allowed people like myself these
old-school<00:04:27.729> crotchety<00:04:28.509> gamers<00:04:29.110> when<00:04:29.830> they

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919

play something like this to excel and
and<00:04:32.919> I'm<00:04:33.039> that's<00:04:33.550> why<00:04:33.819> I'm<00:04:33.940> probably<00:04:34.180> loving

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
and I'm that's why I'm probably loving

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.480 
and I'm that's why I'm probably loving
it<00:04:34.780> but<00:04:35.199> here's<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.560> thing<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:36.190> talk<00:04:36.370> about

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490

of<00:04:43.770> having<00:04:44.770> so<00:04:45.460> many<00:04:45.639> kill<00:04:45.940> streets<00:04:46.210> in<00:04:46.360> the

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
of having so many kill streets in the

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.390 
of having so many kill streets in the
game<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.810> don't<00:04:47.050> like<00:04:47.229> it<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.560> like<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.949> think<00:04:48.310> it

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
game I don't like it I like I think it

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.760 
game I don't like it I like I think it
takes<00:04:48.550> away<00:04:48.729> from<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.419> gun<00:04:49.720> on<00:04:49.840> gun<00:04:50.110> skill<00:04:50.530> the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.320 
takes away from the gun on gun skill the
gun<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.069> gunfights<00:04:51.520> which<00:04:51.789> is<00:04:51.940> what<00:04:52.180> this

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
gun and gunfights which is what this

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.020 
gun and gunfights which is what this
game<00:04:52.539> is<00:04:52.750> usually<00:04:52.900> about<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.500> think<00:04:53.889> it<00:04:54.130> you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
game is usually about I think it you

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.800 
game is usually about I think it you
know<00:04:55.150> there's<00:04:55.330> nothing<00:04:55.599> wrong<00:04:55.750> with

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
know there's nothing wrong with

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.529 
know there's nothing wrong with
killstreaks<00:04:56.380> I<00:04:56.470> liked<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.860> when<00:04:56.949> it<00:04:57.039> was<00:04:57.130> three

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
killstreaks I liked it when it was three

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.589 
killstreaks I liked it when it was three
but<00:04:58.539> having<00:04:58.900> like<00:04:59.250> so<00:05:00.250> many<00:05:00.520> kill<00:05:00.880> streets<00:05:01.180> and

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
but having like so many kill streets and

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:02.610 
but having like so many kill streets and
then<00:05:01.720> changing<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.289> up

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
then changing it up

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.550 
then changing it up
you've<00:05:02.919> got<00:05:03.159> more<00:05:03.460> opportunity<00:05:04.120> for

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
you've got more opportunity for

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.809 
you've got more opportunity for
situations<00:05:05.560> where<00:05:05.710> it's<00:05:05.830> unbalanced<00:05:06.310> Jesus<00:05:06.699> I

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
situations where it's unbalanced Jesus I

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.180

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
a situation like a maniac kid I would

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.100 
a situation like a maniac kid I would
argue<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.909> I'm<00:05:16.240> not<00:05:16.479> wanting<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:16.870> start

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
argue and I'm not wanting to start

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.200 
argue and I'm not wanting to start
saying<00:05:17.349> oh<00:05:17.470> this<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.979> low<00:05:18.099> P<00:05:18.280> or<00:05:18.400> that<00:05:18.580> o<00:05:18.610> P<00:05:18.940> but

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
saying oh this is low P or that o P but

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.670 
saying oh this is low P or that o P but
if<00:05:19.300> you're<00:05:19.419> gonna<00:05:19.539> talk<00:05:19.750> about<00:05:19.930> Opie<00:05:20.289> I<00:05:20.319> think

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
if you're gonna talk about Opie I think

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.309 
if you're gonna talk about Opie I think
the<00:05:20.770> maniac<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.819> use<00:05:22.090> it<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.509> think<00:05:23.229> the

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
the maniac and I use it I think the

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.830 
the maniac and I use it I think the
maniac<00:05:23.680> is<00:05:23.889> slightly<00:05:24.280> overpowered<00:05:24.789> and<00:05:25.360> the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
maniac is slightly overpowered and the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.029 
maniac is slightly overpowered and the
only<00:05:25.990> reason<00:05:26.259> why<00:05:26.380> I'm<00:05:26.500> saying<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:26.919> is

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
only reason why I'm saying that is

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.850 
only reason why I'm saying that is
because<00:05:27.280> it's<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:28.630> hard<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.289> kill<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.680> maniac

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
because it's so hard to kill the maniac

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.490 
because it's so hard to kill the maniac
once<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.340> maniacs<00:05:30.789> out<00:05:31.030> good<00:05:31.870> luck
