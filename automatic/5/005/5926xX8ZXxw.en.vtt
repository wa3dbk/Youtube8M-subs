00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that even the stack is well done not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
that even the stack is well done not
very<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.830> chrome<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.430> looks<00:01:11.610> chrome

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
very much chrome but it looks chrome

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.990 
very much chrome but it looks chrome
esque<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.290> exactly<00:01:13.770> chrome<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
esque but it's not exactly chrome so the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
esque but it's not exactly chrome so the
top<00:01:15.240> inside<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.860> looks<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
inside pretty nice you know standard ma

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
inside pretty nice you know standard ma
n<00:01:20.130> truck<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> inside<00:01:21.030> nothing<00:01:21.360> too<00:01:21.570> crazy

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
n truck on the inside nothing too crazy

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
n truck on the inside nothing too crazy
I<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.830> believe<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.220> has<00:01:23.430> any<00:01:25.070> controls<00:01:26.070> no

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
I don't believe it has any controls no

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.300 
I don't believe it has any controls no
apparently<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> mirrors<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.950> i<00:01:28.979> turn<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
apparently the mirrors can i turn the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.060 
apparently the mirrors can i turn the
mirrors<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.909> off<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.270> anything<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
mirrors on or off or anything like that

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.260 
mirrors on or off or anything like that
now<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.340> apparently<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> one

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
now so apparently that's the one

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.520 
now so apparently that's the one
downfalls<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> mirrors<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.740> work<00:01:36.530> alright

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
downfalls the mirrors don't work alright

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.319 
downfalls the mirrors don't work alright

see the drift wheel works perfectly fine
or<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:37.180> hitch<00:03:37.480> works<00:03:37.750> perfectly<00:03:38.200> fine<00:03:38.440> let's

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
or that hitch works perfectly fine let's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.369 
or that hitch works perfectly fine let's
just<00:03:38.769> send<00:03:39.069> us<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.340> little<00:03:39.579> bit<00:03:39.730> there<00:03:39.909> we<00:03:40.000> go

not a problem there yeah they did an
early<00:03:43.420> nice<00:03:43.510> job<00:03:43.750> on<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:45.519> not<00:03:45.609> going<00:03:45.760> to

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
early nice job on that I'm not going to

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.280 
early nice job on that I'm not going to
test<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.180> trailer<00:03:46.450> out<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.049> works

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
test the trailer out so that works

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.240 
test the trailer out so that works
excellent<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:48.670> we<00:03:48.849> should<00:03:48.879> be<00:03:49.060> able<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.389> use

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
excellent so we should be able to use

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.970 
excellent so we should be able to use
let's<00:03:51.250> see<00:03:51.430> we<00:03:51.609> should<00:03:51.670> be<00:03:51.940> able<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.269> use<00:03:52.980> one

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
let's see we should be able to use one

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.839 
let's see we should be able to use one
of<00:03:55.379> this<00:03:56.379> which<00:03:56.739> is<00:03:56.889> a<00:03:56.919> high<00:03:57.160> hitch<00:03:57.370> i<00:03:57.519> believe

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
of this which is a high hitch i believe

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.170 
of this which is a high hitch i believe
and<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:59.500> which<00:03:59.739> i<00:03:59.859> believe<00:03:59.919> is<00:04:00.280> not<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.849> high

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
and this which i believe is not a high

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.960 
and this which i believe is not a high
hitch<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:03.040> let's<00:04:03.160> give<00:04:03.310> both<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.549> those<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.819> try

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
hitch so let's give both of those a try

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.059 
hitch so let's give both of those a try
real<00:04:04.419> quick<00:04:04.690> can<00:04:05.379> you<00:04:05.440> use<00:04:05.650> differential

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
real quick can you use differential

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.250 
real quick can you use differential
locks<00:04:06.430> yes<00:04:06.699> is<00:04:06.849> considered<00:04:07.269> differential

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
locks yes is considered differential
