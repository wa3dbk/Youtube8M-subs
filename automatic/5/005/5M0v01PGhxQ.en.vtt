00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Twice a year, when changing summer and winter tires, 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.500
 the driver has a problem 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.000
 safe transportation of tires. 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 Since the trunk is rather small 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.000
 and the tires are quite large, the question often arises: 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.550
 how to transport tires in a car 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.550
 and, of course, how to fix them in the car. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 If during the carriage of tires you get into an accident, 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.300
 wrong load 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.400
 may lead to serious consequences. 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.000
 For example, a good place to transport - 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.500
 behind the rear seats, moreover 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.200
 tires must be secured with a strap. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.300
 If due to lack of space 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 the boot lid does not close, 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.400
 You can unlock the seat backs. 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.000
 In this case, be sure 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.000
 fasten the seat belts diagonally. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 The ADAC crash track test shows 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.000
 that in this case the main load falls 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 on the backs of the rear seats, 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.000
 and the driver and passenger 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.000
 Do not take any damage from the tires. 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.300
 The load was secured correctly 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.000
 and we see only minor damage 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.000
 rear seats that take the brunt of the blow, 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.000
 and also easy deformation in places of fastening of tires. 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.000
 During the second experiment 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 seat backs have been lowered and tires laid flat, 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.000
 to lower the center of gravity. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Since this time 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.000
 there were no additional belt mounts, 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.000
 the impact force of the tires fell on the front seats 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 subjected to severe deformation. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.000
 Tires forward 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.300
 hit the driver and passenger in the back. 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 This means severe back injury: 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.100
 spine, neck and possibly head. 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.000
 Increased load and seat belts 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.100
 also caused damage 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.300
 chest driver and passenger. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 The best way to transport tires is in the trunk, 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.200
 behind the passenger seats 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.300
 when possible, tires should be transported flat, 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.100
 to lower the center of gravity, 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.000
 securing tires with a strap, 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.500
 to prevent them from spontaneously moving.
