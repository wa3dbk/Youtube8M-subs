00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
guys alright so what does this part do

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.700 
guys alright so what does this part do
well<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.970> motor<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.479> what<00:01:06.720> releases<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
well this motor is what releases the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.070 
well this motor is what releases the
latch<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.280> either<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.820> fuel<00:01:09.060> door<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
latch on either the fuel door or the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
latch on either the fuel door or the
trunk<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.650> ton<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.250> different<00:01:11.670> Volkswagens

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
trunk on a ton of different Volkswagens

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.840 
trunk on a ton of different Volkswagens
basically<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:13.560> there's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> button<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
basically if there's a button in the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.940 
basically if there's a button in the
door<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.810> probably<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.530> car<00:01:16.770> has

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
door this is probably what your car has

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.280 
door this is probably what your car has
so<00:01:17.280> basically<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.000> pops<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.689> fuel<00:01:18.900> door<00:01:19.080> or

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so basically it pops the fuel door or

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
so basically it pops the fuel door or
pops<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> trunk<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.400> does<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> work<00:01:20.880> when

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
pops the trunk so how does it work when

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
pops the trunk so how does it work when
you<00:01:21.509> push<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:21.990> switch<00:01:22.409> powers<00:01:22.920> applied<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you push your switch powers applied to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.969 
you push your switch powers applied to
this<00:01:23.520> motor<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.810> motor<00:01:24.990> rotates<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.650> pulls

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this motor as the motor rotates it pulls

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
this motor as the motor rotates it pulls
the<00:01:26.189> arm<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.240> that's<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.110> releases

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the arm back and that's what releases

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160 
the arm back and that's what releases
the<00:01:28.799> door<00:01:29.040> while<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.939> motor<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.390> rotating

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the door while the motor is rotating

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.460 
the door while the motor is rotating
this<00:01:31.890> nylon<00:01:32.369> gear<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.270> also<00:01:33.509> winds<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this nylon gear here it also winds up a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.160 
this nylon gear here it also winds up a
spring<00:01:34.950> inside<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.759> red<00:01:36.000> piece<00:01:36.270> by<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
spring inside of this red piece by the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
spring inside of this red piece by the
time<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> gets<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> way<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
time it gets all the way back to the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.289 
time it gets all the way back to the
travel<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.650> stops<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.490> then

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
travel as you can see it stops and then

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.120 
travel as you can see it stops and then
the<00:01:42.420> spring<00:01:42.720> tension<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.350> rotates<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the spring tension is what rotates it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280 
the spring tension is what rotates it
and<00:01:44.340> pushes<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> arm<00:01:45.210> back<00:01:45.540> out<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.110> that's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and pushes the arm back out and that's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
and pushes the arm back out and that's

how<00:01:49.920> does<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.189> fail<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.060> fail<00:01:51.240> in

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
how does it fail well it can fail in

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.630 
how does it fail well it can fail in
about<00:01:51.570> five<00:01:51.780> different<00:01:51.990> ways<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.460> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
about five different ways one and this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
about five different ways one and this
is<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.600> failed<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
is actually how this one failed the

is actually how this one failed the
nylon<00:01:56.040> gear<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.520> break<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.030> see<00:01:57.360> that

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
nylon gear can break you can see that

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.539 
nylon gear can break you can see that
the<00:01:57.840> teeth<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.259> all<00:01:58.380> ground<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.310> here

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549

on the little black nylon gear and this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.789 
on the little black nylon gear and this
can<00:02:02.369> make<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.670> either<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.719> release<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
can make it either not release so it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.429 
can make it either not release so it
won't<00:02:04.979> pull<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.850> it'll<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.299> stuck<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.079> held

won't pull or it'll get stuck in a held
open<00:02:07.979> position<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.030> whatever<00:02:09.390> part<00:02:09.780> it's

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
open position so whatever part it's

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.410

able to latch

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.380 
able to latch
motor<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.160> fail<00:02:14.459> electrically<00:02:15.180> or

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
motor can also fail electrically or

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.030 
motor can also fail electrically or
mechanically<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.260> get<00:02:16.440> bound<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.830> inside

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
mechanically and get bound up inside

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.759 
mechanically and get bound up inside
I've<00:02:17.550> also<00:02:17.790> seen<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.330> shaft<00:02:18.810> break<00:02:19.319> as<00:02:19.560> well

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
I've also seen this shaft break as well

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.440 
I've also seen this shaft break as well
so<00:02:20.250> you'll<00:02:20.400> hear<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> motor<00:02:20.910> turning<00:02:21.209> but

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
so you'll hear the motor turning but

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.300 
so you'll hear the motor turning but
I'll<00:02:21.540> never<00:02:21.810> move<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.319> arm<00:02:22.500> I've<00:02:22.860> also<00:02:23.069> seen

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
I'll never move this arm I've also seen

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.589 
I'll never move this arm I've also seen
a<00:02:23.370> fair<00:02:23.640> amount<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> connector<00:02:24.390> ends

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
a fair amount of the connector ends

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.759 
a fair amount of the connector ends
corrode<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.230> something<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.620> also

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
corrode so that's something you also

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.380 
corrode so that's something you also
want<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.129> take<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.580> look<00:02:26.819> at<00:02:27.000> when<00:02:27.269> you're

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
want to take a look at when you're

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.330 
want to take a look at when you're
trying<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> diagnose<00:02:28.319> this<00:02:28.530> part<00:02:28.830> how<00:02:29.129> do<00:02:29.190> we

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
trying to diagnose this part how do we

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.490 
trying to diagnose this part how do we
know<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.640> failed<00:02:29.970> well<00:02:30.269> either<00:02:30.959> our<00:02:31.230> trunk

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
know this failed well either our trunk

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.380 
know this failed well either our trunk
won't<00:02:31.709> open<00:02:32.010> or<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> fuel<00:02:32.519> door<00:02:32.700> won't<00:02:32.910> open<00:02:33.209> or

won't open or a fuel door won't open or

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.059 
won't open or a fuel door won't open or
it<00:02:33.629> won't<00:02:33.780> close<00:02:34.110> depending<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.769> which

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
it won't close depending on which

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.800 
it won't close depending on which
position<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.670> got<00:02:35.819> stuck<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.629> could

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
position it got stuck in and this could

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.420 
position it got stuck in and this could
be<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> static<00:02:37.319> thing<00:02:37.500> or<00:02:37.709> an<00:02:37.920> intermittent

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
be a static thing or an intermittent

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.979 
be a static thing or an intermittent
thing<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:38.910> really<00:02:39.209> depends<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.690> how<00:02:39.810> it

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
thing it all really depends on how it

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.050 
thing it all really depends on how it
failed<00:02:40.230> how<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.709> diagnose<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.310> well<00:02:41.489> we

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
failed how do we diagnose it well we

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.130 
failed how do we diagnose it well we
need<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.239> make<00:02:42.360> sure<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:42.629> got<00:02:42.720> power<00:02:43.019> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
need to make sure we got power and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.800 
need to make sure we got power and
ground<00:02:43.769> at<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.489> you'll<00:02:45.060> need<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.269> meter<00:02:45.540> or

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
ground at this so you'll need a meter or

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.449 
ground at this so you'll need a meter or
a<00:02:45.840> test<00:02:46.170> light<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.650> you'll<00:02:46.829> want<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.130> have

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
a test light and you'll want to have

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.370 
a test light and you'll want to have
someone<00:02:47.819> else<00:02:47.849> hit<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.269> button<00:02:48.569> check<00:02:49.200> for

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
someone else hit the button check for

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.020 
someone else hit the button check for
power<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.799> check<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.069> ground<00:02:50.459> power<00:02:50.849> and

power and check for ground power and
ground<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.299> good<00:02:51.450> sometimes<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.140> tap<00:02:52.410> on

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
ground is good sometimes you can tap on

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.410 
ground is good sometimes you can tap on
them<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.220> get<00:02:53.400> them<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.610> work<00:02:53.640> again<00:02:54.120> again

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
them and get them to work again again

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.150 
them and get them to work again again
depending<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.900> how<00:02:55.049> they<00:02:55.230> failed<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.799> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
depending on how they failed if the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.039 
depending on how they failed if the
shaft<00:02:56.400> inside<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.060> broke<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.900> it's

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
shaft inside of here broke you know it's

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.690 
shaft inside of here broke you know it's
never<00:02:58.170> going<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.410> work<00:02:58.560> again<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.519> if<00:02:59.610> that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
never going to work again but if that

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.130 
never going to work again but if that
was<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.879> case<00:03:00.120> you'd<00:03:00.269> probably<00:03:00.690> hear<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> motor

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
was a case you'd probably hear the motor

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.410 
was a case you'd probably hear the motor
turning<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.980> can<00:03:02.370> try<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.910> repair<00:03:03.239> these

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
turning you can try and repair these

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.270 
turning you can try and repair these
depending<00:03:04.049> again<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.349> how<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.739> fails<00:03:04.980> but

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
depending again on how it fails but

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.100 
depending again on how it fails but
honestly<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:05.849> not<00:03:06.030> worth<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.540> because<00:03:06.900> if

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
honestly it's not worth it because if

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.530 
honestly it's not worth it because if
you<00:03:07.260> take<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:07.950> apart<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> fix<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.120> this

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
you take this apart and fix it and this

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.420 
you take this apart and fix it and this
little<00:03:09.599> gear<00:03:10.140> has<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.379> broken<00:03:10.680> tooth<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.250> it

little gear has a broken tooth on it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.039 
little gear has a broken tooth on it
odds<00:03:11.940> are<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.329> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> get<00:03:12.629> stuck<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:12.989> that

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
odds are it's going to get stuck on that

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.050 
odds are it's going to get stuck on that
broken<00:03:13.349> tooth<00:03:13.650> again<00:03:13.950> at<00:03:14.069> some<00:03:14.280> point<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:14.879> when

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
broken tooth again at some point so when

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.539 
broken tooth again at some point so when
can<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.269> expect<00:03:15.629> this<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> fail<00:03:16.230> well<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:17.400> is

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
can we expect this to fail well this is

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.280 
can we expect this to fail well this is
usually<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> higher<00:03:18.329> mileage<00:03:18.630> higher<00:03:19.019> use

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
usually a higher mileage higher use

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.349 
usually a higher mileage higher use
failure<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.519> more<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.790> use<00:03:20.850> your<00:03:20.970> trunk

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
failure so the more you use your trunk

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.180 
failure so the more you use your trunk
the<00:03:21.510> more<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.840> use<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.079> fuel<00:03:22.500> door<00:03:22.680> odds<00:03:22.950> are

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the more you use the fuel door odds are

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.640 
the more you use the fuel door odds are
the<00:03:23.370> more<00:03:23.700> likely<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.299> will<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.840> fail<00:03:25.109> so

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the more likely this will be to fail so

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.379 
the more likely this will be to fail so
you<00:03:25.680> diesel<00:03:26.220> customers<00:03:26.609> may<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.970> leg<00:03:27.209> up

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
you diesel customers may have a leg up

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.620 
you diesel customers may have a leg up
on<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.720> failure<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.709> DIY<00:03:29.030> maybe<00:03:30.030> some

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
on this failure is it a DIY maybe some

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.120 
on this failure is it a DIY maybe some
of<00:03:30.750> these<00:03:30.840> are<00:03:31.019> really<00:03:31.290> buried<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.010> got

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
of these are really buried and you got

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.890 
of these are really buried and you got
to<00:03:32.250> disassemble<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.819> entire<00:03:33.180> trunk<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.720> get

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
to disassemble the entire trunk to get

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.960 
to disassemble the entire trunk to get
to<00:03:34.079> them<00:03:34.260> some<00:03:35.069> of<00:03:35.099> them<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> way<00:03:35.609> they<00:03:35.760> bolt

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
to them some of them the way they bolt

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.910 
to them some of them the way they bolt
on<00:03:36.120> they<00:03:36.299> bolt<00:03:36.480> onto<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> plate<00:03:37.170> completely

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
on they bolt onto a plate completely

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.559 
on they bolt onto a plate completely
backwards<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.760> got<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.000> take<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.269> plate

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
backwards so you got to take this plate

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.390 
backwards so you got to take this plate
off<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.019> then<00:03:40.139> take<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.620> motor<00:03:40.829> off<00:03:41.010> put<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
off and then take the motor off put the
