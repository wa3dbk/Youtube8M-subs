and we're going to show you guys exactly
why

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
why

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.599 
why
so<00:00:27.089> let's<00:00:27.300> first<00:00:27.599> pull<00:00:27.929> up<00:00:27.960> our<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.609> finder

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
so let's first pull up our little finder

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
so let's first pull up our little finder
or<00:00:29.789> our<00:00:29.970> Explorer<00:00:30.359> window<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.560> we're

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
or our Explorer window and what we're

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
or our Explorer window and what we're
going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.190> create<00:00:32.430> two<00:00:33.000> windows<00:00:33.360> put

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
going to do is create two windows put

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
going to do is create two windows put
them<00:00:33.780> side<00:00:33.960> by<00:00:33.990> side<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.560> we<00:00:34.650> can<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.980> kind<00:00:35.580> of

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
them side by side so we can see kind of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.650 
them side by side so we can see kind of
two<00:00:35.820> different<00:00:36.060> locations

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
two different locations

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.530 
two different locations
now<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:37.890> say<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> our<00:00:38.850> card

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
now let's say that this is our card

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
now let's say that this is our card
drive<00:00:39.810> and<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.650> is<00:00:40.920> even

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
drive and what we want to do is even

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680

though you know we don't typically

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.360 
though you know we don't typically

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
example we're not pulling everything

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.520 
example we're not pulling everything
because<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.869> gonna<00:01:21.960> take<00:01:22.049> forever<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
because it's gonna take forever to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.349 
because it's gonna take forever to
transfer<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.490> we're<00:01:23.609> gonna<00:01:23.729> say<00:01:23.939> drag<00:01:24.210> and

photos<00:01:36.600> from<00:01:36.810> each<00:01:36.990> card<00:01:37.229> drag<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.100> drop<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
photos from each card drag and drop it

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.389 
photos from each card drag and drop it
in<00:01:38.579> okay<00:01:39.409> next<00:01:40.409> time<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.859> you'll<00:01:40.979> notice<00:01:41.189> guys

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
in okay next time and you'll notice guys

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.889 
in okay next time and you'll notice guys
that<00:01:41.579> I'm<00:01:41.670> actually<00:01:41.819> making<00:01:41.999> duplicates

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that I'm actually making duplicates

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.480 
that I'm actually making duplicates
right<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> them<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.100> new<00:01:44.249> some

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
right now so some of them are new some

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.949 
right now so some of them are new some
of<00:01:44.549> them<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:44.729> duplicates<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.569> is<00:01:45.749> why

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
of them are duplicates and this is why

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.440 
of them are duplicates and this is why
we're<00:01:46.380> gonna<00:01:46.439> recommend<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> system<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.090> then

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
we're gonna recommend the system so then

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.879 
we're gonna recommend the system so then
we're<00:01:48.539> going<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.079> fake<00:01:49.319> card<00:01:49.590> three

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
we're going to go on to fake card three

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.469 
we're going to go on to fake card three
and<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.429> on<00:01:50.609> you're<00:01:50.789> gonna<00:01:50.880> keep<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and so on you're gonna keep going to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.120 
and so on you're gonna keep going to
card<00:01:51.719> four<00:01:51.959> until<00:01:52.289> you<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.039> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
card four until you get all of the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
card four until you get all of the
images<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.670> every<00:01:53.999> one<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.270> cards

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
images from every one of your cards

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.080 
images from every one of your cards
import<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.109> now<00:01:55.889> what<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.279> does<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.939> we

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
import it now what this does is like we

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.330 
import it now what this does is like we
said<00:01:57.209> before<00:01:57.469> there<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.499> no<00:01:58.649> way<00:01:59.039> for<00:01:59.069> your

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
said before there is no way for your

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
said before there is no way for your
file<00:01:59.609> system<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.179> be<00:02:00.270> able<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.509> tell<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:01.020> an

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
file system to be able to tell if an

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.919 
file system to be able to tell if an
image<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.709> a<00:02:01.740> duplicate<00:02:02.279> if<00:02:02.429> or<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:02.969> okay<00:02:03.749> if

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
image is a duplicate if or not okay if

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.349 
image is a duplicate if or not okay if
the<00:02:04.109> file<00:02:04.319> name<00:02:04.529> is<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.979> exact<00:02:05.340> same<00:02:05.639> it's

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
the file name is the exact same it's

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.879 
the file name is the exact same it's
going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.749> treated<00:02:07.079> as<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> duplicate<00:02:07.679> and

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
going to be treated as a duplicate and

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.649 
going to be treated as a duplicate and
Windows<00:02:08.280> or<00:02:08.489> Mac<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> ask<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.539> if

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
Windows or Mac is going to ask you if

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.199 
Windows or Mac is going to ask you if
you<00:02:09.780> want<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.170> replace<00:02:10.679> copy<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.400> overwrite<00:02:11.819> or

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
you want to replace copy or overwrite or

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.550 
you want to replace copy or overwrite or
do<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.599> want<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> change<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.200> names<00:02:13.379> or

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
do you want to change the names or

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
do you want to change the names or
whatever<00:02:13.860> when<00:02:14.489> you're<00:02:14.640> bringing<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
whatever when you're bringing it in and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.960 
whatever when you're bringing it in and
copying<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.110> from<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> card<00:02:16.680> okay<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.819> now

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
copying it from the card okay that now

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.370 
copying it from the card okay that now
the<00:02:18.030> problem<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:18.989> not<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the problem with that is if it's not a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.050 
the problem with that is if it's not a
duplicate<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.220> end<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.400> replacing<00:02:20.670> it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
duplicate and you end up replacing it

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.630 
duplicate and you end up replacing it
well<00:02:21.630> then<00:02:21.870> you've<00:02:22.050> deleted<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.430> know<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
well then you've deleted do you know the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.670 
well then you've deleted do you know the
images<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.360> originals<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
images that are originals and you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.890 
images that are originals and you
replaced<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.190> with<00:02:26.220> other<00:02:26.430> images<00:02:26.819> if<00:02:27.300> they

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
replaced it with other images if they

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.390 
replaced it with other images if they
are<00:02:28.080> duplicates<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.190> end<00:02:29.220> up

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
are duplicates then you just end up

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.520 
are duplicates then you just end up
creating<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.420> know<00:02:30.540> using<00:02:30.810> up<00:02:31.019> extra<00:02:31.349> space

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
creating you know using up extra space

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.229 
creating you know using up extra space
on<00:02:31.650> your<00:02:31.709> hard<00:02:31.830> drive<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:32.220> duplicate<00:02:32.849> images

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
on your hard drive for duplicate images

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.240 
on your hard drive for duplicate images
so<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> why<00:02:34.769> we're<00:02:34.920> going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.069> organize

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
so this is why we're going to organize

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.890 
so this is why we're going to organize
it<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.640> all<00:02:35.730> these<00:02:35.849> different<00:02:35.910> cards<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.660> what

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
it in all these different cards and what

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.729 
it in all these different cards and what
we're<00:02:36.989> gonna<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.380> we're<00:02:37.470> gonna<00:02:37.560> let

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
we're gonna do is we're gonna let

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.830 
we're gonna do is we're gonna let
Lightroom<00:02:38.160> decide<00:02:38.489> after<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.209> get<00:02:39.420> all<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.660> our

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
Lightroom decide after we get all of our

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.199 
Lightroom decide after we get all of our
cards<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.220> let's<00:02:41.459> keep<00:02:41.610> going<00:02:41.670> let's<00:02:42.090> go

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
cards in so let's keep going let's go

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.910 
cards in so let's keep going let's go
say<00:02:42.390> card<00:02:42.750> five<00:02:43.230> we'll<00:02:43.470> say<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.769> there<00:02:43.860> was

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
say card five we'll say that there was

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.979 
say card five we'll say that there was
total<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> six<00:02:44.700> cards<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.510> shoot<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
total of six cards on this shoot and

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.570 
total of six cards on this shoot and
they<00:02:46.470> came<00:02:46.650> from<00:02:46.860> say<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> few<00:02:47.370> different

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
they came from say a few different

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.180 
they came from say a few different
cameras<00:02:47.940> we'll<00:02:48.120> go<00:02:48.239> down<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.190> we'll

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
cameras we'll go down here and we'll

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.990 
cameras we'll go down here and we'll
pull<00:02:50.430> some<00:02:51.420> from<00:02:51.630> here<00:02:51.989> drag<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.430> I'm

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
pull some from here drag it in and I'm

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.020 
pull some from here drag it in and I'm
and<00:02:54.239> once<00:02:54.600> again<00:02:54.840> guys<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:56.130> example<00:02:56.610> here<00:02:56.819> is

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
and once again guys the example here is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.640 
and once again guys the example here is
we're<00:02:57.390> pulling<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.840> from<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.170> same<00:02:58.349> card

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
we're pulling it all from the same card

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.020 
we're pulling it all from the same card
but<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> want<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> think<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.940> know

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
but I want you to think of you know

but I want you to think of you know
basically<00:03:00.599> what<00:03:00.900> we're<00:03:01.110> doing<00:03:01.140> every<00:03:01.590> single

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
basically what we're doing every single

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.039 
basically what we're doing every single
time<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.220> pulling<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.700> from<00:03:02.790> different<00:03:03.269> cards

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
time is pulling it from different cards

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.539 
time is pulling it from different cards
so<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:04.349> each<00:03:04.500> one<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.739> these<00:03:04.830> we're<00:03:05.160> ejecting

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
so with each one of these we're ejecting

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.490 
so with each one of these we're ejecting
the<00:03:05.640> card<00:03:05.819> after<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.120> finishes<00:03:06.390> we're<00:03:07.230> getting

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the card after it finishes we're getting

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.140 
the card after it finishes we're getting
a<00:03:07.560> new<00:03:07.709> card<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.099> importing<00:03:08.670> everything<00:03:08.790> from

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
a new card and importing everything from

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.630 
a new card and importing everything from
that<00:03:09.209> new<00:03:09.390> card<00:03:09.630> right<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.049> these<00:03:10.140> folders

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
that new card right into these folders

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.220 
that new card right into these folders
okay<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.910> noticed<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.299> each<00:03:12.630> card<00:03:12.959> has

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
okay so we noticed that each card has

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.979 
okay so we noticed that each card has
images<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.849> will<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.510> also<00:03:15.660> probably

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
images in it and will you also probably

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.479 
images in it and will you also probably
know<00:03:16.230> now<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.440> I've<00:03:16.830> also<00:03:17.040> selected

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
know now that I've also selected

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.680 
know now that I've also selected
duplicates<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.060> threw<00:03:18.239> them<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:18.600> as

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
duplicates and threw them in there as

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.420 
duplicates and threw them in there as
well<00:03:18.840> all<00:03:19.350> right<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:19.769> we<00:03:19.829> have<00:03:19.920> everything

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
well all right so now we have everything

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.580 
well all right so now we have everything
separate<00:03:20.850> into<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.120> different<00:03:21.390> folders<00:03:21.780> now

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
separate into the different folders now

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.900 
separate into the different folders now
we're<00:03:22.739> going<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.890> go<00:03:23.070> into<00:03:23.340> our<00:03:23.519> Lightroom

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
we're going to go into our Lightroom

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.000 
we're going to go into our Lightroom
catalog<00:03:24.390> we're<00:03:24.810> gonna<00:03:24.900> go<00:03:25.140> back<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.500> import

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
catalog we're gonna go back to import

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.860 
catalog we're gonna go back to import
and<00:03:26.220> what<00:03:27.120> we're<00:03:27.209> gonna<00:03:27.269> do<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.690> we're<00:03:27.810> gonna

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.599 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
select<00:03:28.079> our<00:03:28.350> source<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.980> source<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.519> the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
select our source the source is on the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.670 
select our source the source is on the
desktop<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.329> it's<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.660> file<00:03:30.900> called

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
desktop and it's in a file called

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.370 
desktop and it's in a file called
temporary<00:03:32.100> import<00:03:32.640> we're<00:03:33.359> gonna<00:03:33.510> say<00:03:33.780> include

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
temporary import we're gonna say include

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.410 
temporary import we're gonna say include
subfolders<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.280> reads<00:03:35.549> every<00:03:35.880> subfolder

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
subfolders so it reads every subfolder

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.500 
subfolders so it reads every subfolder
underneath<00:03:36.959> okay<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.880> say<00:03:39.090> include

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
underneath okay so say include

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.420 
underneath okay so say include
subfolders<00:03:39.750> whoops<00:03:40.410> it's<00:03:40.620> freezing<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.310> a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
subfolders whoops it's freezing it for a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.490 
subfolders whoops it's freezing it for a
second<00:03:41.750> okay<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.930> brings<00:03:43.139> up<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> little<00:03:43.380> thing

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
second okay it brings up a little thing

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.990 
second okay it brings up a little thing
that<00:03:43.560> says<00:03:43.650> subfolders<00:03:44.280> are<00:03:44.400> now<00:03:44.489> included

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
that says subfolders are now included

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.640 
that says subfolders are now included
you<00:03:45.480> can<00:03:45.510> say<00:03:45.780> don't<00:03:45.989> show<00:03:46.079> again<00:03:46.260> because<00:03:46.560> we

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
you can say don't show again because we

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.710 
you can say don't show again because we
really<00:03:46.829> don't<00:03:46.950> care<00:03:47.069> all<00:03:47.880> right<00:03:48.000> hit<00:03:48.180> OK<00:03:48.480> and

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
really don't care all right hit OK and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.210 
really don't care all right hit OK and
what<00:03:49.079> we're<00:03:49.200> gonna<00:03:49.260> do<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> check<00:03:49.889> this<00:03:50.010> out

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
what we're gonna do is to check this out

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.160 
what we're gonna do is to check this out
it's<00:03:50.760> automatically<00:03:51.329> detecting<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.049> that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
it's automatically detecting it that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.199 
it's automatically detecting it that
there<00:03:52.319> are<00:03:52.440> duplicate<00:03:53.310> images<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:53.940> these

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
there are duplicate images in these

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.599 
there are duplicate images in these
folders<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.440> will<00:03:55.680> not<00:03:55.889> import<00:03:56.400> those

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
folders and it will not import those

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.030 
folders and it will not import those
duplicate<00:03:57.090> images<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:58.139> what<00:03:58.350> we<00:03:58.440> do<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.769> since

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
duplicate images so what we do is since

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.710 
duplicate images so what we do is since
we're<00:03:59.190> on<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.489> hard<00:03:59.700> drive<00:03:59.940> now<00:04:00.150> what<00:04:00.630> we're

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
we're on the hard drive now what we're

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.449 
we're on the hard drive now what we're
going<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.870> do<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.079> move<00:04:01.350> these<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.130> correct

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
going to do is move these to the correct

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.599 
going to do is move these to the correct
location<00:04:02.639> and<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:03.810> we<00:04:03.930> select<00:04:04.230> move<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:05.280> choose

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
location and so we select move we choose

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.190 
location and so we select move we choose
our<00:04:05.790> standard<00:04:06.180> import<00:04:06.450> preset<00:04:06.630> once<00:04:06.930> again

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
our standard import preset once again

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.500 
our standard import preset once again
and<00:04:07.440> then<00:04:07.920> we<00:04:08.040> just<00:04:08.220> select<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.730> destination

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
and then we just select the destination

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.059 
and then we just select the destination
of<00:04:09.660> where<00:04:09.900> we<00:04:10.019> want<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.500> go<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:10.950> once

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
of where we want this to go so once

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.250 
of where we want this to go so once
again<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.609> same<00:04:11.880> catalog<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.630> then<00:04:13.170> we

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
again it's that same catalog and then we

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.030 
again it's that same catalog and then we
would<00:04:13.319> click<00:04:13.530> import

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
would click import

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.190 
would click import
now<00:04:14.489> with<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.940> unchecked<00:04:15.510> you'll<00:04:15.720> see<00:04:15.959> all

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
now with this unchecked you'll see all

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.569 
now with this unchecked you'll see all
the<00:04:16.350> other<00:04:16.500> duplicate<00:04:16.829> images<00:04:17.100> will<00:04:17.250> actually

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
the other duplicate images will actually

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.090 
the other duplicate images will actually
moved<00:04:17.789> as<00:04:17.940> well<00:04:18.090> okay<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:18.930> let's<00:04:19.739> check<00:04:19.829> that

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
moved as well okay so let's check that

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.409 
moved as well okay so let's check that
again<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.700> doesn't<00:04:20.970> import<00:04:21.209> suspected

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
again so it doesn't import suspected

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.160 
again so it doesn't import suspected
duplicates<00:04:21.720> we're<00:04:22.440> gonna<00:04:22.560> hit

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
duplicates we're gonna hit

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.400 
duplicates we're gonna hit
move<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:25.150> gonna<00:04:25.240> move<00:04:25.570> all<00:04:25.840> those<00:04:26.110> files

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
move and it's gonna move all those files

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.350 
move and it's gonna move all those files
from<00:04:26.860> one<00:04:27.130> location<00:04:27.370> on<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.640> hard<00:04:27.670> drive<00:04:28.060> to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
from one location on the hard drive to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.630 
from one location on the hard drive to
the<00:04:28.450> other<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:29.380> way<00:04:29.620> it's<00:04:29.860> Lightroom<00:04:30.430> that's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
the other that way it's Lightroom that's

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.340 
the other that way it's Lightroom that's
handling<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.570> moving<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:31.990> everything

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
handling the the moving of everything

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.010 
handling the the moving of everything
and<00:04:32.530> what<00:04:33.100> we<00:04:33.190> do<00:04:33.340> now<00:04:33.520> at<00:04:33.760> this<00:04:33.940> point<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.480> I'm

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
and what we do now at this point is I'm

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.050 
and what we do now at this point is I'm
going<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.200> hit<00:04:35.320> Windows<00:04:35.830> D<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.550> go<00:04:36.670> back<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.970> the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
going to hit Windows D to go back to the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.760 
going to hit Windows D to go back to the
desktop<00:04:37.390> and<00:04:37.720> then<00:04:38.290> we're<00:04:38.380> just<00:04:38.410> going<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.650> go

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
desktop and then we're just going to go

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.440 
desktop and then we're just going to go
this<00:04:38.950> temporary<00:04:39.310> import<00:04:39.700> folder<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.180> we<00:04:40.270> can

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450

this temporary import folder and we can
delete<00:04:40.840> this<00:04:41.020> entire<00:04:41.170> folder<00:04:41.680> now<00:04:41.800> because<00:04:42.070> we

delete this entire folder now because we

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.250 
delete this entire folder now because we
know<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.400> Lightroom<00:04:43.120> has<00:04:43.300> imported<00:04:43.840> every

import folder we drag into the recycle

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.350 
import folder we drag into the recycle
bin<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.500> we're<00:05:00.130> done<00:05:00.340> this<00:05:00.730> is<00:05:00.940> how<00:05:01.090> we<00:05:01.150> would

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
bin and we're done this is how we would

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.480 
bin and we're done this is how we would
import<00:05:01.780> off<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.350> any<00:05:02.770> location<00:05:03.370> that's

import off of any location that's
basically<00:05:03.790> other<00:05:04.030> than<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.420> CF<00:05:04.720> card<00:05:04.750> any<00:05:05.170> hard

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
basically other than a CF card any hard

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.170 
basically other than a CF card any hard
drive<00:05:05.620> location<00:05:06.130> we're<00:05:06.790> transferring

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
drive location we're transferring
