and so on and one of these very

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.859 
and so on and one of these very
important<00:00:26.650> tools<00:00:26.860> is<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.460> launch<00:00:27.700> thing<00:00:27.970> the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
important tools is the launch thing the

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.569 
important tools is the launch thing the
whole<00:00:28.989> thing<00:00:29.020> is<00:00:29.349> not<00:00:29.500> just<00:00:29.860> that<00:00:30.070> a<00:00:30.130> horse<00:00:30.399> is

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
whole thing is not just that a horse is

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.639 
whole thing is not just that a horse is
running<00:00:30.730> on<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.060> circle<00:00:31.509> the<00:00:32.050> wrong<00:00:32.200> thing<00:00:32.470> is

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
running on a circle the wrong thing is

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.979 
running on a circle the wrong thing is
the<00:00:32.950> ability<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.579> communicating<00:00:34.390> with<00:00:34.810> the

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
the ability of communicating with the

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.479 
the ability of communicating with the
horse<00:00:35.200> going<00:00:35.710> on<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:35.980> circle<00:00:37.800> he<00:00:38.800> means<00:00:39.040> that<00:00:39.190> it

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
horse going on a circle he means that it

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.610 
horse going on a circle he means that it
is<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.670> little<00:00:40.030> stepping<00:00:40.450> under<00:00:40.809> that<00:00:41.469> the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
is a little stepping under that the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.619 
is a little stepping under that the

can see the inside front foot even
though<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.730> see<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.210> horse<00:00:49.390> from

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
though that you see the horse from

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.009 
though that you see the horse from
behind<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.059> can<00:00:52.210> take<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.510> shoulder<00:00:52.870> out

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
behind if you can take the shoulder out

widow take the shoulder in when you with

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.439 
widow take the shoulder in when you with
the<00:00:58.089> Caviezel<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:59.280> launch<00:01:00.280> line<00:01:00.609> can<00:01:01.210> give

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
the Caviezel and launch line can give

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.899 
the Caviezel and launch line can give
the<00:01:01.600> holes<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:02.620> have<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.949> horse<00:01:03.190> like<00:01:03.460> in<00:01:03.760> a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
the holes you have the horse like in a

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.210 
the holes you have the horse like in a
frame<00:01:04.210> as<00:01:04.480> if<00:01:04.750> you're<00:01:04.930> riding<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.500> smaller<00:01:08.830> a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
frame as if you're riding the smaller a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.520 
frame as if you're riding the smaller a
circle<00:01:09.760> is<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.600> bigger<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.050> centrifugal

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
circle is the bigger the centrifugal

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.260 
circle is the bigger the centrifugal
power<00:01:11.920> will<00:01:12.220> work<00:01:12.400> on<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.700> horse<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.210> the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
power will work on the horse and the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.359 
power will work on the horse and the
more<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.689> bending<00:01:14.079> has<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.530> be<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:15.250> the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
more the bending has to be that the

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.730 
more the bending has to be that the
horse<00:01:15.579> is<00:01:15.670> getting<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.119> balance<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.500> bigger

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
horse is getting in balance the bigger

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.870 
horse is getting in balance the bigger
circle<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:19.000> easier<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:20.290> do<00:01:20.439> for<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.829> horse<00:01:21.040> but

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
circle is easier to do for the horse but

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880 
circle is easier to do for the horse but
still<00:01:22.210> its<00:01:22.509> difficulty<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.380> keep<00:01:23.619> the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
still its difficulty to keep the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.590 
still its difficulty to keep the
standing<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.460> bending<00:01:24.820> with<00:01:24.969> more<00:01:25.149> distance

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
standing and bending with more distance

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.389 
standing and bending with more distance
to<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.020> horse

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
to the horse

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.219 
to the horse
then<00:01:27.399> what's<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.790> front<00:01:28.030> legs<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.540> see<00:01:29.079> that

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
then what's the front legs and see that

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.050 
then what's the front legs and see that
the<00:01:29.350> front<00:01:29.619> legs<00:01:30.009> are<00:01:30.189> swinging<00:01:30.490> out<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.939> the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
the front legs are swinging out of the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.090 
the front legs are swinging out of the
chest<00:01:31.360> in<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:32.049> direction<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.579> circle<00:01:35.100> try

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
chest in the direction of the circle try

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.679 
chest in the direction of the circle try
to<00:01:36.159> see<00:01:36.399> if<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.579> can<00:01:36.759> make<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.090> hook<00:01:37.240> jump<00:01:37.509> in

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
to see if you can make the hook jump in

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.840 
to see if you can make the hook jump in
different<00:01:38.079> directions<00:01:38.380> away<00:01:39.280> from<00:01:39.520> you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
different directions away from you

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.709 
different directions away from you
sending<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.539> horse<00:01:40.719> out<00:01:42.149> forward<00:01:43.149> if<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.600> are

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
sending the horse out forward if you are

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:51.020 
sending the horse out forward if you are
going<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.140> right<00:01:44.259> way<00:01:44.320> around<00:01:45.180> backwards<00:01:47.159> out

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.430 

so<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.510> little<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.900> front<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.229> him

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
so you go a little in the front of him

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.010 
so you go a little in the front of him
and<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:53.159> giving<00:01:53.400> yes<00:01:53.790> exactly<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.510> quarter<00:01:54.869> in

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and to giving yes exactly the quarter in

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.140 
and to giving yes exactly the quarter in
aid<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:56.010> go<00:01:56.190> back<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.670> shoulder<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
aid and then go back to the shoulder in

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.780 
aid and then go back to the shoulder in
aid<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.570> send<00:01:57.869> him<00:01:57.990> forward<00:01:58.290> again<00:01:58.530> good<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
aid and send him forward again good that

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.080 
aid and send him forward again good that
the<00:01:59.940> transition<00:02:00.540> will<00:02:01.110> make<00:02:01.259> him<00:02:01.470> more

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
the transition will make him more

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.030 
the transition will make him more
