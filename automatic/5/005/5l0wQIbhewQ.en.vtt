00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and a little bottle and up next I have

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
and a little bottle and up next I have
what<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.250> been<00:00:41.579> waiting<00:00:41.640> for

what you have all been waiting for
and<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.590> dragon<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.399> we'll<00:00:44.910> start

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and this is the dragon so we'll start

and this is the dragon so we'll start
with<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> head<00:00:45.719> first<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:47.340> open<00:00:47.640> up

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
with the head first and so we open up

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
with the head first and so we open up
this<00:00:47.879> met<00:00:48.120> his<00:00:48.360> mouth<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> we

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this met his mouth you can see that we

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
this met his mouth you can see that we
have<00:00:49.800> some<00:00:49.980> fire<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:51.000> flames<00:00:51.300> coming<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
have some fire some flames coming out of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.139 
have some fire some flames coming out of
his<00:00:52.050> mouth<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:53.309> course<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.059> because

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
his mouth and of course it's because

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
he's a dragon and he we've got like some

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.060 
he's a dragon and he we've got like some
little<00:00:56.640> eyebrows<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.440> eyebrows<00:00:58.829> but

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
little eyebrows not really eyebrows but

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.029 
little eyebrows not really eyebrows but
sort<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.879> parts<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> skull<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.800> kind

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
sort of parts of the skull that are kind

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.429 
sort of parts of the skull that are kind
of<00:01:02.070> spiky<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.059> make<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.329> look<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.570> epic<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of spiky to make them look more epic and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
of spiky to make them look more epic and
we<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.040> studs<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.790> his<00:01:05.909> eyes

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
we have some studs that make up his eyes

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.980 
we have some studs that make up his eyes
and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:07.049> we'll<00:01:07.320> move<00:01:07.500> down<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.750> wings

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and then we'll move down to the wings

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.440 
and then we'll move down to the wings
and<00:01:10.350> such<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> cool<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and such now the cool thing about the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.149 
and such now the cool thing about the
wings<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> feature<00:01:13.799> in

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
wings is that there is a feature in

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.289 
wings is that there is a feature in
which<00:01:14.610> where<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.040> turn<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> tail<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.000> wings

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
which where you turn the tail the wings

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
which where you turn the tail the wings
go<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> I'll<00:01:19.140> show<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> looks

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
go up and I'll show you what that looks

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.670 
go up and I'll show you what that looks
like<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.140> second<00:01:22.439> I'm<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
like and in just a second I'm going to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.460 
like and in just a second I'm going to
show<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.860> how<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.850> really<00:01:24.180> works

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
show you how that actually really works

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.810 
show you how that actually really works
but<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> show<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.580> good

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
but I'm just going to show you a good

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.230 
but I'm just going to show you a good
look<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.710> awesomeness<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> function

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
look on the awesomeness of the function

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.260 
look on the awesomeness of the function
so<00:01:33.240> take<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> apart<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.159> second<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so take this apart in just a second so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.399 
so take this apart in just a second so
now<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> head<00:01:37.049> off<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
now that I have the head off I can

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
now that I have the head off I can
finally<00:01:37.710> show<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> complex

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
finally show you what the complex

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
finally show you what the complex
function<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:40.490> well<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.640> really<00:01:41.820> that

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
function is well it's not really that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.840 
function is well it's not really that
complex<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.560> it's<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.829> lot<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> elements<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
complex but it's a lot of elements that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.990 
complex but it's a lot of elements that
you<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.780> worry<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.130> make

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you have to really worry about and make

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
you have to really worry about and make
sure<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.450> include<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.380> once<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.710> turn<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
sure that you include so once I turn the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
sure that you include so once I turn the
tail<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.759> activates<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.509> gear<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:52.290> for

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
tail it activates one gear there for

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.679 
tail it activates one gear there for
turning<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.100> which<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> piston

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
turning the other which is like a piston

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.770 
turning the other which is like a piston
pushing<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.890> brick<00:01:56.430> forward<00:01:56.909> activating

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
pushing that brick forward activating

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
pushing that brick forward activating
the<00:01:57.899> gear<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.170> attached<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> wing

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the gear that's attached to the wing

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.080 
the gear that's attached to the wing
allowing<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.820> go<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.909> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
allowing it to go up and down so if you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.179 
allowing it to go up and down so if you
kind<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.689> take<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> big<00:02:04.259> look<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.040> could

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
kind of take a big look at it you could

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.479 
kind of take a big look at it you could
kind<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.850> an<00:02:06.000> idea<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.630> how<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.220> wings

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
kind of get an idea of how the wings

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.240 
kind of get an idea of how the wings
work<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.750> also<00:02:10.020> happens<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.069> other

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
work and this also happens on the other

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.430 
work and this also happens on the other
side<00:02:11.580> show<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
side show you that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.870 
side show you that
so<00:02:13.590> symmetrical<00:02:14.370> function<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:18.710> very

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
so symmetrical function and it is very

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.630 
so symmetrical function and it is very
continuous<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.270> very<00:02:22.020> complex<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.400> like

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
continuous and very complex but I like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.360 
continuous and very complex but I like
the<00:02:23.790> way<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.120> works<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:25.500> glad<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.830> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the way it works and I'm glad that it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.480 
the way it works and I'm glad that it
was<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.760> success<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.070> another<00:02:29.070> thing<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.340> I

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
was a success and another thing that I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.940 
was a success and another thing that I
must<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:30.060> fail<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> mention<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.590> there

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
must not fail to mention is that there

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.280 
must not fail to mention is that there
are<00:02:32.160> some<00:02:32.430> clause<00:02:32.990> three-fingered<00:02:33.990> clause

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
are some clause three-fingered clause

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.710 
are some clause three-fingered clause
that<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.860> dragon<00:02:35.850> has<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.450> can

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that the dragon has that you can

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.520 
that the dragon has that you can
maneuver<00:02:37.170> up<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.740> down<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.990> here's<00:02:39.990> finally
