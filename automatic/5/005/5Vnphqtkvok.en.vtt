 drives 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.580
 even more compact than their 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.130
 predecessors keeping the amount of memory 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060

 Russia device provided to us 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.869
 due to the status of the official dealer 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.869

 set my passport is ultra somewhat 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 wider than usual here except the very

 hard disk interface usb 30 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.629
 cable and installation instructions and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 setting up my passport is ultra noticeable 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.890
 smaller than the previous series saving 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 overall design in which it is unlikely 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.719
 something can improve these drives in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 thickness turned out only from 12 to 15 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.040

 literally handheld device given 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.610
 and its low weight practical body made of 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.070
 plastic, opaque from all directions 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.780
 will last for a long time while the ultra series 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.140
 looks no less attractive 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 retaining a successful solution in design 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.590
