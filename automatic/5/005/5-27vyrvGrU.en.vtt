00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.970
 yoro hi all and dim it's a 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.880
 new video on the special video 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.450
 special connections and wej were 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.100
 ribs 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x farting people 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.200
 the sinkers I think like at the buttes ya 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.050
 someone who takes care of rebooting my 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.280
 remote livebox an anvil and party 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.449
 if he does not want me to do 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.190
 records it's a jealous honor 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.050
 frankly the guys who do that deserve 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.930
 not even to live even though it's a 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.500
 game then more is that it's a game 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.890
 do it for nothing happened to the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.350
 handle 55.0 dead and on deco by a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.370
 motherfuckers good traffic links because that 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.720
 I may also have problems with 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.239
 eras and it would surprise me that I have more 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.219
 connections from within me and the a5 the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.950
 same day it's a little bit a lot 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.390
 so so I have school at 55 to 47 at the 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.829
 38 to the 12 to even to the two by the way 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.080
 on the decos I now present a 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.490
 second strategy faster strategy 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.690
 the best in my opinion is with this 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.310
 strategy that you will be able to do 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.539
 the most sleeves why because 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.170
 with only one weapon bullet 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.630
 special kill you 100 200 300 years old him 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.670
 suggested well it depends how how 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.080
 you manage in fact good so this 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.979
 little strategy or am I 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.610
 I am in the building where you are 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.220
 find resuscitation passwords his 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.189
 trumps and I'm all down in fact 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.560
 just before you can escape for 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.570
 park a toboggan that directs you to the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.240
 box a kind of bar of a restaurant 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.830
 Chinese and this is where 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.390
 way to make the biggest carnage and 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.670
 means to do seventy innings in 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.400
 5 hours with this strategy 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.920
 maybe 80 years old 5h30 it's going so much 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.200
 so much so fast it's 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.360
 so much so i'm going to say 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.619
 with the Quebec accent a bit since 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.590
 we often hang out with Quebecers in 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.180
 this moment know the spa that under the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.369
 Quebec by dint of hearing them I 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.810
 just do not take their accent so that's it 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.939
 everything that happened on my left had 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.500
 all khaki an essential asset that you 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.149
 allows you to resuscitate yourself by 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.769
 against if you miss your animation 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.120
 when you have to revive yourself 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.019
 actually arrive on fashion like this 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.450
 you do not have mass all you 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.459
 have not missed anything your resuscitation is 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.260
 the end of the game and that it is an asset 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.629
 a little bit 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.189
 he can as well as you and as soon as 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.750
 make you lose a solo game 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.939
 like two good at 2 it's clear that he 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.439
 must resume solo against I 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.180
 take anyway but I'm not sure 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.290
 sure otherwise there you see I have six of 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.019
 trumps how do we do to have the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.730
 six to all just kill the gollum at 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.599
 knife at the end of the sleeves and then all 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.370
 the tastes the knife man 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.500
 if you have the french knife 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.420
 I had a little galley and solo 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.849
 you will always have only gollum 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.290
 on you put yourself some shots of 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.439
 knife either you take it too low you 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.239
 put to run and it works very well 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.319
 if not after the score is one that gets 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.829
 found in the Buddha building 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.090
 so see a good little ball there I 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.099
 do not believe that I will succeed at the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.209
 next I'll I tried to do 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.730
 a fight in fact needs to focus 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.989
 this weapon acts on zombies as 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.900
 a kind of flames 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.609
 and that's all it takes for a whole 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.469
 little woman and 15 beds next door 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.349
 that after the zombie passing by 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.760
 flames them or trombi and that's it can 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.739
 spread you can kill a lot 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.139
 a lot of zombies there you see I have 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.879
 pulled I was at 3044 that they fired 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.169
 that a bullet we are going to watch how much 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.730
 how much do I want you give free 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.870
 it's clear that the zombies on this 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.519
 new black hawk they always have 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.859
 found weapons that do not kill 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.139
 zombies 24 by 24 why because at 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.599
 every time we kill zombies 24/24 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.370
 I needed to score but it was laguait 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.819
 so they make us weapons that the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.900
 kill 3 by 3 2 by 2 1 by a man that's 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.489
 still better so there's no 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.150
 blades can frankly turn it 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.370
 is really fun 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.230
 this weapon under corner to turn this 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.459
 fashion is the best hand then ever 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.829
 created it's the best weapon they 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.840
 have never created that's it I'm 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.719
 super happy me for all they 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.949
 did the new mode 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.229
 I found that a little bit a little bit 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.400
 naze even super nana I think there is 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:05.629
 not really of interest 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.489
 yes already at 3111 3113 promised here I 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.709
 stop at 3113 there was doubt his 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.949
 goal I could have continued but I missed 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.900
 so 3044 to go up to 3113 that 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.820
 does 60 are bi with a single ball 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.680
 and again ways to do a lot 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.729
 better and where they killed almost 200 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.169
 yeah the sleeve the sleeve 40 47 in 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.580
 four minutes something like that 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.380
 as this is unheard of in this game 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.400
 like that I hope you have who does 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.919
 this video we are very soon 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.919
 for the continuation any lease
