sit right up here on the side of the
tunnel<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.340> pulled<00:02:36.670> out<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.560> wires

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770

that<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.070> don't<00:02:39.250> need<00:02:39.460> just<00:02:40.090> kind<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.360> left<00:02:40.540> them

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
that I don't need just kind of left them

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.370 
that I don't need just kind of left them
there<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.740> these<00:02:41.950> are<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.280> only<00:02:42.460> wires

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110

aluminum<00:05:14.890> around<00:05:15.160> here<00:05:15.340> ruin<00:05:15.610> threads<00:05:16.000> but

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
aluminum around here ruin threads but

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.800 
aluminum around here ruin threads but
the<00:05:17.490> nut<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:18.820> kept<00:05:19.180> trying<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.480> weld<00:05:19.660> to

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.030 
the nut that I kept trying to weld to
this<00:05:19.960> I'd<00:05:20.110> go<00:05:20.230> straight<00:05:20.500> down<00:05:20.620> through<00:05:20.770> the

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
this I'd go straight down through the

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.460 
this I'd go straight down through the
middle<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.340> pick<00:05:21.550> up<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.450> broken<00:05:22.870> bolt

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
middle to pick up the the broken bolt

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.560 
middle to pick up the the broken bolt
and<00:05:24.040> build<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.520> blob<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:25.000> weld<00:05:25.180> up<00:05:25.300> into<00:05:25.480> the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
and build the blob the weld up into the

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.810 
and build the blob the weld up into the
nut<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:26.320> nut<00:05:26.530> wooden<00:05:26.830> stick<00:05:27.100> so<00:05:27.490> it's

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
nut the nut wooden stick so it's

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.490 
nut the nut wooden stick so it's
probably<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:28.150> case<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.540> my<00:05:28.690> welders<00:05:29.050> piece<00:05:29.350> of

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
probably a case of my welders piece of

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.690 
probably a case of my welders piece of
crap<00:05:31.230> but<00:05:32.230> I<00:05:32.500> might<00:05:32.710> just<00:05:32.920> end<00:05:33.070> up<00:05:33.220> taking<00:05:33.580> this

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
crap but I might just end up taking this

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.570 
crap but I might just end up taking this
down<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:34.180> a<00:05:34.210> machine<00:05:34.600> shop<00:05:35.310> there's<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.490> other

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
down to a machine shop there's the other

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.540 
down to a machine shop there's the other
one<00:05:36.670> in<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.120> back<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:38.560> is<00:05:38.770> really<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.190> only

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
one in the back that is really the only

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.820 
one in the back that is really the only
thing<00:05:39.910> that's<00:05:40.090> holding<00:05:40.210> me<00:05:40.390> up<00:05:40.570> from<00:05:40.930> changing

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
thing that's holding me up from changing

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.430 
thing that's holding me up from changing
out<00:05:41.920> the<00:05:41.950> springs<00:05:42.370> and<00:05:43.260> buttoning<00:05:44.260> this

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
out the springs and buttoning this

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.700 
out the springs and buttoning this
engine<00:05:44.740> back<00:05:44.920> up<00:05:45.510> so<00:05:46.510> I<00:05:46.870> got<00:05:47.410> to<00:05:47.500> get<00:05:47.560> that

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
engine back up so I got to get that

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.770 
engine back up so I got to get that
