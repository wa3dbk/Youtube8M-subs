00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
all but all I can say is that usually

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
all but all I can say is that usually
because<00:01:19.140> there<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.830> many<00:01:20.010> awards<00:01:20.400> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

because there are so many awards that
are<00:01:20.729> happening<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.510> think<00:01:21.869> film<00:01:22.200> fans<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.619> one

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
nominated or whoever wins that I think

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.779 
nominated or whoever wins that I think
those<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.100> best<00:01:32.280> performance

those that will be the best performance
of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> year<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.020> should<00:01:34.049> judge
