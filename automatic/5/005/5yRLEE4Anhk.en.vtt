 edible rich in vitamin b12 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:57.610
 cultivated in Eastern countries as well as 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.670
 in fact the two have recently been 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.219
 introduced in Western countries and already 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.429
 have become the darlings of our 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:13.920
 gastronomy and there you are staying today 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.380
 a frying pan 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.970
 You can use that obvious pot that is 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.819
 more difficult because nobody will bring the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.860
 camp and the frying pan 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:33.010

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.260
 trusted the other option is you already 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.090
 let it all be lonely after only 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.090
 our say then we advise 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.349
 The tip in the camp is to put the stove 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.290
 where it sells less to facilitate and only 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.569

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.959
 after you leave the shitake and 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.269

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.360

 missing here is to see this seasoning itself 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.159

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.269
 little seasoning and then we come with 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.269

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.830
 milk comes to break everything ready 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.830
