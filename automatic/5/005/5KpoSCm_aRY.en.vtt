in<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.400> stage<00:00:28.700> of<00:00:29.000> doing<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:29.630> now<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:30.500> have

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
in the stage of doing this now I have

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.410 
in the stage of doing this now I have
some<00:00:31.239> Cernik<00:00:32.239> clay<00:00:32.540> here<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.820> I<00:00:34.820> have<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.330> all

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
some Cernik clay here and I have it all

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.290 
some Cernik clay here and I have it all
rolled<00:00:35.750> out<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.410> I've<00:00:37.280> already<00:00:37.489> started<00:00:38.030> it

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
rolled out and I've already started it

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.729 
rolled out and I've already started it
and<00:00:38.420> then<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:38.629> thought<00:00:38.840> well<00:00:39.110> why<00:00:39.320> not<00:00:39.350> make<00:00:39.680> it

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
and then I thought well why not make it

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.299 
and then I thought well why not make it
a<00:00:39.980> little<00:00:40.430> tutorial<00:00:41.059> on<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.440> okay<00:00:42.440> what<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:43.160> do

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
a little tutorial on it okay what I do

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.899 
a little tutorial on it okay what I do
instead<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.270> taking<00:00:44.960> my<00:00:45.500> clay<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.129> mixing

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
instead of taking my clay and mixing

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.860 
instead of taking my clay and mixing
white<00:00:47.239> or<00:00:48.159> mixing<00:00:49.159> other<00:00:49.430> colors<00:00:50.059> of<00:00:50.269> polymer

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
white or mixing other colors of polymer

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.790 
white or mixing other colors of polymer
clay<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.470> with<00:00:51.739> my<00:00:51.949> flesh<00:00:52.220> I'm<00:00:53.000> doing<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.800> with

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
clay in with my flesh I'm doing it with

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.410 
clay in with my flesh I'm doing it with
the<00:00:55.190> genesis<00:00:56.409> oil<00:00:57.409> paints<00:00:57.979> and<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.940> have<00:00:59.269> this

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
the genesis oil paints and I have this

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.740 
the genesis oil paints and I have this
in<00:00:59.720> and<00:01:00.290> this<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.670> white<00:01:01.879> make<00:01:02.239> sure<00:01:02.540> that

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
in and this and the white make sure that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.259 
in and this and the white make sure that
you<00:01:02.930> get<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.290> white<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:03.879> because<00:01:04.879> that

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
you get the white in because that

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.320 
you get the white in because that
eliminates<00:01:05.930> me<00:01:06.260> of<00:01:06.500> having<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.490> mix<00:01:07.700> white<00:01:08.060> in

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
eliminates me of having to mix white in

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.100 
eliminates me of having to mix white in
my<00:01:08.570> clay<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:11.000> always<00:01:11.030> say<00:01:11.600> this

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
my clay and it like I always say this

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.830 
my clay and it like I always say this
works<00:01:12.770> for<00:01:13.310> me<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.090> might<00:01:14.270> not<00:01:14.450> work<00:01:14.479> for

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
works for me and it might not work for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.310 
works for me and it might not work for
everyone

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
a certain way I like my clay to not be

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.040 
a certain way I like my clay to not be
mushy<00:02:05.469> so<00:02:06.469> what<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.039> do<00:02:07.189> is<00:02:07.609> I<00:02:07.999> always<00:02:08.300> have<00:02:08.690> to

mushy so what I do is I always have to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.890 
mushy so what I do is I always have to
leech<00:02:09.259> my<00:02:09.530> clay<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.160> as<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.460> rolled<00:02:11.240> out<00:02:11.569> my

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900

leech my clay so as I rolled out my
flesh<00:02:12.410> clay<00:02:12.770> before<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.340> put<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.819> paint<00:02:14.390> on

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
flesh clay before I put the paint on

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.840 
flesh clay before I put the paint on
there<00:02:14.810> I've<00:02:14.930> leached<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.740> then<00:02:16.670> after<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> get

plastic container and as you can see I
have<00:02:30.349> mixed<00:02:30.739> them<00:02:30.890> up<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.370> need<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.730> mix<00:02:31.879> up

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
have mixed them up and I need to mix up

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.640 
have mixed them up and I need to mix up
some<00:02:32.209> more<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.750> will<00:02:35.750> just<00:02:36.019> take<00:02:36.410> my

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
some more and then I will just take my

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.780 
some more and then I will just take my
paintbrush<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:38.150> will<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:40.340> over<00:02:40.370> it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
paintbrush and I will just go over it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.030 
paintbrush and I will just go over it
now<00:02:40.819> I've<00:02:41.300> done<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.140> many<00:02:42.200> times<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.920> I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
now I've done this so many times that I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.180 
now I've done this so many times that I
practically<00:02:43.940> know<00:02:44.090> how<00:02:44.930> much<00:02:45.530> paint<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.950> put

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
practically know how much paint to put

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.699 
practically know how much paint to put
on<00:02:46.340> there<00:02:46.750> okay<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:48.019> I'm<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
on there okay then I'm just going to

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.940 
on there okay then I'm just going to
take<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.629> and<00:02:50.629> I'm<00:02:51.019> going<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.260> just<00:02:51.590> keep

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
take this and I'm going to just keep

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.160 
take this and I'm going to just keep
running<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.489> through<00:02:52.519> my<00:02:53.440> pasta<00:02:54.440> machine<00:02:54.799> and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.490 

I<00:03:00.170> won't<00:03:00.590> keep<00:03:00.950> doing<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:01.819> because<00:03:02.599> you're

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
I won't keep doing this because you're

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.710 
I won't keep doing this because you're
going<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.739> have<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.180> run<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.329> through<00:03:05.360> your

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
going to have to run it through your

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:15.009 
going to have to run it through your
pasta<00:03:06.170> machine<00:03:06.590> many<00:03:07.489> many<00:03:08.090> times<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:14.019> don't

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
pasta machine many many times I don't

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.420 
pasta machine many many times I don't
know<00:03:15.140> if<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.349> can<00:03:15.530> start<00:03:15.769> seeing<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.250> color

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
know if you can start seeing the color

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.789 
know if you can start seeing the color
coming<00:03:16.970> through<00:03:17.829> but<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.860> love<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.730> technique

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
coming through but I love this technique

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.180 
coming through but I love this technique
the<00:03:21.799> only<00:03:22.069> thing<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.549> I<00:03:22.610> can<00:03:22.670> tell<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.329> is

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
the only thing that I can tell you is

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.970 
the only thing that I can tell you is
it's<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.489> texture<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.569> clay<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.260> I'd

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
it's the texture of the clay that I'd

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.559 
it's the texture of the clay that I'd
like<00:03:29.349> see<00:03:30.349> how<00:03:30.739> that's<00:03:30.980> running<00:03:31.280> through<00:03:32.920> and

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
like see how that's running through and

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.920 
like see how that's running through and
then<00:03:35.739> sometimes<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:37.430> haven't<00:03:38.180> mixed<00:03:38.510> up<00:03:38.630> enough

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
then sometimes I haven't mixed up enough

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.129 
then sometimes I haven't mixed up enough
clay<00:03:40.030> if<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.269> see<00:03:41.450> you're<00:03:41.600> getting<00:03:41.720> low<00:03:42.109> on

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
clay if you see you're getting low on

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.699 
clay if you see you're getting low on
clay<00:03:42.560> always<00:03:43.040> keep<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.549> piece<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.660> hasn't<00:03:45.349> on

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
clay always keep a piece that hasn't on

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.940 
clay always keep a piece that hasn't on
that<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.280> haven't<00:03:46.609> used<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.269> on<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.920> can

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
that you haven't used and on you can

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.670 
that you haven't used and on you can
match<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.180> piece<00:03:50.599> but<00:03:51.230> I've<00:03:51.470> never

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
match it up to that piece but I've never

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:01.629 
match it up to that piece but I've never
really<00:03:52.160> ran<00:03:52.370> into<00:03:52.819> that<00:03:52.849> problem<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:59.919> I<00:04:00.919> love

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
really ran into that problem and I love

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.539 
really ran into that problem and I love
doing<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.209> because<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.720> don't<00:04:02.870> have<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.549> have

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
doing this because I don't have to have

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.569 
doing this because I don't have to have
so<00:04:04.880> many<00:04:05.139> blocks<00:04:06.139> of<00:04:06.470> different<00:04:07.190> colors<00:04:07.549> of

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
so many blocks of different colors of

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.809 
so many blocks of different colors of
clay

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.340 

and<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:13.209> really<00:04:13.690> don't<00:04:13.930> use<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:15.160> much<00:04:15.370> paint

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
and you really don't use that much paint

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.430 
and you really don't use that much paint
in<00:04:17.350> it<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.100> doesn't<00:04:18.669> make<00:04:18.910> your<00:04:19.440> clay

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
in it and it doesn't make your clay

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:29.580 
in it and it doesn't make your clay
mushy<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:27.870> don't<00:04:28.870> know<00:04:29.020> it's<00:04:29.139> starting<00:04:29.380> to

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
mushy I don't know it's starting to

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.510 
mushy I don't know it's starting to
really<00:04:29.830> start<00:04:30.250> starting<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.000> blend<00:04:31.240> now<00:04:32.280> but<00:04:33.280> I

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
really start starting to blend now but I

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.700

that but the flush is important for me

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:24.060 
that but the flush is important for me
but<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.690> can<00:05:10.810> get<00:05:10.960> any<00:05:11.110> color<00:05:11.350> that<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.740> want

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
that tip and I wanted to show you that

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.910 
that tip and I wanted to show you that
that<00:05:28.180> is<00:05:28.390> what<00:05:28.810> I've<00:05:28.930> been<00:05:28.960> doing<00:05:29.260> for<00:05:29.620> years

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
that is what I've been doing for years

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.390 
that is what I've been doing for years
and<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.910> has<00:05:31.150> always<00:05:31.420> worked<00:05:31.600> for<00:05:32.110> me<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.500> it

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
and it has always worked for me and it

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.100 
and it has always worked for me and it
eliminates<00:05:34.170> having<00:05:36.060> other<00:05:37.060> color<00:05:37.420> of<00:05:37.540> clays

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
eliminates having other color of clays
