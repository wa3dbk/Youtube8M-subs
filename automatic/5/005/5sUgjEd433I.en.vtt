00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.269
 start off 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.030
 these objects in order to 1 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.150
 scene like 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 object we need to go to the tab 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.650
 adgex click select trees for example 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.009
 and click on this picture here 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.399
 you can choose the tree that we need 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:31.099
 here are ordinary trees here 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:35.750
 ate and pines here palm trees here grass 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.690
 plants various flowers cacti 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.460
 to get started we start working with trees 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 this is the top section we just 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 viewed there is not yet and no section in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.960
 the lower section can be switched here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 a lot of trees and when we switch 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.600
 like trees for example if we need 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.789
 birch then it seems to be in the second 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 tab now if not mistaken 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:09.540
 here so here birch push and now 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.170
 It is proposed to choose a place where we have it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.659
 we will plant 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.880
 for example here, well, you can use the left button 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.219
 arrange 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.390
 some trees now we 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:27.630
 We climb a little so it will be on 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:31.430
 much more comfortable and arrange the trees so 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.430
 as we wish 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.560
 Here is a small forest now to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.880
 change the type of tree then go again 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 In this picture, choose another tree 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 for example from this collection 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.860
 that is, the division can experiment 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.660
 but of course it's better to make everything more realistic 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 and don't mix too many species 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.770
 trees in the same forest 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.450
 use just two three kinds quite 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:17.810
 enough except that you can add 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:20.120
 shrubs for example this one now we 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.310
 select the grass and place it on the visible 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:30.620
 the territory of our project we choose 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:37.850
 grass section and the most appropriate here 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:41.140
 will be in the second tab files gras 2 she 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:49.160
 captures a fairly large area 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:52.000
 surfaces and can be carefully landed 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.000
 grass 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.470
 can easily plant a whole forest even 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.370
 if your computer resources are small 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.549
 the program under is built in this way 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.549
 so you can work quite easily 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.110
 and the scene did not slow down as a last resort 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.409
 can be slightly reduced in the settings 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.200
 image quality and resolution 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.209
 settings are here right here 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.220
 image quality if i deliver 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.400
 the worst image is what we see 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.700
 that the shadows disappeared, that is, the picture 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.569
 I have also been optimized 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.140
 resolution 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.079
 about movies put 50 click ok then 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.480
 see the picture became a muddy processor 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.810
 handles it all much faster but 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.670
 quality noticeably lost for work 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.489
 it's not very comfortable but since my 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.120
 the computer allows you to work with a good 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.349
 quality 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.819
 I make the settings to the maximum next 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.819
 the lesson will create a reservoir
