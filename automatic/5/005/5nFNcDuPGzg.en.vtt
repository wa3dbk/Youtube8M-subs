00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
tell me about the dichotomy there

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.120 
tell me about the dichotomy there
between<00:04:31.790> what<00:04:32.210> history<00:04:32.630> tells<00:04:32.660> us<00:04:33.130> happened

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
between what history tells us happened

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.129 
between what history tells us happened
in<00:04:34.370> terms<00:04:34.639> of<00:04:34.790> atomic<00:04:35.180> energy<00:04:35.270> development

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
in terms of atomic energy development

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.010 
in terms of atomic energy development
and<00:04:36.290> what<00:04:36.770> your<00:04:36.949> research<00:04:37.370> has<00:04:37.610> uncovered

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
and what your research has uncovered

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.950 
and what your research has uncovered
well<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.699> when<00:04:40.699> I<00:04:40.850> saw<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.180> pictures<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:43.370> two

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
well and when I saw the pictures the two

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.750 
well and when I saw the pictures the two
German<00:04:44.960> atomic<00:04:45.560> bombs<00:04:45.770> were<00:04:46.100> captured<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:46.639> the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
German atomic bombs were captured in the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.050 
German atomic bombs were captured in the
Harz<00:04:46.970> mountains<00:04:47.090> east<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.840> indy<00:04:48.410> i<00:04:48.789> had<00:04:49.789> seen

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
Harz mountains east of indy i had seen

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.529 
Harz mountains east of indy i had seen
pictures<00:04:50.389> of<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.990> fat<00:04:51.199> boy<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:53.180> bomb<00:04:53.360> was

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
pictures of the fat boy and the bomb was

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.260 
pictures of the fat boy and the bomb was
dropped<00:04:53.720> on<00:04:54.580> nagasaki<00:04:55.580> afterwards<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.090> one
