give you the basic overview and kind of
what<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.110> because<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.500> just

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
what I think about it because I just

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.470 
what I think about it because I just
discovered<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.309> today<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> market<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.420> was

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
discovered it today on the market it was

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.890 
discovered it today on the market it was
a<00:00:15.540> recommended<00:00:16.400> application<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.640> is

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
a recommended application and this is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.300 
a recommended application and this is
currently<00:00:18.900> being<00:00:19.109> taken<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> piss-poor

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
currently being taken with a piss-poor

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.849 
currently being taken with a piss-poor
video<00:00:20.910> camera<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.750> Motorola<00:00:22.170> Droid<00:00:22.590> Bionic

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
video camera on my Motorola Droid Bionic

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.609 
video camera on my Motorola Droid Bionic
and<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.750> runs<00:00:24.960> pretty<00:00:25.470> well

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and as you can see it runs pretty well

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.370 
and as you can see it runs pretty well
it's<00:00:26.070> surprisingly<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:28.260> know

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
it's surprisingly well actually you know

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
it's surprisingly well actually you know
I<00:00:28.410> thought<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> would<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.130> glitchy<00:00:29.580> it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
I thought that it would be glitchy it

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.790 
I thought that it would be glitchy it
would<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.420> know<00:00:30.539> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> shaky<00:00:31.410> because

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
would be you know kind of shaky because

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.560 
would be you know kind of shaky because
I<00:00:32.040> actually<00:00:32.340> try<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.550> run<00:00:32.790> Minecraft<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.420> my

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I actually try and run Minecraft on my

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.790 
I actually try and run Minecraft on my
own<00:00:33.690> computer<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.290> while<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
own computer and while it's not the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
own computer and while it's not the
greatest<00:00:35.130> computer<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.630> know<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:36.930> still

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
greatest computer I you know it's still

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.049 
greatest computer I you know it's still
it<00:00:37.410> still<00:00:37.530> runs<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.460> issues<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it still runs with some issues so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.479 
it still runs with some issues so
basically<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.140> $7<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> application

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
basically it's $7 for the application

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
basically it's $7 for the application
which<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.790> quite<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> bit<00:00:42.300> pricier<00:00:42.809> than<00:00:43.050> any

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
which is quite a bit pricier than any

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
which is quite a bit pricier than any
other<00:00:43.950> applications<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> android

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
other applications out on the android

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.590 
other applications out on the android
market<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.379> think<00:00:46.800> what<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:48.000> warrants

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
market and I think what what warrants

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
market and I think what what warrants
that<00:00:48.629> price<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> fact<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.800> Mojang<00:00:50.640> has

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that price is the fact that Mojang has

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.470 
that price is the fact that Mojang has
probably<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> most<00:00:52.039> devoted

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
probably one of the most devoted

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.850 
probably one of the most devoted
development<00:00:54.480> team<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.170> patch<00:00:55.500> things

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
development team so they patch things

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
development team so they patch things
they<00:00:56.190> update<00:00:56.640> things<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.210> hoping<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
they update things and I'm hoping that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.500 
they update things and I'm hoping that
they<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.980> fact<00:00:59.010> patch<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> update<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
they do in fact patch and update this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.500 
they do in fact patch and update this
just<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:02.070> their<00:01:02.510> desktop

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
just like they do with their desktop

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
just like they do with their desktop
version<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.489> fairly

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
version so you see it's actually fairly

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
version so you see it's actually fairly
simple<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.990> fluid<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.619> figure<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:07.979> what

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
simple and very fluid to figure out what

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
simple and very fluid to figure out what
you're<00:01:08.369> doing<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.600> world

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you're doing this is actually a world

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
you're doing this is actually a world
that<00:01:09.960> I've<00:01:10.140> been<00:01:10.260> playing<00:01:10.530> around<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that I've been playing around in for the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
that I've been playing around in for the
last<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.760> don't<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.970> 30<00:01:12.330> minutes<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
last I don't know 30 minutes or so and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679 
last I don't know 30 minutes or so and
you<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.310> actually<00:01:14.549> built<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.119> house<00:01:15.330> there's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you see I actually built a house there's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.870 
you see I actually built a house there's
no<00:01:15.810> falling<00:01:16.229> damage<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.759> no

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
no falling damage and there's no

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.130 
no falling damage and there's no
survival<00:01:18.420> mode<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.020> basically

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
survival mode right now it's basically

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.710 
survival mode right now it's basically
an<00:01:19.560> architecture<00:01:20.340> mode<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
an architecture mode so we all like to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.109 
an architecture mode so we all like to
build<00:01:22.049> things<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.470> Minecraft<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.939> now

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.730 
build things in Minecraft but right now
we're<00:01:24.330> kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> limited<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.990> only<00:01:25.350> building

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
we're kind of limited to only building

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
we're kind of limited to only building
things<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.119> destroy<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.869> have

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
select blocks you have infinite amount

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
select blocks you have infinite amount
of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> blocks<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> touch

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
of the blocks and you know the touch

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
of the blocks and you know the touch
responses<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.079> everything<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.560> pretty<00:01:35.220> damn

fluid I'm not gonna lie
digging<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.270> building<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:40.200> you'd

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
digging and building is what you'd

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.990 
digging and building is what you'd
expect<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.040> touchscreen<00:01:41.520> device<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.970> just

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
expect from a touchscreen device it just

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.080 
expect from a touchscreen device it just
works<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.720> onto<00:01:43.470> some<00:01:43.770> basic<00:01:44.159> controls<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.880> do

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
works so onto some basic controls we do

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.700 
works so onto some basic controls we do
have<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.479> d-pad<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.259> Left<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
have this d-pad on the Left which is

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
have this d-pad on the Left which is
very<00:01:47.009> responsive<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
very responsive but it's not the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.789 
very responsive but it's not the
greatest<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:48.960> wish<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.649> had<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
greatest I do wish that they had a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.520 
greatest I do wish that they had a
joystick<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.570> look<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:51.990> move<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
joystick and to look you just move to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.139 
joystick and to look you just move to
the<00:01:52.740> left<00:01:52.950> or<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.850> very

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the left or the right that is very

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
the left or the right that is very
simplistic<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.049> wish<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.890> had<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
simplistic but I wish that they had it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.310 
simplistic but I wish that they had it
opposite<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.880> I've<00:01:56.969> moved<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.869> your

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
opposite so I've moved this way your

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.139 
opposite so I've moved this way your
screen<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:58.770> turn<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.189> way<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.700> just

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
screen would turn this way that's just

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.760 
screen would turn this way that's just
how<00:02:00.329> things<00:02:00.540> work<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> tablet<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
how things work on the tablet so it's a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.609 
how things work on the tablet so it's a
little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.159> confusing<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.619> reversal

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
little bit confusing to get a reversal

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.340 
little bit confusing to get a reversal
of<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.390> select<00:02:07.049> group<00:02:07.110> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of that now we have a select group of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.779 
of that now we have a select group of
blocks<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:07.950> choose<00:02:08.340> from<00:02:08.550> here

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
blocks that you can choose from here

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.460 
blocks that you can choose from here
just<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.119> tapping<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.929> select<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.440> of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
just by tapping you can select one of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.300 
just by tapping you can select one of
these<00:02:10.590> three<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.190> build<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
these three and build it

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.610 
these three and build it
holding<00:02:12.910> down<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.330> can<00:02:13.480> actually<00:02:13.630> destroy<00:02:14.410> it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
holding down you can actually destroy it

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.040 
holding down you can actually destroy it
but<00:02:15.040> there's<00:02:15.280> no<00:02:15.489> raw<00:02:15.730> materials<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.599> have<00:02:16.630> a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
but there's no raw materials you have a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.080 
but there's no raw materials you have a
select<00:02:17.650> list<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.190> things<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.880> add

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
select list of things that you can add

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.330 
select list of things that you can add
into<00:02:19.390> these<00:02:19.599> squares<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.860> put<00:02:21.130> on

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
into these squares that you can put on

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.089 
into these squares that you can put on
and<00:02:21.550> build<00:02:21.819> but<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.690> don't<00:02:22.989> have<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.530> you

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
and build but you don't have the you

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.770 
and build but you don't have the you
know<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.370> harvesting<00:02:25.000> capabilities<00:02:25.660> that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
know the harvesting capabilities that

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.870 
know the harvesting capabilities that
you<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.470> desktop<00:02:26.950> version<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.520> you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
you have on the desktop version and you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.570 
you have on the desktop version and you
certainly<00:02:28.120> can't<00:02:28.630> make<00:02:29.500> anything<00:02:30.099> new<00:02:30.310> so

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
certainly can't make anything new so

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.729 
certainly can't make anything new so
these<00:02:30.700> are<00:02:30.880> what<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:32.260> am<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> little

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
these are what you get and I am a little

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.140 
these are what you get and I am a little
bit<00:02:32.890> disappointed<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.489> was<00:02:33.610> hoping<00:02:33.910> for<00:02:33.970> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
bit disappointed I was hoping for a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.750 
bit disappointed I was hoping for a
longer<00:02:34.510> list<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:35.800> some<00:02:36.010> shovels<00:02:36.459> maybe

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
longer list you know some shovels maybe

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.509 
longer list you know some shovels maybe
or<00:02:37.090> whatnot<00:02:37.330> but<00:02:38.080> as<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.739> right<00:02:38.860> now<00:02:39.069> this<00:02:39.280> will

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
or whatnot but as of right now this will

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:39.990 
or whatnot but as of right now this will
do

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
do

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.270 
do
you<00:02:40.690> can't<00:02:40.930> build<00:02:41.080> furnaces<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.920> can't<00:02:42.160> do

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
you can't build furnaces you can't do

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.580 
you can't build furnaces you can't do
anything<00:02:42.670> like<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:44.140> know<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.440> is

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
anything like that but you know it is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.880 
anything like that but you know it is
what<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:46.000> select<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:47.440> know<00:02:47.470> by

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
what it is so you can select you know by

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.070 
what it is so you can select you know by
choosing<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.549> different<00:02:48.700> thing<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.840> can

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
choosing a different thing you can

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.990 
choosing a different thing you can
change<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.769> three<00:02:51.010> blocks<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.580> only<00:02:51.819> issue

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
change the three blocks the only issue

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.490 
change the three blocks the only issue
is<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.600> most<00:02:52.720> confusing<00:02:53.170> thing<00:02:53.410> in

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
is that it's the most confusing thing in

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.000 
is that it's the most confusing thing in
the<00:02:53.590> world<00:02:53.799> they<00:02:54.489> accidently<00:02:55.030> chose<00:02:55.299> a<00:02:55.540> ladder

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the world they accidently chose a ladder

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.380 
the world they accidently chose a ladder
now<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.040> have<00:02:57.340> now<00:02:57.670> let's<00:02:57.849> say<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.060> don't<00:02:58.209> want

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
now I have now let's say I don't want

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.440 
now I have now let's say I don't want
that<00:02:58.599> ladder<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:59.110> but<00:02:59.290> instead<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.620> want<00:02:59.950> my

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that ladder there but instead I want my

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.300 
that ladder there but instead I want my
steps<00:03:01.450> back<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.959> have<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.170> choose<00:03:02.530> three<00:03:02.950> things

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
steps back I have to choose three things

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.970 
steps back I have to choose three things
before<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.569> ladder<00:03:04.780> will<00:03:05.049> disappear<00:03:05.590> it

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
before the ladder will disappear it

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.100 
before the ladder will disappear it
cycles<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:06.700> that's<00:03:06.880> kind<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.150> annoying<00:03:07.390> but

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
cycles so that's kind of annoying but

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.420 
cycles so that's kind of annoying but
other<00:03:08.470> than<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.739> I'm<00:03:09.010> sure<00:03:09.190> they're<00:03:09.340> gonna

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
other than that I'm sure they're gonna

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.990 
other than that I'm sure they're gonna
fix<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.880> eventually<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:12.220> for<00:03:12.519> everything<00:03:12.849> else

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
fix it eventually as for everything else

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.970 
fix it eventually as for everything else
that<00:03:13.180> touches<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.900> touch<00:03:14.080> response<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.680> great

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
that touches the touch response is great

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.220 
that touches the touch response is great
it<00:03:15.250> looks<00:03:15.519> good<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.060> looks<00:03:16.120> pretty<00:03:16.630> sexy<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.200> me

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
it looks good it looks pretty sexy to me
