00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
it and it's long lasting so I think it

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.600 
it and it's long lasting so I think it
lasts<00:04:59.210> about<00:04:59.300> eight<00:04:59.630> hours<00:04:59.840> supposedly<00:05:00.650> I've

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
lasts about eight hours supposedly I've

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.860 
lasts about eight hours supposedly I've
had<00:05:01.850> another<00:05:02.090> one<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.390> these<00:05:02.479> but<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.720> actually

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
had another one of these but I actually

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.530 
had another one of these but I actually
lost<00:05:03.229> it<00:05:03.530> and<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:04.160> also<00:05:04.310> has<00:05:04.490> SPF<00:05:05.060> in<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.390> which

lost it and it also has SPF in it which

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.580 
lost it and it also has SPF in it which
is<00:05:05.660> really<00:05:05.840> good<00:05:05.990> because<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.290> don't<00:05:06.530> want

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.990 
is really good because you don't want
your<00:05:06.800> lips<00:05:06.979> to<00:05:07.100> burn<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.610> lot<00:05:07.760> of<00:05:07.880> people

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000

don't know that their lips can burn out
in<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.310> Sun<00:05:10.490> but<00:05:10.669> they<00:05:10.880> do<00:05:10.940> so<00:05:11.720> it's<00:05:11.870> really

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
in the Sun but they do so it's really
