stuff<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.410> got<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.590> bunch<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:03.920> estimates

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
stuff is we got a bunch of estimates

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.920 
stuff is we got a bunch of estimates
coming<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:04.760> our<00:02:04.880> sales<00:02:05.150> how<00:02:05.300> much<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:05.810> get

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
coming in our sales how much we get

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.270 
coming in our sales how much we get
three<00:02:06.140> estimates<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.710> everything<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.190> it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
three estimates of everything and it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.450 
three estimates of everything and it
runs<00:02:07.430> anywhere<00:02:07.700> from<00:02:07.850> 90<00:02:09.040> 119,000<00:02:10.040> dollars<00:02:10.340> so

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
runs anywhere from 90 119,000 dollars so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.680 
runs anywhere from 90 119,000 dollars so
we<00:02:10.610> know<00:02:10.760> our<00:02:10.880> range<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.330> somewhere<00:02:11.600> around

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
we know our range is somewhere around

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.140 
we know our range is somewhere around
under<00:02:12.170> grand<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.530> do<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:13.820> think<00:02:14.030> our

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
under grand to do this we think our

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.280 
under grand to do this we think our
plumbing<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.630> going<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:14.900> somewhere<00:02:15.260> around

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
plumbing is going to be somewhere around

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.350 
plumbing is going to be somewhere around
thirty<00:02:15.740> thousand<00:02:16.280> dollars<00:02:16.520> individual<00:02:17.060> unit

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
thirty thousand dollars individual unit

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.780 
thirty thousand dollars individual unit
plumbing<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.810> fine<00:02:17.990> but<00:02:18.680> there's<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
plumbing is fine but there's a all the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.190 
plumbing is fine but there's a all the
plumbing<00:02:20.090> goes<00:02:20.240> in<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.540> building<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.050> then

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
plumbing goes in that building and then

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.230 
plumbing goes in that building and then
ago<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.680> these<00:02:21.830> three<00:02:21.980> bills<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
ago so these three bills one of the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.970 
ago so these three bills one of the
things<00:02:23.360> we<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.870> building<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.530> resolved

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
things we know that building we resolved

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.740 
things we know that building we resolved
I<00:02:25.040> think<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.640> bees<00:02:25.820> are<00:02:25.850> underground<00:02:26.450> this

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
I think the bees are underground this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.510 
I think the bees are underground this
one<00:02:26.930> disease<00:02:27.290> probably<00:02:27.620> place<00:02:28.040> that's<00:02:28.370> going

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
one disease probably place that's going

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.020 
one disease probably place that's going
to<00:02:28.580> be<00:02:28.640> about<00:02:28.700> 11<00:02:28.880> child<00:02:29.740> dollars<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.760> i

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
to be about 11 child dollars and i

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.050 
to be about 11 child dollars and i
believe<00:02:33.020> i<00:02:33.470> believe<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.220> one<00:02:34.370> over<00:02:34.550> there<00:02:34.670> has

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
believe i believe the one over there has

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.300 
believe i believe the one over there has
to<00:02:35.210> be<00:02:35.240> done<00:02:35.450> i'm<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:35.870> exactly<00:02:36.170> sure<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:36.830> i

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
to be done i'm not exactly sure but i

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.220 
to be done i'm not exactly sure but i
think<00:02:37.580> my<00:02:38.000> your<00:02:38.390> own<00:02:38.480> told<00:02:38.720> me<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.020> said

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
think my your own told me so I said

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.230 
think my your own told me so I said
investigation<00:02:39.980> should<00:02:40.070> be<00:02:40.160> around<00:02:40.310> 30<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
investigation should be around 30 the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.660 
investigation should be around 30 the
balance<00:02:41.810> would<00:02:42.020> be<00:02:42.050> just<00:02:42.590> individual<00:02:43.280> units

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
balance would be just individual units

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.610 
balance would be just individual units
it<00:02:44.030> doesn't<00:02:44.450> take<00:02:44.570> additional<00:02:44.840> hundred<00:02:45.230> grand

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
it doesn't take additional hundred grand

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.800 
it doesn't take additional hundred grand
to<00:02:45.860> do<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.430> no<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:47.300> put<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.660> their
