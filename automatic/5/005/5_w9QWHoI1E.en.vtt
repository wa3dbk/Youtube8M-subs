the beauty of the golden rectangle is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.469 
the beauty of the golden rectangle is
that<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> take<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.909> golden<00:01:09.299> rectangle

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that if you take the golden rectangle

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.440 
that if you take the golden rectangle
section<00:01:10.340> here<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> golden<00:01:11.939> rectangle

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
section here is a golden rectangle

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
section here is a golden rectangle
section<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.110> draw<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> square<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
section and you draw a square out of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
section and you draw a square out of
that<00:01:15.360> golden<00:01:15.720> rectangle<00:01:16.290> section<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:17.220> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that golden rectangle section what you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.270 
that golden rectangle section what you
end<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.659> golden<00:01:19.259> rectangle<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
end up with is a golden rectangle here a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.230 
end up with is a golden rectangle here a
square<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.850> surprisingly<00:01:23.850> enough

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
square here and surprisingly enough

square here and surprisingly enough
another<00:01:24.869> golden<00:01:25.350> rectangle<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:27.530> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
another golden rectangle right here you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.700 
another golden rectangle right here you
can<00:01:28.740> divide<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.400> space<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:30.060> into<00:01:30.780> fives<00:01:31.170> and

can divide this space up into fives and
eights<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.000> squares<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.229> you'll<00:01:34.829> end<00:01:35.040> up

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
eights and squares and you'll end up

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.020

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
rectangle those positions are all where

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
rectangle those positions are all where
the<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> naturally<00:01:58.860> will<00:01:59.700> go<00:02:00.619> if<00:02:02.000> it's<00:02:03.000> allowed

the I naturally will go if it's allowed

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.249 
the I naturally will go if it's allowed
to<00:02:03.530> that's<00:02:04.530> where<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> finds<00:02:05.369> rest<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.479> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
to that's where it finds rest and it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.889 
to that's where it finds rest and it
finds<00:02:07.590> rest<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.310> primarily<00:02:09.090> because<00:02:09.690> of

finds rest there primarily because of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.390 
finds rest there primarily because of
the<00:02:10.050> fact<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.560> our<00:02:10.830> cells<00:02:11.610> divide

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
the fact that our cells divide

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.920 
the fact that our cells divide
that<00:02:12.790> way<00:02:13.230> when<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.439> flower<00:02:15.040> grows<00:02:15.579> it<00:02:15.939> grows<00:02:16.420> in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
that way when a flower grows it grows in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.149 
that way when a flower grows it grows in
a<00:02:17.079> spiral<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:18.489> shell<00:02:19.110> spiral<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.739> nautilus

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
a spiral the shell spiral of a nautilus

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.569 
a spiral the shell spiral of a nautilus
is<00:02:21.519> due<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.720> growth<00:02:23.140> rate<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.250> it's

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
is due to that growth rate so it's

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.140 
is due to that growth rate so it's
somehow<00:02:24.909> built<00:02:25.599> into<00:02:26.049> us<00:02:26.079> to<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.730> ratio

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
somehow built into us to like that ratio

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.920 
somehow built into us to like that ratio
and<00:02:29.099> when<00:02:30.099> artists<00:02:30.670> discovered<00:02:30.909> it<00:02:31.359> when<00:02:31.810> they

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
and when artists discovered it when they

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.479 
and when artists discovered it when they
started<00:02:32.290> painting<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.859> when<00:02:33.040> they<00:02:33.129> started

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
started painting and when they started

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.940 
started painting and when they started
doing<00:02:33.849> things<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.239> building<00:02:34.950> buildings

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
doing things like building buildings

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.059 
doing things like building buildings
they<00:02:36.459> discovered<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.299> was<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> very

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
they discovered that that was a very

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.539 
they discovered that that was a very
perfect<00:02:39.599> shape<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:41.459> established<00:02:42.459> good

perfect shape and established good
composition<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.720> people<00:02:47.260> naturally<00:02:47.709> liked

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
composition that people naturally liked

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.800 
composition that people naturally liked
so<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.720> tend<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> build<00:02:50.799> any<00:02:51.180> structure<00:02:52.180> whether

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
so I tend to build any structure whether

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.509 
so I tend to build any structure whether
it's<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.170> still<00:02:53.470> life<00:02:53.680> or<00:02:53.709> whether<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.430> a

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
it's a still life or whether it's a

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.360 
it's a still life or whether it's a
portrait<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.150> use<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.200> golden<00:02:56.530> rectangle<00:02:57.250> as

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
portrait and use the golden rectangle as

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.050 
portrait and use the golden rectangle as
a<00:02:57.430> guideline<00:02:58.269> as<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:59.709> place<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.340> start<00:03:00.639> rather

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
a guideline as a place to start rather

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.349 
a guideline as a place to start rather
than<00:03:01.359> just<00:03:01.659> breaking<00:03:02.170> things<00:03:02.409> down<00:03:02.530> into

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
than just breaking things down into

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.140 
than just breaking things down into
simple<00:03:04.359> halves<00:03:04.900> in<00:03:05.319> fact<00:03:06.250> an<00:03:06.519> eight<00:03:06.939> and<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
simple halves in fact an eight and a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.240 
simple halves in fact an eight and a
half<00:03:07.180> by<00:03:07.329> eleven<00:03:07.989> sheet<00:03:08.139> of<00:03:08.530> paper<00:03:08.709> is

half by eleven sheet of paper is

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.460 
half by eleven sheet of paper is
basically<00:03:10.030> based<00:03:10.659> upon<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.109> golden

basically based upon the golden
rectangle
