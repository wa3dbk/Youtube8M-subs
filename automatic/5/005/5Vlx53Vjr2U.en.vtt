00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:09.059
 Hello today I want to show it 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.580
 which I discovered recently 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.679
 and you know the problem of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.929
 home button on the iphone 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 This nasty little thing becomes natural 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:25.320
 also the most used of his 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 Most abused buttons you need 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.619
 get him out of the app somewhere 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.529
 come on the homescreen back and forth 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.780
 change and the little thing that works 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.370
 also the most broken and so a home 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.649
 Button repair because I have me real 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.739
 startled costs just between times 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:48.180
 79 and 80 euros or between 60 and 80 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.989
 euro your provider I have the expensive 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.480
 sometimes faced with it 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.820
 why then 20 euro difference 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.850
 in between he paints gentlemen yes we 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 build only original parts so one 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.789
 homebutton costs three euros but 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 if ye times the expense of peeping 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.000
 because it means this home button too 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.409
 then that's actually the change 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.820
 most of the work is the working time and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.439
 that's what causes them too 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.080
 correspondingly high cost 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.520
 I think it's fast at 40 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.939
 minutes 45 minutes alone for 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.850
 disassemble and again 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.830
 assemble 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.390
 yes I have a very unconventional 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.280
 Method found because I believe that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.640
 this home button often just 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.220
 dirty and dirty and mine 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.130
 solution that looks like it will 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.590
 Some smirk and laugh that's it 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.979
 a toothbrush or electric exactly 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.210
 and you can do a lot with this 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.460
 you have to pay you buy 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.790
 Just set it up before taking this 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.119
 why 60 70 80 euros invested in the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 repair first tried herewith one 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.670
 electric toothbrush has with 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.320
 security everyone knows 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.020
 at least someone like that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.080
 toothbrush he should have new head 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.720
 be very dry 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.030
 and ye just works here 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.860
 slowly around the homebutton we around 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.690
 could also impress it or 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.370
 so i think that maybe whole 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.310
 good if you put the iphone on it 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.710
 the bender dirt keeps its head somewhere 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.590
 in there is this dirt again 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.140
 directly solves and falls out can also 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.210
 it's great too 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.030
 new use for the speakers here 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.450
 which also displace very quickly and the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.940
 dock connector but also here the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.510
 side buttons right here in this one 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.220
 Area 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.440
 because we like to be dirty 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:51.740
 or even for the headphones 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.030
 for the headphone jack yes I show 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.260
 you now just how I do it 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.430
 So you switch this electrical 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.230
 toothbrush a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.459
 names are not mentioned will not 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.470
 done bad and so easy now 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.900
 times 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.180
 so be careful about it 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800
 only by the vibration the first 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.980
 created 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.330
 it is so that I am going right there 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.760
 So you can also easily yourself 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.260
 after pressing then one comes namely 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.330
 a little deeper in then goes now and then 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.040
 times the voice control of others but so 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.870
 nothing happens and how 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.630
 I would even say that on the whole 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.250
 ask 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.560
 because I think that 's even better 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.450
 effect then because you have the whole 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.260
 things really out there all the way 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.970
 get out and but I have it too 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.770
 but do not want to believe it 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:45.070
 proven to work better afterwards 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.630
 So you probably get too 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.540
 not completely the whole dirt with it 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.880
 but you can also use other methods 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.190
 of course try it like you 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.150
 somehow to go in with high pressure 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.400
 or so and that is the cellphone of mine 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.050
 Woman and she often uses hand cream 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.440
 believe that, too 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.690
 Factor is the one that leads to problems 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.030
 but if you do that, keep it quiet 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.190
 so 23 minutes or even longer and the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.110
 Note that it will be essential 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.640
 be liquid 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.709
 So if it somehow problems 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.120
 there is now above me just 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.419
 press twice or just once 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.320
 to press 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.479
 Now it works again 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.330
 better than before 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:32.580
 and yes I hope you can help this tip 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.169
 if it has saved you 60 70 80 euro 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.030
 I would like to have a nice one 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.340
