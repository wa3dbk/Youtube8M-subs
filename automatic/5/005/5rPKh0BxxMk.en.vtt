00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
okay let's make another try okay so i

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.790 
okay let's make another try okay so i
will<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.510> click<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.319> same<00:03:01.530> time<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.680> it

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
will just click the same time so it

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.610 
will just click the same time so it
seems<00:03:08.099> like<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:09.330> note<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> little<00:03:10.440> bit

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
seems like the note is a little bit

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.580 
seems like the note is a little bit
faster<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.700> barely<00:03:15.060> noticeable<00:03:15.980> and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
faster but it's barely noticeable and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.680 
faster but it's barely noticeable and
yeah<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:22.140> let's<00:03:22.379> try<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:23.129> other<00:03:23.610> website<00:03:24.180> called

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
yeah so let's try a other website called

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.140 
yeah so let's try a other website called

often blow de you guys probably don't

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.130 
often blow de you guys probably don't

know what this website is but it's a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.350 
know what this website is but it's a
news<00:03:34.799> channel<00:03:35.730> or<00:03:36.239> news<00:03:37.160> website<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.640> Swedish

news channel or news website in Swedish
I<00:03:42.950> not<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.400> small<00:03:45.060> keyboard<00:03:45.390> on<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.069> s2

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
I not like this small keyboard on the s2

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:57.050 
I not like this small keyboard on the s2
so<00:03:48.720> used<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:53.120> note<00:03:54.170> keyboard<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.700> let's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
so used to this note keyboard so let's

so used to this note keyboard so let's
go

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.160 

okay<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:09.010> weird<00:04:09.280> because<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:10.420> one<00:04:10.689> goes

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
okay this is weird because this one goes

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.920 
okay this is weird because this one goes
to<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.530> mobile<00:04:12.219> version<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.269> site<00:04:13.569> and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
to the mobile version of this site and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.810 
to the mobile version of this site and
this<00:04:14.650> one<00:04:14.950> just<00:04:15.370> go<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.730> their<00:04:16.060> regular<00:04:16.299> like

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
this one just go to their regular like

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.090 
this one just go to their regular like
computer<00:04:18.820> website<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.750> that's<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.709> little<00:04:20.889> bit

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
computer website and that's a little bit

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.050 
computer website and that's a little bit
weird<00:04:21.400> but<00:04:22.120> if<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.690> would<00:04:23.220> if<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.280> would<00:04:24.610> see

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
weird but if you would if you would see

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.890 
weird but if you would if you would see
it<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:25.419> way<00:04:25.840> i<00:04:26.400> think<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.150> s2<00:04:28.599> is<00:04:28.750> the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
it this way i think that the s2 is the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.249 
it this way i think that the s2 is the
winner<00:04:29.139> because<00:04:29.650> this<00:04:30.389> regular<00:04:31.389> website<00:04:31.660> is<00:04:32.229> a

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
winner because this regular website is a

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.140 
winner because this regular website is a
lot<00:04:33.570> heavier<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:35.050> load<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.669> takes<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.910> lot<00:04:37.120> more

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
lot heavier to load and takes a lot more

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.379 
lot heavier to load and takes a lot more
time<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:38.110> load<00:04:38.320> up<00:04:38.820> then<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.000> mobile<00:04:40.360> version

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
time to load up then the mobile version

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.890 
time to load up then the mobile version
and<00:04:41.280> there<00:04:42.280> wasn't<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.669> much<00:04:43.509> big

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
and there wasn't that much big

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.300 
and there wasn't that much big
difference<00:04:44.440> between<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:45.150> speed<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.770> i<00:04:47.800> would

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
difference between the speed so i would

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.550 
difference between the speed so i would
probably<00:04:49.150> say<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.690> s2<00:04:50.050> is<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.320> winner

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
probably say that the s2 is the winner

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.969 
probably say that the s2 is the winner
but<00:04:51.030> yeah<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.570> little<00:04:52.690> bit<00:04:52.930> unfair<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.770> say

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
but yeah it's a little bit unfair to say

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.640 
but yeah it's a little bit unfair to say
that<00:04:55.800> let's<00:04:56.800> try<00:04:57.070> another<00:04:57.250> website<00:04:58.650> let's

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
that let's try another website let's

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.820 
that let's try another website let's
take<00:05:02.370> youtube<00:05:03.370> i<00:05:03.660> know<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.320> will<00:05:05.530> go<00:05:05.770> to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
take youtube i know that it will go to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.460 
take youtube i know that it will go to
the<00:05:06.430> like<00:05:07.410> regular<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.820> mean<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:10.630> mobile

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
the like regular I mean the mobile

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.040 
the like regular I mean the mobile
version<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.370> i<00:05:12.400> will<00:05:12.669> just<00:05:12.699> click<00:05:13.150> this<00:05:13.389> same

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
version so i will just click this same

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.930 
version so i will just click this same
time<00:05:19.050> ok<00:05:20.050> so<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.860> s2<00:05:21.220> was<00:05:21.430> a<00:05:21.460> little<00:05:21.820> bit

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
time ok so the s2 was a little bit

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:31.020 
time ok so the s2 was a little bit
faster<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:26.440> yeah<00:05:28.380> I<00:05:29.380> have<00:05:30.070> been<00:05:30.370> noticing<00:05:31.000> that

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
faster so yeah I have been noticing that

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.060 
faster so yeah I have been noticing that
the<00:05:31.479> s2<00:05:32.050> is<00:05:32.289> faster<00:05:33.210> in<00:05:34.210> pretty<00:05:34.599> much<00:05:34.750> always

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
the s2 is faster in pretty much always

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:42.350 
the s2 is faster in pretty much always
but<00:05:36.070> i<00:05:36.720> think<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:38.770> note<00:05:39.009> is<00:05:39.340> more<00:05:40.090> like

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
but i think that the note is more like

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.379 
but i think that the note is more like
smoother<00:05:43.360> I<00:05:43.389> mean<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:44.590> use<00:05:45.039> it's<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.970> lot<00:05:46.150> nicer

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
smoother I mean to use it's a lot nicer

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.010 
smoother I mean to use it's a lot nicer
to<00:05:47.050> use<00:05:47.320> because<00:05:47.710> of<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.580> big<00:05:48.820> screen<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.599> a

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
to use because of the big screen and a

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.249 
to use because of the big screen and a
bigger<00:05:50.229> resolution<00:05:51.120> so<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.180> can<00:05:52.479> read<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.229> lot

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
bigger resolution so you can read a lot

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.719 
bigger resolution so you can read a lot
more<00:05:53.469> information<00:05:53.979> on<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.669> screen<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:56.729> yeah

if you would watch movies this is the
