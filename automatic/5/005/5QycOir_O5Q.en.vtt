00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.470
 with the shoes that in colombia and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.410

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.570
 well 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.000
 a color of those that we take to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 that when they arrived in Colombia 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.800

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.300

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:26.840
 extremely large is quite solid 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.640

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.500
 exactly the thread of the wave 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.500

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.810

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.439

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.550
 paper 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.140
 the days 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:10.250

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:14.810

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.810

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.420
 shoes 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.849
 are 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.849
 the most comfortable in the world 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.370
 they are very challenging 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.530

 the side panel yes school because it 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.700

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:29.130
 the material is the synthetic tip in the 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.130
 good leather cast now 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.820
 painted clear 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.169
 but sometimes but it's like a 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.349
 with a protective 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:58.060

00:04:53.349 --> 00:05:01.139
 2 to row mattress technology 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:08.999

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:16.430
 just the air for another shoe back and 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.430

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:29.330
 the foam and it's all very color the 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.330
 material pressel games 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.460

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.550
 good classes 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.490

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.449
 to show the thalamus 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.789
 Normally you see that guy 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.789

 in jump many of these 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:38.579
 people are obviously with the moral of 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.399
 the jordan then we will not let fly 

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:43.820

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:46.360
 comfort
