influenced it and how did it come about

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
influenced it and how did it come about
so<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> knew<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> make<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> video<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so I knew I want to make a video for the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
so I knew I want to make a video for the
song<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.489> had<00:00:50.640> an<00:00:50.760> idea<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
song and I had an idea of a way to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.709 
song and I had an idea of a way to
create<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.070> type<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.309> motion<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
create this type of motion that kind of

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
create this type of motion that kind of
synced<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.140> well<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> energy<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
synced up well with the energy of the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
synced up well with the energy of the
song<00:00:56.550> which<00:00:57.030> has<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.750> jagged

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
song which has a little bit of a jagged

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.040 
song which has a little bit of a jagged
edge<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.910> this<00:00:59.910> stop-motion<00:01:00.390> sort<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
edge to it and this stop-motion sort of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.930 
edge to it and this stop-motion sort of
process<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.190> worked<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.699> well<00:01:02.820> i

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
process kind of worked really well i

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.280 
process kind of worked really well i
thought<00:01:03.180> well<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> thought<00:01:04.140> behind

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
thought well it was the thought behind

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.350 
thought well it was the thought behind
the<00:01:04.530> blue<00:01:04.650> boxes<00:01:05.040> wanted<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.119> something

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the blue boxes wanted to have something

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
the blue boxes wanted to have something
that<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> moved<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.560> sync<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that kind of moved in sync with the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
that kind of moved in sync with the
music<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.700> i<00:01:09.330> was<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.840> love<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.290> idea

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
music and i was in love with this idea

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.880 
music and i was in love with this idea
of<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.040> old<00:01:11.670> early<00:01:12.570> 80s<00:01:12.930> boom<00:01:13.110> boxes<00:01:13.560> at

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
of like old early 80s boom boxes at

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
of like old early 80s boom boxes at
first<00:01:14.130> i<00:01:14.369> had<00:01:14.610> thought<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.000> i<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.720> go

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
first i had thought about i will just go

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
first i had thought about i will just go
out<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:15.990> buy<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> bunch<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.650> old<00:01:16.799> ladies<00:01:16.890> boom

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
out and buy a bunch of old ladies boom

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
out and buy a bunch of old ladies boom
boxes<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.880> i<00:01:17.970> realize<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.170> just

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
boxes and i realize it was that it just

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.929 
boxes and i realize it was that it just
wasn't<00:01:19.409> feasible<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> financial

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
wasn't feasible from a financial

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.420 
wasn't feasible from a financial
standpoint<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.560> solution<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.220> was

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
standpoint so so my solution to that was

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
standpoint so so my solution to that was
hey<00:01:23.610> I'll<00:01:23.820> make<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.540> cheapest<00:01:24.900> boom<00:01:25.020> boxes<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
hey I'll make the cheapest boom boxes I

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
hey I'll make the cheapest boom boxes I
