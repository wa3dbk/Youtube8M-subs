 the reason to smile one more chance is 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.259
 when I was asked what I did not 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.009

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.770

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:30.680
 on TV screens with their work as 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.680
 journalist in 2000 an accident in the curve 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.710
 completely her life I just want 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.550

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.129
 help 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.469
 I already knew that I had broken my neck 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.670
 because the same time the car stopped 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.530
 My hand fell on my lap. 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.659
 I thought my neck 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.269
 You know that thing to hear some 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.909
 Someone asking if you want 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.440
 nobody wanted to operate because the injury was 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.510
 very high 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.909
 It's what you want out of life, I want to stay. 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.030
 to stay alive on pensions 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.240
 the journalist stayed in athletic but the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.660
 The most chance could not be 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.030
 wasted 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.400
 physical disability was a barrier to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.160
 that has been broken with the touches 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.040
 soft brushes on canvas painted by 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.530
 she with her mouth shares an association 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.140
 painters with his mouth and feet to where 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.320
 is distributed in more than 70 countries 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.700
 a lot of people paint themselves or with their mouths 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.640
 with the parents 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.610
 the art of simone runs the world east 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 such as postcards that have been 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.170
 distributed in three countries 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.970
 the strength to be able to continue 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.540
 his work as an artist comes from the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.320
 friends of parents and their four children 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.870
 that brings happiness epics 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.900
 certainly there are no limits to this 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.800
 warrior to tetraplegia is not synonymous 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.890
 of accommodation on the contrary if with the mouth 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.750
 Simone paints with her eyes she writes in 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.450
 a web page 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.070
 what you find interesting to share with 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.160
 other people 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.190
 the difference between the old 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.310
 current simone is the same as that picture 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 painted before and from this other painted 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.400
 after the accident 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.400
 little thing has changed 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.010
 looking at the picture quickly everything seems 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.739
 being perfect but the work it portrays 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.260
 a tulip divided into parts have another 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.510
 meaning and won the title that neither 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.750
 everything that is whole means 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.720
 perfection a parallel between art and 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.420
 life of the artist it is fragmented it 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.840
 is in pieces it is pasted a screen in the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.900
 the other the same way I got it right 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.700
 whole but is internally amended has a 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.870
 prosthesis has screw 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.480
 so it 's a nice picture, it's him 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.760
 accurately conveys the figure I 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.849
 I believe it will be yes I am absorbing given 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.930
 but that does not make me a person and 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.930
 imperfect does not
