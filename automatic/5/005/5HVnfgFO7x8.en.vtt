00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:16.529
 guto and jonas is the tip we 'll see 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.410
 a technique to facilitate the accounts of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.539
 multiplication when one of the numbers has 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.550
 zeros on the right, ie when the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.180
 We are multiplying multiples of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.490
 10 to 1 take the first example there three 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.949
 times 200 times 60 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 if we multiply this in the way 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.940
 that is putting a business 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.940
 of the other and making the count gives a certain 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.520
 work any simpler form of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.500
 if you do that, you think this is 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.350
 even 200 people can write like 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.309
 twice the 60 as six times 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.100
 10 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.460
 so we can rewrite this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.190
 explanation as three times 2 16 times the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.369
 followed by all 10 that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:09.090
 appear now are 30 thousand three times 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.630
 two to 66 16 36 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.189
 so here it is 36 and then we say 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.479
 number 10 that appear 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:23.150
 So much so this product here in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.150
 Up in the 36 thousand 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.550
 for this example here fifty times twenty 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.670
 times 90 times 8 what would be the rule is 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.100
 same thing we're writing this 5 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 with five times 2 times nine times eight 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:50.450
 times that they appear 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:53.820
 are 300 30 thousand thousand five times 21010 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.320
 1990 90 times 18 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.509
 we can even think about it 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 Our thing plus a rule 9018 is to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.930
 same thing as nine times eight times in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.810
 10 9 times eight and 72 times 10 720 o 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.239
 product of these four numbers of here 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.979
 720 and then I'll put the number of 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.190
 zeros that appear now there is 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:23.330
 right 00 do is a product here 50 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.330
 times 2690 times 18 of 720 thousand 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.090
 ok he thinks our tip today tutto 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.090
 I eat you
