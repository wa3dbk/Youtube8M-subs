00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.530
 do not 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.550
 very good condition people who just like 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.970
 it is fine on menus the actual vote on 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.470
 how to make an item classifier is worth 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.390
 which is an item classifier 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 naive that you have some trap of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.869
 mons 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.790
 or whatever it is that pick up items 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.910
 automatically and you think that it 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.250
 order by rows of chests do you think that in 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.470
 this software row of an object in this 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.810
 another etcetera so that we get out 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.360
 everything is ordered and not then have to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.649
 solve you and waste the time that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.540
 you could devote doing something else well 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:40.110
 let's do a tasting vale 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.080
 put here so that each item goes in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.480
 a site other than what was downloaded from 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.860
 Spider 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.860
 some bones 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.750
 here zombie 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.980
 and here they will lower the zombie flesh like 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.100
 You see, I have not put it in before, I'm going to be 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.100
 plus 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.150
 and look here 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.160
 and here I am going to throw for achieving 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.160
 example pass by time 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.459
 and he arrived 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.330
 facebook well how does this work 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.900
 sample is very simple look 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.120
 these hopper is up here they are like a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.840
 circle vale go the circle all the time 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.430
 good and in case they do not capture the item 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.870
 we come from time to capture so 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.430
 repeat until you do not have all the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.640
 sites that each one of them should capture 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.820
 these hoppers these towers are for 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.870
 select the item you want is worth 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.900
 these are all going to be hooked 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.330
 comparator and in the comparators will stop 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.010
 the just number of items that are in 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.760
 theory 18 + 1 here here you see that 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.540
 examples 18 plus 4 forgiveness 18 plus 4 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.290
 then this number 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.390
 it's the right thing to throw a 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.160
 pulse comparator and just when 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.460
 goal with and also this hopper the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.900
 comparator send one more signal 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.140
 sanz with 19 4 will send two courses and now 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.260
 that turns on this 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.800
 this one here repeats and that for this 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.650
 torch allowing this to happen towards 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.290
 ahead for each item precisely here 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.620
 will send small ejected so fall each 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.890
 pressing in half 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.210
 and for example if we put in let's put 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.370
 you have here 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.230
 and I know that again at 18 and they all pass 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.480
 here it is well and then from 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.910
 here, then the item will go through your line 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.040
 down and already it has no more 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.690
 visits lines and well this is achieved 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.050
 very easy does not have many things like 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.470
 you see is a comparator two of rest a 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.570
 repeater and a good torch I hope 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.810
 what you liked is the editing team 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.810
 bye
