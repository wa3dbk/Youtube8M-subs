this<00:02:52.989> one<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.830> little<00:02:54.040> different<00:02:54.190> you

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
this one it's a little different you

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.770 
this one it's a little different you
have<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> little<00:02:54.880> bit<00:02:54.970> more<00:02:55.120> freedom<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.570> feel

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
have a little bit more freedom I feel

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.170 
have a little bit more freedom I feel
like<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.170> because<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.530> similar<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
like it because it's similar to like a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.390 
like it because it's similar to like a
squished<00:02:58.900> version<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.530> standoff<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.130> guess<00:03:00.280> you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
squished version of standoff I guess you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.460 
squished version of standoff I guess you
could<00:03:00.550> say<00:03:00.700> or<00:03:00.880> like<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> long<00:03:01.780> agent<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.290> more

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
could say or like a long agent is more

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.229 
could say or like a long agent is more
like<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.680> more<00:03:03.040> elongated<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.060> more

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
like it more elongated in a more

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.449 
like it more elongated in a more
straight<00:03:04.600> version<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.140> standoff<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:06.340> I

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
straight version of standoff and I

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.430 
straight version of standoff and I
really<00:03:06.880> really<00:03:07.060> like<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.390> maps<00:03:07.840> definitely

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
really really like this maps definitely

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.770 
really really like this maps definitely

recorded the whole thing we're going to
post<00:05:56.940> it<00:05:57.180> in<00:05:57.360> part<00:05:57.930> they're<00:05:58.440> going<00:05:58.560> to<00:05:58.620> be<00:05:58.680> six

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
post it in part they're going to be six

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.680 
post it in part they're going to be six
parts<00:05:59.280> of<00:05:59.370> 10<00:05:59.580> about<00:05:59.820> 10<00:06:00.030> minutes<00:06:00.240> long<00:06:00.540> I

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
parts of 10 about 10 minutes long I

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.210 
parts of 10 about 10 minutes long I
think<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:00.930> last<00:06:01.110> one<00:06:01.260> is<00:06:01.410> going<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.590> be<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:01.710> 15

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
think the last one is going to be a 15

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.470 
think the last one is going to be a 15
because<00:06:02.430> i<00:06:02.460> think<00:06:02.610> it<00:06:02.730> was<00:06:02.790> like<00:06:02.910> an<00:06:03.030> hour<00:06:03.150> five

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
because i think it was like an hour five
