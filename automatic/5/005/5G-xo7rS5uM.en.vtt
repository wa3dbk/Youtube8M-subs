it enough shocks even put a new grille
on<00:01:14.620> it<00:01:14.740> that's<00:01:15.220> probably<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.580> 60<00:01:16.560> 68<00:01:17.560> or<00:01:17.710> 69<00:01:17.830> I

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
on it that's probably a 60 68 or 69 I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.740 
on it that's probably a 60 68 or 69 I
don't<00:01:18.400> know<00:01:18.460> if<00:01:18.550> I'm<00:01:18.640> right<00:01:18.820> or<00:01:18.850> wrong<00:01:19.030> think

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
don't know if I'm right or wrong think

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
don't know if I'm right or wrong think
68<00:01:20.320> over<00:01:20.650> 6x<00:01:21.190> 469<00:01:22.290> grille<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.900> got<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> 315<00:01:26.830> here

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
68 over 6x 469 grille we got a 315 here

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.850 
68 over 6x 469 grille we got a 315 here
it's<00:01:28.210> not<00:01:28.480> really<00:01:28.750> nothing<00:01:29.320> special<00:01:29.350> it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
it's not really nothing special it's

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's not really nothing special it's
just<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:30.100> 350<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.720> these<00:01:31.840> hoses<00:01:32.110> are<00:01:32.770> still<00:01:33.010> bad

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
just a 350 and these hoses are still bad

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.470 
just a 350 and these hoses are still bad
it's<00:01:33.580> got<00:01:33.730> even<00:01:34.030> worse<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.540> need<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.409> redo<00:01:35.860> that

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
it's got even worse I need to redo that

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.600 
it's got even worse I need to redo that
but<00:01:37.480> probably<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.380> biggest<00:01:38.590> thing<00:01:38.830> the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
but probably the biggest thing the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.040 
but probably the biggest thing the
update<00:01:39.909> I've<00:01:40.060> done<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.330> this<00:01:40.450> truck<00:01:40.659> was<00:01:40.810> put<00:01:41.020> a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
update I've done on this truck was put a

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.320 
update I've done on this truck was put a
new<00:01:41.230> wiring<00:01:41.470> harness<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:42.010> it<00:01:42.159> because<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.240> was

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
new wiring harness on it because it was

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.149 
new wiring harness on it because it was
pretty<00:01:43.480> the<00:01:44.170> wires<00:01:44.350> were<00:01:44.530> pretty<00:01:44.740> messed<00:01:44.950> up

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
pretty the wires were pretty messed up

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.820 
pretty the wires were pretty messed up
and<00:01:45.310> everything<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:46.260> guess<00:01:47.260> I'll<00:01:47.470> show<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
and everything I guess I'll show the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.780 
and everything I guess I'll show the
inside<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:50.729> okay

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
inside now okay

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.600 
inside now okay
here's<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.060> inside<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.979> like<00:01:55.979> my<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.250> Chevy

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
here's the inside I like my little Chevy

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.330 
here's the inside I like my little Chevy
mirror<00:01:56.909> right<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.560> here's<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> door<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
mirror right there here's the door and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.930 
mirror right there here's the door and
the<00:01:59.430> speakers<00:01:59.909> right<00:02:00.090> there

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
the speakers right there

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.370 
the speakers right there
it's<00:02:02.940> pretty<00:02:03.270> clean<00:02:03.479> these<00:02:03.720> seats<00:02:03.990> came<00:02:04.200> out

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's pretty clean these seats came out

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.859 
it's pretty clean these seats came out
steel<00:02:04.890> 2003<00:02:05.729> Silverado<00:02:08.479> it's<00:02:09.479> really

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
steel 2003 Silverado it's really

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.530 
steel 2003 Silverado it's really
comfortable<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.819> much<00:02:12.300> space

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
comfortable in here not that much space

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.740 
comfortable in here not that much space
for<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.830> you're<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> big<00:02:14.489> boy<00:02:14.750> you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
for so if you're really a big boy you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.479 
for so if you're really a big boy you
probably<00:02:16.050> don't<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.340> here

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
probably don't want to get in here

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.790 
probably don't want to get in here
because<00:02:17.840> your<00:02:18.840> belly<00:02:19.050> probably<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> stand

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
because your belly probably on the stand

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:28.160 
because your belly probably on the stand
