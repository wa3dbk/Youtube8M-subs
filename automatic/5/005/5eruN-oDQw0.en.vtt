00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.740
 hello lovely friends today i 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.779
 tell you how 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.599
 all false cilia just not 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 puchkovye but for years the glasses are such 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:28.830
 it looks like this cilia me 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.059
 small looks enough 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.699
 natural if you are interested see 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 then I will tell you everything 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.989
 applied false eyelashes by us 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.400
 display of dina kittens on the eye 4 snowballs I 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.290
 I use port brothel 124 such 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.909
 natural 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.420
 means paid your attention how to shoot 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.280
 cilia let's twist need a little bit 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.150
 as if that's how they push here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.040
 spend the night sever each as they are pasted 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.010
 how they took off 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.979
 dragged before cilia 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.400
 need to impose a little bit like this 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:17.750
 bend so that they are more flexible 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 well superimposed comfortable 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.630
 so can you in advance can 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.399
 try them on the eye to see the length 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 Is everything going okay 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.420
 principle, if something from the edge of 200 if 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.179
 they are too long but can dock 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.679
 never had to do glue 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:40.289
 glue can be applied 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.679
 immediately from the tubes from i usually do or 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.329
 you can put glue on your hand 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.719
 links as if I was not so convenient 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.380
 so I will demonstrate how I apply 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.380
 of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 is to blame 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.350
 I draw your attention to the fact that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.090
 glue on the edge should be applied 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.160
 apply deer skin one by one not 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.100
 because he tends to sorem 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.760
 pecking 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.640
 like this and 30 seconds hundreds you can on them 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.989
 blow in principle 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.380
 to dry quickly 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.610
 wait and we will impose our cilia 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.560
 ready to stick to their pay 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.720
 your attention that you take them for 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.780
 midpoint and attach as if to 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.780
 midway originally like this 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.430
 if somewhere you got dirty in the glue 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.970
 nothing terrible becomes transparent 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.970
 corners stuck 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.930
 he's so 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.670
 stick cilia as always as possible 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:19.639
 closer to your own lashes up 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.769
 loops whether our cilia if you 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:26.780
 feel that they are not completely homogeneous with 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:30.170
 you can drive them a little like that 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.280
 a little bit a little bit not to 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.219
 break and cover with mascara along with your 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.120
 cilia and then not glued and and not 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:43.700
 will there be such an option on me 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.209
 natural almost natural eyelashes 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.719
 non-long so principle when near 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.739
 considering them not so guilty if you 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:55.239
 see what 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.250
 front sight spoiled the eyeliner line 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.280
 you take a brush or eyeliner 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.109
 Whatever you saved 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.459
 pencil and in those places where you 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:11.840
 see you need to add a little bit of it 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:15.500
 do draw directly on top 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.250
 cilia will not be okay here 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.720
 so see 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.789
 so that they cannot be seen they will not be seen 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.940
 like this so I put eyelashes 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.520
 overhead their virtually invisible for 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.710
 account of the fact that I use not such 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.020
 big with a side and how they are good 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.979
 look swallowed of a given how are they 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:47.110
 look good when you shoot 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:49.370
 cilia remove them from the outer edge as 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.560
 if a 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.690
 it will hurt for example it happens 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.350
 unpleasantly a lot of glue can they be good 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.970
 holding can take a cotton swab 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.540
 blot it in the fluid to remove 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.060
 make up and i would get wet on the hem 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.910
 as if erasing as if erasing 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.360
 eyeliner and again remove from the outside 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.560
 corner and remove the box because their 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.970
 can be used several times rinse 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.139
 their same makeup remover fluid 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.780
 rinse gently do not bathe straight 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.389
 then wipe it with a cotton swab 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.370
 on top of a napkin I might be a little 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.380
 I'll post a video later on how to do it and 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.510
 put it back in the box i'm not 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.370
 preparing for use next 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.060
