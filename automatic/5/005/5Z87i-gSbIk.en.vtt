00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.599 

I<00:00:03.710> really<00:00:04.710> think<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.250> body<00:00:05.430> of

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
I really think that the body of

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.160 
I really think that the body of
experiments<00:00:06.420> was<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:06.990> most

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
experiments was one of the most

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.400 
experiments was one of the most
significant<00:00:08.420> experiments<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.570> evolution

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
significant experiments in evolution

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.070 
significant experiments in evolution
that<00:00:10.440> took<00:00:10.860> place<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> 20th<00:00:11.969> century<00:00:12.080> and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
that took place in the 20th century and

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.980 
that took place in the 20th century and
it<00:00:13.320> affected<00:00:13.830> my<00:00:14.009> life<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:15.089> my<00:00:15.150> thinking

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
it affected my life and in my thinking

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.570 
it affected my life and in my thinking
in<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.680> many<00:00:16.800> ways<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:19.529> experiment<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.250> begun

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
in so many ways the experiment was begun

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.950 
in so many ways the experiment was begun
in<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> 1950s<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> fox<00:00:22.260> farm<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.740> Siberia

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
in the 1950s that a fox farm in Siberia

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
in the 1950s that a fox farm in Siberia
the<00:00:24.960> foxes<00:00:25.410> were<00:00:25.439> being<00:00:25.769> bred<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.279> their<00:00:26.400> fur

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the foxes were being bred for their fur

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.700 
the foxes were being bred for their fur
but<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.390> were<00:00:27.449> wild<00:00:27.990> animals<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.500> were

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
but they were wild animals that were

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
but they were wild animals that were
hard<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> handle<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.760> often<00:00:30.150> too<00:00:30.510> stressed<00:00:30.900> to

that<00:02:39.269> we're<00:02:39.599> dealing<00:02:39.810> with<00:02:40.019> some<00:02:40.459> underlying

that we're dealing with some underlying

genetics for that is producing a

genetics for that is producing a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360

experiment it changed the way a lot of

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.509 
experiment it changed the way a lot of
us<00:03:39.889> began<00:03:40.889> to<00:03:41.069> think<00:03:41.280> about<00:03:41.579> dogs<00:03:43.519> people

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
us began to think about dogs people

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.050 
us began to think about dogs people
talked<00:03:44.970> about<00:03:45.470> why<00:03:46.470> did<00:03:47.010> people<00:03:47.280> select<00:03:47.730> dogs

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
talked about why did people select dogs

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.479 
talked about why did people select dogs
to<00:03:48.329> have<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.720> coat<00:03:48.989> color<00:03:49.290> or<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.680> coat

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
to have this coat color or that coat

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.180 
to have this coat color or that coat
color<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.660> why<00:03:51.959> did<00:03:52.319> people<00:03:52.739> select

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
color and so on why did people select

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.599 
color and so on why did people select
dogs<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:54.299> bark<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.650> then<00:03:55.889> all<00:03:56.099> of<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.280> sudden<00:03:56.310> we

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
dogs to bark and then all of a sudden we

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.220 
dogs to bark and then all of a sudden we
realized<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.180> those<00:03:57.630> were<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> bunch<00:03:58.079> of

realized that those were a bunch of

realized that those were a bunch of
really<00:03:58.709> silly<00:03:59.069> questions<00:03:59.720> because<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:01.049> could

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
really silly questions because we could

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.530 
really silly questions because we could
get<00:04:01.470> all<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.950> just<00:04:02.730> by<00:04:02.849> selecting<00:04:03.090> for

get all of that just by selecting for
