00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.630
 hence the famous hernary choice 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.120
 of the don alfonso 1890 law restaurants 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.120
 Campania as never before 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.680
 then she thinks it Vicenza 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.920
 first of all reliable things 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.030
 now seen as never taking the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.510
 person of research cables 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.910
 to say why the courage of whom 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.010
 he thinks the doctor days it is 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.850
 able to an argument which therefore does not 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.300
 edited expect but that now thanks 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.809
 this route was not expected 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.809
 philosophical 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.940
 let's say that aesthetics also knows it 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.790
 of taste and sony I also know that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.500
 all 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.430
 so second it also revs 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.400
 clever thin hands his say 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.650
 the doctors didn't like this dish 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.650
 to tell you that we are blown 12 if you 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.420
 how he sees it 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.420
 when constructive 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:29.380
 you would do me if you were and constructive her 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.070
 he thinks that the smell will cost to propose 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.070
 prejudicial criticisms 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.650
 now he knows it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.020
 so it doesn't take 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.789
 your star and urine or if I knew 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.789
 because you spice up what you're doing 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.870
 who make their minds 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870
 are words 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.310
 showing the salt warehouse of 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.489
 Buffalo 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.489
 the current 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.130
 half nails 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.130
 the boy my dick 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.760
 when he wants to stay 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.180
 a different future this machine here 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.170
 Yes No 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.170
 or not 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.580
 no 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.350
 they do not exist anymore 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:06.480
 it makes the nature of the oven 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.480
 then with the 440 test 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.630
 the thing you ship that is ready 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.630
 by color 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.220
 basil that there is almost a day 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.910
 after we do they want to cover a little 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.910
 boring with basil cooking 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.490
 in the affected 400 degrees that 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.300
 but when you live in the oven 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.300
 just a little oil is missing 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.400
