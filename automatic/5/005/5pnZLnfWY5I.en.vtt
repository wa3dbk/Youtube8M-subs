center<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.459> attention<00:02:14.700> their<00:02:15.660> purpose<00:02:15.930> is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
center of attention their purpose is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.780 
center of attention their purpose is
really<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.620> underlie<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.160> sportiness<00:02:17.700> of

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
really to underlie the sportiness of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.270 
really to underlie the sportiness of
this<00:02:18.090> vehicle<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:19.080> course<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:20.040> narrow

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this vehicle and of course the narrow

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.130 
this vehicle and of course the narrow
tail<00:02:20.550> lights<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.630> clearly<00:02:21.990> visible

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
tail lights and the clearly visible

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.199 
tail lights and the clearly visible
underbody<00:02:22.860> protection<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:24.090> other

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
underbody protection and one other

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.240 
underbody protection and one other
feature<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> rounded<00:02:25.650> window<00:02:25.980> at<00:02:26.130> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
feature is the rounded window at the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.540 
feature is the rounded window at the
back

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.920 

so<00:02:30.550> all<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.910> all<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.180> could<00:02:31.270> say<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.570> mixture

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
so all in all you could say the mixture

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.500 
so all in all you could say the mixture
of<00:02:32.050> these<00:02:32.230> two<00:02:32.290> concepts<00:02:33.040> SUV<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.970> coupe<00:02:34.330> a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
of these two concepts SUV and coupe a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.780 
of these two concepts SUV and coupe a
are<00:02:34.750> clearly<00:02:35.230> recognizable<00:02:36.130> technical

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
are clearly recognizable technical

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.820 
are clearly recognizable technical
details<00:02:37.210> like<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.660> wing<00:02:37.870> design<00:02:38.230> rear<00:02:38.590> view

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
details like the wing design rear view

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.250 
details like the wing design rear view
mirror<00:02:39.190> add<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.880> contrast<00:02:40.390> after<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.110> G

le<00:02:41.500> we<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:41.980> another<00:02:42.250> great<00:02:42.520> example<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:43.030> this

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
le we have another great example of this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.600 
le we have another great example of this
type<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.780> form<00:02:44.380> hybrid

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.120 

alright<00:02:51.360> guys<00:02:51.540> that's<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.470> for<00:02:52.500> me<00:02:52.740> from
