you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.540 

then<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:14.479> see<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.720> 1.8<00:01:17.979> will<00:01:18.979> be<00:01:19.100> taken<00:01:19.400> out

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
then we see a 1.8 will be taken out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.300 
then we see a 1.8 will be taken out
about<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.790> 10-mile<00:01:20.330> trip<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:22.010> course<00:01:22.190> we

won't make you watch the whole thing was

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.190 
won't make you watch the whole thing was
edited<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.409> see<00:01:24.650> just<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.040> NOC<00:01:25.220> events

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.390 

this<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.230> question<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.740> is<00:01:41.950> being<00:01:42.160> puzzled

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
this is a question that is being puzzled

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.700 
this is a question that is being puzzled
a<00:01:42.700> lot<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.060> certain<00:01:43.450> cars<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.080> they<00:01:44.590> will

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
a lot of a certain cars and they will

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.640 
a lot of a certain cars and they will
come<00:01:44.830> up<00:01:44.920> some<00:01:45.100> some<00:01:45.310> more<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:47.140> we've

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
come up some some more because we've

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.860 
come up some some more because we've
always<00:01:47.830> tried<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.190> work<00:01:49.090> out<00:01:49.330> these<00:01:49.570> not

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
always tried to work out these not

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.870 
always tried to work out these not
greater<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.650> we<00:01:50.770> get<00:01:50.950> occasionally<00:01:51.760> after

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
greater that we get occasionally after

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.710 
greater that we get occasionally after
flash<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.490> can<00:01:54.640> see<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:55.240> something

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
flash and as we can see is something

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.120 
flash and as we can see is something
that<00:01:55.810> happens<00:01:56.020> even<00:01:56.410> in<00:01:56.590> stock<00:01:56.830> cars

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.469 

here<00:02:03.130> we're<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.310> cruising<00:02:03.790> along<00:02:03.940> I<00:02:04.270> have<00:02:04.450> a

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.400 

there<00:02:12.410> was<00:02:12.560> one<00:02:12.980> as<00:02:13.100> high<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.310> 3.2<00:02:14.410> around

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
there was one as high as 3.2 around

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:32.340 
there was one as high as 3.2 around

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:41.200 

and<00:02:33.350> then<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.830> more<00:02:34.010> episode

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.610 

you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:03:04.810 

one<00:02:46.620> point<00:02:46.859> eight<00:02:47.010> nine<00:02:47.549> point<00:02:47.790> four

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.280 

here<00:03:05.820> we<00:03:06.000> are<00:03:06.120> almost<00:03:06.240> at<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.600> end<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.840> our<00:03:06.990> 10

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
here we are almost at the end of our 10

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.470 
here we are almost at the end of our 10
mile<00:03:07.500> drive<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.190> will<00:03:08.340> observe<00:03:08.730> about<00:03:09.030> seven

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
mile drive and will observe about seven

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.690 
mile drive and will observe about seven
episodes<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.080> Law<00:03:10.290> great<00:03:10.530> art<00:03:10.800> one<00:03:11.370> as<00:03:11.490> high<00:03:11.640> as

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
episodes of Law great art one as high as

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.090 
episodes of Law great art one as high as
three<00:03:11.970> point<00:03:12.210> two<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.590> answer<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
three point two so the answer to the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.780 
three point two so the answer to the
question<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.610> yes<00:03:14.970> definitely<00:03:16.070> stop<00:03:17.070> nc's

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
question is yes definitely stop nc's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.330 
question is yes definitely stop nc's
actually<00:03:18.540> experience<00:03:19.110> not<00:03:19.590> great<00:03:19.860> dark<00:03:20.130> and

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
actually experience not great dark and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.390 
actually experience not great dark and
this<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.000> probably<00:03:21.210> just<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.930> few<00:03:22.650> strategy<00:03:23.310> in

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
this is probably just a few strategy in

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.570 
this is probably just a few strategy in
order<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.760> keep<00:03:23.910> timing<00:03:24.330> as<00:03:24.450> high<00:03:24.600> as<00:03:24.660> possible

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
order to keep timing as high as possible

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.550 
order to keep timing as high as possible
however<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.760> will<00:03:26.910> see<00:03:27.180> these<00:03:27.420> all<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.380> more

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
however you will see these all the more

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.220 
however you will see these all the more
so<00:03:28.830> as<00:03:29.160> soon<00:03:29.580> as<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.850> flash<00:03:30.090> your<00:03:30.150> car<00:03:30.570> because

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
so as soon as you flash your car because

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.190 
so as soon as you flash your car because
this<00:03:31.620> resets<00:03:32.100> all<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.430> trims<00:03:32.700> or<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:34.080> you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
this resets all the trims or if you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.440 
this resets all the trims or if you
disconnect<00:03:34.530> your<00:03:34.830> battery<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:36.150> don't<00:03:36.360> sweat

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
disconnect your battery so don't sweat

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.090 
disconnect your battery so don't sweat
it<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:36.840> should<00:03:37.050> go<00:03:37.170> away<00:03:37.260> within<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.860> first

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
it you should go away within the first

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.670 
it you should go away within the first
one<00:03:38.460> or<00:03:38.730> two<00:03:38.850> hundred<00:03:39.000> miles<00:03:39.300> just<00:03:40.230> enjoy<00:03:40.530> your
