00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
fond of that the steering wheel actually

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.710 
fond of that the steering wheel actually
seems<00:01:21.640> as<00:01:21.970> though<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:22.270> gotten<00:01:22.599> its

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
seems as though it's gotten its

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.320 
seems as though it's gotten its
inspiration<00:01:23.319> from<00:01:23.349> a<00:01:23.770> bit<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.039> sandpaper<00:01:24.550> so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
inspiration from a bit of sandpaper so

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.749 
inspiration from a bit of sandpaper so
that's<00:01:25.690> really<00:01:25.929> not<00:01:26.170> pleasing<00:01:27.160> to<00:01:27.429> the<00:01:27.550> touch

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
that's really not pleasing to the touch

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.449 
that's really not pleasing to the touch
and<00:01:28.060> then<00:01:28.660> finally<00:01:28.929> the<00:01:29.800> instrument<00:01:30.429> cluster

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
and then finally the instrument cluster

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.779 
and then finally the instrument cluster
layout<00:01:31.149> being<00:01:31.539> up<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:31.990> center<00:01:32.580> much<00:01:33.580> like

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
layout being up in the center much like

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.410 
layout being up in the center much like
the<00:01:33.819> Prius<00:01:35.340> again<00:01:36.340> it's<00:01:36.610> not<00:01:36.819> where<00:01:37.000> our<00:01:37.149> eyes

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
the Prius again it's not where our eyes

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.100 
the Prius again it's not where our eyes
are<00:01:37.599> used<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.319> going<00:01:39.330> you<00:01:40.330> can<00:01:40.509> get<00:01:40.660> used<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.959> it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
are used to going you can get used to it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
but it is a bit of a nuisance right off

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.870 
but it is a bit of a nuisance right off
the<00:01:42.819> bat<00:01:43.709> some<00:01:44.709> of<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.890> things<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.310> do<00:01:45.550> like

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
the bat some of the things we do like

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.040 
the bat some of the things we do like
about<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:47.830> longer<00:01:48.610> wider<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.569> just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
about this is it's longer wider and just

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.040 
about this is it's longer wider and just
larger<00:01:50.500> overall<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.880> package<00:01:52.239> is<00:01:52.420> far<00:01:52.780> more

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
larger overall the package is far more

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.130 
larger overall the package is far more
versatile<00:01:53.679> than<00:01:53.739> the<00:01:54.130> original<00:01:55.140> hunchback

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
versatile than the original hunchback

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.490 
versatile than the original hunchback
Prius<00:01:56.709> if<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.009> will<00:01:57.190> which<00:01:58.090> makes<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.569> more

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
Prius if you will which makes it more

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.520 
Prius if you will which makes it more
acceptable<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.310> our<00:02:00.459> eyes<00:02:00.610> it's<00:02:00.910> just<00:02:01.440> some<00:02:02.440> of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
acceptable in our eyes it's just some of

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.919 
acceptable in our eyes it's just some of
the<00:02:02.619> shortcomings<00:02:03.039> of<00:02:03.099> the<00:02:03.399> Prius<00:02:03.789> are<00:02:03.970> much

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
the shortcomings of the Prius are much

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.680 
the shortcomings of the Prius are much
easier<00:02:04.959> to<00:02:05.560> swallow<00:02:05.770> in<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.429> package<00:02:06.970> so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
easier to swallow in this package so

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.499 
easier to swallow in this package so
we're<00:02:08.110> on<00:02:08.289> board<00:02:08.590> with<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.270> another<00:02:10.270> thing

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
we're on board with that another thing

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.320 
we're on board with that another thing
we<00:02:10.539> like<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:11.050> how<00:02:11.879> Toyota<00:02:12.879> has<00:02:13.090> been

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
we like is that how Toyota has been

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.630 
we like is that how Toyota has been
innovative<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.200> keeping<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.590> weight<00:02:15.430> down

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
innovative in keeping the weight down

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.589 
innovative in keeping the weight down
this<00:02:15.849> thing<00:02:16.090> only<00:02:16.300> adds<00:02:16.950> another<00:02:18.390> 232<00:02:19.390> pounds

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
this thing only adds another 232 pounds

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.720 
this thing only adds another 232 pounds
over<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.770> regular<00:02:21.099> prius<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.610> one
