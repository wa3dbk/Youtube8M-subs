BY THIS I OVERCOME THE devil

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:26.666
I TESTIFY TO satan PERSONALLY AS TO WHAT THE WORD SAYS

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:32.364
THE BLOOD OF JESUS DOES FOR ME.

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:48.867
THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS, I AM REDEEMED

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:54.243
OUT OF THE HAND OF THE devil

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.806

00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.557
the blood of the Lamb (Jesus Christ), and by the word of their testimony."

00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:08.373
(That is, they testified to what the Word of God says

00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:11.308
about the blood of Jesus.)

00:01:19.248 --> 00:01:30.876
THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS, ALL MY SINS ARE FORGIVEN

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:38.814
Ephesians 1: 7 - "In whom we have redemption through His blood,

00:01:38.814 --> 00:01:45.564
the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace."

00:01:58.693 --> 00:02:03.880
THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S SON,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.320
CONTINUALLY CLEANSES ME FROM ALL SIN.

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:16.946
I John 1:7 - "But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light,

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:21.697
we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ,

00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:25.387
His Son, cleanseth us from all sin."

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:40.456
THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS, I AM JUSTIFIED, MADE RIGHTEOUS,

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:44.516
JUST AS IF I'D NEVER SINNED.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:54.953
Romans 5:9 - "Much more than, now justified by His blood,

00:02:54.953 --> 00:03:00.330
we shall be saved from wrath through Him."

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:17.334
THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS I AM SANCTIFIED,

00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:23.461
MADE HOLY, SET APART TO GOD.

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:33.525
Hebrews 13:12 - "Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:37.588
with His own blood, suffered without the gate."

00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:53.466
MY BODY IS A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, REDEEMED, CLEANSED,

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:59.157
BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS

00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:05.908
I Corinthians 6:19-20 - "What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:11.219
the Holy Ghost, which is in you. which ye have of God,

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:15.096
and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price;

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:19.662
Therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."

00:04:26.597 --> 00:04:32.973
satan HAS NO PLACE IN ME, NO POWER OVER ME,

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:43.352
THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS.
