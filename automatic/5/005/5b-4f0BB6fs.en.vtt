when you muddle the sugar cube in there

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.969 
when you muddle the sugar cube in there
with<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> bitters<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.500> sits<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
with the bitters it kind of sits at the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.530 
with the bitters it kind of sits at the
bottom<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.700> drink<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> when<00:01:39.420> you're

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
drinking it'll progressively get sweeter

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.889 
drinking it'll progressively get sweeter
but<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> first<00:01:41.790> sip<00:01:42.030> isn't<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.689> low

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
