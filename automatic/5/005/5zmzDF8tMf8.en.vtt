00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
unplug them from the equipment where I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
unplug them from the equipment where I
threw<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.439> know<00:01:22.560> you'll<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.830> unplugging

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
threw this you know you'll be unplugging

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
threw this you know you'll be unplugging
it<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.180> far<00:01:24.420> better<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.750> being<00:01:24.960> out

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it but this is far better for being out

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
it but this is far better for being out
and<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.610> other<00:01:26.670> reason<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.150> are

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and about the other reason these are

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.310 
and about the other reason these are
kind<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.869> multi-purpose

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
kind of more of a multi-purpose

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.700 
kind of more of a multi-purpose
headphone<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> plug<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.470> which<00:01:31.470> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
headphone is that the plug here which is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
headphone is that the plug here which is
speed<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> plot<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.119> would<00:01:33.299> used

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
speed this is a plot that you would used

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.380 
speed this is a plot that you would used
for<00:01:34.049> plugging<00:01:34.680> into<00:01:34.829> vision<00:01:35.220> equipment<00:01:35.430> look

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
for plugging into vision equipment look

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.350 
for plugging into vision equipment look
here<00:01:36.630> comes<00:01:37.409> off<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> give<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> eighth<00:01:38.549> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
here comes off to give you the eighth of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
here comes off to give you the eighth of
an<00:01:39.479> inch<00:01:39.570> plug<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.890> erm<00:01:41.100> kind<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
an inch plug but it's just erm kind of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.100 
an inch plug but it's just erm kind of
like<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> push-pull

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
like a push-pull

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.560 
like a push-pull
so<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.740> quite<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> mess<00:01:44.280> quite<00:01:44.970> touchable

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so that's quite a mess quite touchable

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
so that's quite a mess quite touchable
quite<00:01:46.259> Loserville<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.890> well<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.790> means

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
quite Loserville as well but that means

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.149 
quite Loserville as well but that means
is<00:01:48.180> easy<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.899> set<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:49.890> this

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
is easy so just set them up for this

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.499 
is easy so just set them up for this
kind<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> use<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.850> guess<00:01:51.030> Denon<00:01:51.390> are

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
kind of use I'm I guess Denon are

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.819 
kind of use I'm I guess Denon are
