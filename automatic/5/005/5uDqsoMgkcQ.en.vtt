00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
nice fancy gizmos just like in a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.740 
nice fancy gizmos just like in a
laundromat<00:00:19.520> lift<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.910> got<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.359> stuff

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
laundromat lift it up got all your stuff

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.029 
laundromat lift it up got all your stuff
in<00:00:21.930> there<00:00:22.369> anyways<00:00:23.369> my<00:00:23.789> rant<00:00:24.320> would<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.529> this

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
in there anyways my rant would be this

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.080 
in there anyways my rant would be this
thing<00:00:26.310> costs<00:00:26.810> $1000<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:29.849> main

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
thing costs $1000 and the main

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.330 
thing costs $1000 and the main
difference<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:33.530> 16<00:00:34.530> pairs<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> jeans

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
difference is I can do 16 pairs of jeans

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.420 
difference is I can do 16 pairs of jeans
in<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.820> thing<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.430> I<00:00:38.780> can<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.930> them<00:00:40.430> eight

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
in this thing and I can do them eight

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
in this thing and I can do them eight
loads<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.120> day<00:00:43.219> for<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.579> year

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
loads a day for a year

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.160 
loads a day for a year
and<00:00:46.370> apparently<00:00:47.570> given<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> current<00:00:48.960> power

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and apparently given the current power

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
and apparently given the current power
rate<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.770> would<00:00:49.920> cost<00:00:50.160> me<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.640> under<00:00:51.059> 20

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
rate it would cost me a little under 20

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.850 
rate it would cost me a little under 20
dollars<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.780> six<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.989> eight<00:00:55.140> loads<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.649> day

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
dollars to do six to eight loads a day

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.170 
dollars to do six to eight loads a day
for<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.670> entire<00:00:56.789> year<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.719> 52<00:00:58.170> weeks<00:00:58.789> now<00:00:59.789> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
for an entire year that's 52 weeks now I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.799 
for an entire year that's 52 weeks now I
am<00:01:00.989> no<00:01:01.500> rocket<00:01:02.010> scientist<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.600> after<00:01:03.600> all

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
am no rocket scientist but after all

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.690 
am no rocket scientist but after all
this<00:01:04.110> time<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:05.729> finally<00:01:06.479> found<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.900> way<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
this time you finally found a way to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.630 
this time you finally found a way to
make<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> use<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:10.100> normal<00:01:11.100> plug<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:13.520> stead<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
make it use a normal plug and stead of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
make it use a normal plug and stead of
that<00:01:14.850> funky<00:01:15.509> thing<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.200> always<00:01:16.590> had<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that funky thing that you always had to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
that funky thing that you always had to
rewire<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.909> an<00:01:18.000> electrician<00:01:18.600> plug<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.049> for

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
rewire have an electrician plug in for

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.690 
rewire have an electrician plug in for
you<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:22.189> that's<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.460> only<00:01:23.670> difference

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you and that's the only difference

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.499 
you and that's the only difference
besides<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.720> being<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.020> side<00:01:25.320> load<00:01:25.650> oh<00:01:26.390> here<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
besides it being a side load oh here is

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.399 
besides it being a side load oh here is
the<00:01:27.540> other<00:01:27.840> difference<00:01:28.110> efficiency<00:01:29.100> wise<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
the other difference efficiency wise and

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.969 
the other difference efficiency wise and
again<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.650> taken<00:01:32.159> decades<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.979> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
again it's taken decades to do this we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.370 
again it's taken decades to do this we
this<00:01:35.400> washer<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> wash<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
this washer right here the wash is so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.850 
this washer right here the wash is so
much<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.860> such<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> small<00:01:38.280> space<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.829> uses<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
much in such a small space and uses a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
much in such a small space and uses a
regular<00:01:41.400> plug<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.500> America<00:01:43.549> actually<00:01:44.600> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
regular plug in America actually this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.710 
regular plug in America actually this
thing<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> thousand<00:01:47.250> dollars<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.939> could

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
thing for a thousand dollars I could

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
thing for a thousand dollars I could
have<00:01:48.960> bought<00:01:49.140> two<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:50.840> maybe<00:01:52.250> four<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.549> six

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
have bought two for maybe four to six

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.139 
have bought two for maybe four to six
regular<00:01:54.540> sized<00:01:54.780> washers<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:56.729> amount<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
regular sized washers the amount of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.830 
regular sized washers the amount of
water<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.689> uses<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.670> swig<00:02:00.000> oh<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.600> don't

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
water it uses well in a swig oh we don't

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.670 
water it uses well in a swig oh we don't
pay<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.590> water<00:02:02.399> bill<00:02:02.759> per<00:02:03.240> gallon<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.079> pay<00:02:04.380> like

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
pay a water bill per gallon we pay like

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.109 
pay a water bill per gallon we pay like
per<00:02:05.040> year<00:02:05.579> every<00:02:06.420> three<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.049> four<00:02:07.350> months<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
per year every three or four months and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
per year every three or four months and
it's<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.599> much<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> little

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it's not that much I think it's a little

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's not that much I think it's a little
under<00:02:10.830> 200<00:02:11.340> years

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
under 200 years

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.090 
under 200 years
at<00:02:12.690> best<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.310> thing<00:02:14.810> uses<00:02:15.950> less<00:02:16.950> water

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
at best now this thing uses less water

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.700 
at best now this thing uses less water
five<00:02:18.060> or<00:02:18.240> six<00:02:18.480> times<00:02:18.720> less<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:19.170> believe<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
five or six times less I believe a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.040 
five or six times less I believe a
normal<00:02:20.250> wash<00:02:20.520> or<00:02:20.850> will<00:02:20.970> use<00:02:21.180> twenty<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.780> thirty

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
normal wash or will use twenty to thirty

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.830 
normal wash or will use twenty to thirty
gallons<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.400> uses<00:02:23.910> five<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.540> six<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.840> use

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
gallons this uses five to six so I use

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.860 
gallons this uses five to six so I use
less<00:02:28.140> water<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.830> bill<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.400> I'm<00:02:29.550> not<00:02:30.510> really

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
less water on a bill that I'm not really

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.260 
less water on a bill that I'm not really
paying<00:02:31.140> per<00:02:31.530> gallon<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.820> uses<00:02:33.210> less<00:02:33.450> power

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
paying per gallon it uses less power

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.050 
paying per gallon it uses less power
which<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> plus<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.680> only<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> couple

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
which is a plus but I only do a couple

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
which is a plus but I only do a couple
loads<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.450> week<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:41.030> well<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:43.170> be<00:02:43.290> honest<00:02:43.710> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
loads a week and well to be honest I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.450 
loads a week and well to be honest I
unless<00:02:44.790> I'm<00:02:44.970> paying<00:02:45.240> per<00:02:45.510> gallon<00:02:45.960> and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
unless I'm paying per gallon and
