00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.139 
have that you go in that game do not
join<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> game<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> has<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.549> four<00:01:56.820> people

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
join a game that has like four people

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
join a game that has like four people
because<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.840> most<00:01:58.020> likely<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> survival

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
because that most likely is a survival

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.100 
because that most likely is a survival
thing<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.460> probably<00:01:59.880> will<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> deal<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.899> I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
thing I probably will do a deal on it I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.499 
thing I probably will do a deal on it I
guess<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:02.399> i<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> game<00:02:03.329> it's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
guess so because i like the game it's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.139 
guess so because i like the game it's
okay<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.369> need<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> find<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.030> game
