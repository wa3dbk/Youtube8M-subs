very<00:04:12.880> strawberry<00:04:13.480> very<00:04:14.200> artificial

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
very strawberry very artificial

very<00:04:23.800> bland<00:04:24.130> cream<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.910> think<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.420> meant<00:04:25.540> to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
very bland cream I think it's meant to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.720 
very bland cream I think it's meant to
complement<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.650> waffles<00:04:27.040> because<00:04:27.370> there

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
complement the waffles because there

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.980 
complement the waffles because there
they<00:04:28.000> are<00:04:28.030> very<00:04:28.560> vanilla<00:04:29.560> flavor<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.600> waffles

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
they are very vanilla flavor the waffles

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.190 
they are very vanilla flavor the waffles
themselves<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.240> will<00:04:34.240> not<00:04:34.510> make<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.810> texture

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
themselves and will not make the texture

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.550 
themselves and will not make the texture
of<00:04:35.230> wheat<00:04:35.470> real<00:04:35.770> waffles<00:04:36.220> they're<00:04:37.180> very<00:04:37.560> soft

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
of wheat real waffles they're very soft

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.870 
of wheat real waffles they're very soft
kind<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.220> gooey<00:04:40.530> chewy<00:04:41.530> hang<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.490> having<00:04:42.790> a

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
kind of gooey chewy hang it having a

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.840 
kind of gooey chewy hang it having a
vanilla<00:04:43.300> flavoring<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:45.220> they<00:04:45.340> kind<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.670> taste

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
vanilla flavoring so they kind of taste

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.960 
vanilla flavoring so they kind of taste
like<00:04:46.000> vanilla<00:04:46.180> waffles

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
like vanilla waffles

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.600 
like vanilla waffles
but<00:04:48.970> another<00:04:49.240> texture<00:04:49.690> waffles<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.460> they

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
but another texture waffles so they

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.630 
but another texture waffles so they
would<00:04:51.790> they<00:04:51.970> don't<00:04:52.090> taste<00:04:52.420> that<00:04:52.570> great<00:04:53.190> all<00:04:54.190> in

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
would they don't taste that great all in

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.730 
would they don't taste that great all in
all<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.970> fruit<00:04:55.210> flavorings<00:04:55.930> on<00:04:56.200> these<00:04:56.410> or<00:04:56.710> is

all the fruit flavorings on these or is
very<00:04:57.130> good<00:04:58.530> I'll<00:04:59.530> do<00:04:59.740> like<00:04:59.770> the<00:05:00.040> flavor<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
very good I'll do like the flavor of the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.180 
very good I'll do like the flavor of the
fruit<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.330> vanilla<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.840> things<00:05:02.260> it's

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
fruit and the vanilla and things it's

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.220 
fruit and the vanilla and things it's
just<00:05:03.430> a<00:05:03.520> texture<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.360> waffles<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:04.930> don't

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
just a texture of the waffles I don't

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.150 
just a texture of the waffles I don't
really<00:05:05.440> like<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:07.120> said<00:05:08.110> it's<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.350> bit<00:05:08.530> strange<00:05:08.890> if

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
really like I said it's a bit strange if

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.310 
really like I said it's a bit strange if
you<00:05:09.250> don't<00:05:09.460> do<00:05:09.640> like<00:05:09.820> chewy<00:05:10.150> textures<00:05:11.080> and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
you don't do like chewy textures and

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.020 
you don't do like chewy textures and
things<00:05:11.500> like<00:05:11.650> that<00:05:11.710> then<00:05:12.400> maybe<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.820> wouldn't

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
things like that then maybe you wouldn't

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.360 
things like that then maybe you wouldn't
like<00:05:13.300> this<00:05:13.510> case<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.350> was<00:05:14.560> fun<00:05:14.980> to<00:05:15.010> make<00:05:15.310> a

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
like this case it was fun to make a

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.460 
like this case it was fun to make a
little<00:05:15.670> bit<00:05:15.910> difficult<00:05:16.120> at<00:05:16.540> times<00:05:16.900> but<00:05:17.320> I

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
little bit difficult at times but I

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.040 
little bit difficult at times but I
really<00:05:17.860> like<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.190> waffle<00:05:18.610> mechanism<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.510> um

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
really like the waffle mechanism that um

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.790 
really like the waffle mechanism that um

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
they get to the use it's very and its

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.320 
they get to the use it's very and its
new<00:05:24.070> thing<00:05:24.370> for<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.670> popin<00:05:24.970> cookin'<00:05:25.120> kit<00:05:25.540> I<00:05:27.330> mean
