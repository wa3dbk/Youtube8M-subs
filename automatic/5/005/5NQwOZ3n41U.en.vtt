00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 I know that this application is already known 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.350
 but I got the he had found out like that 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 that you come for those who have not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.560
 known this application and if they are 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.390
 interested because this application is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.000
 very good that we go with the video now 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.920
 with the will install them as polo live 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.830
 the description in the application calls 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.320
 player pro and you will leave this this 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 message whenever you want and you will 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 say that if you already have between the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.600
 application clear application cache 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 good is what they have installed and what 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 more important is how to activate more 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.640
 the channels that is going to the menu of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.219

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.219
 write your tv in the first one and down your 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.420
 tv tv dot tv like now I do not know 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.420
 that they will not understand what to explain 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.610
 while nothing recent ends up in your 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.590

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.979

 tv and just write the url your tv for free 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.850
 point tv or as I tell them because once 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.800
 it changes the url so I'll be 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.630
 always updating the description like this 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.820

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.849
 have a good connection if they want to 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.559
 your channel is seen in hd in super hd 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.409
 here are all the channels that can 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:12.169
 see them I do not have good connection is not so 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.029
 well that's why I do not have them but if 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.789
 that you have and it will serve you 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:19.999
 well with this we end up with what is 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.619
 live are the two channels that can see 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:25.189
 they can also watch their videos of their 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:27.319
 most favorite phones and you now 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.379

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.759
 tablets and they want or if you have tablets 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.429
 but they want to see it on their television in 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.679
 these channels what I was doing was there 

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:38.240
 an application on your computer that 

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:42.229
 flame bluestacks 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.509
 and you can see their rights and what I 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:48.620
 was to connect it where the television 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.750
 and the HDMI cable so that my television 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.330
 the reproduction was like it was a 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.180
 channel without another channel as if it were a 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.440
