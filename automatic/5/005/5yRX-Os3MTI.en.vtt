00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.680
 What is your first thought? 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.120
 First thought 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
 Tell me, Liu Ding 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.210
 it's okay 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.460
 knife 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.770
 what? 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.270
 knife 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.010
 Wow, green pepper! 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.850
 You know, in fact, we should have gotten used to it. 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.160
 terrible! 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.870
 So, Liu Ding, what do you want to tell me? 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.870
 Oh, okay? 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.990
 I want to say it would be better (get off my chest literally translated as "taken out of the chest") 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.000
 Wait, I don't have a chest at all! 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.610
 Ok, now it’s very quiet, pear 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.210
 You can continue to watch your bad movies. 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.460
 Liu Ding, do you know? 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.460
 I really like this movie. 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.700
 If you are so powerful, then understand TV. 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.910
 Why don't you go to the show yourself and see what happens? 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.370
 A Liu Ding who can speak? 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.870
 No one will look at this kind of thing 

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.640
 (polujony subtitle production) 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.820
 Liu Ding in front of the live audience 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.110
 Ok, green pepper, it’s up to you. 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.810
 Hey, you know 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.530
 Remember that we bet, Liu Ding 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.190
 If you lose, you have to tell the passion fruit you feel about her. 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.610
 Ok, it’s up to you. 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.630
 Ok... 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.540
 I have to draw three cards. 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.200
 Don't talk, you can't smoke my cards at all. 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 You slowly flip the flop to the card you want to appear. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.940
 What? Not like this, Liu Ding. We are playing poker. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.260
 what? Oh 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.630
 Ok, in this case, then I have to pump you 15 cards. 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.730
 No, the game is not playing like you! 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.950
 How else can I play? 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.450
 Just hurry up. 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.330
 Good (puff) 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.330
 Wow! 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.990
 I think I recently fell in love with playing cards. 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.320
 You won't play poker at all! 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.810
 Right-no-start-唷~ 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.380
 At least one game, I am very good at it. 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.870
 is it? what game? 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.120
 I am playing cards, you are playing cards. 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.830
 Say the card... Wait a minute, no! 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.780
 Oh! 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.100
 do you understand? I lay the cards and you will bring back the cards. 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 Do you know, Liu Ding? 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.470
 Because you fouled, you have lost. 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.310
 This means that you have to tell the passion fruit how you feel about her. 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 Ok, just casual. 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 Hey Hey 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.000
 What are you talking about? 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.650
 I am thinking about watching a movie. 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.080
 really? Which one are you looking at? 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080
 Twilight 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.080
 Isn't that the vampire? 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.120
 correct 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.630
 Sounds a bit bad 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370
 understand? rotten. 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.120
 Ok, I know. 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.410
 Because this film has vampires, they will suck blood (suck = suck) 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.030
 Ok, I know. 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 Hey, everyone. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.110
 Sorry, I am late. 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.680
 I went shopping to buy new earrings. 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.170
 What do you think? 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.470
 I think you should go buy the ear first. 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 what did you say? pear 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 Nothing. 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.830
 Hey, Liu Ding, Passion fruit has come. 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 Remember what we bet? 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.110
 what? 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.120
 No, no, um... 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.370
 What are you betting on? 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.460
 No la 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.950
 Really okay 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.250
 Oh, it’s better to be fine. 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.480
 You bet lost 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000
 Now is the time to tell the passion fruit. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.170
 tell me what? 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.170
 What is it? Liu Ding? 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.490
 Really okay 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.250
 Really, nothing at all. 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.440
 Hey, can you be quiet? 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.490
 I can't watch movies because you are so noisy. 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.460
 Who will Bella choose in the end? 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.290
 I want to know 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.140
 You listen to me well. 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 If you want to tell her, or I will tell her the truth. 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.630
 What? Liu Ding? 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.160
 Please~ tell me~ 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.300
 Tell me what you think.
