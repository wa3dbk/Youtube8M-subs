let's<00:00:19.090> talk<00:00:19.240> about<00:00:19.360> picking<00:00:19.870> there<00:00:20.470> are

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
let's talk about picking there are

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.680 
let's talk about picking there are
basically<00:00:20.890> two<00:00:21.250> ways<00:00:21.280> to<00:00:21.730> pick<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.030> base<00:00:22.210> one

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
basically two ways to pick the base one

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.810 
basically two ways to pick the base one
is<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.960> use<00:00:23.110> an<00:00:23.230> actual<00:00:23.500> pick<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.370> the<00:00:24.640> others

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
is to use an actual pick and the others

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.130 
is to use an actual pick and the others
to<00:00:24.940> play<00:00:25.120> with<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.360> two<00:00:25.540> fingers<00:00:25.750> of<00:00:26.050> your

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
to play with the two fingers of your

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.750 
to play with the two fingers of your
right<00:00:26.170> hand<00:00:26.320> your<00:00:26.800> index<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.190> middle<00:00:27.310> fingers

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
right hand your index and middle fingers

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.910 
right hand your index and middle fingers
if<00:00:28.570> you're<00:00:28.720> gonna<00:00:28.870> play<00:00:29.110> with<00:00:29.290> a<00:00:29.320> pick<00:00:29.590> I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
if you're gonna play with a pick I

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.330 
if you're gonna play with a pick I
recommend<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:31.000> medium<00:00:31.450> or<00:00:31.630> heavy<00:00:31.869> pick<00:00:32.340> it'll

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
recommend a medium or heavy pick it'll

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.620 
recommend a medium or heavy pick it'll
give<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.640> best<00:00:33.790> action<00:00:34.270> off<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.540> the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
give you the best action off of the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.660 
give you the best action off of the
strings<00:00:34.989> now<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.830> pick<00:00:36.130> will<00:00:36.340> give<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.640> a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
strings now the pick will give you a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.400 
strings now the pick will give you a
sound<00:00:36.970> that's<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.540> little<00:00:37.720> brighter<00:00:38.110> and

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
sound that's a little brighter and

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.729 
sound that's a little brighter and
little<00:00:39.280> has<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:39.880> little<00:00:40.239> more<00:00:40.390> attack<00:00:41.140> than<00:00:41.590> if

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
little has a little more attack than if

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:42.750 
little has a little more attack than if
you<00:00:41.830> play<00:00:41.980> with<00:00:42.129> your<00:00:42.250> index<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.670> middle

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
you play with your index and middle

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.510 
you play with your index and middle
finger<00:00:43.770> it'll<00:00:44.770> also<00:00:44.950> allow<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:45.400> play

finger it'll also allow you to play

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.300 
finger it'll also allow you to play
quicker<00:00:45.820> on<00:00:46.000> single<00:00:46.420> lines<00:00:46.629> like<00:00:47.020> this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.350

for the purpose of this video and

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.000 
for the purpose of this video and
because<00:00:55.630> it's<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.870> most<00:00:56.020> common<00:00:56.140> technique

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
because it's the most common technique

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.260 
because it's the most common technique
I'm<00:00:57.340> gonna<00:00:57.550> be<00:00:57.640> showing<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.940> how<00:00:57.970> to<00:00:58.090> play

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
I'm gonna be showing you how to play

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.970 
I'm gonna be showing you how to play
with<00:00:58.570> your<00:00:58.690> two<00:00:58.960> fingers<00:00:59.320> your<00:00:59.440> right<00:00:59.650> hand

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
with your two fingers your right hand

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.400 
with your two fingers your right hand
there<00:01:00.880> are<00:01:00.910> some<00:01:01.090> fundamentals<00:01:02.080> that<00:01:02.170> you'll

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
there are some fundamentals that you'll

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.829 
there are some fundamentals that you'll
need<00:01:02.590> to<00:01:02.650> memorize<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.970> use<00:01:04.270> to<00:01:04.570> make<00:01:04.690> sure

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
need to memorize and use to make sure

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.300 
need to memorize and use to make sure
this<00:01:04.989> technique<00:01:05.350> will<00:01:05.620> operate<00:01:05.830> for<00:01:06.160> you

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
this technique will operate for you

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.760 
this technique will operate for you
basically<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.540> primary<00:01:08.140> one<00:01:08.470> is<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.710> always

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
basically the primary one is to always

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.010 
basically the primary one is to always
anchor<00:01:09.280> your<00:01:09.430> thumb<00:01:09.729> on<00:01:09.940> some<00:01:10.479> place<00:01:10.780> your

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
anchor your thumb on some place your

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.140 
anchor your thumb on some place your
base<00:01:11.200> now<00:01:11.530> I<00:01:11.800> recommend<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.760> most<00:01:12.940> players

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
base now I recommend and most players

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150 
base now I recommend and most players
will<00:01:13.479> put<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.260> thumb<00:01:14.470> on<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.680> top<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:15.040> their

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
will put the thumb on the top of their

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.400 
will put the thumb on the top of their
pickup<00:01:15.400> so<00:01:16.360> it's<00:01:16.510> a<00:01:16.570> good<00:01:16.750> reference<00:01:17.170> place

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
pickup so it's a good reference place

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.930 
pickup so it's a good reference place
and<00:01:17.590> give<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.860> more<00:01:18.040> strength<00:01:18.370> as<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.700> play

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
and give you more strength as you play

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.800 
and give you more strength as you play
also<00:01:19.840> another<00:01:20.740> basic<00:01:21.190> rule<00:01:21.370> is<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.640> always

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
also another basic rule is to always

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.990 
also another basic rule is to always
alternate<00:01:22.810> with<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.410> fingers<00:01:23.820> using<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
alternate with the fingers using the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.640 
alternate with the fingers using the
index<00:01:25.270> one<00:01:25.479> time<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.080> next<00:01:26.290> time<00:01:26.320> use<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.590> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
index one time the next time use in the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.249 
index one time the next time use in the
middle<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.070> back<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.400> forth<00:01:27.640> evenly<00:01:28.259> it'll

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
middle and back and forth evenly it'll

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.859 
middle and back and forth evenly it'll
be<00:01:29.410> better<00:01:30.220> for<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.700> sound<00:01:31.090> smoother<00:01:31.660> and

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
be better for you to sound smoother and

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.570 
be better for you to sound smoother and
you'll<00:01:32.080> have<00:01:32.229> more<00:01:32.440> speed<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.009> control<00:01:33.430> if

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
you'll have more speed and control if

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.070 
you'll have more speed and control if
you<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:33.850> do<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.240> now<00:01:34.720> as<00:01:34.900> you're

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
you can do this now as you're

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.410 
you can do this now as you're
alternating<00:01:35.580> when<00:01:36.580> you're<00:01:36.759> playing<00:01:37.090> it's

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
alternating when you're playing it's

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.359 
alternating when you're playing it's
okay<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.780> let<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.080> finger<00:01:38.470> play<00:01:38.800> one<00:01:39.070> string

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
okay to let the finger play one string

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.670 
okay to let the finger play one string
and<00:01:39.550> rest<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> string<00:01:40.690> next<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.200> that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
and rest on the string next to it that

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.260 
and rest on the string next to it that
actually<00:01:41.830> works<00:01:42.160> as<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.369> good<00:01:42.610> mute<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.119> it's

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
actually works as a good mute and it's

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.580 
actually works as a good mute and it's
something<00:01:43.540> that<00:01:43.660> you<00:01:43.750> just<00:01:43.899> will<00:01:44.350> incorporate

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
something that you just will incorporate

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.910 
something that you just will incorporate
into<00:01:45.040> your<00:01:45.100> playing<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.899> let<00:01:47.170> me<00:01:47.259> give<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.680> an

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
into your playing now let me give you an

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.710 
into your playing now let me give you an
open<00:01:48.610> string<00:01:48.850> exercise<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.630> will

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
open string exercise that will

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.359 
open string exercise that will
concentrate<00:01:50.050> on<00:01:50.350> developing<00:01:50.619> your

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
concentrate on developing your

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.980 
concentrate on developing your
coordination<00:01:51.880> with<00:01:52.149> just<00:01:52.390> your<00:01:52.479> right<00:01:52.540> hand

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
coordination with just your right hand

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.530 
coordination with just your right hand
so<00:01:53.830> in<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.070> case<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.850> can<00:01:55.030> actually<00:01:55.119> just

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
so in this case you can actually just

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.240 
so in this case you can actually just
mute<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.810> strings<00:01:56.290> with<00:01:56.500> your<00:01:56.650> left<00:01:56.830> hand<00:01:57.010> so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
mute the strings with your left hand so

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.730 
mute the strings with your left hand so
nothing<00:01:57.580> comes<00:01:57.760> through<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:59.560> going<00:01:59.710> to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
nothing comes through and we're going to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.440 
nothing comes through and we're going to
start<00:02:00.010> by<00:02:00.159> playing<00:02:00.430> four<00:02:00.820> times<00:02:01.150> on<00:02:01.390> each

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
start by playing four times on each

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:14.670 
start by playing four times on each
string<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.620> this<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:14.080> how<00:02:14.260> will<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.530> know

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
string like this so how will you know

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.410 
string like this so how will you know
when<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.220> enough<00:02:15.250> technique<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.269> move

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
when you have enough technique to move

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.590 
when you have enough technique to move
on<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.840> other<00:02:16.870> areas<00:02:17.260> well<00:02:17.980> let<00:02:18.790> me<00:02:18.880> play<00:02:19.239> at<00:02:19.540> a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
on to other areas well let me play at a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.900 
on to other areas well let me play at a
certain<00:02:20.080> tempo<00:02:20.470> see<00:02:21.160> if<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.489> play<00:02:21.610> with

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
certain tempo see if you can play with

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.850 
certain tempo see if you can play with
me<00:02:22.090> if<00:02:22.299> you<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.750> then<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.530> probably<00:02:23.680> have

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
me if you can then you probably have

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.650 
me if you can then you probably have
enough<00:02:24.010> technique<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.549> go<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.820> if<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.360> can't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
enough technique to go on if you can't

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.890 
enough technique to go on if you can't
stop<00:02:26.320> tape<00:02:26.620> work<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:27.910> then<00:02:28.360> come<00:02:28.870> back

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
stop tape work on it and then come back

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.870 
stop tape work on it and then come back
and<00:02:29.230> see<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.530> can<00:02:29.650> play<00:02:29.830> with<00:02:30.010> me<00:02:30.160> here<00:02:30.790> we

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
and see if you can play with me here we

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.850 
and see if you can play with me here we
go

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.060 

now<00:02:40.860> let's<00:02:41.100> try<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.490> little<00:02:41.700> bit<00:02:41.880> faster
