00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.010 
also do is create Street plans that have
all<00:01:58.829> these<00:01:58.979> symbols<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.579> them<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> when<00:02:00.930> we

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
all these symbols in them and when we

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.399 
all these symbols in them and when we
get<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.409> next<00:02:02.100> video<00:02:02.460> I'll<00:02:02.899> pick<00:02:03.899> up<00:02:04.110> that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
get to the next video I'll pick up that

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
get to the next video I'll pick up that
in<00:02:04.710> Paris<00:02:05.430> take<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:05.969> Washington<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
in Paris take it into Washington and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.020 
in Paris take it into Washington and
talk<00:02:07.469> about<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.770> stream<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> other<00:02:08.520> things<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
talk about a stream of other things that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.330 
talk about a stream of other things that
relate<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.929> basic<00:02:10.800> structure<00:02:11.099> I've

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
relate to the basic structure I've

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.490 
relate to the basic structure I've
already<00:02:11.489> described<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.510> i'll<00:02:12.989> relate<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
already described and i'll relate it to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.790 
already described and i'll relate it to
the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
the
the<00:02:13.860> assassination<00:02:14.850> because<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.270> what<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the assassination because that's what it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.150 
the assassination because that's what it
was<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:16.880> Diana<00:02:17.880> Princess<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.510> Wales<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.160> also

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
was of Diana Princess of Wales and also

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.220 
was of Diana Princess of Wales and also
when<00:02:20.880> we<00:02:21.030> looked<00:02:21.300> at<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> structure<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:21.990> how

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
when we looked at the structure of how

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.130 
when we looked at the structure of how
we<00:02:22.290> controlled<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.640> look<00:02:23.850> at<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:24.900> out

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
we controlled we can look at the way out

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.350 
we controlled we can look at the way out
of<00:02:25.320> here<00:02:25.590> because<00:02:26.310> we're<00:02:26.670> only<00:02:26.820> controlled

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
of here because we're only controlled

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.030 
of here because we're only controlled
because<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:28.110> allow<00:02:28.380> ourselves<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.830> be

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
because we allow ourselves to be

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
because we allow ourselves to be
controlled<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:29.850> we<00:02:30.180> give<00:02:30.360> our<00:02:30.480> power

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
controlled because we give our power

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.930 
controlled because we give our power
away<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:31.230> take<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.590> back<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.490> stuff<00:02:32.760> is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
away we take it back all this stuff is

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.280 
away we take it back all this stuff is
over<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:34.050> summarize<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.680> first<00:02:35.010> part<00:02:36.020> we<00:02:37.020> had

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
over to summarize this first part we had

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.970 
over to summarize this first part we had
the<00:02:37.860> intervention<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.140> human<00:02:40.560> genetic

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the intervention in the human genetic

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.210 
the intervention in the human genetic
stream<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.880> two<00:02:42.630> ways<00:02:42.840> first<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.860> all<00:02:43.980> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
stream in two ways first of all a
