00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.529
 in the new hunt is news hunters 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.940
 today I come to talk about a character 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:16.190
 called jack ryan is a character from 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:20.270
 fiction an agent of the cia that is work 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.160
 from the novelist Tom Clancy who passed away 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.280
 recently and that we have already seen 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.650
 previously in other films and with 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.270
 different faces 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.400
 the first time we saw him in the great 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.559
 screen was in the red October hunt 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.620
 who had the ability of alec 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.760
 baldwin and then we saw him the game of 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.400
 patriotic patriots with the face 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.650
 harrison ford and in 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.590
 happy eminent also with his face 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.350
 from harrison ford the last time what 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.120
 we saw it was 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.210
 nuclear panic and on this occasion he returned 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.200
 to change face and the protagonist the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.619
 in charge of life the agent brian was 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.729
 ben affleck in an attempt to rejuvenate 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.789
 to the character and thus be able to extend 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.920
 let's say the franchise the movie does not 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:27.330
 it worked quite well and now they're going 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.440
 to try again then 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.630
 is to have the universe of the character and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.610
 who knows if they give rise to a new 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.930
 franchise again with him 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.120
 with Ryan as the protagonist and who's going 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.790
 to give life in the new movie because it's going 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:52.160
 to be chris pain who is in charge of 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:55.640
 make captain kirk in the star network 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.360
 trek and the movie because it has like 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.220
 name already brian shadow operation after 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 the cameras we found ourselves 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.679
 we find that in the grana 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.310
 a long- distance direct and expert 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.489
 in adaptations of de william 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.890
 shakespeare but lately 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.620
 is a little more commercial especially 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.530
 as a result of having directed the first 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.730
 part of thor the adaptation of 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.110
 marvel character if you see in the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.530
 trailer seems to have only directed this 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.220
 movie by putting the director's 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.220
 of reader 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.120
 has brand has directed movies like 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.390
 die still 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.810
 much noise and few nuts' to say to 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.960
 Peter's friends are also not bad 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.630
 I remember, but it seems that man 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.280
 has to eat and then it has gone to a 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.520
 most commercial cinema 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.250
 thor did not work badly and now lohan 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.010
 is the one in charge of putting in images 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.280
 then the new adventure of jack that there 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.790
 in what is called jack ryan operation 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.500
 shadow with one after a rejuvenated already 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.930
 fall to the one who puts a face 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.030
 crispÃ­n and I entered into the pact then the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.310
 own that in the plan based on the bad of 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.490
 the movie and we can also see 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.970
 kevin costner that lately then 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.460
 quite on the screen and that in 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.080
 April and a girl that many people the 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.850
 against beautiful and the film 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.290
 make 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.690
 Well, many period films and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.450
 protagonist of advertising campaigns 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.400
 of perfumes but I also saw the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.150
 I think it's a bit dull 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.030
 bad actress is eye and little more to leave the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.390
 trailer of jack ryan operation shadow 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.910
 it looks pretty good we'll see how it is 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.050
 comes the action scenes held 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.390
 why 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.400
 at least for me it was the weakest of 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.250
 all the action scenes 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.150
 I think the premiere is for this month of 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.549
 January and do not delay it or for the month that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.980
 comes I 'm not sure but good and 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.100
 we'll see how it works at the box office 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.760
 this long shadow operation and if it's the 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.790
 start of a new franchise on the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.020
 ok character and leave as a mentalist 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.580
 I work with what you think of the trailer if 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.979
 you like the character if you have seen 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.310
 the previous films or what you 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.720
 look like that and give it to like its own 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.070
 to get the freedom of the videos 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.070
 we have before to be to the last
