of mentality so K to the fourth is
really<00:04:26.789> is<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:26.940> going<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.150> give<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.300> hard<00:04:27.599> time

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
really is it going to give a hard time

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.870 
really is it going to give a hard time
and<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.800> make<00:04:31.979> things<00:04:32.190> worse<00:04:32.460> if<00:04:32.759> you

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
and and and to make things worse if you

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.839 
and and and to make things worse if you
have<00:04:33.030> another<00:04:33.300> planet<00:04:33.750> together<00:04:33.990> with<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.849> for

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
have another planet together with it for

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.379 
have another planet together with it for
example<00:04:36.330> if<00:04:36.479> you<00:04:36.599> have<00:04:36.840> mercury<00:04:37.669> or<00:04:38.669> Buddha<00:04:39.090> in

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
example if you have mercury or Buddha in

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.010 
example if you have mercury or Buddha in
the<00:04:39.720> same<00:04:40.139> house<00:04:40.440> then<00:04:41.220> Mercury's<00:04:42.020> qualities

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
the same house then Mercury's qualities

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.140 
the same house then Mercury's qualities
will<00:04:43.199> be<00:04:43.349> then<00:04:43.500> absorbed<00:04:43.949> by<00:04:43.979> K<00:04:44.280> 2<00:04:44.340> K<00:04:44.849> 2<00:04:44.910> will

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
will be then absorbed by K 2 K 2 will

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.350 
will be then absorbed by K 2 K 2 will
have<00:04:45.360> mercury<00:04:46.080> plus<00:04:46.800> itself<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.150> can

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
have mercury plus itself so you can

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.700 
have mercury plus itself so you can
imagine<00:04:48.570> all<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.080> good<00:04:49.229> qualities<00:04:49.440> of

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
imagine all the good qualities of

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.120 
imagine all the good qualities of
mercury<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:50.550> speech<00:04:50.910> low<00:04:51.240> points<00:04:51.979> you<00:04:52.979> know

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
mercury like speech low points you know

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.460 
mercury like speech low points you know
mathematics<00:04:53.880> logical<00:04:54.840> thinking<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.349> all

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
mathematics logical thinking and all

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.200 
mathematics logical thinking and all
that<00:04:55.680> will<00:04:55.860> be<00:04:56.270> would<00:04:57.270> be<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.449> waste<00:04:59.000> since<00:05:00.000> why

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
that will be would be a waste since why

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.870 
that will be would be a waste since why
it's<00:05:00.360> important<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.370> look<00:05:02.520> where<00:05:02.699> the

it's important to to to look where the

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.140 
it's important to to to look where the
nodes<00:05:03.120> are<00:05:03.419> Rahu<00:05:04.349> and<00:05:04.650> Ketu<00:05:04.860> now<00:05:05.669> if<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.880> if

nodes are Rahu and Ketu now if you if

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.570 
nodes are Rahu and Ketu now if you if
someone<00:05:06.449> would<00:05:06.750> think<00:05:06.960> why<00:05:07.889> why<00:05:08.159> does<00:05:08.400> this

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
someone would think why why does this

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.790 
someone would think why why does this
Rahu<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.389> Ketu<00:05:09.510> giving<00:05:09.900> also<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:10.289> process

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
Rahu and Ketu giving also a process

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.879 
Rahu and Ketu giving also a process
because<00:05:10.979> these<00:05:11.789> two<00:05:12.000> planets<00:05:12.210> apart<00:05:12.659> from

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
because these two planets apart from

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.480 
because these two planets apart from
Satan<00:05:13.889> or<00:05:14.070> Sonny

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
Satan or Sonny

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.149 
Satan or Sonny
are<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.449> karmic<00:05:15.810> planets<00:05:16.139> they<00:05:16.470> show<00:05:16.740> what<00:05:17.010> we

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
are the karmic planets they show what we

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.920 
are the karmic planets they show what we
have<00:05:17.280> done<00:05:17.460> in<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.729> previous<00:05:17.940> life<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.630> gives

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
have done in the previous life it gives

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.830 
have done in the previous life it gives
an<00:05:19.080> astrologer<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.889> clue<00:05:20.580> as<00:05:20.880> what<00:05:21.630> was

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
an astrologer a clue as what was

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.050 
an astrologer a clue as what was
happened<00:05:22.320> in<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.470> previous<00:05:22.800> birth<00:05:23.060> and

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
happened in the previous birth and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.930 
happened in the previous birth and
that's<00:05:24.270> why<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:24.960> reflecting<00:05:25.530> now<00:05:25.680> okay<00:05:26.430> so

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
that's why it is reflecting now okay so

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.689 
that's why it is reflecting now okay so
that's<00:05:27.120> my<00:05:27.300> thought<00:05:27.599> about<00:05:27.750> what<00:05:28.280> k2<00:05:29.280> will<00:05:29.550> do

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
that's my thought about what k2 will do

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.370 
that's my thought about what k2 will do
if<00:05:29.820> it's<00:05:30.000> on<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.240> fourth<00:05:30.479> house<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:30.990> hope<00:05:31.199> it's

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
if it's on the fourth house I hope it's

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.940 
if it's on the fourth house I hope it's
beneficial<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.760> must
