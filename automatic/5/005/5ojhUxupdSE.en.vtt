 the inaugural day friendship 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.029

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.009
 Crystal institute boys sit 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:20.199
 welcome but let it be clear that 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.730
 we are a fearsome adversary and I will return 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.090
 within an hour to see what you have 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.090

 score of my love love song 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.940
 reflects our talent and they will be 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.399
 received with the universal language of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.769
 music I was thinking about a model 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.480
 of DNA will know that we are smart and 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.790
 It will be like inviting them with all the fiber 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.730
 of our being what we must transmit 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.360
 it's peace through art, love only 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.360
 brothers 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.930
 Be careful with my uncle hair 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.759

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.759
 purpose 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.660
 I ask my chorus with your science to have given 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.120
 on top of my structures by school children 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.820
 and how am I going to paint my spiritual guide 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.190
 when there is DNA and a treble clef in 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.490
 I do not know, ask your uncle 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.490
 spiritual and design 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:50.659
 to see we are already very proud is but 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.930
 this is wonderful, it 's inspiring 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.360
 but warm and cordial I love how it 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.720

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.070

 guide you and inspire you with a song by 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.950

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.000

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.550
