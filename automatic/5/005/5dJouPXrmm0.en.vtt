well also because it was my first
scripting<00:00:30.210> attempt<00:00:30.659> it<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.810> very<00:00:31.320> basic<00:00:31.949> all

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
scripting attempt it was very basic all

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.880 
scripting attempt it was very basic all

it was was a selection box so he can
select<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.340> image<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.030> upload<00:00:36.480> button

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
select your image and an upload button

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.680 
select your image and an upload button
and<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:37.620> once<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.310> done<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.540> took

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and then once that was done it just took

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.610 
and then once that was done it just took
you<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> page<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.380> just<00:00:41.040> had<00:00:42.140> just<00:00:43.140> had<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
image and gave you a few links but now

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.280 
image and gave you a few links but now
it's<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> lot<00:00:46.710> better<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:48.450> website<00:00:48.750> went

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
it's a lot better and that website went

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.190 
it's a lot better and that website went
down<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.480> first<00:00:51.510> scripting

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
down because it was my first scripting

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.600 
down because it was my first scripting
attempt<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.650> didn't<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.040> lot<00:00:53.490> about

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
attempt I didn't know a lot about

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.960 
attempt I didn't know a lot about
scripting<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.450> just<00:00:54.960> used<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.620> few<00:00:56.220> tutorials<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
scripting I just used a few tutorials I

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.670 
scripting I just used a few tutorials I
found<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:59.090> because<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.240> wasn't<00:01:00.540> very<00:01:01.290> good<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
found and because it wasn't very good it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.759 
found and because it wasn't very good it
was<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> bit<00:01:02.010> basic<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.910> hacked<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.769> all

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
was a bit basic it got hacked and all

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.520 
was a bit basic it got hacked and all
the<00:01:04.920> images<00:01:05.159> were<00:01:05.580> taken<00:01:05.820> off<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.229> I've

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the images were taken off but now I've

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.270 
the images were taken off but now I've
got<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.070> own<00:01:08.430> VPS<00:01:09.299> server<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.649> should<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
got my own VPS server and it should be a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.510 
got my own VPS server and it should be a
lot<00:01:11.310> faster<00:01:11.999> a<00:01:12.479> lot<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:12.929> secure<00:01:13.289> and<00:01:13.520> because

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
lot faster a lot more secure and because

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.639 
lot faster a lot more secure and because
I<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.179> bit<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:15.840> scripting<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
I know a bit more about scripting it

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.660 
I know a bit more about scripting it
should<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.249> unhackable<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.289> called<00:01:19.770> pic

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
should be unhackable so it is called pic

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.139 
should be unhackable so it is called pic
ha<00:01:20.939> tu<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.649> as<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.859> can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> try<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> find

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
ha tu so as you can see I try to find

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.020 
ha tu so as you can see I try to find
the<00:01:24.329> shortest<00:01:24.600> domain<00:01:25.319> possible<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.069> so<00:01:26.850> it's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the shortest domain possible and so it's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.800 
the shortest domain possible and so it's
pic<00:01:27.270> hardy<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.770> quite<00:01:29.039> sure<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.810> as

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
pic hardy you which is quite sure and as

pic hardy you which is quite sure and as
you<00:01:30.929> can<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.109> it<00:01:31.409> looks<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:32.009> nicer<00:01:32.119> it's

need us click Choose file pick an image
so<00:03:53.459> here<00:03:53.609> I've<00:03:53.729> got<00:03:53.760> one<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.090> sonic<00:03:54.449> and<00:03:54.769> you

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
so here I've got one of sonic and you

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.589 
so here I've got one of sonic and you
have<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.069> option<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.400> resize<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.389> click

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
have the option to resize you just click

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.710 
have the option to resize you just click
here<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.989> slides<00:03:58.319> out<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.609> only<00:03:59.819> asks<00:04:00.150> for

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
here it slides out and it only asks for

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.500 
here it slides out and it only asks for
the<00:04:00.840> desired<00:04:01.229> width<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.709> pixels<00:04:02.359> so<00:04:03.359> it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the desired width in pixels so it

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.629 
the desired width in pixels so it
doesn't<00:04:03.840> put<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.440> height<00:04:04.709> as<00:04:04.979> well<00:04:05.190> because

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
doesn't put the height as well because

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.240 
doesn't put the height as well because
it<00:04:05.909> keeps<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.449> proportions<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.739> say<00:04:07.949> you<00:04:08.010> have

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
it keeps the proportions so say you have

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.629 
it keeps the proportions so say you have
an<00:04:08.370> image<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.729> is<00:04:09.379> 1000<00:04:10.379> pixels<00:04:10.769> by<00:04:11.010> 1000

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
an image that is 1000 pixels by 1000

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.089 
an image that is 1000 pixels by 1000
pixels<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.329> you<00:04:12.599> change<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.229> 250<00:04:13.919> pixels

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
pixels if you change it to 250 pixels

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.430 
pixels if you change it to 250 pixels
and<00:04:14.430> width<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:15.150> height<00:04:15.180> will<00:04:15.569> change<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.959> 250

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
and width the height will change the 250

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.020 
and width the height will change the 250
as<00:04:16.530> well<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:16.949> it<00:04:17.010> always<00:04:17.159> keeps<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.849> in<00:04:17.970> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
as well so it always keeps it in the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.149 
as well so it always keeps it in the
correct<00:04:18.630> proportion<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.440> it's<00:04:19.560> not<00:04:19.709> stretched

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
correct proportion so it's not stretched

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.909 
correct proportion so it's not stretched
or<00:04:20.489> anything<00:04:20.789> like<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.650> choose

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
or anything like that and you can choose

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.740 
or anything like that and you can choose
any<00:04:23.220> width<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.789> want<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.510> go<00:04:24.599> all<00:04:24.720> the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
any width you want so you can go all the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.810 
any width you want so you can go all the
way<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.930> 99<00:04:25.500> 999<00:04:25.949> or<00:04:26.159> something<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.729> and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
way to 99 999 or something like that and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.120 
way to 99 999 or something like that and
go<00:04:26.969> all<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.539> way<00:04:27.570> down<00:04:27.779> to<00:04:27.810> one<00:04:28.139> if<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.979> don't

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
go all the way down to one if you don't

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.220 
go all the way down to one if you don't
want<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.310> resize<00:04:29.610> just<00:04:29.940> keep<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.270> blank

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
want to resize just keep it blank

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.900 
want to resize just keep it blank

image and it is that quick so here you
have<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.200> really<00:04:37.760> simple<00:04:38.760> layout<00:04:39.540> you've<00:04:40.410> got

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
have a really simple layout you've got

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.380 
have a really simple layout you've got
the<00:04:40.710> share<00:04:41.010> button<00:04:41.430> up<00:04:41.550> here<00:04:41.760> what<00:04:42.270> that

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
the share button up here what that

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.940 
the share button up here what that
button<00:04:42.570> does<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.930> takes<00:04:43.170> you<00:04:43.380> down<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.590> here

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
button does it takes you down to here

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.460 
button does it takes you down to here
but<00:04:44.160> most<00:04:44.820> screens<00:04:45.660> really<00:04:45.930> won't<00:04:46.080> be<00:04:46.170> as<00:04:46.260> big

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
but most screens really won't be as big

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.350 
but most screens really won't be as big
as<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:46.920> what<00:04:47.070> that<00:04:47.220> will<00:04:47.340> do<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.520> you

you the direct link to the actual image

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.080 
you the direct link to the actual image
and<00:05:12.230> you've<00:05:13.230> got<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.620> forum<00:05:14.220> code<00:05:14.490> which<00:05:14.850> what

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
and you've got a forum code which what

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.120 
and you've got a forum code which what
that<00:05:15.240> does<00:05:15.420> is<00:05:15.450> when<00:05:15.840> you<00:05:15.990> copy<00:05:16.200> that<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.800> put

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
that does is when you copy that and put

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.670 
that does is when you copy that and put
it<00:05:17.160> in<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.430> forum<00:05:17.850> post<00:05:17.880> it<00:05:18.660> will<00:05:18.810> embed<00:05:19.320> it<00:05:19.470> into

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
it in a forum post it will embed it into

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.560 
it in a forum post it will embed it into
the<00:05:20.130> post<00:05:20.370> instead<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.880> just<00:05:21.000> giving<00:05:21.210> a<00:05:21.330> link

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
the post instead of just giving a link
