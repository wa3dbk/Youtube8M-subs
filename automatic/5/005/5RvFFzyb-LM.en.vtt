00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
play around with the Moto X a little bit

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.390 
play around with the Moto X a little bit
and<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.230> just<00:00:04.410> wanted<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.710> do<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.859> comparison

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
and I just wanted to do a comparison

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.450 
and I just wanted to do a comparison
between<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.879> Moto<00:00:06.150> X<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.740> Samsung

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
between the Moto X and the Samsung

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.459 
between the Moto X and the Samsung
Galaxy<00:00:08.490> Nexus<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> reason<00:00:10.110> why<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.260> did

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
Galaxy Nexus and the reason why I did

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.080 
Galaxy Nexus and the reason why I did
this<00:00:10.620> because<00:00:10.800> I've<00:00:11.040> used<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.460> Galaxy<00:00:11.910> Nexus

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this because I've used the Galaxy Nexus

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.440 
this because I've used the Galaxy Nexus
as<00:00:12.570> my<00:00:12.690> personal<00:00:12.929> phone<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:13.830> all<00:00:14.580> over<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> year

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
how similar they are other than the fact

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.080 
how similar they are other than the fact
that<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.890> feature<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.610> you

turn on and off and a few other things

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.529 
turn on and off and a few other things
like<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> say<00:00:42.450> okay<00:00:43.050> Google<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:44.539> then

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
like if you say okay Google now then

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
like if you say okay Google now then
this<00:00:45.690> will<00:00:45.870> wake<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.500> respond<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> listen

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this will wake up and respond and listen

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
this will wake up and respond and listen
to<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.149> saying<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.539> record<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to what you're saying and record it and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
to what you're saying and record it and
then<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.910> searches<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.780> whatever<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
then do searches or do whatever it is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.750 
then do searches or do whatever it is
that<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.469> looking<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:54.110> other<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
that you're looking for other than that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
that you're looking for other than that
I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.600> two<00:00:57.809> phones<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.559> very

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
I think these two phones are very very

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.849 
I think these two phones are very very
similar<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.570> average<00:01:00.899> user<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
similar the average user is not going to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
similar the average user is not going to
notice<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> difference<00:01:02.699> there's<00:01:03.420> probably<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
notice the difference there's probably a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.010 
notice the difference there's probably a
little<00:01:03.960> bit<00:01:04.110> faster<00:01:04.320> processor<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.020> Moto

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
little bit faster processor on the Moto

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
little bit faster processor on the Moto
X<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.840> Moto<00:01:10.020> X<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.530> 4.4<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.909> 4.2<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
X and the Moto X is 4.4 this is 4.2 and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
X and the Moto X is 4.4 this is 4.2 and
will<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.900> updated<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> chance

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
will not be updated so you have a chance

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
will not be updated so you have a chance
that<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.700> updated<00:01:15.180> further<00:01:15.420> but

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that this will be updated further but

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
that this will be updated further but

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
right here and that's a a microphone

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
right here and that's a a microphone
which<00:01:46.920> allows<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.579> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.450> probably
