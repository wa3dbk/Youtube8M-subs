think<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.630> little<00:05:09.840> late<00:05:09.960> for<00:05:09.990> my<00:05:10.260> liking

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
think a little late for my liking

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.020 
think a little late for my liking
because<00:05:10.920> there's<00:05:11.280> certain<00:05:11.520> time<00:05:11.700> limit<00:05:11.940> to

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
because there's certain time limit to

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.020 
because there's certain time limit to
that<00:05:12.210> but<00:05:12.810> they<00:05:12.960> have<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:13.440> here<00:05:13.590> goes<00:05:13.800> who

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
that but they have so here goes who

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:27.840 
that but they have so here goes who
that's<00:05:16.020> all<00:05:16.260> back<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.710> me<00:05:16.860> there

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.130 

got<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:28.970> continue<00:05:29.360> saying<00:05:29.570> I<00:05:29.690> think<00:05:29.840> that<00:05:29.990> was

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
got to continue saying I think that was

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.820 
got to continue saying I think that was
very<00:05:30.320> very<00:05:30.590> late

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
very very late

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.520 
very very late
sir

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.640 

let's<00:05:36.070> see<00:05:36.190> what<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.430> decision<00:05:36.820> is

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.130 

also<00:05:39.980> think<00:05:40.220> that<00:05:40.330> rowdy<00:05:41.330> were<00:05:41.600> taking<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:41.930> big

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
also think that rowdy were taking a big

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.130 
also think that rowdy were taking a big
step<00:05:42.440> forward<00:05:42.970> yeah<00:05:43.970> I<00:05:44.330> think<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.690> time<00:05:44.870> limit

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
step forward yeah I think the time limit

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.660 
step forward yeah I think the time limit
is<00:05:45.230> now<00:05:45.440> being<00:05:45.830> talked<00:05:46.070> about<00:05:46.190> deal<00:05:46.520> are

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
is now being talked about deal are

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.760 
is now being talked about deal are

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
not be too pleased but perhaps this goes

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.870 
not be too pleased but perhaps this goes
with<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:57.080> rules<00:05:57.440> of<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:57.650> game<00:05:57.860> well<00:05:58.640> they've

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
got only themselves to blame

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.650 
got only themselves to blame
to<00:06:00.380> be<00:06:00.500> honest<00:06:00.770> cherry<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:02.000> new<00:06:02.150> rules<00:06:02.390> of<00:06:02.540> the

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
to be honest cherry the new rules of the

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.070 
to be honest cherry the new rules of the
game<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.020> if<00:06:03.110> they<00:06:03.260> felt<00:06:04.510> so<00:06:05.510> strongly<00:06:05.900> about

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
game and if they felt so strongly about

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.050 
game and if they felt so strongly about
the<00:06:06.260> pill<00:06:06.500> they<00:06:06.620> should<00:06:06.770> have<00:06:06.860> asked<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.640> DRS

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
the pill they should have asked the DRS

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.600 
the pill they should have asked the DRS
straight<00:06:08.300> away<00:06:08.510> not

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
straight away not

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.999 
straight away not
after<00:06:10.939> a<00:06:10.970> minute<00:06:11.180> or<00:06:11.389> two<00:06:11.569> and<00:06:11.870> I<00:06:12.770> think

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
after a minute or two and I think

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:14.409 
after a minute or two and I think
honestly<00:06:13.550> I<00:06:13.639> think<00:06:13.759> this<00:06:13.909> could<00:06:14.030> have<00:06:14.150> gone<00:06:14.180> in

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
honestly I think this could have gone in

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.330 
honestly I think this could have gone in
their<00:06:14.569> favor<00:06:14.810> this<00:06:15.680> decision<00:06:16.220> could<00:06:16.280> have

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
their favor this decision could have

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.860 
their favor this decision could have
gone<00:06:16.520> in<00:06:16.849> their<00:06:17.120> favor<00:06:17.300> because<00:06:17.599> it<00:06:17.659> was<00:06:17.780> all

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
gone in their favor because it was all

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.800
