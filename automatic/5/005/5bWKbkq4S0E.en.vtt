00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.410 
metal and the ball goes and whacks the
perp<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.590> decided<00:00:19.949> hey<00:00:20.850> let's<00:00:20.880> make<00:00:21.270> one

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
perp so we decided hey let's make one

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.929 
perp so we decided hey let's make one
for<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.630> shotgun<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.609> make<00:00:23.789> it

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
for a shotgun and see if we can make it

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.870 
for a shotgun and see if we can make it
for<00:00:24.359> under<00:00:24.539> five<00:00:24.750> dollars<00:00:25.340> our<00:00:26.340> device<00:00:26.699> will

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
for under five dollars our device will

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.630 
for under five dollars our device will
be<00:00:26.910> launching<00:00:27.480> golf<00:00:27.840> balls<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:29.460> keep

be launching golf balls and to keep
costs<00:00:30.029> down<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.539> used<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.050> cardboard<00:00:31.619> toilet

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
costs down we used a cardboard toilet

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.250 
costs down we used a cardboard toilet
paper<00:00:32.759> tube<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.480> bridge<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:34.020> call<00:00:34.230> a

paper tube which if bridge would call a
bog<00:00:34.800> roll<00:00:35.250> tube<00:00:35.750> for<00:00:36.750> our<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:37.140> test<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.800> will

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
bog roll tube for our first test we will

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.299 
bog roll tube for our first test we will
be<00:00:38.340> using<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.940> foam<00:00:39.420> rubber<00:00:39.719> golf<00:00:40.350> ball<00:00:40.649> also

the lead shot from the shotgun shell has

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
the lead shot from the shotgun shell has
been<00:00:43.350> replaced<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.860> solid<00:00:44.340> wax<00:00:47.120> blue<00:00:48.120> apart

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
been replaced with solid wax blue apart

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.279 
been replaced with solid wax blue apart
before<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.800> went<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.300> using<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.420> real<00:00:51.719> golf<00:00:51.989> ball

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
before we went to using a real golf ball

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.540 
before we went to using a real golf ball
and<00:00:53.059> live<00:00:54.059> factory<00:00:54.840> ammunition<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and live factory ammunition we want to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400 
and live factory ammunition we want to
do<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.879> test<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.750> sure<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
do this test first to make sure that the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
do this test first to make sure that the
entire<00:00:59.070> concept<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.300> work

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.130 

and<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.620> punch<00:01:04.800> right<00:01:04.980> through<00:01:05.160> that<00:01:05.309> yeah

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
and just punch right through that yeah

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
and just punch right through that yeah
next<00:01:07.140> we'll<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.320> again<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.430> wax<00:01:09.420> filled

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
next we'll use again the wax filled

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.810 
next we'll use again the wax filled
shotgun<00:01:10.260> shell<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> real<00:01:11.220> golf<00:01:11.460> ball<00:01:11.670> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
shotgun shell but a real golf ball this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
shotgun shell but a real golf ball this
time<00:01:13.250> if<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> alignment<00:01:14.820> isn't<00:01:15.360> perfect<00:01:15.780> well

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
time if the alignment isn't perfect well

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.440 
time if the alignment isn't perfect well
just<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> golfer<00:01:17.640> he's<00:01:17.940> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> slice

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
just like a golfer he's going to slice

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.540 
just like a golfer he's going to slice
the<00:01:18.780> ball<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.620> what<00:01:19.860> happened<00:01:20.190> here<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
the ball and that's what happened here a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:35.080 
the ball and that's what happened here a
regular<00:01:23.550> golf<00:01:23.910> ball<00:01:24.119> shot<00:01:24.479> -<00:01:25.700> yep<00:01:29.090> Wow<00:01:33.470> Wow

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
regular golf ball shot - yep Wow Wow

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.790 
regular golf ball shot - yep Wow Wow
now<00:01:36.090> velocity<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:36.780> still<00:01:37.020> pretty<00:01:37.259> low<00:01:37.350> because

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
now velocity is still pretty low because

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.219 
now velocity is still pretty low because
we're<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.280> using<00:01:38.490> those<00:01:38.700> wax<00:01:39.229> projectiles

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
we're just using those wax projectiles

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.800 
we're just using those wax projectiles
instead<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.280> factory<00:01:41.700> round<00:01:41.940> we're<00:01:42.600> really

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
instead of a factory round we're really

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.170 
instead of a factory round we're really
happy<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> performance<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.369> custom

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
happy with the performance of the custom

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
happy with the performance of the custom
Mike<00:01:45.390> Dittman<00:01:45.810> muzzle<00:01:46.440> break<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:46.830> allows

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
Mike Dittman muzzle break which allows

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.999 
Mike Dittman muzzle break which allows
the<00:01:47.790> excess<00:01:48.360> gases<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.050> vent<00:01:49.380> out<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.740> sides

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the excess gases to vent out the sides

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.889 
the excess gases to vent out the sides
we<00:01:50.700> wouldn't<00:01:50.940> have<00:01:51.030> done<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.210> without<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
we wouldn't have done that without that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
we wouldn't have done that without that

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
were just using a solid wax projectile

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.410 
were just using a solid wax projectile
and<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.440> still<00:02:11.680> blew<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.190> very<00:02:12.880> tough<00:02:13.150> ball

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
and it still blew this very tough ball

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.390 
and it still blew this very tough ball
apart<00:02:13.810> next<00:02:14.530> we'll<00:02:14.650> use<00:02:14.680> an<00:02:14.920> even<00:02:15.040> larger

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
apart next we'll use an even larger
