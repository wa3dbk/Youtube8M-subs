00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.240
 we are with simone resta c chiusani a di 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.460
 ferrari team you want what it means 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.790
 for a formula 1 chassis car 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.029
 motor run in the 36 degrees and beyond 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.140
 two soldiers the track as a seventh 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.610
 runs in a track as if he is also for 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.070
 a car of formula 1 represents a 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.050
 large system load 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.000
 cooling to ensure the poles 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.250
 combined the temperatures required for 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.420
 reliability and performance 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.949
 the car to ensure a level of 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.680
 cooling that is sepang e 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.010
 particularly high compared to the track 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.930
 in which well I ran previously from 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.969
 one part the engine from the other note 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.700
 requirement and on the other the aerodynamics is 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.760
 always the eternal compromise between was 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.899
 dynamic and motorists as you see it 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.489
 view like this because you go more into one 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.140
 direction rather than the other 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.330
 in the end we always go in the direction 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.160
 best for the team the point where 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.100
 we operate if a little compromise between the 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.490
 needs needs points of reliability 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.590
 of performance services both for the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 pole united and for aerodynamics e 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.440
 we try to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.260
 reach the best point of use 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.210
 overall for the allison car james 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.520
 having said that from the point of view of the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.470
 engineers the track of malaysia is not 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.210
 then so different from the first in 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.860
 australia leaves precisely for the climate 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.720
 however there are definitely network lines 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.400
 much longer do you think they can 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.540
 adapt to the characteristics of the sf 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.550
 15th in describing the features 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.620
 of a car we say on a particular 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.090
 track must always consider that 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.290
 we are at the beginning of the season so 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.150
 it is not very clear where they are 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.260
 balance if we look only at what 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.390
 is seen in the first race we can 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.160
 say that our car shows how 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 the top speed that it could be 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.360
 interesting these two long ones 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 straights that we have sepang is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.990
 proved a good step in conditions 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.270
 of competition and is not on such a track 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.350
 with a lot of tire degradation 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.110
 high could only factor 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 interesting in australia despite the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.940
 the qualification is not perfect 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.560
 podium with sebastiano slice the country that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.400
 is a goal reachable even on 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.100
 this second seen after a good race 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.450
 in Australia 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.010
 despite a phone from our two 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.970
 cars 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.920
 we aim to form uteriore next 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.950
 forward reinforcing its position in 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.870
 sepang and we will try to stay the most 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.730
 possible near the mercedes for having 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.730
 them as much as possible for inter style
