00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110 

all<00:00:00.420> righty<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:01.260> was<00:00:02.070> asked<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.399> do<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> video

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
all righty I was asked to do a video

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.190 
all righty I was asked to do a video
about<00:00:03.540> my<00:00:03.750> atomic<00:00:04.259> LED<00:00:04.770> cab<00:00:05.040> lights<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:06.170> so<00:00:07.170> I

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
about my atomic LED cab lights and so I

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.390 
about my atomic LED cab lights and so I
figured<00:00:07.379> I'd<00:00:07.560> just<00:00:07.680> do<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> little<00:00:08.099> rundown<00:00:08.250> on

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
figured I'd just do a little rundown on

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.770 
figured I'd just do a little rundown on
the<00:00:08.550> truck<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.940> everything

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
the truck of everything

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.190 
the truck of everything
I<00:00:09.809> got<00:00:10.200> done<00:00:10.380> light<00:00:10.650> wise<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:12.080> like<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.139> said

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I got done light wise to it like I said

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.230 
I got done light wise to it like I said
I<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> atomic<00:00:13.920> LED<00:00:14.309> cab<00:00:14.549> lights<00:00:14.880> I

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
I have the atomic LED cab lights I

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.599 
I have the atomic LED cab lights I
bought<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.660> Ford<00:00:16.320> KITT<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.279> clear

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
bought the Ford KITT with the clear

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.700 
bought the Ford KITT with the clear
lenses<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> then<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.570> also<00:00:18.720> bought<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.289> wiring

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
lenses and then I also bought the wiring

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.120 
lenses and then I also bought the wiring
harness<00:00:20.180> it<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.420> makes<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.199> lot<00:00:22.619> easier<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
harness it just makes it a lot easier to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.310 
harness it just makes it a lot easier to
wire<00:00:23.970> everything<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.720> everything<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.199> in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
wire everything because everything is in

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.250 
wire everything because everything is in
it<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> wire<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> separate<00:00:27.260> signal

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
it you have to wire a separate signal

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.460 
it you have to wire a separate signal
wire<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.920> each<00:00:29.130> bulb<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> strobe<00:00:30.990> once

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
wire to each bulb to get the strobe once

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.139 
wire to each bulb to get the strobe once
you<00:00:31.560> get<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> package<00:00:32.130> you'll<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
you get the package you'll see from the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.540 
you get the package you'll see from the
strobe<00:00:33.390> module<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.079> each<00:00:34.260> hat<00:00:34.530> each<00:00:34.710> cab<00:00:35.309> light

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
strobe module to each hat each cab light

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.420 
strobe module to each hat each cab light
bulb<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> run<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> signal<00:00:37.680> wire<00:00:37.829> so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
bulb you have to run a signal wire so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
bulb you have to run a signal wire so
using<00:00:38.879> their<00:00:39.120> wiring<00:00:39.450> harness<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> lot

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
using their wiring harness that's a lot

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.860 
using their wiring harness that's a lot
easier<00:00:40.410> than<00:00:41.540> running<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> wires

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
easier than running all the wires

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.000 
easier than running all the wires
individually<00:00:43.469> yourself<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:45.710> have<00:00:46.710> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
strobes on the atomic LED cab lights I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.660 
strobes on the atomic LED cab lights I
have<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.560> set<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> random<00:01:38.460> flash

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
have them set to the random flash

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.370 
have them set to the random flash
pattern<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.390> keep<00:01:39.570> changing<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:43.140> more

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
pattern so they keep changing it's more

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.929 
pattern so they keep changing it's more
noticeable<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> mean<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.729> set

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
noticeable that way I mean you can set

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.429 
noticeable that way I mean you can set
them<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.240> individual<00:01:45.689> flash<00:01:45.899> pattern<00:01:46.290> or

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
them to an individual flash pattern or

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.050 
them to an individual flash pattern or
keep<00:01:46.590> them<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.829> random<00:01:47.250> random<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.030> uh

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
keep them on random random but uh

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.020 
keep them on random random but uh
default<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.590> random<00:01:50.009> pattern<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> left

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
default is the random pattern so I left

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.190 
default is the random pattern so I left
it<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.299> there<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.490> have<00:01:53.490> LEDs<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> side

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it on there I have LEDs down the side

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.179 
it on there I have LEDs down the side
under<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> doors<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:57.560> running<00:01:58.560> lights<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
under the doors for running lights I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.179 
under the doors for running lights I
have<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.490> Recon<00:01:59.820> LED<00:02:00.180> Mir<00:02:00.570> lights<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
have the Recon LED Mir lights and the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.679 
have the Recon LED Mir lights and the
back<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:03.619> here's<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:05.329> what<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> back<00:02:06.659> looks

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
back here here's a what the back looks

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.589 
back here here's a what the back looks
like<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.829> well<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.729> hot<00:02:08.879> aways<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
like with the well and hot aways and the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:25.699 
like with the well and hot aways and the
reverse<00:02:10.259> lights<00:02:23.239> up<00:02:24.239> there<00:02:24.420> 3<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.870> had<00:02:25.200> my<00:02:25.410> rigid

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
reverse lights up there 3 I had my rigid

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:35.570 
reverse lights up there 3 I had my rigid
light<00:02:25.920> bar<00:02:27.650> C<00:02:32.629> up<00:02:33.629> therefore<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.980> LED

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
light bar C up therefore I have this LED

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:49.390 
light bar C up therefore I have this LED
backup<00:02:36.510> lights<00:02:38.599> mounted<00:02:39.599> under<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.110> bumper
