I see people just rip it open I done
from<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.690> box<00:02:31.960> sub<00:02:32.320> as<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.010> said<00:02:33.280> before<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.640> keep

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
from the box sub as I said before I keep

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.660 
from the box sub as I said before I keep
box<00:02:37.170> nowadays<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.860> beautiful<00:02:39.370> beautiful

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
box nowadays it's a beautiful beautiful

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.420 
box nowadays it's a beautiful beautiful
model<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.360> year<00:02:41.020> too<00:02:41.200> bold<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.590> do<00:02:41.710> pivot<00:02:42.100> so

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
model and year too bold to do pivot so

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.130 
model and year too bold to do pivot so
this<00:02:42.880> would<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.800> landing<00:02:45.130> time<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:46.600> facing

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
this would be the landing time or facing

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.700 
this would be the landing time or facing
upwards<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.940> that's<00:02:49.570> landing<00:02:49.900> gear<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.620> was

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
upwards so that's landing gear if it was
