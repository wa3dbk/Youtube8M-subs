00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.520
 individual remy who is doing the 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.920
 difference because it's all about 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.700
 next to goal the bridge offsets 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:29.410
 of age he wants abbas continues to common sense 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.850
 good to study in open de france for 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.070
 Andre Pierre Gignac 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.790
 arica he framed his recovery in the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.550
 superb service florian 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.840
 but also the benefit of the call that 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.270
 were not in vain that was not in vain 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.600
 from rhodes valley which proposed a 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.340
 solution which allowed the exit no 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.350
 addressed second center it takes 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.790

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.660
 men of aurélien bosch who will do 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.310
 the effort at the first post 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.510
 the statement are in trouble tonight on 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.010
 the set pieces are 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:10.009
 ineffective on kicks 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:12.800

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.229
 avoidable of yassin haddou and have 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.229
 sanctioned and absences also 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.910
 particularly guilty in terms of timing 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.110
 a good reading of the trajectory of 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.670
 the share of the eiti ndiaye supported by his 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.050
 team dominates outrageously since 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.630
 beginning of the maquis and the first 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.720
