go check out my first look / overview of
the<00:00:10.530> 780<00:00:10.950> Ti<00:00:11.010> where<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.730> basically<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.360> go

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
the 780 Ti where I basically just go

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.730 
the 780 Ti where I basically just go
over<00:00:12.570> some<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> specifications<00:00:13.530> as<00:00:13.710> well

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
over some of the specifications as well

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
as the hardware of the card if you

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.060 
as the hardware of the card if you
already<00:00:15.780> saw<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:15.990> video<00:00:16.139> that's<00:00:16.470> probably

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
already saw that video that's probably

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.990

against three other high-end cards that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.320 
against three other high-end cards that
are<00:00:26.160> pretty<00:00:26.340> much<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> same<00:00:26.789> ballpark<00:00:27.029> as

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
are pretty much in the same ballpark as

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.210 
are pretty much in the same ballpark as
far<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.630> performance<00:00:28.050> go<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.859> before<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.160> get

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
far as performance go but before we get

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.529 
far as performance go but before we get
into<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> actual<00:00:29.640> performance<00:00:30.119> numbers<00:00:30.420> why

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
into the actual performance numbers why

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.669 
into the actual performance numbers why
don't<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.720> take<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> look<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> hardware

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
don't we take a look at the hardware

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and this is this is exciting stuff

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
and this is this is exciting stuff
because<00:01:41.159> we're<00:01:41.310> kind<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.549> moving<00:01:42.420> away<00:01:42.540> from

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a newer engine and it's a bit more

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.510 
a newer engine and it's a bit more
taxing<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:46.950> hardware<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.399> that's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
taxing on your hardware and that's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.010 
taxing on your hardware and that's
that's<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.000> exciting<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.570> us<00:01:48.720> bench

so if you take a look at the results

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
so if you take a look at the results
here<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.619> see<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> 780<00:01:53.250> Ti<00:01:53.310> pulling

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

ahead of the competition by quite a

ahead of the competition by quite a
margin<00:01:55.470> actually<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.310> 1080<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.540> isn't<00:01:57.719> too

margin actually at 1080 which isn't too

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
margin actually at 1080 which isn't too

the video cards the 780ti really didn't

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.500 
the video cards the 780ti really didn't
get<00:02:24.710> much<00:02:24.920> hotter<00:02:25.190> than<00:02:25.280> 83<00:02:25.790> degrees<00:02:26.060> Celsius

at<00:02:26.630> any<00:02:26.840> given<00:02:27.050> time<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.650> any<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.040> tests

at any given time in any of the tests
that<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.460> ran<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.060> did<00:02:29.390> get<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:29.870> bit<00:02:29.990> cooler

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
that I ran I did get a little bit cooler

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.380 
that I ran I did get a little bit cooler
I<00:02:30.350> think<00:02:30.620> for<00:02:30.740> 3d<00:02:31.160> mark<00:02:31.370> which<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.610> one<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
I think for 3d mark which is one of the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.120 
I think for 3d mark which is one of the
tests<00:02:32.660> we're<00:02:32.750> gonna<00:02:32.900> look<00:02:33.020> at<00:02:33.200> later<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:33.800> for

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
tests we're gonna look at later but for

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.830 
tests we're gonna look at later but for
the<00:02:34.400> other<00:02:34.790> tests<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.180> you'll<00:02:35.330> see<00:02:35.540> they<00:02:35.720> all

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the other tests as you'll see they all

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.600 
the other tests as you'll see they all
pretty<00:02:36.110> much<00:02:36.230> stayed<00:02:36.620> at<00:02:36.800> around<00:02:37.040> 83<00:02:37.520> and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
pretty much stayed at around 83 and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.890 
pretty much stayed at around 83 and
that's<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:38.000> know<00:02:38.120> that's<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.480> guess<00:02:38.690> that's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that's you know that's I guess that's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.300 
that's you know that's I guess that's
what<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.170> card<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.440> rated<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.830> run<00:02:39.980> at<00:02:40.100> and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
what that card is rated to run at and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.190 
what that card is rated to run at and
it's<00:02:40.400> perfectly<00:02:40.940> fine<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.810> definitely<00:02:42.110> not

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
it's perfectly fine it's definitely not

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.230 
it's perfectly fine it's definitely not
quite<00:02:42.650> as<00:02:42.800> alarming<00:02:43.220> as<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.550> 290x

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
quite as alarming as the 290x

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.660 
quite as alarming as the 290x
temperature<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.590> runs<00:02:45.710> at<00:02:45.920> at<00:02:46.130> 94

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
temperature that it runs at at 94

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.580 
temperature that it runs at at 94
degrees<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.660> course<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> AMD<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.230> said

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
degrees but of course the AMD is said

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.110 
degrees but of course the AMD is said
that<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.010> safe<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.370> run<00:02:49.520> at<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.760> that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
that it's safe to run at that that

there's still the issue of well it might

in this test Crysis 3 we see once again
the<00:03:27.890> 780<00:03:28.310> Ti<00:03:28.370> wins<00:03:28.850> yes<00:03:29.300> it's<00:03:29.810> getting<00:03:29.930> old<00:03:30.200> now

the 780 Ti wins yes it's getting old now

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.720 
the 780 Ti wins yes it's getting old now
we<00:03:30.470> get<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> point

but you can see they're worth pointing

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.949 
but you can see they're worth pointing

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
780ti and the Titan pretty much neck and

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.800 
780ti and the Titan pretty much neck and
neck<00:04:19.400> right<00:04:19.519> there<00:04:19.760> at<00:04:19.880> 1080<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.570> when<00:04:20.750> we

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
neck right there at 1080 and when we

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.500 
neck right there at 1080 and when we
take<00:04:20.960> a<00:04:20.989> look<00:04:21.080> at<00:04:21.320> 2560<00:04:22.039> by<00:04:22.130> 1600<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:23.210> see<00:04:23.390> the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
take a look at 2560 by 1600 we see the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.240 
take a look at 2560 by 1600 we see the
780<00:04:23.900> Ti<00:04:23.990> pull<00:04:24.470> ahead<00:04:24.590> ever<00:04:24.950> so<00:04:25.190> slightly<00:04:25.550> but

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
780 Ti pull ahead ever so slightly but

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.150 
780 Ti pull ahead ever so slightly but
290x<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.360> gtx<00:04:27.810> titan<00:04:28.020> 3d<00:04:28.620> mark<00:04:28.860> was<00:04:29.040> the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
290x and the gtx titan 3d mark was the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.620 
290x and the gtx titan 3d mark was the
last<00:04:29.340> test<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.790> ran<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.330> it's<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.510> only

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
last test that I ran and it's the only

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.330 
last test that I ran and it's the only
synthetic<00:04:31.050> benchmark<00:04:31.440> test<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.130> ran

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
synthetic benchmark test that I ran

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.100 
synthetic benchmark test that I ran
against<00:04:32.640> these<00:04:32.760> cards<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.330> did<00:04:33.810> do<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.020> on

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
against these cards I did do it on

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.840 
against these cards I did do it on
Xtreme<00:04:34.500> though<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:34.860> it's<00:04:35.010> extremely<00:04:35.580> taxing

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
Xtreme though so it's extremely taxing

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.150 
Xtreme though so it's extremely taxing
on<00:04:36.240> your<00:04:36.600> hardware<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.320> if<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.800> look<00:04:38.010> at<00:04:38.100> the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
on your hardware and if you look at the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.680 
on your hardware and if you look at the
performance<00:04:38.280> numbers<00:04:38.730> it's<00:04:39.210> kind<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.510> cool<00:04:39.660> to

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
performance numbers it's kind of cool to

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.360 
performance numbers it's kind of cool to
just<00:04:39.840> see<00:04:39.990> these<00:04:40.170> numbers<00:04:40.380> go<00:04:40.650> up<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.010> up<00:04:41.130> with

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
just see these numbers go up and up with

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.430 
just see these numbers go up and up with
every<00:04:41.670> new<00:04:41.880> GPU<00:04:42.270> launch<00:04:42.570> that<00:04:42.810> AMD<00:04:43.080> or<00:04:43.350> in

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
be Titan and the GTX 780 were able to

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.040 
be Titan and the GTX 780 were able to
achieve<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.240> if<00:04:54.480> you<00:04:54.540> look<00:04:54.660> at<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.810> bottom

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
achieve and if you look at the bottom

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.660 
achieve and if you look at the bottom
left<00:04:55.170> you<00:04:55.350> can<00:04:55.470> see<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.890> GTX<00:04:56.250> 780<00:04:56.550> Ti

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
left you can see that the GTX 780 Ti

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.490 
left you can see that the GTX 780 Ti
didn't<00:04:57.150> even<00:04:57.270> get<00:04:57.420> too<00:04:57.660> hot<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.080> only<00:04:58.230> got<00:04:58.410> up

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
didn't even get too hot it only got up

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.070 
didn't even get too hot it only got up
to<00:04:58.590> 77<00:04:58.980> degrees<00:04:59.340> Celsius<00:04:59.790> max<00:05:00.120> which<00:05:00.810> tells<00:05:01.020> me

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
to 77 degrees Celsius max which tells me

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.300 
to 77 degrees Celsius max which tells me
that<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:01.290> could<00:05:01.410> have<00:05:01.530> been<00:05:01.590> pushed<00:05:01.890> even<00:05:02.250> a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
that it could have been pushed even a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.950 
that it could have been pushed even a
bit<00:05:02.460> further<00:05:02.790> before<00:05:03.240> hitting<00:05:03.630> its<00:05:03.750> temp

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
bit further before hitting its temp

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.140 
bit further before hitting its temp
target<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.470> 83<00:05:04.980> degrees<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.850> those<00:05:06.000> are<00:05:06.090> all

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
target of 83 degrees so those are all

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.220 
target of 83 degrees so those are all
the<00:05:06.180> benchmarks<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:06.780> have<00:05:06.930> for<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.080> today
