00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
remember from the start of the video

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.440 
remember from the start of the video
where<00:04:25.370> um<00:04:25.670> like<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:27.380> on<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.790> home<00:04:28.970> page<00:04:29.000> where

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
where um like the on the home page where

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.960 
where um like the on the home page where
it<00:04:29.660> had<00:04:29.810> like<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.050> percentage<00:04:30.950> if<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.730> is

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
it had like the percentage if that is

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.510 
it had like the percentage if that is
actually<00:04:32.390> at<00:04:32.480> 98<00:04:32.870> percent<00:04:32.900> no<00:04:33.860> one<00:04:34.070> else<00:04:34.280> will

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
actually at 98 percent no one else will

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.800 
actually at 98 percent no one else will
actually<00:04:34.880> really<00:04:35.030> be<00:04:35.150> able<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.360> create<00:04:35.570> server

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
actually really be able to create server

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.620 
actually really be able to create server
so<00:04:36.410> you're<00:04:37.220> going<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.430> have<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.700> wait<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.000> bit<00:04:38.120> to

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
so you're going to have to wait a bit to

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.090
