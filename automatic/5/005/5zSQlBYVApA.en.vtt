00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
I'm ahead of my schedule so fingers

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.299

crossed<00:00:34.110> everything<00:00:34.380> goes<00:00:34.649> straight<00:00:35.040> forward

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
crossed everything goes straight forward

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
crossed everything goes straight forward
from<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.840> think<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:36.960> probably<00:00:37.410> fair<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
from here I think it's probably fair to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.020 
from here I think it's probably fair to
say<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> few<00:00:38.160> things<00:00:38.309> haven't<00:00:38.610> gone<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.940> way

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
say a few things haven't gone your way

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.100 
say a few things haven't gone your way
in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> past<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.930> been<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> few

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
in the past and there have been a few

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.770 
in the past and there have been a few
disappointing<00:00:40.890> campaigns<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.690> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
disappointing campaigns but for you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.540 
disappointing campaigns but for you
previously<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> real<00:00:44.100> air<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
previously but there is a real air of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
previously but there is a real air of
positivity<00:00:44.940> around<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> lead-up<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
positivity around you in the lead-up to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.069 
positivity around you in the lead-up to
London<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.430> fair<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> say<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
London is it fair to say that that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.240 
London is it fair to say that that
that's<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.739> things<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.190> own

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that's how you see things on your own

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
that's how you see things on your own
look<00:00:50.940> I've<00:00:51.059> got<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.420> good<00:00:51.570> team<00:00:51.809> around

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
look I've got a really good team around

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.119 
look I've got a really good team around
me<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.320> know<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.590> saying<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.980> haven't

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
me you know not saying that I haven't

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.650 
me you know not saying that I haven't
had<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> past<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.510> been<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
had in the past but I think it's been a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.970 
had in the past but I think it's been a
rocky<00:00:54.809> road<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.260> injuries<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.620> I've<00:00:55.770> had<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
rocky road with injuries and I've had to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.260 
rocky road with injuries and I've had to
learn<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.129> lot<00:00:56.280> about<00:00:56.460> myself<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.969> sort<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> get

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
learn a lot about myself to sort of get

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.670 
learn a lot about myself to sort of get
the<00:00:57.329> best<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.649> my

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the best out of out of you know my

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
the best out of out of you know my
talent<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.609> think<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.239> we've<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.660> put

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
talent and I think now we've really put

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
talent and I think now we've really put
in<00:01:00.899> place<00:01:01.079> something<00:01:01.469> that's<00:01:01.649> foolproof<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
in place something that's foolproof and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.359 
in place something that's foolproof and
and<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.539> equally<00:01:04.260> keen<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.949> try<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and we're all equally keen to try and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
and we're all equally keen to try and
bring<00:01:05.489> home<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.670> goods<00:01:05.850> next<00:01:06.180> year<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.540> yes<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
bring home the goods next year so yes I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.850 
bring home the goods next year so yes I
think<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.350> positive<00:01:07.560> environment

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
think it's a very positive environment

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
think it's a very positive environment
it's<00:01:08.400> certainly<00:01:08.610> gonna<00:01:08.760> help<00:01:09.119> me

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it's certainly gonna help me

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
it's certainly gonna help me
well<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.140> certainly<00:01:10.229> can't<00:01:10.470> hurt<00:01:10.670> obviously

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
well it certainly can't hurt obviously

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.010 
well it certainly can't hurt obviously
there's<00:01:11.820> been<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.030> bit<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> speculation<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
there's been a bit of speculation as to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
there's been a bit of speculation as to
what<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.290> plans<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.830> beyond<00:01:14.400> London<00:01:14.760> have

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
what your plans are beyond London have

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.219 
what your plans are beyond London have
you<00:01:14.939> put<00:01:15.360> much<00:01:15.479> thought<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.900> yourself

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you put much thought into that yourself

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
you put much thought into that yourself
at<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.409> point<00:01:16.500> I've<00:01:17.100> made<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> real<00:01:17.850> solid

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
at this point I've made a real solid

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.520 
at this point I've made a real solid
plan<00:01:18.330> actually<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.900> contemplating

plan actually I was contemplating

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
plan actually I was contemplating
retiring<00:01:20.100> after<00:01:20.340> London<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> would

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

but<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.330> stage<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.780> thought<00:01:27.900> existing<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
but at this stage I thought existing in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.770 
but at this stage I thought existing in
my<00:01:28.500> heart<00:01:28.680> okay<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:29.520> thing<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.630> throw

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
my heart okay any thing you can throw

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
my heart okay any thing you can throw
out<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.320> us<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.619> point<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:32.189> I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
out there for us at this point well I

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
out there for us at this point well I
think<00:01:32.490> we've<00:01:32.820> Winter<00:01:33.060> Olympics<00:01:33.360> bobsleigh<00:01:33.780> or

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
think we've Winter Olympics bobsleigh or

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
think we've Winter Olympics bobsleigh or
potentially<00:01:34.680> rowing<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.100> cycling<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
potentially rowing or cycling so just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.190 
potentially rowing or cycling so just
something<00:01:36.299> that's<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.630> injury<00:01:36.990> prone

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
something that's not as injury prone

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
something that's not as injury prone
with<00:01:37.350> sport<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.009> think<00:01:38.369> when<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.579> comes

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
with sport but I think when it comes

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.069 
with sport but I think when it comes
down<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.210> athletics<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.659> such<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> pure

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
down to it athletics is such a pure

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.270 
down to it athletics is such a pure
sport<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.530> something<00:01:40.740> I've<00:01:40.829> loved<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
sport it's something I've loved for so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.980 
sport it's something I've loved for so
long<00:01:41.430> I'd<00:01:41.579> find<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.880> very<00:01:42.060> hard<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.720> change

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
long I'd find it very hard to to change

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.649 
long I'd find it very hard to to change
