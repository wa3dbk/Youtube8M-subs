00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.660 

I<00:00:04.859> said<00:00:05.859> today<00:00:06.100> we're<00:00:06.220> going<00:00:06.310> to<00:00:06.399> be<00:00:06.460> talking

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
I said today we're going to be talking

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.120 
I said today we're going to be talking
about<00:00:06.730> the<00:00:06.970> PDC<00:00:07.660> cycle<00:00:08.170> um<00:00:08.349> and<00:00:08.740> what<00:00:08.950> is<00:00:09.040> the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
about the PDC cycle um and what is the

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.959 
about the PDC cycle um and what is the
PDC<00:00:09.610> cycle<00:00:10.150> it's<00:00:10.300> the<00:00:10.599> pyruvate

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
PDC cycle it's the pyruvate

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.629 
PDC cycle it's the pyruvate
dehydrogenase<00:00:12.969> cycle<00:00:13.870> or<00:00:14.639> dehydrogenase

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
dehydrogenase cycle or dehydrogenase

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.240 
dehydrogenase cycle or dehydrogenase
complex<00:00:15.940> actually<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:19.000> so<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:20.710> this<00:00:20.890> is<00:00:21.070> is

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
complex actually and so what this is is

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.160 
complex actually and so what this is is
the<00:00:21.400> intermediate<00:00:21.939> between<00:00:22.090> by<00:00:22.480> colonists

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
the intermediate between by colonists

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.290 
the intermediate between by colonists
and<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.890> TCA<00:00:24.250> cycle<00:00:24.310> so<00:00:24.910> we<00:00:24.939> have<00:00:25.119> by

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
and the TCA cycle so we have by

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.109 
and the TCA cycle so we have by
colonists<00:00:25.810> first<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.250> then<00:00:27.400> we<00:00:27.460> have<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.640> PC

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
colonists first and then we have the PC

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.470 
colonists first and then we have the PC
and<00:00:28.390> then<00:00:29.170> we<00:00:29.259> have<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.500> TCA<00:00:30.009> and<00:00:30.580> after<00:00:30.970> TCA

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
and then we have the TCA and after TCA

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.810 
and then we have the TCA and after TCA
we<00:00:32.320> have<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.590> electron<00:00:33.160> chapter<00:00:33.520> of<00:00:33.610> change

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
we have the electron chapter of change

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.840 
we have the electron chapter of change
so<00:00:33.970> we're<00:00:34.120> going<00:00:34.210> to<00:00:34.270> look<00:00:34.390> at<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.660> PDC<00:00:35.140> today

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so we're going to look at the PDC today

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.880 
so we're going to look at the PDC today
so<00:00:36.850> what<00:00:37.540> is<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.720> PDC<00:00:38.140> that<00:00:38.350> they<00:00:38.530> have<00:00:38.650> two

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
so what is the PDC that they have two

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
so what is the PDC that they have two
goals<00:00:39.160> for<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.430> PDC<00:00:40.320> which<00:00:41.320> is<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.860> break<00:00:42.070> down

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
goals for the PDC which is to break down

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.110 
goals for the PDC which is to break down
pyruvate<00:00:43.660> which<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.940> three<00:00:45.940> carbon

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
pyruvate which is a three carbon

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.830 
pyruvate which is a three carbon
molecule<00:00:46.660> into<00:00:47.320> two<00:00:47.430> carbons<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.610> then<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.390> co2

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
molecule into two carbons and then a co2

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.410 
molecule into two carbons and then a co2
that's<00:00:50.800> goal<00:00:51.100> number<00:00:51.130> one<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:51.880> goal<00:00:52.300> number

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
that's goal number one and goal number

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.800 
that's goal number one and goal number
two

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
two

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.890 
two
I'm<00:00:53.110> is<00:00:53.560> to<00:00:53.740> produce<00:00:53.950> NADH<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.300> look<00:00:55.630> at<00:00:55.750> those

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
I'm is to produce NADH so look at those

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.470 
I'm is to produce NADH so look at those
two<00:00:56.140> goals<00:00:56.410> right<00:00:56.620> now<00:00:57.000> before<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.360> we

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
two goals right now before that we

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.650 
two goals right now before that we
wanted<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.810> see<00:00:59.110> after<00:00:59.740> glycolysis<00:01:00.660> so

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
wanted to see after glycolysis so

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.340 
wanted to see after glycolysis so
glycolysis<00:01:02.200> we<00:01:02.500> start<00:01:02.770> with<00:01:04.080> glucose<00:01:05.080> and

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
glycolysis we start with glucose and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.800 
glycolysis we start with glucose and
this<00:01:06.280> will<00:01:06.490> produce<00:01:06.670> two<00:01:07.240> pyruvate<00:01:07.929> to<00:01:09.810> NADH

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
this will produce two pyruvate to NADH

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.749 
this will produce two pyruvate to NADH
and<00:01:11.939> also<00:01:12.939> to<00:01:13.320> ATP<00:01:14.320> all<00:01:15.009> right<00:01:15.159> so<00:01:15.340> these<00:01:15.490> two

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
and also to ATP all right so these two

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.660 
and also to ATP all right so these two
pyruvate<00:01:16.420> will<00:01:16.570> be<00:01:16.689> shuttled<00:01:17.079> now<00:01:18.070> into<00:01:18.549> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
pyruvate will be shuttled now into the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.520 
pyruvate will be shuttled now into the
mitochondria<00:01:19.390> because<00:01:19.659> remember<00:01:19.899> glycolysis

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
mitochondria because remember glycolysis

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.090 
mitochondria because remember glycolysis
is<00:01:20.859> in<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.100> cytoplasm<00:01:21.609> so<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.409> pyruvate

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
is in the cytoplasm so this pyruvate

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.179 
is in the cytoplasm so this pyruvate
which<00:01:24.579> is<00:01:25.030> three<00:01:25.240> carbons<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.890> going<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.130> be

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
which is three carbons it's going to be

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.800 
which is three carbons it's going to be
shuttled<00:01:27.520> into<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.820> mitochondria<00:01:28.539> on

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
shuttled into the mitochondria on

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.929 
shuttled into the mitochondria on
through<00:01:29.289> a<00:01:29.350> transport<00:01:29.890> system<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.579> we<00:01:30.789> go

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
through a transport system and we go

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.760 
through a transport system and we go
into<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.240> mitochondria<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.079> now<00:01:32.319> into<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
into the mitochondria and now into the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.760 
into the mitochondria and now into the
PDC<00:01:33.429> all<00:01:34.090> right<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:34.359> we<00:01:34.509> have<00:01:34.749> right<00:01:35.469> here<00:01:35.679> we

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
PDC all right so we have right here we

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.190 
PDC all right so we have right here we
have<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.609> two<00:01:36.850> pyruvates<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.689> are<00:01:37.840> now<00:01:38.140> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
have the two pyruvates that are now the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.550 
have the two pyruvates that are now the
PDC<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.450> mitochondria<00:01:41.109> and<00:01:41.259> we'll<00:01:41.350> see

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
PDC in the mitochondria and we'll see

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.179 
PDC in the mitochondria and we'll see
how<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.429> actually<00:01:42.700> will<00:01:43.270> work<00:01:44.009> alright<00:01:45.009> so

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
how that actually will work alright so

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.200 
how that actually will work alright so
the<00:01:45.310> PC<00:01:45.819> has<00:01:46.740> three<00:01:47.740> different<00:01:48.039> parts<00:01:48.819> to<00:01:48.909> it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
the PC has three different parts to it

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.590 
the PC has three different parts to it
okay<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:50.020> it's<00:01:50.380> divided<00:01:50.979> into<00:01:51.159> e1<00:01:51.749> e2<00:01:52.749> and<00:01:53.350> e3

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
okay so it's divided into e1 e2 and e3

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.169 
okay so it's divided into e1 e2 and e3
which<00:01:55.600> are<00:01:55.749> all<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:57.159> parts<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:58.090> the

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
which are all different parts the to the

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.410 
which are all different parts the to the
PC<00:01:58.689> and<00:01:59.649> so<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.759> first<00:02:00.969> one<00:02:01.149> is<00:02:01.270> called

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
PC and so the first one is called

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.569 
PC and so the first one is called
pyruvate<00:02:02.049> dehydrogenase<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.920> second<00:02:06.310> one<00:02:06.399> is

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
pyruvate dehydrogenase the second one is

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.980 
pyruvate dehydrogenase the second one is
called<00:02:07.679> dihydrolipoyl<00:02:10.680> transacetylase

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.790 

see<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> lace<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:17.020> last<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.620> die

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
see the lace and the last one is die

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
see the lace and the last one is die
hydro<00:02:19.890> lip<00:02:20.890> oil<00:02:23.280> dehydrogenase<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:24.460> well

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
hydro lip oil dehydrogenase as well

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.280 
hydro lip oil dehydrogenase as well
right

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
right

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.280 
right
um<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> e<00:02:27.820> one<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.630> we<00:02:29.170> have

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
um and so in the e one we have we have

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.530 
um and so in the e one we have we have
different<00:02:29.620> coenzymes<00:02:30.220> within<00:02:30.700> each<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.210> these

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
different coenzymes within each of these

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.130 
different coenzymes within each of these
different<00:02:32.110> segments<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:32.830> even<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:33.340> have<00:02:33.460> TPP

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
different segments and even we have TPP

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.350 
different segments and even we have TPP

a and also nad our Co subjects so TPP in
the<00:02:56.770> poi<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.220> f<00:02:57.610> ad<00:02:57.790> are<00:02:58.240> all<00:02:58.810> prosthetic

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
the poi and f ad are all prosthetic

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.850 
the poi and f ad are all prosthetic
groups<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.870> prosthetic<00:03:01.870> group<00:03:02.080> maken

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.830 
groups and so prosthetic group maken
substrate<00:03:03.340> prosthetic<00:03:03.880> group<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.300> me<00:03:04.660> this

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
substrate prosthetic group is me this

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.370 
substrate prosthetic group is me this
covalent<00:03:05.170> bond<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.700> enzyme<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
covalent bond to the enzyme and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.710 
covalent bond to the enzyme and
consumption<00:03:09.070> is<00:03:09.250> free<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.790> interact<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
consumption is free to interact it and

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.450 
consumption is free to interact it and
move<00:03:10.930> around<00:03:11.050> okay

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
move around okay

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.610 
move around okay
so<00:03:12.790> we'll<00:03:12.940> see<00:03:13.150> what<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.660> basic<00:03:14.260> goals<00:03:14.470> of

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
so we'll see what the the basic goals of

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.530 
so we'll see what the the basic goals of
e<00:03:14.860> 1<00:03:15.130> e<00:03:15.400> 2<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:15.850> E<00:03:16.150> 3<00:03:16.180> e<00:03:16.600> 1<00:03:17.560> we'll<00:03:17.800> see<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.540> we're

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
e 1 e 2 and E 3 e 1 we'll see that we're

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.680 
e 1 e 2 and E 3 e 1 we'll see that we're
doing<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.870> decarboxylation<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:21.490> also<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:22.060> lot

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
doing a decarboxylation and also a lot

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.420 
doing a decarboxylation and also a lot
acetylation<00:03:23.650> transfer<00:03:24.370> e<00:03:25.650> 2<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.100> see<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
acetylation transfer e 2 if you see the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.860 
acetylation transfer e 2 if you see the
trends<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.790> see<00:03:27.880> ways<00:03:28.240> we<00:03:28.450> should<00:03:28.630> know<00:03:28.750> that

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
trends to see ways we should know that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.960 
trends to see ways we should know that
the<00:03:29.020> goal<00:03:29.260> will<00:03:29.440> be<00:03:29.610> trans<00:03:30.610> acetylation<00:03:31.210> ah

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the goal will be trans acetylation ah

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.960 
the goal will be trans acetylation ah
and<00:03:33.970> also<00:03:34.870> for<00:03:35.440> e3<00:03:35.590> will<00:03:36.220> see<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.580> it's<00:03:36.820> a

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
and also for e3 will see that it's a

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.680 
and also for e3 will see that it's a
regeneration<00:03:37.630> of<00:03:39.630> our<00:03:40.630> fa<00:03:41.050> d<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:43.270> also<00:03:43.420> want

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
regeneration of our fa d you also want

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.580 
regeneration of our fa d you also want
to<00:03:44.100> regenerate<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.130> dihydrolipoyl<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.660> so

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
to regenerate a dihydrolipoyl and so

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.800 
to regenerate a dihydrolipoyl and so
regeneration<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:48.460> everything<00:03:48.940> about<00:03:49.090> III

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
regeneration so everything about III

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.220 
regeneration so everything about III
just<00:03:50.020> regeneration<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.730> PDC<00:03:52.630> cycle<00:03:53.080> we<00:03:53.200> have

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
just regeneration the PDC cycle we have

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.820 
just regeneration the PDC cycle we have
pyruvate<00:03:53.860> coming<00:03:54.220> in<00:03:54.870> okay<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:55.930> pyruvate<00:03:56.590> um

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
pyruvate coming in okay so pyruvate um

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.440 
pyruvate coming in okay so pyruvate um
so<00:03:57.550> we'll<00:03:57.700> break<00:03:57.880> this<00:03:58.030> down<00:03:58.300> II<00:03:58.600> won<00:03:59.970> then<00:04:00.970> e2

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
so we'll break this down II won then e2

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.130 
so we'll break this down II won then e2
and<00:04:02.070> then<00:04:03.070> III<00:04:03.430> alright<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.450> ty<00:04:04.690> ripping<00:04:04.990> will

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
and then III alright so ty ripping will

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.680 
and then III alright so ty ripping will
come<00:04:05.320> in<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:06.400> I'll<00:04:06.610> go<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:08.410> TPP<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.880> TPP<00:04:10.480> will

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
come in and I'll go with TPP so TPP will

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.020 
come in and I'll go with TPP so TPP will
come<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:12.100> now<00:04:12.310> at<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.700> end<00:04:12.850> we'll<00:04:13.000> have

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
come in and now at the end we'll have

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.190 
come in and now at the end we'll have
TVP<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:14.020> pyruvate<00:04:14.620> attached<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:16.299> now<00:04:16.480> so

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
TVP and pyruvate attached but now so

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.020 
TVP and pyruvate attached but now so
pyruvate<00:04:17.799> looks<00:04:18.010> like<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:18.549> pyruvate

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
pyruvate looks like this so pyruvate

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.250 
pyruvate looks like this so pyruvate
look<00:04:19.209> something<00:04:19.660> similar<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:21.430> um

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
look something similar to this um

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.010 
look something similar to this um
all<00:04:24.260> right<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:25.220> pyruvate<00:04:25.480> will<00:04:26.480> get

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
all right and pyruvate will get

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.660 
all right and pyruvate will get
decarboxylated<00:04:27.890> remember<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.340> was<00:04:28.430> one<00:04:28.580> of

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
decarboxylated remember that was one of

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.910 
decarboxylated remember that was one of
our<00:04:28.790> goals<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.080> will<00:04:30.200> be<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.530> group<00:04:30.710> up

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
our goals so that will be this group up

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.160 
our goals so that will be this group up
here<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:31.490> can<00:04:31.550> imagine<00:04:31.880> now<00:04:32.660> all<00:04:32.990> we'll

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
here so if we can imagine now all we'll

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.020 
here so if we can imagine now all we'll
see<00:04:33.410> is<00:04:35.230> so<00:04:36.230> this<00:04:36.410> TVP<00:04:37.040> will<00:04:37.220> come<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:37.610> and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
see is so this TVP will come in and

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.070 
see is so this TVP will come in and
attack<00:04:38.660> right<00:04:39.170> here<00:04:39.970> bump<00:04:40.970> up<00:04:41.120> this<00:04:41.360> ketone

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
attack right here bump up this ketone

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.200 
attack right here bump up this ketone
and<00:04:42.620> then<00:04:42.860> move<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.250> down<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.700> then<00:04:43.820> bump<00:04:44.060> up

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
and then move it down and then bump up

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.720 
and then move it down and then bump up
the<00:04:44.390> co2<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.200> that's<00:04:45.350> why<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:45.730> decarboxylated

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
the co2 so that's why we decarboxylated

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.670 
the co2 so that's why we decarboxylated
and<00:04:46.940> we<00:04:47.000> also<00:04:47.150> have<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.630> acetyl<00:04:48.440> group

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
and we also have that acetyl group

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.280 
and we also have that acetyl group
transfer<00:04:49.130> all<00:04:49.700> right<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:49.970> we<00:04:50.120> we<00:04:50.540> transfer

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
transfer all right so we we transfer

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.920 
transfer all right so we we transfer
that<00:04:51.320> acetyl<00:04:51.710> group<00:04:51.830> onto<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.190> TPP<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.780> this

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
that acetyl group onto the TPP so this

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.030 
that acetyl group onto the TPP so this
is<00:04:54.050> all<00:04:54.230> you<00:04:54.560> won<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.910> now<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.360> two<00:04:56.860> we<00:04:57.860> have

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
is all you won so now you two we have

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.480 
is all you won so now you two we have
this<00:04:58.160> TPP<00:04:58.760> attached<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.660> this<00:04:59.750> alcohol<00:05:00.200> um<00:05:00.620> and

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
this TPP attached to this alcohol um and

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.100 
this TPP attached to this alcohol um and
it's<00:05:01.940> going<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.270> react<00:05:02.870> with<00:05:03.830> that<00:05:04.510> lip<00:05:05.510> oil<00:05:05.750> um

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
it's going to react with that lip oil um

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.330 
it's going to react with that lip oil um
lip<00:05:06.950> boy<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.730> it<00:05:07.880> looks<00:05:08.210> like<00:05:08.270> this<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:10.310> has

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
lip boy so it looks like this and it has

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.100 
lip boy so it looks like this and it has
some<00:05:10.760> type<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:10.970> our<00:05:11.240> group<00:05:11.450> here<00:05:11.720> it's<00:05:11.960> not

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
some type of our group here it's not

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.540 
some type of our group here it's not
important<00:05:12.560> what<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.860> is<00:05:13.010> all<00:05:13.250> we<00:05:13.370> need<00:05:13.520> to

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
important what that is all we need to

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.910 
important what that is all we need to
know<00:05:13.670> is<00:05:13.910> that<00:05:13.940> this<00:05:14.360> group<00:05:14.570> right<00:05:14.750> here<00:05:14.920> gets

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
know is that this group right here gets

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.000 
know is that this group right here gets
attacked<00:05:16.250> so<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.820> we'll<00:05:17.300> see<00:05:17.480> that<00:05:17.630> at<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.900> end

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
attacked so so we'll see that at the end

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.490 
attacked so so we'll see that at the end
we'll<00:05:19.010> have<00:05:21.730> something<00:05:22.730> like<00:05:22.850> this<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.500> this

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
we'll have something like this so this

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.070 
we'll have something like this so this
group<00:05:24.710> will<00:05:24.890> get<00:05:25.630> bumped<00:05:26.630> off<00:05:26.720> right<00:05:26.900> there

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
group will get bumped off right there

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.770 
group will get bumped off right there
that<00:05:27.260> bond<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.740> this<00:05:28.310> see<00:05:28.850> o<00:05:29.150> H<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.260> H<00:05:31.780> will

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
that bond and this see o H and H will

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.900 
that bond and this see o H and H will
get<00:05:32.900> attached<00:05:33.200> up<00:05:33.440> there<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.220> we'll<00:05:34.760> see<00:05:34.880> that

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
get attached up there and we'll see that

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.660 
get attached up there and we'll see that
the<00:05:35.120> TPP<00:05:35.750> will<00:05:35.780> will<00:05:36.320> get<00:05:36.440> reformed<00:05:36.890> and<00:05:37.220> come

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
the TPP will will get reformed and come

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.610 
the TPP will will get reformed and come
out<00:05:37.820> alright<00:05:38.480> so<00:05:38.720> now<00:05:38.840> that<00:05:38.900> we<00:05:39.140> have<00:05:39.170> this

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
out alright so now that we have this

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
out alright so now that we have this
right<00:05:40.220> here<00:05:40.280> we'll<00:05:40.970> also<00:05:41.180> see<00:05:41.600> that<00:05:41.890> as<00:05:42.890> the

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
right here we'll also see that as the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.000 
right here we'll also see that as the
the<00:05:43.880> co<00:05:44.090> ash<00:05:44.270> will<00:05:44.510> come<00:05:44.690> in<00:05:44.870> so<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:45.560> CO<00:05:45.800> ash

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
the co ash will come in so so CO ash

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.790 
the co ash will come in so so CO ash
will<00:05:46.910> come<00:05:47.210> in<00:05:47.390> and<00:05:47.690> make<00:05:47.770> acetyl<00:05:48.770> koi<00:05:49.100> oh<00:05:50.800> and

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
will come in and make acetyl koi oh and

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.550 
will come in and make acetyl koi oh and
and<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.310> will<00:05:52.430> leave<00:05:52.640> us<00:05:52.670> with<00:05:52.820> s<00:05:54.940> sh<00:05:55.940> sh

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
and that will leave us with s sh sh

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.750 
and that will leave us with s sh sh
something<00:05:57.560> like<00:05:57.680> that<00:05:57.890> right<00:05:58.070> so<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.460> co<00:05:58.610> ash

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
something like that right so the co ash

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.150 
something like that right so the co ash
comes<00:05:59.030> in<00:05:59.240> and<00:05:59.450> attacks<00:05:59.930> right<00:06:00.350> here<00:06:00.650> this

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
comes in and attacks right here this

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.130 
comes in and attacks right here this
whole<00:06:01.430> group<00:06:01.640> by<00:06:01.790> here<00:06:02.030> will<00:06:02.180> now<00:06:02.330> form<00:06:02.660> acetyl

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
whole group by here will now form acetyl

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.260 
whole group by here will now form acetyl
co<00:06:03.320> a<00:06:03.350> because<00:06:03.830> we'll<00:06:04.400> see<00:06:04.580> that<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.910> Oh<00:06:05.090> H

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
co a because we'll see that the Oh H

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.000 
co a because we'll see that the Oh H
will<00:06:05.450> come<00:06:05.660> down<00:06:05.870> and<00:06:06.170> make<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.320> ketone<00:06:06.770> again

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
will come down and make a ketone again

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.010 
will come down and make a ketone again
and<00:06:07.220> make<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.520> acetyl<00:06:07.880> group<00:06:08.090> which<00:06:08.750> will<00:06:08.930> be

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
and make the acetyl group which will be

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.710 
and make the acetyl group which will be
attached<00:06:09.350> to<00:06:09.380> Co<00:06:09.770> a<00:06:09.800> right<00:06:10.070> there<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:10.520> so<00:06:11.060> whoa

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
attached to Co a right there and so whoa

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.230 
attached to Co a right there and so whoa
for<00:06:12.260> e3<00:06:12.440> we<00:06:12.890> need<00:06:13.040> to<00:06:13.190> reform<00:06:13.550> everything<00:06:14.030> so

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
for e3 we need to reform everything so

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.570 
for e3 we need to reform everything so
if<00:06:14.390> you<00:06:14.480> want<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:14.750> reform<00:06:15.110> back<00:06:15.950> into<00:06:16.310> this<00:06:16.460> SS

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
if you want to reform back into this SS

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.570 
if you want to reform back into this SS
like<00:06:19.580> that<00:06:20.050> all<00:06:21.050> right<00:06:21.230> all<00:06:21.530> we<00:06:21.890> need<00:06:22.040> to<00:06:22.070> do<00:06:22.310> is

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
like that all right all we need to do is

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.740 
like that all right all we need to do is
use<00:06:23.000> FA<00:06:23.360> d<00:06:23.680> fa<00:06:24.680> D<00:06:24.830> will<00:06:24.980> go<00:06:25.100> to<00:06:25.160> fadh2<00:06:25.750> because

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
use FA d fa D will go to fadh2 because

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.200 
use FA d fa D will go to fadh2 because
we<00:06:26.960> are<00:06:27.080> trying<00:06:27.500> to<00:06:27.850> oxidize<00:06:28.850> this

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
we are trying to oxidize this

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.840 
we are trying to oxidize this
dihydrolipoyl<00:06:30.370> lysine<00:06:31.420> into<00:06:32.420> the<00:06:32.930> lip<00:06:33.140> boy<00:06:33.290> we

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
dihydrolipoyl lysine into the lip boy we

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.330 
dihydrolipoyl lysine into the lip boy we
use

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
use

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.900 
use
d<00:06:35.540> as<00:06:36.560> oxidizing<00:06:37.560> agent<00:06:38.010> and<00:06:38.100> it<00:06:38.340> gets<00:06:38.550> reduced

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
d as oxidizing agent and it gets reduced

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.270 
d as oxidizing agent and it gets reduced
so<00:06:39.240> it<00:06:39.360> gets<00:06:39.480> rid<00:06:39.630> rid<00:06:39.870> it<00:06:40.620> gets<00:06:40.770> reduced<00:06:41.100> to

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
so it gets rid rid it gets reduced to

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.129 
so it gets rid rid it gets reduced to
fadh2<00:06:41.690> but<00:06:42.690> in<00:06:43.020> order<00:06:43.290> to<00:06:43.350> reform<00:06:44.040> this<00:06:44.190> fadh2

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
fadh2 but in order to reform this fadh2

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.700 
fadh2 but in order to reform this fadh2
2f<00:06:46.139> ad<00:06:46.350> we're<00:06:47.070> going<00:06:47.190> to<00:06:47.250> use<00:06:47.370> nad<00:06:47.940> and<00:06:48.590> it<00:06:49.590> will

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
2f ad we're going to use nad and it will

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.250 
2f ad we're going to use nad and it will
go<00:06:49.830> into<00:06:49.949> NADH<00:06:50.669> okay<00:06:51.240> so<00:06:51.389> we<00:06:51.720> see<00:06:51.930> that<00:06:52.050> our

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
go into NADH okay so we see that our

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.590 
go into NADH okay so we see that our
first<00:06:52.710> goal<00:06:52.949> was<00:06:53.130> to<00:06:53.280> reform<00:06:53.699> this<00:06:54.180> is<00:06:54.240> a<00:06:54.449> boy

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
first goal was to reform this is a boy

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.960 
first goal was to reform this is a boy
and<00:06:54.900> then<00:06:55.320> our<00:06:55.470> second<00:06:55.889> goal<00:06:56.010> was<00:06:56.190> to<00:06:56.340> reform<00:06:56.729> F

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
and then our second goal was to reform F

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.560 
and then our second goal was to reform F
ad<00:06:57.180> final<00:06:58.139> product<00:06:58.639> when<00:06:59.639> we<00:06:59.790> get<00:06:59.970> out<00:07:00.090> of<00:07:00.120> this

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
ad final product when we get out of this

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.890 
ad final product when we get out of this
so<00:07:00.900> the<00:07:01.169> pyruvate<00:07:01.880> was<00:07:02.880> our<00:07:03.030> starting<00:07:03.419> product

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
so the pyruvate was our starting product

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.219 
so the pyruvate was our starting product
so<00:07:04.169> we<00:07:04.260> had<00:07:04.380> two<00:07:04.590> pyruvate<00:07:05.160> to<00:07:05.190> begin<00:07:05.610> with<00:07:06.229> now

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
so we had two pyruvate to begin with now

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.640 
so we had two pyruvate to begin with now
we're<00:07:07.470> going<00:07:07.560> to<00:07:07.620> end<00:07:07.860> up<00:07:08.100> with<00:07:08.900> two<00:07:09.900> NADH

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
we're going to end up with two NADH

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:17.090 
we're going to end up with two NADH
and<00:07:11.419> also<00:07:12.419> two<00:07:12.479> acetyl<00:07:13.440> co<00:07:13.830> a<00:07:15.620> also<00:07:16.620> is<00:07:16.979> the

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
and also two acetyl co a also is the

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.719 
and also two acetyl co a also is the
byproduct<00:07:17.400> we're<00:07:17.700> going<00:07:17.820> to<00:07:17.880> have<00:07:18.090> co2<00:07:18.710> um<00:07:19.729> and

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729
