00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
up here and show you what all comes with
it<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.440> front<00:00:43.739> plate<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
believe that is the left side the right

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.760 
believe that is the left side the right
side<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.719> hard<00:00:55.530> drive

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
side and you get one for the hard drive

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.729 
side and you get one for the hard drive
I<00:00:56.690> have<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:57.840> xbox<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.250> will<00:00:59.399> start<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
I have my xbox here and I will start to

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
I have my xbox here and I will start to
apply<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:03.420> most<00:01:03.570> likely<00:01:03.899> just

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
apply this and I all most likely just

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020 
apply this and I all most likely just
fast-forward<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.549> speed<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> up

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
fast-forward all of this or speed it up

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.420 
fast-forward all of this or speed it up

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
know not get as many bubbles putting it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.840 
know not get as many bubbles putting it
on<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:26.600> is<00:02:26.840> one<00:02:27.170> side<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.890> looks<00:02:28.130> very<00:02:28.310> nice

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
on that is one side it looks very nice

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.560 
on that is one side it looks very nice
that<00:02:29.510> one<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:29.810> very<00:02:30.110> easy<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.010> time<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:32.209> the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
that one on very easy so time to do the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.530 
that one on very easy so time to do the
other<00:02:32.840> side<00:02:33.170> again<00:02:33.830> for<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.370> side<00:02:34.640> which<00:02:35.209> i

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
other side again for this side which i

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.850 
other side again for this side which i
guess<00:02:35.900> there'd<00:02:36.110> be<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.470> right<00:02:36.650> side

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
guess there'd be like the right side

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.140 
guess there'd be like the right side
depending<00:02:37.010> on<00:02:37.310> which<00:02:37.430> way<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.610> looking<00:02:37.910> at<00:02:38.030> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
depending on which way you looking at it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.810 
depending on which way you looking at it
use<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.170> one<00:02:39.260> has<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> cutout<00:02:39.890> edge<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:40.730> you

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
use the one has the cutout edge so you

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.330 
use the one has the cutout edge so you
can<00:02:41.300> put<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.800> back<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.310> can

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
can put back here in the back you can

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:54.670 
can put back here in the back you can
see<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.090> needs<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.600> cut<00:02:44.840> up<00:02:44.930> edge<00:02:53.680> and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
see that it needs to cut up edge and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.949 
see that it needs to cut up edge and
again<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.370> went<00:02:55.489> on<00:02:55.580> very<00:02:55.820> smooth<00:02:56.239> looks<00:02:56.750> great

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
again it went on very smooth looks great

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.020 
again it went on very smooth looks great
and<00:02:57.290> now<00:02:57.920> I'm<00:02:58.070> going<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.280> do<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.519> faceplate

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
and now I'm going to do the faceplate

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.050 
and now I'm going to do the faceplate
for<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.420> faceplate<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.170> would<00:03:00.410> suggest<00:03:01.060> that

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
for the faceplate I would suggest that

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.970 
for the faceplate I would suggest that
you<00:03:02.390> take<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.810> off<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.709> can<00:03:03.860> work

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
you take it off so that you can work

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:15.460 
you take it off so that you can work
with<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.160> easier
