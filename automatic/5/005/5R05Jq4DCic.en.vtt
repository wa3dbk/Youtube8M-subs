00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.750
 instagram bought by facebook as the 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.920
 flexible fangs of samsung is an iphone 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.300
 5 in october 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.300
 hello to all and the franchise of the day 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.960
 mark zuckerberg announced it himself on 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.940
 his wall facebook has just bought 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960
 instagram for a value estimated at a 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.369
 billion dollars 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.110
 why such a price for a 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.120
 application released a year and a half ago 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.489
 and whose company has only 14 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.680
 employees first to get ahead of 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.210
 competitors twitter or google would have 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.580
 very well could bought the start-up 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.739
 facebook was therefore the fastest 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.879
 then to protect against the site 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.070
 who is exhibiting right now 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.110
 pinto remains its growth scares to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.160
 facebook and bought instagram could 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.910
 allow him to curb this 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.220
 growth 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.350
 finally facebook could integrate the 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.059
 advertising in instagram and its 5 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.010
 millions of photos published every day 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.600
 it would thus reach 30 million 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.640
 of users already addicted to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.350
 the mobile application and that would continue 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.790
 probably to use instagram 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.560
 even if it integrates a stream 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.479
 advertising and reactions 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.550
 instagram users were fast 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.200
 tens of thousands of black images 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.030
 have come to greet the death of 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.190
 the independence of the application of his 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.470
 kevin side six dresses the boss of the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.250
 start up said he was obviously delighted 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.170
 this operation 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
 the one who had been trainee in 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.920
 the team that had created twitter had 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.520
 also refused a job offer from 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.570
 Facebook 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.570
 a few months ago 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.940
 the company is in shape right now 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.010
 well samsung the Korean company comes 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.170
 to announce record profits especially 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.910
 supported by its smart phone business 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.350
 but samsung innovates in several 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.240
 areas and just presented a 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.729
 new product that will undoubtedly 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.400
 make a lot of noise this is yum 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.770
 yum is an unprecedented technology that 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.229
 only samsung seems to master that of 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.000
 totally flexible oled screens this 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.710
 incredibly product is no longer the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.360
 all at the prototype stage since 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.970
 Samsung launched a mass production 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.860
 a month ago no device using 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.720
 youm has not been announced yet but if the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.429
 production is on the way it's probably 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.140
 that samsung is getting ready to make a 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.920
 announcement that would undoubtedly 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.920
 deafening 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.659
 new rumor around the iphone 5 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.730
 apple would already be testing a 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.420
 prototype of his next smartphone to 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.730
 cupertino 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.859
 probably in case this prototype would 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.230
 he too forgot in a bar this likely 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.900
 iphone 5 would be concealed in a hull 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.349
 iphone 4s inside however the at 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.750
 5x ipad processor 3 and 1 gigabyte 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.609
 ram a second rumor reports all 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.989
 new design and larger screen 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.629
 4 inches 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.129
 we thus evoke the unibody shell so 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.620
 cut in one block 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.209
 exactly like the macbook pro finally 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.950
 an official announcement will be made to 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.199
 the month of October as was the case 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.239
 for iphone 4s as usual 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.819
 these rumors are to be taken with 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.469
 tweezers previous affiliates for 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.780
