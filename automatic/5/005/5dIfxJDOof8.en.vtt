00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.119
 hello very good engineer bill we are 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.160
 in part 4 of the zombie guide that 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.490
 we emphasize by the title is to improve the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.410
 bus and the bus has three pieces 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.230
 which can come out in four zones 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.699
 of the map we have to use the turbine 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.940
 the first as you see would be in the 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.370
 first zone equal let's give this 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.899
 we open here 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.850
 if there will be some day we open 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.620
 we entered and here would be the first piece 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.480
 what there are times that comes to us because 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 as there are three pieces and there are four places 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 where they can go out randomly 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.570
 there are times here in the first 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 room we get is not normal 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.890
 usually it's usually a piece here in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.129
 the first room I'm seeing that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.420
 that has come to me now when it reaches the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.420
 area of ​​the pieces 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.399
 well as you can see, we are still looking for 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.619
 bus parts we are in the 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.250
 gas station the second part of the 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.170
 second stop of the circuit we are here 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 we take our turbine which already 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.740
 we did in the first video that you can 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.930
 insisted that the most important thing was 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.630
 turbine we enter here and we have the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 first piece is already good in the first 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.720
 site has not come out is random from 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.280
 now I have touched the front 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.869
 of the bus I could have touched the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.990
 staircase I could have touched the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.299
 trapdoor there are three pieces and it is random 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.149
 the four places the piece that comes out does not 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.710
 it will always be the same in each place 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.659
 these are already random they are not 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.520
 like that of the turbine than that of the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 Turbine always goes hungry always 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.390
 they come out in the same area 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.189
 to this one just reaching up and pulling 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.009
 a grenade I'm just arrived from this 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.020
 the stop as you see the mill farm 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.590
 as you want to call him we will come 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.590
 here we open that also we are worth 750 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.720
 and we come here 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.299
 and here we would have the third for 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.909
 third or second part of the bus in my 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.860
 case that is the trapdoor trapdoor 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.770
 and bacteria said one thing and here they are 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.930
 which we see that we exclude it because if 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.790
 you have a group of 20 or more zombies coges 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.090
 strips one we believe you put it in front of your 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.330
 mouth and already die as 20 points as 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.730
 better is some lame but 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.010
 this enough cousins ​​are devastating 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.570
 I say, you do not have that, you go around and around 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.180
 you have a lot of zombie compadre 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.010
 one strips we believe and die very many 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.470
 as we have seen I already say this is the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.510
 trapdoor that can also be put 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.220
 you have seen the first piece of post 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.720
 to take care of yourself this can be put here in 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.960
 this part of the bus that is where I'm going to 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.960
 put 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.190
 or it can be put in the gas station but 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.630
 and that'll show in the next and 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.180
 you have seen 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.700
 is this part so now I'm going to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.440
 put next 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.209
 ok I'm at the stop of the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.129
 electricity that this more than anything 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.480
 machine and piece for the bus but I'm going 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.730
 to teach a trick before it 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.560
 I go here now you will see more 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.349
 ahead there is right in that corner it 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.910
 he puts on he gets the ladder to 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.950
 be able to climb to the top by 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.420
 this side on that side of the bus and the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.640
 trick of the thing is that if 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.190
 we had the bus here without the staircase 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.140
 is outside we could not give the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.239
 turn around and pick up and enter some of the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.549
 electricity or flip the map 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.900
 to try to escape from the zombies 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.209
 we would be blocked by the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.739
 bus because we could not pass because 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.599
 the car is from the van of this 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.640
 there is here the bus is blocking us like this 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.069
 and would not let us pass but I say 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.870
 having the ladder that yes yes that 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.340
 it can happen no problem can be 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.260
 get on the bus part back 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.870
 jump over here you go back to put the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.620
 another turn and you run away I'm already in the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.930
 town to catch the last piece of the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.810
 bus that we do with the bus 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.489
 we would arrive here we take jump from 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.880
 up and we come here or open the 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.850
 bank door 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.490
 Anyway, with this we come so that as 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.730
 we want we ask 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.830
 our turbine and open the sown 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.920
 Mother 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.360
 well adjusted to dig the turbine not 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.370
 I'm looking forward to giving you all the 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.340
 back and have it to teach but good 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.260
 it's the same the same system we take 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.230
 we open there 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.250
 with the turbine we enter and inside it will be 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.650
 will be the missing piece if you are 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.200
 I do not like the first one went forth 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.729
 the last hour we will have here that good 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.740
 you can not see but if the last one is there 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.419
 and then well I say we take the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.210
 last piece that in my case would be the 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.520
 staircase and we put it where it has been 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.770
 taught before the back right 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.479
 of the hands the back of the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.460
 bus that you have seen and here 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.740
 between also she looks at gypsum azulillo 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.659
 there are the grenades that stick 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.099
 lullabies that hook in case someone 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.710
 I want to buy them because you already know 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.360
 also lullabies that hook 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.979
 are there then not these would all be 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.979
 the parts of the bus 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:08.329
 even in the four places where they can 

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:10.789
 go out as I said there they can leave 

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:13.069
 to naturally never come out in the same 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.289
 site there are times you can get lucky 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:19.089
 that the pieces come out 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.089
 There are times when you have no luck 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.490
 no no
