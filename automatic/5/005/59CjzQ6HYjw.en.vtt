you you won't be able to throw it far to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.279 
you you won't be able to throw it far to

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
them like if they're on the ground you

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.320 
them like if they're on the ground you
can't<00:02:08.500> chuck<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.979> more<00:02:09.160> than<00:02:09.310> 16<00:02:09.789> blocks<00:02:10.090> to

can't chuck it more than 16 blocks to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.870 
can't chuck it more than 16 blocks to

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
them also if they are higher than 12

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.700 
them also if they are higher than 12
blocks<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.690> can't<00:02:13.930> throw<00:02:14.140> any<00:02:14.380> higher<00:02:14.530> than

that

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.949 
that
so<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.489> doesn't<00:02:15.819> make<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.360> best

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
so it doesn't make it the best

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.559 
so it doesn't make it the best
kit<00:02:17.170> for<00:02:17.739> taking<00:02:18.099> out<00:02:18.219> towers<00:02:18.670> because<00:02:19.390> if

kit for taking out towers because if

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.300 
kit for taking out towers because if
they're<00:02:19.780> any<00:02:19.900> higher<00:02:20.170> than<00:02:20.379> 12<00:02:20.590> blocks<00:02:20.799> which

they're any higher than 12 blocks which
most<00:02:21.819> towers<00:02:22.209> are<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.810> makes<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> little

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
most towers are it makes it a little

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.729 
most towers are it makes it a little
difficult<00:02:24.040> but<00:02:24.849> it<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.319> affect<00:02:26.319> how<00:02:26.469> high<00:02:26.680> you

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
difficult but it can affect how high you

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.830 
difficult but it can affect how high you
need<00:02:27.159> to<00:02:27.370> tower<00:02:27.549> up<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.790> get<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.239> them<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.689> also

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
need to tower up to get to them we also

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.479 
need to tower up to get to them we also
need<00:02:29.109> to<00:02:29.200> be<00:02:29.319> careful<00:02:29.650> about<00:02:29.739> pulling<00:02:30.159> people

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
need to be careful about pulling people

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.920 
need to be careful about pulling people
who<00:02:30.640> you're<00:02:30.849> trying<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.299> get<00:02:31.450> away<00:02:31.540> from

who you're trying to get away from
towards<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.739> because<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.310> could<00:02:33.549> do<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.849> on

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
towards you because you could do that on

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.509 
towards you because you could do that on
accident<00:02:34.689> if<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.680> reflex<00:02:35.859> move<00:02:36.310> and

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
accident if it's just a reflex move and

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.709 
accident if it's just a reflex move and
you<00:02:36.579> pull<00:02:36.760> them<00:02:36.939> in<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.299> then<00:02:37.389> they<00:02:37.510> could

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
you pull them in and then they could

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.569 
you pull them in and then they could
kill<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.230> way<00:02:38.349> also<00:02:38.829> be<00:02:39.069> careful<00:02:39.430> about

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
kill you that way also be careful about

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.490 
kill you that way also be careful about
pulling<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.120> mobs<00:02:40.359> like<00:02:40.659> creepers<00:02:41.109> towards

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
pulling in mobs like creepers towards

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.679 
pulling in mobs like creepers towards
you<00:02:41.590> because<00:02:41.829> they<00:02:41.980> can<00:02:42.159> explode<00:02:42.879> pretty<00:02:43.420> much

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
you because they can explode pretty much

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.780 
you because they can explode pretty much
instantly<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:45.219> can<00:02:45.400> find<00:02:45.670> yourself

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
instantly and then you can find yourself

instantly and then you can find yourself
being<00:02:46.239> killed<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.659> way<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:47.500> also<00:02:47.620> need<00:02:47.950> to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
being killed that way you also need to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
being killed that way you also need to
