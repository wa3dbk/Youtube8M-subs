00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
something I should point out just to

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.350 
something I should point out just to
make<00:00:30.380> you<00:00:30.560> all<00:00:30.590> rush<00:00:31.070> out<00:00:31.250> and<00:00:31.369> buy<00:00:31.520> one<00:00:31.550> is

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
machine connoisseurs - BMW will notice

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.930 
machine connoisseurs - BMW will notice
immediately<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.579> only<00:00:43.730> one

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
immediately that this is the only one

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.210 
immediately that this is the only one
that<00:00:44.120> doesn't<00:00:44.239> employ<00:00:44.630> a<00:00:44.660> shaft<00:00:45.020> drive

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
that doesn't employ a shaft drive

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.710 
that doesn't employ a shaft drive
instead<00:00:46.220> there's<00:00:46.670> an<00:00:46.760> o-ring<00:00:46.880> chain<00:00:47.329> which<00:00:47.540> is

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
instead there's an o-ring chain which is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.479 
instead there's an o-ring chain which is
probably<00:00:48.350> more<00:00:48.500> logical<00:00:48.980> on<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:49.220> type<00:00:49.460> of

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
probably more logical on this type of

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.110 
probably more logical on this type of

it's<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:56.870> 5-speed<00:00:57.410> gearbox<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.100> that's

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
it's a 5-speed gearbox and that's

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.250 
it's a 5-speed gearbox and that's
actually<00:00:58.430> housed<00:00:58.790> within<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.600> same<00:00:59.809> lump<00:01:00.050> and
