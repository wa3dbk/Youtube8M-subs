00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.300
 besides the standard shooting positions 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.520
 standing with knee down 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.890
 from a machine gun and a pistol that I am with my hand 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.450
 there are also derivative positions 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.720
 for shooting 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.309
 which is used when leaving the line 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.940
 aiming 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:49.900
 the first position is the position from the knees to 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.900
 two hands 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.200
 or with one hand 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:11.540
 the next position is with a lunge to the right 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.810
 or left exactly the same with two hands and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.810
 one hand 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:42.460
 and intermediate lying position with 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.680
 rolling like two hands can 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.720
 used this position for 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.720
 firing well with one hand 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.789
 as well as sitting position it is used 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 most often during the transition 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.870
 for shooting from a prone position 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.750
 both with two hands and one hand 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.720
 in combat except 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.030
 position standards for perry for 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.920
 firing prone with knee and stand out 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.360
 which on which we are with you 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.360
 met a little earlier 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.240
 can still be applied and the intermediate 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.970
 firing position at line entrances 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:03:01.670
 enemy fire for example with a lunge 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:01.670
 your right then left with the board 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.890
 from the knees with the transition you yard false 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.890
 rolling 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.069
 moreover, all these elements among themselves with 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.400
 movement can be interconnected in a single 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.909
 whole and promote care arrow with 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.799
 line of fire that will prevent it 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.799
 defeat 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.799
 opponents
