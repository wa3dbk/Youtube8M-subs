00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.280
 Greetings from the modest cuisine 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.760
 In this section, more renewed in the Aegean region ... 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.360
 we'll share a nice recipe, "Bean with Spinach" 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.880
 But before the materials 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.120
 2 cup dry beans 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.120
 1 small bunch of spinach 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.080
 2 pieces of medium onion 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 1 tablespoon of tomato paste 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 1 big tea cup of olive oil 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.880
 we learned the necessary ingredients for beans with spinach 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.800
 we used to dry beans soaked in cold water 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.200
 remained in cold water for about 9 hours 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.600
 and a lot of swelling 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 Let's go to the fire to fry it now 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.800
 we would like to boil in the pressure cooker to be quicker 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.840
 the dried beans we soaked with water in a pot 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.960
 and closing the lid 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.680
 after the pin is cut and cook for 10 minutes 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.200
 If we hadn't wetted for 35 minutes 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.400
 Let's keep chopping the onions while the beans are boiling 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.320
 We said we have 2 medium-sized onions. 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.760
 one big enough 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.440
 Let's go near the saucepan to roast 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 let's transfer the beans to the backyard 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.880
 let's put another pot on the front 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.040
 and olive oil 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.080
 finely chopped onions 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.240
 and let it ripen until it becomes transparent 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.600
 onion roasted while we continue chopping spinach 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.640
 spinach 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 stalk 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.720
 we can expand a little more when it comes to leaves 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 spinach 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.000
 Let's finish the chopping process by chopping garlics 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.880
 we added the garlics on the spinach 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.000
 and we go to the stove to combine with onion 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.920
 Our onions are beautiful 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.200
 Let's take the paste now 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.440
 let's turn 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.440
 in the meantime we can add salt 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.360
 now spinach and garlic 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.640
 you know that spinach is cooked very quickly 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 we'll sub-top 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.720
 and we will cover the lid, we will cook for 10 minutes 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.520
 in the meantime, the pin came out, the fire was cut, the bean was also boiled 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.720
 now we add the beans we filter 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.200
 we're lower-top 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.960
 not too much, add some hot water 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.240
 and we're cooking with a lid 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 baked beans with spinach 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.960
 now we're closing the lid, we're cooling in the pan for half an hour 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.320
 After half an hour 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.760
 dried beans with spinach 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.280
 Now is the service time 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.280
 we open the cover ... 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
 currently warm 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.760
 cold 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.840
 As you can see, the construction of "Dry Bean with Spinach" is not difficult at all 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.440
 I wish you to try this recipe and remember Humble Flavors 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.400
 Goodbye sir ...
