 devices and a smart watch too 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.710
 As you can see, there are many products like this 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 which is almost impossible to show them in a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.160
 just video so this time we're going 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.960
 to be doing the realized of this 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.910

 samsung htc lg nokia motorola and lenovo y 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.680
 well I'm going to try to connect it with 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 my iphone 6 plus so let's see if 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.710
 it works for me but for the time being 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 can see works with a great 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 variety of devices and brands in 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.180
 the back we have some 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.010
 specific 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 the techniques among the most remarkable 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.240
 I can tell you that it gives us up to 500 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.590
 load cycles and good between 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 recommendations I also owe them 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 say that you have to charge so 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.810
 less once every three months although not 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 what have you used this is for 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 preserve the life of the product I think that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 Among the technical specifications is 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.070
 the most important to highlight so 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.240
 well without more or more I will have 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.240
 take it out of this package 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.899
 then we have here our 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.329
 charger and of course all your 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.049
 accessories and let me tell you what is 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.700
 of 4,800 thousand perez is quite large 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.950
 so it's perfectly going to allow us 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.929
 load two or more devices at the same time 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 has a comfortable size is not very large 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.069
 but he's not a kid either, as you can see 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.079
 we have here what is the solar panel and 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.000
 of course the led indicators that go 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.369
 in the part above here is from 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.319
 metal and with slightly heavy plastic 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.810
 it's not good enough either 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.340
 show them here the back such 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.829
 time you do not reach it to notice but 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.140
 here tells us the capacity that is 4800 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.269
 million but has two departures lieuwe 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.730
 see one with voltage of 2 and one with 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.310
 voltage of 1 and in addition we have here another 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.930
 5 volt micro usb jack that also 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.060
 will help us connect some 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.799
 device and good an indicator here 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.540
 to know when the device is 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.879
 find already loaded I want to show you 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.220
 the accessories comes with a usb cable 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.290
 that will help us connect the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.750
 different accessories we have here the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.879
 cable and we have accessories we are going to 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.099
 get them out of here and we have here a 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.500
 micro usb accessory we also have a 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.710
 accessory for the devices 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.110
 samsung another accessory for another type of 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.270
 phones and of course the accessory 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.800
 for what is the devices it 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.370
 applies mentally does not come with a 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.570
 lighting 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 but well let's see if we can 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.470
 connect what is the lighting cable and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.510
 see if we load our device 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.580
 I have here my charger for the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.310
 iphone 6 plus so I'm going to connect it 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.350
 in this part I will connect it in the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.990
 of less voltage directly with the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.050
 usb cable I will bring my devices already 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.810
 I have it here and I'm going to connect it 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.380
 let's put it on this side and let's 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.380
 turn on 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.130
 and as you can see it works perfectly 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.200
 with the cable so we can charge 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.820
 our device without any problem 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.500
 now let's see if we can connect 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.510
 another device to load it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.980
 simultaneously we will use the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.240
 cable that include us we are going to 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.150
 connect it on the top 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.870
 let's connect now what is the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.180
 adapter for samsung 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.720
 and I'll put here again we will 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.720
 connect it 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.500
 and it's supposed to be loading there like 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.660
 can see so it works 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.390
 perfectly and I'm loading two 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.530
 devices at a time as you can see 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.840
 here it tells us that they are loading 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.370
 correctly the devices the truth 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.590
 is that I think it's great that we can 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.629
 charge our two devices to the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.670
 Once I would even connect the iPad but 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.440
 I think it would be too much however 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.629
 I'm sure we could also 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.730
 charge at the same time as it sells 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.920
 this product is quite interesting is 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.629
 highly recommended so imagine in 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.209
 an emergency can bring this to all 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.310
 sides and also very important is solar 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.019
 you do not need to connect it to light so 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.669
 you will be able to have it available in 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.959
