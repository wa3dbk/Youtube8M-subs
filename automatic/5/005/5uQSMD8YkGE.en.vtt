00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.979
 the report points to the misuse of alternative energy from 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 half of what is consumed could come from renewable sources 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.959
 but two of this indicator is only 13% bad for the economy the theme of the class 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.959
 the monetary fund is heating the soil 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.289
 plastic plates 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.810
 the device has a capacity of up to 250 liters of water 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.039
 the human cost three hundred reais 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.109
 sr energy revolution 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.779
 inside home 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.720
 can be much more efficient than the next class says 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.670
 I think it is expected for the future right now and in seminars and the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.940
 society wants 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 Brazil needs 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.470
 at the state university of rio de janeiro students and teachers of the course of 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.500
 physics 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 the text received health as a jeca 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.590
 just have boxes of milk pet bottles is ready a new heated 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.010
 the water temperature can reach 50 degrees Celsius 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 will remain for what cement of the water but also for power 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.940
 the lighting domination a home the customer you actually gain the impact 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.130
 environment that you let provoke in the city where you live 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.380
 more than one million such systems are used in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.289
 developing countries in this center of Rio de Janeiro. 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.330
 two months adopted solar collector 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.240
 the light bill has already dropped 40% spent a sunny day 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.790
 is that you have hot water is that day morning team had day 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.040
 people take such work according to the report made by the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.840
 greenpeace 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.490
 organization that studies environmental issues' half of the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.759
 energy consumed in the world 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.190
 could be generated 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.410
 by alternative sources but currently only 13% of world energy demand 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.980
 come from these chains we have to start thinking in other ways 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.000
 an economically prosperous society is socially just and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.640
 environmentally responsible
