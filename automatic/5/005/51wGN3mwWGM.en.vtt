that's<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> could<00:00:49.050> build<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.149> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that's all I could build and it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
that's all I could build and it's
actually<00:00:51.329> gonna<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.750> bigger<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.559> more
