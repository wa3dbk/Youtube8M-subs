my<00:00:23.550> attraction<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.359> seashell<00:00:24.839> is<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
my attraction to this seashell is that

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.529 
my attraction to this seashell is that
it's<00:00:25.439> emphasizing<00:00:26.339> the<00:00:26.759> form<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.509> shape

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it's emphasizing the form and the shape

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.749 
it's emphasizing the form and the shape
and<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> texture<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.499> the<00:00:28.769> interior<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.429> this

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
and the texture of the interior of this

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.259 
and the texture of the interior of this
shell

shell

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.210 
shell
let's<00:00:30.749> take<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> look<00:00:31.289> I've<00:00:31.740> got<00:00:32.009> my<00:00:32.160> two

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
let's take a look I've got my two

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.040 
let's take a look I've got my two
hundred<00:00:32.640> millimeter<00:00:33.000> macro<00:00:33.240> lens<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.840> which

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
hundred millimeter macro lens on which

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.530 
hundred millimeter macro lens on which
allows<00:00:34.320> me<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.560> focus<00:00:34.740> remarkably<00:00:35.580> close<00:00:35.940> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
allows me to focus remarkably close in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
allows me to focus remarkably close in
this<00:00:36.750> case<00:00:36.960> about<00:00:37.260> half<00:00:37.560> life-size<00:00:38.130> I'm<00:00:38.550> going

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this case about half life-size I'm going

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.120 
this case about half life-size I'm going
to<00:00:39.210> choose<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.510> aperture<00:00:39.810> of<00:00:40.050> 22<00:00:40.560> in<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.890> case

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
to choose an aperture of 22 in this case

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.730 
to choose an aperture of 22 in this case
simply<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.780> need<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.170> little<00:00:43.530> more

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
simply because I need a little more

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.590 
simply because I need a little more
depth<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> field<00:00:44.340> than<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.180> were<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> shoot

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
depth of field than if I were to shoot

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900 
depth of field than if I were to shoot
this<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.930> 8<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.170> 11<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.490> I<00:00:47.520> call

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
this at 8 or 11 this is not what I call

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
this at 8 or 11 this is not what I call
a<00:00:48.150> who<00:00:48.510> cares<00:00:48.840> where<00:00:49.020> everything's<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
a who cares where everything's at the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
a who cares where everything's at the
same<00:00:49.620> focus<00:00:49.890> distance<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> fact

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
same focus distance because in fact

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
same focus distance because in fact
there's<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> ridges<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.440> being

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
there's like ridges that are being

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.730 
there's like ridges that are being
exposed<00:00:53.190> almost<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.210> mountaintops<00:00:54.810> to<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
exposed almost like mountaintops to a to

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.070 
exposed almost like mountaintops to a to
a<00:00:55.770> degree<00:00:55.950> that<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> macro<00:00:57.150> lens<00:00:57.330> reveals<00:00:57.780> as

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
a degree that the macro lens reveals as

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.710 
a degree that the macro lens reveals as
we<00:00:58.200> get<00:00:58.350> closer<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.830> closer<00:00:59.040> so<00:00:59.670> I'm<00:00:59.910> at<00:01:00.060> f-22

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
we get closer and closer so I'm at f-22

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.690 
we get closer and closer so I'm at f-22
and<00:01:00.960> adjust<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.500> aperture<00:01:01.860> excuse<00:01:02.310> me<00:01:02.430> adjust

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
and adjust my aperture excuse me adjust

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.200 
and adjust my aperture excuse me adjust
my<00:01:02.820> shutter<00:01:03.090> speed<00:01:03.439> until<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:05.090> sixtieth<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.120> a
