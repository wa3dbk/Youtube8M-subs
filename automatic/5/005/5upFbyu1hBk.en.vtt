yes ps3 and other consoles will get
horses<00:01:55.550> eventually<00:01:56.550> now<00:01:56.970> you're<00:01:57.150> probably

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
horses eventually now you're probably

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.730 
horses eventually now you're probably
sitting<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.720> wondering<00:01:57.990> well<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.590> isn't

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sitting there wondering well this isn't

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.710 
sitting there wondering well this isn't
really<00:01:59.010> confirmation<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.850> getting<00:02:00.150> horses<00:02:00.570> at

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
really confirmation of getting horses at

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.430 
really confirmation of getting horses at
all<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.430> mean<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.330> all<00:02:03.630> coincides

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
all and so I mean this all coincides

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.040 
all and so I mean this all coincides
with<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.040> fact<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.000> seeing<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.450> horse

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050
