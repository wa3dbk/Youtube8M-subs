 these patients to preserve the territory 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.880
 likewise 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.050
 to attract customers who identify themselves as the only hand 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.180

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 in the hesse can not do otherwise than his mistakes 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.329

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.660
 and M 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.660
 I think we are all a bit 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740

 and with his team 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370
 desires of 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.880

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.690
 nostalgia squeezes for past memories 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.920
 but period a joker bowling 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.310
 to actually appreciate 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010
 this obstacle 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.930
 when you are passionate m 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.850

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.360
 I have a little more effort to succeed but in short when we love this 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.259
 that we do 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.169
 of those who have succeeded 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:13.749
 the camera touches the hunt 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.499
 low and solidarity is the passion that makes you think several 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.759
 night hours 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.700
 near a lake 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.889
 a sin 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.879
 several hours to hunt in difficult conditions 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.079
 but we expect a lot of sweat 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.169
 and M 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.869
 we expect a lot of what drives us to say 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.379

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.669

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.289
 catching a plate 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:43.229

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.119
 auger because the back of you 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.319

 amap memories for members 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.290
 compensate with the people we love but also for the places we live 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.269
 this year 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.069

 unfortunately that's all 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.309
 yet these aids 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.669
 in the real consumer had had his moments with them that we saw him in the 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:09.389
 chaos 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.799
 and that's what's beautiful 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.909
 we identify with people we love 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.529
 western am to philosophies that are shared which are ours 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.449
 and I see a martin stone only to see the valin mounts 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.069
 a philosophy 2 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.829
