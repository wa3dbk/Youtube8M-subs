comes<00:02:16.590> close<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.510> alternate

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
comes close and I for the alternate

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.750 
comes close and I for the alternate
finisher<00:02:19.439> which<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.799> basically<00:02:20.159> your<00:02:20.370> table

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
finisher which is basically your table

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300 
finisher which is basically your table
finishing<00:02:21.319> what<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.349> need<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.799> use<00:02:22.980> when<00:02:23.159> you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
finishing what you need to use when you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.170 
finishing what you need to use when you
on<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.519> table

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
on the table

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.349 
on the table
I<00:02:24.469> used<00:02:25.469> the<00:02:25.620> belly-to-belly<00:02:26.340> cuz<00:02:27.209> we

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
I used the belly-to-belly cuz we

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.880 
I used the belly-to-belly cuz we
actually<00:02:27.780> finished<00:02:28.109> some<00:02:28.290> matches<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.859> that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
actually finished some matches with that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.059 
actually finished some matches with that
belly-to-belly<00:02:29.609> so<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.409> figured<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.500> was<00:02:31.739> a

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
belly-to-belly so I figured it was a

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.869 
belly-to-belly so I figured it was a
better<00:02:32.970> fit<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:34.140> table<00:02:34.500> finishing<00:02:34.980> Lord

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
better fit for a table finishing Lord

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.490 
better fit for a table finishing Lord
