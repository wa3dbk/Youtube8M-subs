00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
now that I know that I have addresses

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.380 
now that I know that I have addresses
back<00:01:47.899> I'm<00:01:48.899> gonna<00:01:48.990> take<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.350> lens<00:01:49.590> off<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:53.390> in

the flashlight locate the dust on the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.249 
the flashlight locate the dust on the
sensor<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> pretty<00:02:00.659> big<00:02:00.930> speck

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
sensor and I can see a pretty big speck

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.810 
sensor and I can see a pretty big speck
right<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> I've<00:02:03.930> got<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:07.729> called<00:02:08.729> an

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
right there so I've got this called an

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.210 
right there so I've got this called an
Arctic<00:02:09.209> butterfly<00:02:09.690> also<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:10.619> visible<00:02:11.009> dust

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
Arctic butterfly also from visible dust

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.130 
Arctic butterfly also from visible dust
builds<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.519> static<00:02:14.700> charge<00:02:15.090> by<00:02:15.690> spinning

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
builds up a static charge by spinning

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.530 
builds up a static charge by spinning
and<00:02:17.510> then<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.720> static<00:02:19.230> will<00:02:20.150> suck<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.180> rest

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and then the static will suck the rest

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.940 
and then the static will suck the rest
right<00:02:21.840> up

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
right up

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.730 
right up
he's<00:02:23.819> gonna<00:02:24.030> slip<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.750> across<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.290> surface

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
he's gonna slip that across the surface

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.420 
he's gonna slip that across the surface
there<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:28.130> then<00:02:29.130> spin<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.670> again<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:31.250> blow<00:02:32.250> off

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
there and then spin it again to blow off

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.520 
there and then spin it again to blow off
the<00:02:32.640> dust<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.090> build<00:02:33.300> up<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.540> new<00:02:33.690> charge<00:02:36.530> yeah

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the dust and build up a new charge yeah

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.000 
the dust and build up a new charge yeah

my swab on the roof swipe across again
and<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.530> swab<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.100> done<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:13.170> check

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
and now this swab is done and then check

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:31.339 
and now this swab is done and then check
again<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:14.630> make<00:03:15.630> sure<00:03:15.810> that

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.890 

and<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.249> we<00:03:32.340> got<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.549> nice<00:03:32.819> clean<00:03:33.090> sensor<00:03:34.730> now

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
and there we got a nice clean sensor now

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.619 
and there we got a nice clean sensor now
when<00:03:36.900> you're<00:03:37.139> doing<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.249> you're<00:03:39.239> probably

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
when you're doing this you're probably

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.110 
when you're doing this you're probably
not<00:03:40.139> going<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.680> actually<00:03:40.859> be<00:03:41.459> touching<00:03:41.999> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
not going to actually be touching the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.780 
not going to actually be touching the
sensor<00:03:42.540> many<00:03:43.290> cameras<00:03:43.799> have<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.069> piece<00:03:44.609> of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
sensor many cameras have a piece of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.910 
sensor many cameras have a piece of
glass<00:03:44.909> in<00:03:45.030> fact<00:03:45.599> called<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.019> low-pass<00:03:46.409> filter

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
glass in fact called a low-pass filter

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.490 
glass in fact called a low-pass filter
and<00:03:47.209> that's<00:03:48.209> where<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.689> dust<00:03:48.959> tends<00:03:49.260> to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
and that's where the dust tends to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.250 
and that's where the dust tends to
collect<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.909> chamber<00:03:51.389> behind<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.930> low-pass

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
collect the chamber behind the low-pass

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.740 
collect the chamber behind the low-pass
filter<00:03:52.829> is<00:03:52.859> usually<00:03:53.280> fairly<00:03:53.760> airtight<00:03:54.420> and

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
filter is usually fairly airtight and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.569 
filter is usually fairly airtight and
pretty<00:03:55.379> rare<00:03:55.650> you're<00:03:55.859> actually<00:03:56.189> gonna<00:03:56.310> have

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
pretty rare you're actually gonna have

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.440 
pretty rare you're actually gonna have
dirt<00:03:56.849> on<00:03:57.060> your<00:03:57.419> actual<00:03:58.109> sensor<00:03:59.120> well<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.150> hope

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
dirt on your actual sensor well I hope

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.610 
dirt on your actual sensor well I hope
you<00:04:00.629> found<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.989> helpful
