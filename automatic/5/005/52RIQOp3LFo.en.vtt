00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
probably go into more detail about each

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.930 
probably go into more detail about each

that he writes in this article is that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.370 
that he writes in this article is that

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
egg yolks should be avoided because they

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.900 
egg yolks should be avoided because they
are<00:03:47.500> high<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.680> cholesterol<00:03:47.920> which<00:03:48.550> drives
