apart from the first edition having been
a<00:01:47.690> best-seller<00:01:48.170> what<00:01:48.950> prompted<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.490> to

a best-seller what prompted you to

did<00:01:51.740> very<00:01:51.950> well<00:01:52.009> because<00:01:52.490> most<00:01:52.790> people<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.240> the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
did very well because most people in the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.240 
did very well because most people in the
UK<00:01:53.509> want<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.140> learn<00:01:54.259> about<00:01:54.410> property<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.070> once

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
UK want to learn about property and once

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.410 
UK want to learn about property and once
were<00:01:55.430> in<00:01:55.520> their<00:01:55.640> own<00:01:55.759> property<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.270> that's

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
were in their own property and that's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420 
were in their own property and that's
what<00:01:56.570> we<00:01:56.660> teach<00:01:56.780> people<00:01:56.990> had<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.350> do<00:01:57.470> um<00:01:58.159> but

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
what we teach people had to do um but

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.219 
what we teach people had to do um but
the<00:01:58.490> property<00:01:58.759> market<00:01:58.909> changes<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.509> it's

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
the property market changes and it's

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.080 
the property market changes and it's
very<00:02:00.380> dynamic<00:02:00.530> particularly<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> moments<00:02:01.729> so

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
very dynamic particularly the moments so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.340 
very dynamic particularly the moments so
it's<00:02:02.240> very<00:02:02.300> important<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.810> make<00:02:02.990> sure<00:02:03.020> people

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's very important to make sure people

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.140 
it's very important to make sure people
get<00:02:03.409> up-to-date<00:02:03.770> information<00:02:04.220> because<00:02:04.940> what

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
get up-to-date information because what

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.149 
get up-to-date information because what
we<00:02:05.420> do<00:02:05.570> now<00:02:05.990> might<00:02:06.320> be<00:02:06.350> different<00:02:06.650> for<00:02:06.710> 2012

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
coming down it gives you a bit of a

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.749 
coming down it gives you a bit of a
buffer<00:04:33.380> in<00:04:33.530> case<00:04:33.560> valleys<00:04:34.070> come<00:04:34.280> down<00:04:34.460> further

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
buffer in case valleys come down further

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.089 
buffer in case valleys come down further
so<00:04:35.479> in<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.870> good<00:04:36.020> market<00:04:36.199> you<00:04:36.650> might<00:04:36.800> be<00:04:36.919> buying

find the right motivated sellers so

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.110 
find the right motivated sellers so
that's<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.949> first<00:04:49.159> rule<00:04:49.370> always<00:04:49.610> buy<00:04:49.880> below

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
that's a first rule always buy below

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.540 
that's a first rule always buy below
market<00:04:50.300> value<00:04:50.479> the<00:04:51.440> next<00:04:51.620> rule<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:51.889> the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
market value the next rule is the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.339 
market value the next rule is the
discount<00:04:52.940> alone<00:04:53.210> isn't<00:04:53.389> enough<00:04:53.570> it's<00:04:54.050> got<00:04:54.259> to

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
discount alone isn't enough it's got to

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.260 
discount alone isn't enough it's got to
be<00:04:54.409> a<00:04:54.440> property<00:04:54.800> which<00:04:54.979> we<00:04:55.340> call<00:04:55.490> stack<00:04:55.849> up<00:04:56.060> so

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
be a property which we call stack up so

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.089 
be a property which we call stack up so
it's<00:04:56.389> got<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:56.630> make<00:04:56.840> cash<00:04:57.229> for<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:58.009> in

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
approaches gotta be in there that's

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.659

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
demand because the idea of an investment

demand because the idea of an investment
property<00:05:25.370> is<00:05:25.580> that<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.330> don't<00:05:26.509> have<00:05:26.659> to<00:05:26.810> pay

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
property is that you don't have to pay

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
the mortgage the tenants you have in the

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.310 
the mortgage the tenants you have in the
property<00:05:29.180> are<00:05:29.389> actually<00:05:29.659> covering<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.110> cost

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
property are actually covering the cost

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.350 
property are actually covering the cost
of<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.500> ownership<00:05:30.800> for<00:05:31.190> you<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:32.000> you've<00:05:32.240> got

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
of the ownership for you so you've got

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.020 
of the ownership for you so you've got
to<00:05:32.479> have<00:05:32.509> a<00:05:32.599> good<00:05:32.840> strong<00:05:33.050> rental<00:05:33.259> demand<00:05:34.030> the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
to have a good strong rental demand the

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.120 
to have a good strong rental demand the
fourth<00:05:35.300> rule<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:36.139> need<00:05:36.380> to<00:05:36.409> buy<00:05:36.710> for<00:05:36.979> long

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
fourth rule is you need to buy for long

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.920 
fourth rule is you need to buy for long
term<00:05:37.430> property<00:05:37.940> investment<00:05:38.419> is<00:05:38.509> not<00:05:38.780> a

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
term property investment is not a

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.439 
term property investment is not a
get-rich-quick<00:05:39.229> scheme<00:05:39.919> it's<00:05:40.280> get<00:05:40.520> rich<00:05:40.669> very

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
get-rich-quick scheme it's get rich very

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.080 
get-rich-quick scheme it's get rich very
very<00:05:41.690> slowly<00:05:41.990> scheme<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.550> idea<00:05:43.820> is<00:05:43.940> you

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
very slowly scheme and the idea is you

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.730 
very slowly scheme and the idea is you
buy<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.300> property<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:44.840> you're<00:05:45.289> holding<00:05:45.650> it

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
buy the property and you're holding it

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.409 
buy the property and you're holding it
for<00:05:45.919> the<00:05:45.979> long<00:05:46.190> term<00:05:46.219> growth<00:05:46.789> and<00:05:47.240> in<00:05:47.330> the

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
for the long term growth and in the

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.510 
for the long term growth and in the
meantime<00:05:47.680> someone<00:05:48.680> else<00:05:48.830> is<00:05:48.979> paying<00:05:49.219> for<00:05:49.460> the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
meantime someone else is paying for the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.700 
meantime someone else is paying for the
cost<00:05:49.759> of<00:05:49.880> holding<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.300> property<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:51.050> the

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
cost of holding that property and the

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.810 
cost of holding that property and the
fifth<00:05:51.919> rule<00:05:52.190> which<00:05:52.340> I<00:05:52.430> think<00:05:52.610> is<00:05:52.669> very

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
fifth rule which I think is very

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.790 
fifth rule which I think is very
important<00:05:53.479> is<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:54.050> believe<00:05:54.289> everyone<00:05:54.710> who's

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
important is I believe everyone who's

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
important is I believe everyone who's
investing<00:05:55.250> in<00:05:55.310> property

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
investing in property

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.810 
investing in property
needs<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.180> have<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.570> cache<00:05:56.810> buffer<00:05:57.280> because<00:05:58.280> the

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
needs to have a cache buffer because the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.490 
needs to have a cache buffer because the
people<00:05:59.090> who<00:05:59.240> you<00:05:59.360> see<00:05:59.510> struggling<00:05:59.990> investors

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
people who you see struggling investors

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.320 
people who you see struggling investors
who<00:06:00.620> do<00:06:00.770> get<00:06:00.920> into<00:06:01.070> difficulty<00:06:01.640> are<00:06:01.850> ones<00:06:02.090> who

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
who do get into difficulty are ones who

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.450 
who do get into difficulty are ones who
buy<00:06:02.540> they've<00:06:03.200> got<00:06:03.410> no<00:06:03.650> money<00:06:03.860> they've<00:06:04.130> got<00:06:04.280> no

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
buy they've got no money they've got no

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.400 
buy they've got no money they've got no
assets<00:06:04.910> behind<00:06:05.240> them<00:06:05.480> and<00:06:05.900> if<00:06:05.990> they<00:06:06.080> have<00:06:06.230> any

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
assets behind them and if they have any

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.920 
assets behind them and if they have any
problems<00:06:06.440> such<00:06:07.040> as<00:06:07.070> bad<00:06:07.400> tenants<00:06:08.090> or<00:06:08.270> repairs

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
problems such as bad tenants or repairs

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.330 
problems such as bad tenants or repairs
on<00:06:09.170> the<00:06:09.260> property<00:06:09.560> they've<00:06:09.770> not<00:06:10.010> got<00:06:10.250> the

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
on the property they've not got the

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.250 
on the property they've not got the
money<00:06:10.520> to<00:06:10.670> cover<00:06:10.850> it<00:06:11.060> and<00:06:11.300> so<00:06:11.780> they<00:06:11.870> get<00:06:12.020> into

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
money to cover it and so they get into

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.900 
money to cover it and so they get into
difficulty<00:06:12.770> so<00:06:13.070> you<00:06:13.130> always<00:06:13.370> need<00:06:13.610> to<00:06:13.670> make

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
difficulty so you always need to make

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.730 
difficulty so you always need to make
sure<00:06:14.090> you<00:06:14.510> minimize<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.170> risk<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:15.590> have<00:06:15.710> a

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
sure you minimize the risk and have a

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.830 
sure you minimize the risk and have a
cash<00:06:16.100> buffer<00:06:16.370> available<00:06:16.610> so<00:06:17.510> if<00:06:17.690> you're

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
cash buffer available so if you're

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.240 
cash buffer available so if you're
investing<00:06:18.380> in<00:06:18.470> properties<00:06:18.890> then<00:06:19.010> would<00:06:19.160> you

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
investing in properties then would you

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.730 
investing in properties then would you
need<00:06:19.460> to<00:06:19.580> have<00:06:19.760> that<00:06:20.000> cash<00:06:20.330> buffer<00:06:20.630> to<00:06:21.410> start

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
need to have that cash buffer to start

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.230 
need to have that cash buffer to start
with<00:06:22.040> before<00:06:22.340> because<00:06:22.910> you<00:06:23.030> talk<00:06:23.210> about

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
with before because you talk about

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.720 
with before because you talk about
putting<00:06:23.720> no<00:06:23.990> money<00:06:24.020> down<00:06:24.410> so<00:06:25.130> you<00:06:25.190> can<00:06:25.460> buy<00:06:25.670> it

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
putting no money down so you can buy it

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.510 
putting no money down so you can buy it
without<00:06:26.420> actually<00:06:26.780> paying<00:06:27.470> out<00:06:27.710> a<00:06:27.740> deposit<00:06:28.100> no

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
without actually paying out a deposit no

case you have difficulty so when you

case you have difficulty so when you
normally<00:06:48.740> buy<00:06:48.890> a<00:06:48.920> property<00:06:49.400> as<00:06:49.460> an<00:06:49.550> own<00:06:49.700> home

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
normally buy a property as an own home

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.090 
normally buy a property as an own home
you<00:06:50.210> might<00:06:50.360> put<00:06:50.630> ten<00:06:50.930> or<00:06:51.080> fifteen<00:06:51.500> percent<00:06:51.860> in

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
you might put ten or fifteen percent in

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.830 
you might put ten or fifteen percent in
as<00:06:52.190> a<00:06:52.220> deposit<00:06:52.730> as<00:06:53.030> an<00:06:53.240> investment<00:06:53.750> it's

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
as a deposit as an investment it's

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.150 
as a deposit as an investment it's
somewhere<00:06:54.080> between<00:06:54.230> fifteen<00:06:54.920> and<00:06:54.950> twenty

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
somewhere between fifteen and twenty

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.070 
somewhere between fifteen and twenty
five<00:06:55.640> percent<00:06:55.850> depending<00:06:56.450> on<00:06:56.480> the<00:06:56.540> market<00:06:56.960> at

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
five percent depending on the market at

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.020 
five percent depending on the market at
the<00:06:57.200> time<00:06:57.410> so<00:06:57.920> that's<00:06:58.010> a<00:06:58.160> substantial<00:06:58.880> amount

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
the time so that's a substantial amount

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.240 
the time so that's a substantial amount
of<00:06:59.210> cash<00:06:59.270> normally<00:07:00.050> for<00:07:00.170> the<00:07:00.230> deposit<00:07:00.500> so<00:07:01.100> you

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
of cash normally for the deposit so you

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.550 
of cash normally for the deposit so you
can<00:07:01.520> buy<00:07:01.760> without<00:07:02.060> a<00:07:02.270> deposit<00:07:02.690> but<00:07:03.290> I<00:07:03.320> think

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
can buy without a deposit but I think

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.320 
can buy without a deposit but I think
you<00:07:03.650> do<00:07:03.830> need<00:07:04.040> a<00:07:04.070> little<00:07:04.400> bit<00:07:04.550> or<00:07:04.730> access<00:07:05.300> to

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
you do need a little bit or access to

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.730 
you do need a little bit or access to
some<00:07:05.660> to<00:07:05.870> make<00:07:06.020> sure<00:07:06.170> you<00:07:06.290> cover<00:07:06.470> any

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
some to make sure you cover any

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.200 
some to make sure you cover any
potential<00:07:07.130> risks<00:07:07.460> okay

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
potential risks okay

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.390 
potential risks okay
