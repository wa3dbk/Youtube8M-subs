00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
are great as well so I mean they pretty

growing up in the in the late 50s and
early<00:00:42.730> 60s<00:00:43.499> that<00:00:44.499> wasn't<00:00:44.829> even<00:00:45.010> close<00:00:45.219> that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
early 60s that wasn't even close that

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.520 
early 60s that wasn't even close that
there<00:00:46.269> wasn't<00:00:46.449> you<00:00:46.749> know<00:00:47.170> there<00:00:47.319> were<00:00:47.409> there

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
to to express a wide dynamic range on

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.860 
to to express a wide dynamic range on
the<00:01:26.650> instruments<00:01:27.190> that<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:28.150> my<00:01:28.360> experience

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
the instruments that in my experience

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.870 
the instruments that in my experience
has<00:01:29.680> never<00:01:30.040> happened<00:01:30.250> with<00:01:30.520> any<00:01:30.550> other

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
instrument that I've played you know I'm

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.700 
instrument that I've played you know I'm
always<00:01:33.540> comparing<00:01:34.540> them<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.020> Selmer<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
always comparing them to the Selmer and

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.130 
always comparing them to the Selmer and
it's<00:01:36.310> like<00:01:36.400> every<00:01:36.610> time<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.820> play<00:01:37.600> another<00:01:37.810> horn

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
it's like every time I play another horn

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's like every time I play another horn
and<00:01:38.380> then<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.130> come<00:01:39.310> back<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.490> my<00:01:39.610> solver<00:01:40.090> Selmer

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
and then I come back to my solver Selmer

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170 
and then I come back to my solver Selmer
it's<00:01:40.720> like<00:01:40.840> being<00:01:41.080> home<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.670> that's<00:01:43.000> what

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
it's like being home so that's what

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.850 
it's like being home so that's what
summer<00:01:43.450> represents<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.230> me<00:01:44.320> it's<00:01:44.440> like<00:01:44.530> being

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
summer represents to me it's like being

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.600 
summer represents to me it's like being
home<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:47.410> let's<00:01:47.590> let's<00:01:47.920> play<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.280> rest<00:01:48.460> of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
home so let's let's play the rest of

00:01:48.610 --> 00:04:08.430 
home so let's let's play the rest of
this<00:01:48.730> to<00:01:49.260> go<00:01:50.260> start<00:01:50.590> at<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.770> bridge

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.810 

I<00:04:10.050> think<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.170> idea<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.770> just<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:12.100> try<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.400> leave

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
I think the idea is just to try to leave

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.360 
I think the idea is just to try to leave
as<00:04:13.690> much<00:04:13.990> space<00:04:14.230> as<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.560> can<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.980> just<00:04:15.040> try<00:04:15.190> to

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
as much space as you can and just try to

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.180 
as much space as you can and just try to
