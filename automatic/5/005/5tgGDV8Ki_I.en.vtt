00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.220

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.910
 hello how about I am lupita welcome to 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.510
 my channel today we are going to prepare 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.250
 a 5-cup cake 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.720
 we are going to need 4 eggs 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.400
 two cups of hot cakes flour 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.570
 a cup of oil a cup of sugar 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.960
 a cup of milk 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.690
 and I in this case I have syrup because 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.120
 I'm going to stuff it with peaches then 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.570
 I have here the peach syrup 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.810
 but if you are not going to use peaches or 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 some fruit in syrup is milk one 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 cup of milk 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.180
 let's start then with our 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.180
 preparation 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.670
 Well, what we are going to do first is 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.680
 put the eggs here in the blender 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.170
 you know that I like everything like that 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.990
 super easy let's also put the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.659
 vanilla and well let's put all the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.399
 ingredients here 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.319
 since we have all the ingredients in 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.570
 the glass of the blender we are going to 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.090
 take them to liquefy 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.560
 since we liquefy the ingredients we are going to 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 empty them to our mold that I already 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.170
 I have previously greased and floured 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.880
 and we're going to take the oven for 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.000
 approximately 30 to 35 minutes to 170 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.400
 our cake already came out of the oven I'm going 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.020
 let cool to unmold and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.750
 decorate 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.140
 our bread has cooled down then now 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.520
 let's break it in half to be able 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.520
 fill it and decorate it 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.270
 we already started it and we're putting the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 chantilly 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.200
 and we're going to put the peaches 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.200
 that we have already chopped 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.769
 since we have put the peaches 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.379
 then now to the other half of the bread 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.689
 that we have reserved also we are going to 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.730
 put chantilly and then we're going to 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:06.300
 link 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.310
 since we join the loaves again we are going to 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.650
 start with our decoration me in 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.069
 this case I will put chantilly a 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.810
 thin layer of chantilly 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.599
 because I'm going to put a wafer 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.730
 edible above but right now it 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:26.350
 I show how we are staying, we already have 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.990
 the cake covered with chantilly 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.840
 I 'm going to put the wafer now I'm going to 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.890
 put an edible wafer stamped 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.800
 it's plants against zombies 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.800
 and I'm going to put it on the cake 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.690
 for so it has been us and our 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.000
 decorated cake I hope that this idea will 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.980
