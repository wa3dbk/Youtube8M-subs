00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello friends how are you welcome to 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.450
 steve test and well then 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.820
 beautiful beautiful textures well then 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.710
 people here as they are watching the ds4 is 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.359
 meters to minecraft changes the other 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.610
 because the factor is you were even in the 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.609
 home screen as well as 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.890
 well let's see it and then we're going to 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.080
 do the review to this that you will have in 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.019
 the system this texture pack that the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.640
 truth is very, very good, we are going to 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.769
 start with the criteria if not then the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.429
 animals that really are very 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.780
 but these would be very good 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.519
 let's plan that the eggs some 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.889
 eggs the skewers disappear 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.839
 monkeys and as also here on screen it 

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:46.659
 they put the pinches balls as well as 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.179
 they were not worth pokemon people something 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.639
 that looks very funny to me 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.739
 the truth is very good come then 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:55.510
 that both do review how it ended here 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.819
 we are missing already having the champions 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.299
 that the truth has no eyes or facto fuck 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:03.930
 what's up with you friend do not you have but 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.540
 Well, this cow 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.730
 the sheep does not stain is that the animals 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.440
 It's funny that is to grab 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.540
 cure with the pack of your thanks because 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.090
 if the animals are very curious they are 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 seeing here also what they pass 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.700
 the pig has the same thing to say as 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.619
 a square point is not missing that is the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.320
 the bank also has these eyes 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.210
 what the fuck you have ends like this 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.100
 they have gray eyes almost do not 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.820
 they denote that here the lobes have 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.440
 normal 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.490
 well they do not have normal all 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.490
 pinches monkeys feel it like this 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.040
 I make certain certain is that I have 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.570
 deactivated this and then forgive people and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.220
 now we are going to put this let's say 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.290
 also of the schlenker offerings is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 light does not change anything no more because it looks 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.310
 a little better let's see here the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.570
 spider generator as terms happens already 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 the spider also has a bit of a 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.900
 small change the zombie the zombie see 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.110
 world of folk that is cold these friends 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.720
 although this is very ugly the pig the big 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.240
 man here we also on screen what 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.890
 are watching the zombie on the screen 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.990
 pickman because they also today in 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.250
 screen the squid that I'm going to put 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.250
 here the squid 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.970
 pacman I do not understand why it is this way 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.060
 here the magma that they see ottawa totally 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.190
 you are very ugly or that the spider cave now 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.290
 if the game spider has eyes now yes 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.660
 It's prettier than the Larena spider 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.070
 normal because and let's go here no longer 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.740
 I will be taller than another because 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.640
 all that because we are going to battle 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.900
 as also here as soon as there's up 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.730
 minutes the minerals that the truth 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.850
 they are very beautiful see the cubes 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.280
 cubes the courses I loved to see what 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.970
 so broke the cubes these diamond 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.250
 gold iron aldair much liked the gold 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.440
 neither that of emeralds and the rest 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.260
 of lapis lazuli more or less because these 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.750
 we are that the parrot is very beautiful prey 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.540
 they left it almost the same in diamond almost 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.720
 equal the lapis lazuli also change the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.800
 I arrested the emerald coal and it happened 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.480
 because if I change and also 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.430
 instead we are seeing the block of 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.890
 it's like it's like a clay guy I do not know 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.420
 all those blocks are sandy 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.530
 these are the stone ones as well in 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.510
 a screen that changes a little bit 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.190
 also a little people the truth is 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.050
 very good view - the blocks these 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.030
 brick block all those that are 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.930
 appear in which troops of the slow 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.820
 and then nothing is going to go to the groups 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.200
 these objects of this is the door that 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.790
 as we would also be the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200
 windows and this is the door to 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.160
 staircase that is perfect very good 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.580
 here 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.480
 these costs that come out in the portal the 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.860
 they read 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.170
 here also all those things that are 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.930
 like 15 to make the farms the cake 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.000
 that also here the base scale 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.770
 wow the heads I loved have the 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.610
 form of an orange kripper pageantry 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.130
 facto 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.290
 here they are seeing the bibles the sponge 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.840
 all of the champions cows reader 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.670
 sneijder 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.379
 here we see all types of quartz 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.760
 they are watching here on the screen 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.500
 colors that I think will be a little better 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.780
 with this bewilderment that they gave him 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.760
 it would be like pixelated as good people 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.410
 let's go to the group of this place that 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.390
 would be for the last I think that would be what 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.880
 last that would be the flowers I think not 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.680
 have a book let's see if what 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.419
 you really have book are the flowers 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.750
 that also what has nothing books 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.610
 ok ok ok everything is perfectly
