hello everyone
here's<00:00:13.320> me<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> bathroom<00:00:14.540> probably

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
here's me in the bathroom probably

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.630 
here's me in the bathroom probably
because<00:00:15.870> I'm<00:00:16.170> hoping<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.619> bitter<00:00:16.950> a<00:00:17.040> reverb

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
because I'm hoping that bitter a reverb

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.150 
because I'm hoping that bitter a reverb
will<00:00:17.820> come<00:00:18.029> through<00:00:18.440> natural<00:00:19.440> reverb<00:00:19.650> from

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
will come through natural reverb from

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.690 
will come through natural reverb from
the<00:00:20.279> room<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:21.950> just<00:00:22.950> wanted<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.430> quickly

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
the room I just wanted to quickly

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.019 
the room I just wanted to quickly
mention<00:00:24.830> not<00:00:25.830> gonna<00:00:26.099> promote<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.790> product

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
mention not gonna promote the product

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.910 
mention not gonna promote the product
but<00:00:27.360> I<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> box<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.039> plug<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.680> that's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
but I got a box and plug the one that's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.650 
but I got a box and plug the one that's
got<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.129> lowest<00:00:32.369> distortion<00:00:33.150> which<00:00:33.330> is<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
got the lowest distortion which is the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.689 
got the lowest distortion which is the
IC<00:00:33.989> 31<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.470> think<00:00:37.769> I<00:00:37.830> always<00:00:38.129> seek<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.580> is

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
IC 31 and I think I always seek that is

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.660 
IC 31 and I think I always seek that is
but<00:00:39.000> anyway<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.710> good<00:00:40.860> i<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.220> it's<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> one

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
but anyway it's good i see it's the one

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.100 
but anyway it's good i see it's the one
with<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.910> lowest<00:00:42.059> distortion<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.870> three

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
with the lowest distortion is three

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.069 
with the lowest distortion is three
different<00:00:43.500> flavors<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.420> I'm

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
turned on in a short time I'll turn it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.109 
turned on in a short time I'll turn it
off<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.009> spice<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.460> whole<00:01:44.729> thing<00:01:45.000> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
off this is spice this whole thing is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.170 
off this is spice this whole thing is
supposed<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.570> emulate<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> Vox<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:47.970> I
