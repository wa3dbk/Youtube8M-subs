I honestly don't know it could happen

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.319 
I honestly don't know it could happen
but<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

Twilight<00:02:06.780> system<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> princess<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> student

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
Twilight system to princess a student

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.589 
Twilight system to princess a student
with<00:02:08.099> minor<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.580> yet<00:02:08.729> unknown<00:02:09.030> differences

with minor and yet unknown differences

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.089 
with minor and yet unknown differences
so<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> show<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.500> change<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:10.830> much<00:02:10.979> as

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so the show will not change as much as

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.589 
so the show will not change as much as
we<00:02:11.190> may<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:12.030> there's<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.300> thing

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
we may think and there's the thing

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.820 
we may think and there's the thing

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
upon in season 3 which I don't think it

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.940 
upon in season 3 which I don't think it
was<00:02:18.540> then<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.170> got<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.410> have<00:02:19.530> something<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.980 
sounds interesting the opening sequence
which<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.910> find<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.270> very<00:02:24.480> special<00:02:24.600> part

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
which I find to be a very special part

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.420 
which I find to be a very special part
of<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.080> show<00:02:25.200> did<00:02:25.710> not<00:02:25.890> change<00:02:26.100> from<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
after the season opener which was the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.190 
after the season opener which was the
case<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.670> season<00:02:30.150> 2<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:30.780> i'm<00:02:30.870> pretty<00:02:30.960> sure

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
case in season 2 but i'm pretty sure

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.140 
case in season 2 but i'm pretty sure
that<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.590> will<00:02:31.740> change<00:02:32.100> for<00:02:32.340> season<00:02:32.610> 4<00:02:32.790> if

think something between the two is more

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.410 
think something between the two is more
likely<00:03:14.340> like<00:03:14.700> what<00:03:14.850> she's<00:03:15.030> doing<00:03:15.240> right<00:03:15.360> here

it<00:03:15.930> matches<00:03:16.170> their<00:03:16.380> personality<00:03:16.920> more<00:03:17.070> I

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
it matches their personality more I

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.280 
it matches their personality more I
think<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.880> what<00:03:18.239> circumstances<00:03:18.390> will<00:03:18.989> she<00:03:19.170> fly

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
think in what circumstances will she fly

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.960 
think in what circumstances will she fly
maybe<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.950> look<00:03:20.070> at<00:03:20.190> books<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.519> higher<00:03:20.700> shelves

or<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.480> speak<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> crowd<00:03:22.050> in<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> middle<00:03:22.320> of

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
or to speak to a crowd in the middle of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.199 
or to speak to a crowd in the middle of
a<00:03:22.620> series<00:03:22.890> situation<00:03:23.070> or<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.910> reach<00:03:24.060> places

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
a series situation or to reach places

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.699 
a series situation or to reach places
quicker<00:03:24.540> like<00:03:24.840> if<00:03:24.959> she<00:03:25.080> suddenly<00:03:25.260> found<00:03:25.530> out

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
quicker like if she suddenly found out

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.900 
quicker like if she suddenly found out
about<00:03:25.830> some<00:03:26.070> kind<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.310> crisis<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.820> the

she was already an alicorn there I'm
pretty<00:03:30.450> sure<00:03:30.720> she<00:03:30.900> would<00:03:31.019> have<00:03:31.050> flown<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
pretty sure she would have flown to the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.470 
pretty sure she would have flown to the
town<00:03:31.769> hall<00:03:31.950> instead<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.610> trotting<00:03:32.970> when

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.210 
town hall instead of just trotting when
flying<00:03:33.720> will<00:03:34.080> she<00:03:34.230> be<00:03:34.260> less<00:03:34.500> experienced<00:03:35.100> and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
flying will she be less experienced and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.530 
flying will she be less experienced and
need<00:03:35.370> advices<00:03:35.730> from<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.090> other<00:03:36.180> princesses

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
need advices from the other princesses

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600 
need advices from the other princesses
and<00:03:36.870> Rebecca<00:03:37.140> sigh<00:03:37.290> friends<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.800> mean<00:03:38.280> she

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
and Rebecca sigh friends I mean she

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.250 
and Rebecca sigh friends I mean she
never<00:03:38.790> had<00:03:39.000> wings<00:03:39.180> before<00:03:39.390> does<00:03:39.870> she<00:03:40.019> know<00:03:40.140> how

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
never had wings before does she know how

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.140

to<00:03:40.290> properly<00:03:40.650> use<00:03:40.739> them<00:03:41.100> yet<00:03:41.610> she<00:03:41.790> didn't<00:03:42.030> seem

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
to properly use them yet she didn't seem

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.280

to<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.360> problems<00:03:42.750> at<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.930> end<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
to have problems at the end of the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.840 
to have problems at the end of the
episode<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.010> was<00:03:44.160> probably<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
episode but that was probably for the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.490 
episode but that was probably for the
sake<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.239> moment<00:03:45.570> where<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.959> just<00:03:46.230> made

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
sake of the moment where it just made
