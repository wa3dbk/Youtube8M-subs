00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
much forward it's going to be a little

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.230 
much forward it's going to be a little
more<00:01:24.330> almost<00:01:24.619> horizontal<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.090> then<00:01:27.090> from

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
more almost horizontal and then from

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.520 
more almost horizontal and then from
there<00:01:27.390> you're<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.930> step<00:01:28.350> back

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
