00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
the right of the black yeah it was a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.200 
the right of the black yeah it was a
bigger<00:01:41.740> target<00:01:42.070> how<00:01:42.490> they've<00:01:42.640> come<00:01:42.820> off<00:01:42.940> two

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
bigger target how they've come off two

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.330 
bigger target how they've come off two
cushions<00:01:43.479> just<00:01:44.229> off<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.410> one<00:01:44.830> cushion<00:01:45.130> you

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
cushions just off that one cushion you

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:55.620 
cushions just off that one cushion you
had<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.610> catch<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.060> black<00:01:46.300> full<00:01:47.050> on

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.360 

I'm<00:01:56.630> just<00:01:56.930> wondering<00:01:57.140> if<00:01:57.650> he<00:01:57.830> can<00:01:58.010> send<00:01:58.250> the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
I'm just wondering if he can send the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.120 
I'm just wondering if he can send the
black<00:01:58.600> on<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.020> blue<00:02:00.230> and<00:02:00.560> bring<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.920> blue

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
black on to the blue and bring the blue

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.900 
black on to the blue and bring the blue
into<00:02:01.430> play<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.670> get<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.880> good<00:02:02.060> cue<00:02:02.360> ball<00:02:02.570> I

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
into play and get a good cue ball I

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.380 
into play and get a good cue ball I
could<00:02:04.910> be<00:02:05.000> quite<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> good<00:02:05.450> result<00:02:05.810> for<00:02:05.870> him

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.670 

very<00:02:11.390> good<00:02:11.810> shot

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.449 

so<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.400> has<00:02:19.489> created<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:20.329> situation<00:02:21.459> whereby

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
so that has created a situation whereby

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.630 
so that has created a situation whereby
whoever<00:02:23.060> pops<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.200> brown<00:02:24.409> should<00:02:25.340> win<00:02:25.519> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
whoever pops the brown should win the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.540 
whoever pops the brown should win the
frame

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.640 

and<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.300> might<00:02:33.540> go<00:02:33.720> close<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.230> pocket

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
and this might go close to the pocket

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.330 
and this might go close to the pocket
here<00:02:34.890> it's<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.210> back<00:02:36.510> double<00:02:40.130> he's<00:02:41.130> got

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
here it's like a back double he's got

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.070 
here it's like a back double he's got
the<00:02:41.490> snooker<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> sort<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.750> shock<00:02:43.050> to

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
the snooker it was a sort of a shock to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.100 
the snooker it was a sort of a shock to
nothing<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:45.150> doubled<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.660> brown<00:02:45.900> he

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
nothing there we doubled the brown he

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.110 
nothing there we doubled the brown he
was<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.440> blue<00:02:46.740> always<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.730> chance<00:02:47.940> of

was on the blue always the chance of
getting<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.450> snooker<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:55.020> doesn't<00:02:55.410> matter
