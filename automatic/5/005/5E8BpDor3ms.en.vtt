then<00:00:20.310> put<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.640> top<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.119> we're<00:00:21.660> talking<00:00:21.990> high

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
then put on top of it we're talking high

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.900 
then put on top of it we're talking high
quality<00:00:22.590> stuff<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.550> should<00:00:23.760> really

quality stuff here you should really

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880 
quality stuff here you should really
make<00:00:24.000> sure<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.810> room<00:00:25.289> temperature

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
make sure that it is room temperature

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
make sure that it is room temperature
because<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.400> ice-cold<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.180> outside<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
because if it's ice-cold the outside is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.630 
because if it's ice-cold the outside is
gonna<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.109> burnt<00:00:28.349> left<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> inside<00:00:29.310> starts

warming<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.510> first<00:00:31.349> thing<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:31.679> gonna

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
warming up so first thing you're gonna

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.639 
warming up so first thing you're gonna
want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.610> put<00:00:33.239> your<00:00:33.420> oven<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.530> the

want to do is put your oven on to the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.889 
want to do is put your oven on to the
lowest<00:00:35.040> temperature<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.570> smallest

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
lowest temperature this is the smallest

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
lowest temperature this is the smallest
pan<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.250> too<00:00:38.550> much<00:00:38.820> area<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
pan I have you have too much area and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.299 
pan I have you have too much area and
you're<00:00:40.050> only<00:00:40.260> cooking<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:40.980> piece<00:00:41.129> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
you're only cooking one little piece of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.340 
you're only cooking one little piece of
meat<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.090> oil<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:42.840> heat<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
meat the oil can actually heat up so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.020 
meat the oil can actually heat up so
much<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.800> burns<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.309> it'd<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.520> bad<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
much that it burns now it'd be bad so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
much that it burns now it'd be bad so
you<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> appropriate<00:00:46.410> size

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.500 
and a medium low heat because we really
need<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> temperature<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> change<00:00:54.059> quickly

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
need the temperature to change quickly

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
need the temperature to change quickly
and<00:00:54.719> electric<00:00:55.260> doesn't<00:00:55.559> respond<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.940> a

you're on electric and you want control

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.460 
you're on electric and you want control
the<00:01:27.250> heat<00:01:27.430> move<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.180> other<00:01:28.240> side<00:01:28.470> I'm

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
the heat move to the other side I'm

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.680 
the heat move to the other side I'm
doing<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:29.950> start<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.850> see<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.090> browning<00:01:31.539> come

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.730 
off the side or any droplets of blood
here<00:01:34.270> it's<00:01:34.420> time<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.720> flip<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.289> my<00:01:35.470> case

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
here it's time to flip in my case

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.330 
here it's time to flip in my case
something<00:01:36.159> with<00:01:36.310> them<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.770> minute<00:01:39.130> or

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
something with them probably a minute or

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.820 
something with them probably a minute or
so<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.610> go<00:01:39.909> we're<00:01:40.509> gonna<00:01:40.630> come<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.229> low

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
so to go we're gonna come to the low

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.700 
so to go we're gonna come to the low
heat<00:01:42.100> side<00:01:42.490> with<00:01:43.179> a<00:01:43.210> turn<00:01:43.509> arm<00:01:43.780> by<00:01:44.229> each<00:01:44.440> side

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
heat side with a turn arm by each side

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.070 
heat side with a turn arm by each side
on<00:01:44.890> high<00:01:45.100> people<00:01:45.819> with<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.090> flame<00:01:46.420> just<00:01:46.810> turn
