00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.710
 Fuji Instax Mini 8 show and I 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.910
 Go tell you all that you bring 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.440
 can do 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 I saw this room for the first time 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.939
 at be move where i also do my photo shoot 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.930

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.930
 also bought in it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.310
 with this button you turn the camera on and so on 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.310
 set the correct exposure 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.809
 the camera has a 60 mm lens and such 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.809
 defeat him 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.219
 take a photo with this button 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.059
 and this is the flash 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.059
 It is important that you get the exposure 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.059
 sensor does not cover 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.900

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.900

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.119
 This short can you do to your wrist you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.380
 can if you look through the viewfinder 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.380
 determine the correct position 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.009
 Here you can see how many photos you have left 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.009
 can make 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.270
 And these are the special cards that you get 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.270
 used where the photos appear 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.810
 this is what the packaging looks like 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.220

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:52.080

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.119

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.959
 coming

 here you can see how the photo speeds up 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.340
 appears it is important not to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.909
 go fluttering with the photo but quiet too 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.909
 let it dry 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.030
 this is the photo i just got 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.030

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.379
