 the magnificent sensations 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.090

 air baptisms for lionel 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.440
 these escorts to start 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.440
 but still a few cents and he can evolve alone 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.030
 he loved help 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.830
 but what does it matter then everyone is often 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.610
 and to each student the same protests 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.690
 the banana apart 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.549
 the head 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.100
 and alongside an instructor 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.900
 a translator 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.650
 everything about the basin other difference for deaf students 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 a sanction with radio Sunday is difficult to say 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.500
 when landing on the floor when we say that students 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.859
 working for euros 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.230
 they have a radio headset 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.900
 duo with whom we are with whom we can play the om can communicate with 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.640
 them 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.830
 so far no problem with conventional chicken radios will be 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 of course 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.380
 we will communicate yet the means of decoration is so we will put him 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.030
 sensors 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.189
 once equipped 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.189
 the latest checks and helicopters 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.549

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.280
 relaxed atmosphere 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 but before sinking enter enterprising last 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.770
 put on the track 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.590
 we watch for the arrival of lionel 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.470

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.250
 radios 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.839
 lionel luca led on the field 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.839
 very gently 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.849
 by the way the ball to the head 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.499
 the normal 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.369
 so that's a good hour 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.009
 the beautiful ring sensations not really 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.099

 especially carney the future daddy looking for her far away 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:32.950
 I went to 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.590
 in quiet calm or even more at the landing to do it 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.269
 it is not easy 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.009
 the objective of the internship is to 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.919
 even dominated and deaf 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.959
 a stop who have a big communication problem in a risky sport and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.569
 to get them to be initiated to be autonomous the fastest fall like 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.629
 any practitioners 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.879
 allow companies 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.409
 a bold bet 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.249
 these courses framed and recognized by the French skydiving federation 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.459
 HermÃ¨s the safe trends
