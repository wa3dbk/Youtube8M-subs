00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
health overall to be her main motivators

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.560 
health overall to be her main motivators
now<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> first<00:00:16.560> thing<00:00:16.710> I'm<00:00:16.830> looking<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:17.250> is

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
now the first thing I'm looking at is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.380 
now the first thing I'm looking at is
how<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:19.430> basically<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.880> her<00:00:20.970> off<00:00:21.090> sugar

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
how can we basically get her off sugar

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
how can we basically get her off sugar
gear<00:00:22.080> off<00:00:22.230> processed<00:00:22.769> carbohydrates<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
gear off processed carbohydrates and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.480 
gear off processed carbohydrates and
start<00:00:24.449> improving<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.230> eating<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.650> food<00:00:26.310> more

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
start improving and eating the food more

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.480 
start improving and eating the food more
naturally<00:00:27.109> the<00:00:28.109> reason<00:00:28.410> being<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.250> is

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
naturally the reason being for this is

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
naturally the reason being for this is
that<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:30.300> need<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.599> keep<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.929> insulated

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that we need to keep it insulated

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
that we need to keep it insulated
insulin<00:00:32.250> levels<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.820> check<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.610> fact

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
insulin levels in check so the very fact

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.130 
insulin levels in check so the very fact
that<00:00:36.059> things<00:00:36.210> because<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.600> start<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> burn

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that things because you start to burn

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.690 
that things because you start to burn
body<00:00:37.380> fat<00:00:37.530> because<00:00:37.890> I've<00:00:37.980> got<00:00:38.160> her<00:00:38.250> doing<00:00:38.489> some

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
body fat because I've got her doing some

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.750 
body fat because I've got her doing some
gentle<00:00:39.090> exercises<00:00:39.540> every<00:00:39.930> morning<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.379> well

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
gentle exercises every morning as well

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.479 
gentle exercises every morning as well
but<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.710> reality<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> have

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
but the reality is that if you have

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.069 
but the reality is that if you have
insulin<00:00:44.850> runs<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.329> body<00:00:45.629> you're<00:00:45.870> never

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
insulin runs from your body you're never

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.590 
insulin runs from your body you're never
going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.410> able<00:00:46.469> access<00:00:46.800> any<00:00:47.250> any<00:00:47.969> body<00:00:48.300> fat

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
going to be able access any any body fat

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
going to be able access any any body fat
so<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.680> keep<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> blood<00:00:50.340> sugar

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so you have to keep that blood sugar

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.040 
so you have to keep that blood sugar
level<00:00:50.940> steady<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.690> don't<00:00:51.899> produce

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
level steady so you don't produce

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.970 
level steady so you don't produce
insulin

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
insulin

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.850 
insulin
now<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.480> problem<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> mum<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.260> having<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
now the problem a mum is having is the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.139 
now the problem a mum is having is the
fact<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.190> once<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.469> remove<00:00:58.469> people<00:00:58.829> from

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
fact that once you remove people from

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.889 
fact that once you remove people from
carbohydrate<00:01:00.149> processed<00:01:00.510> carbohydrates<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
carbohydrate processed carbohydrates and

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.109 
carbohydrate processed carbohydrates and
also<00:01:03.899> sugar<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:04.979> cravings<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.909> because

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
also sugar you get cravings so because

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.609 
also sugar you get cravings so because
the<00:01:06.210> only<00:01:06.330> carbohydrate<00:01:06.990> she's<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.439> do

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the only carbohydrate she's actually do

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.910 

tablespoons<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.290> dessert<00:02:01.290> spoons<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.740> should

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
tablespoons of dessert spoons I should

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.370 
tablespoons of dessert spoons I should
say

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
say

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.770 
say
one<00:02:03.010> clearly<00:02:03.760> reasonable<00:02:04.360> another<00:02:04.570> good

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
one clearly reasonable another good

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.800 
one clearly reasonable another good
thing<00:02:04.810> about<00:02:04.990> 180<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.040> fact<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
thing about 180 is that the fact that

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.450 
thing about 180 is that the fact that
