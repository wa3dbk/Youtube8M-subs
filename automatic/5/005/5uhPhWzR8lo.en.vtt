00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:11.330
 Hi sg at Gon conversation school or something 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:14.349
 It is said that it is often used in the crank that doing something called that intermittent clutch 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.349
 I think I will see 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:33.119
 As there is no s-letter or crank like a school , close to you 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:33.119
 I will try to run assuming a clan walk using the parking lot site 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 Hmm 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.860
 I will start first 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.950
 Yes 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.230
 Called intermittent et al Tsude from Deko' 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.310
 Let Ttemi 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.820
 Yes 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.329
 High 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.399
 Foot phosphorus 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.399
 I guess I can't stand it 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.170
 Entered was 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.520
 Next time I will try to compare with the meter 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.520
 Start the upper agent 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.020
 You start 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.020
 There is but 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:58.220
 The random dance clutch is used when the speed is too fast even when running at idling speed with one pair 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.780
 I think it means both 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:11.300
 It feels like it feels like using a clutch to create 0.5 breath 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.810
 It's a method, but I'm off while clutching and running while coasting 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.330
 Also cut by a half-clutch before the car stalls 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.460
 I think it will be repeated class action 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.060
 I think that there are many scenes that cut the Hangul is a just place, such as s-shaped and crank 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.450
 But 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 The act of turning off the handle is increasingly running resistance by bending the diamond and at the same time bending the car 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.319
 So slow down the car 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.300
 Or it can say to be less likely to outgoing This large satin and curves 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.700
 But the same thing is said 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.890
 Therefore, if the half clutch is too sweet when the steering wheel is released, it will just stall. 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.230
 There is a high possibility of 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:58.890
 As a knack I think that the sound is on when you do half clutch in the video, but a little 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.890
 I think that it is the point to do the glide half clutch with a shock
