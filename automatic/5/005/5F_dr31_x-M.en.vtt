anything undelete nothing they can walk

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.570 
anything undelete nothing they can walk
away<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.890> thing<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.400> thought

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
away it's it in the thing is I thought

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.250 
away it's it in the thing is I thought
it<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.700> going<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.000> too<00:02:30.209> long<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.870> just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
it was going to be too long but just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.960 
it was going to be too long but just
because<00:02:31.440> he<00:02:31.739> switched<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.190> up<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.459> he<00:02:32.520> changed

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
because he switched it up and he changed

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.479 
because he switched it up and he changed
it<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:34.380> different<00:02:34.530> places<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.220> thought<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
it up to different places I thought it

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.920 
it up to different places I thought it
was<00:02:35.610> interesting<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.330> ultimately<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.900> think

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
was interesting and ultimately I think

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.800 
was interesting and ultimately I think
four<00:02:37.440> minutes<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:37.860> not<00:02:38.010> too<00:02:38.280> long<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.880> did<00:02:39.570> think

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
four minutes is not too long I did think

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.430 
four minutes is not too long I did think
that<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.410> powering<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.670> inside<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.209> water<00:02:42.510> or

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
that the powering up inside the water or

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.199 
that the powering up inside the water or
the<00:02:43.500> pool<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.010> wherever<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> hell<00:02:44.550> he<00:02:44.790> was<00:02:44.910> I

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the pool or wherever the hell he was I

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.810 
the pool or wherever the hell he was I
assume<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.080> pool<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.530> was<00:02:47.250> freakin<00:02:47.610> cool

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
assume it's a pool that was freakin cool

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.190 
assume it's a pool that was freakin cool
i<00:02:48.030> look<00:02:48.209> like<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:49.470> cool<00:02:49.800> shot<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.930> i<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:52.170> that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
i look like a cool shot and i like that

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.110 
i look like a cool shot and i like that
he<00:02:52.410> broke<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.550> shot<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.000> he

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
he broke it up it's not a shot that he

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.759 
he broke it up it's not a shot that he
kept<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.510> there<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:56.269> consistently<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:58.530> let<00:02:58.680> it

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
kept it there for consistently to let it

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.259 
kept it there for consistently to let it
