00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
and then he'll try and increase his

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.880 
and then he'll try and increase his
protein<00:02:39.970> intake<00:02:40.390> by<00:02:40.959> eating<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.380> little<00:02:41.500> peanut

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
protein intake by eating a little peanut

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.460

butter it also works as a reward for him

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.320 
butter it also works as a reward for him
so<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.010> kind<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.280> unique<00:02:45.430> diet<00:02:45.820> for<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> dog
