00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
this stuff and also a black sharpie

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
this stuff and also a black sharpie
marker<00:00:34.920> anything<00:00:35.510> but<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.660> did<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.469> colored<00:00:38.100> mine

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
marker anything but I did I colored mine

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.700 
marker anything but I did I colored mine
with<00:00:38.760> Sharpie<00:00:39.360> probably<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> best<00:00:40.410> idea

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
with Sharpie probably not the best idea

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
with Sharpie probably not the best idea
because<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> runs<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.410> paints

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
because it runs out so I get some paints

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.410 
because it runs out so I get some paints
like<00:00:44.219> acrylic<00:00:44.550> paints<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.149> something<00:00:45.360> like

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
like acrylic paints or something like

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.040 
like acrylic paints or something like
that<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.890> um<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.789> yeah<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.780> only<00:00:48.930> my

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
that and um but yeah so this was only my

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.040 
that and um but yeah so this was only my
first<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.280> don't<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
first one so I don't know it's kind of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830 
first one so I don't know it's kind of
not<00:00:52.559> too<00:00:52.890> good<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.309> yeah<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.510> only<00:00:54.629> out

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
not too good but yeah so it's only out

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.240 
not too good but yeah so it's only out
of<00:00:54.870> poster<00:00:55.379> board<00:00:55.910> it's<00:00:56.910> pretty<00:00:57.120> sturdy<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
of poster board it's pretty sturdy it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.279 
of poster board it's pretty sturdy it
that<00:00:59.250> mean<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.550> thin<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.870> hangs

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that mean it's thin this one just hangs

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.840 
that mean it's thin this one just hangs
up<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> wall<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> double-sided

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
up on the wall so it's on a double-sided

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.780 
up on the wall so it's on a double-sided
one<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> double<00:01:05.129> sided<00:01:05.489> 1

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
one but if I was to do a double sided 1

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
one but if I was to do a double sided 1
i'd<00:01:05.970> probably<00:01:06.409> thicken<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.040> couple

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
i'd probably thicken it up and do couple

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.719 
i'd probably thicken it up and do couple
layers<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.909> poster<00:01:09.420> board<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.110> um<00:01:10.790> yeah<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.290> um

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
layers of poster board so um yeah and um

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
layers of poster board so um yeah and um
well<00:01:14.729> yeah<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> measure<00:01:15.900> each

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
well yeah you just got to measure each

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
well yeah you just got to measure each
inch<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.130> everything<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.400> haven't

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
inch and everything and so I haven't

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.660 
inch and everything and so I haven't
finished<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.869> yet<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.740> will

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
finished in this one yet but I will

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.749 
finished in this one yet but I will
pretty<00:01:24.119> quick<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.830> sometimes<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.580> want

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
