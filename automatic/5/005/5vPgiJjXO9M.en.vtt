00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.020
 good companions and lovers of the mixture 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.340
 Here I bring you a video that has been how 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.230
 fight with efe the video I'm explaining 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.910
 a couple of things that for me from my 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.789
 point of view are fundamental to the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.250
 time to work 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.800
 is the first and what we have to have 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.079
 very clear is what many people call 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 the traffic jam that at the moment in which 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.300
 It stings we keep the cane and stick a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.149
 dry blow without brutality is I'm not going to 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.280
 make cane paste lies the blame 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.260
 we hit a blow dry and we work 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.489
 of the fish or to bury them with the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.559
 leaks in the mouth or on the skin 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.690
 this is important to do because many 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.789
 species 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.489
 has the side of the lower jaw and 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.070
 superior so hard that if we do not hit 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.100
 the tranco do not love them and pictures 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.930
 Halfway through the fight, we lose a bit of 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.329
 tension and it was released we were left not 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.850
 I know what is going on I do not understand 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.640
 precisely because of this does not mean that 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.009
 doing this we are always going to take out 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.210
 fish for one reason or another many 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.900
 times 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.610
 we lose some capture but doing 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.610
 this can show the following 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.479
 video we make sure in most of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.479
 the vital cases 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:38.480
 well then I'm going to show you a 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.300
 fight with a dog of 14 kilos 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.680
 Well, I 'll explain what it is 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.680
 I was doing during that fight 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.430
 good fellows because as you have seen 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.319
 in the video is a fight with a pcr like 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.660
 I already commented before and good to see that 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.420
 when the silverside catches and sets 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.190
 hit a race to see what I 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.660
 I do is always keep at all times 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.100
 the cane 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.860
 think 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.370
 without letting go of the attention that the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.409
 braided 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.700
 just when the fish so that I 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.459
 what I do is that I start pumping 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.670
 we pick up pumping again pumped is 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.220
 this we think back we pick 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.799
 we think back we pick that the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.079
 fish wants to run again as 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.400
 you know, let's say I catch and I'm back 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.439
 measuring 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.569
 always fixing me diaz where he's going in 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.360
 this case goes to inside but there is a 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.069
 moment in the final fight or else that the 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.530
 dry fish does not go to the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.629
 right and fix that I put the street 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.069
 to the left in two appreciation but 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.470
 I then give him a small 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.109
 pointer touch and the silverside in this 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.329
 case when giving the small one where before 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.220
 take and turn around and come back again 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.050
 toward the left 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.900
 this is one thing that I recommend that 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.670
 if they are going to do it when they have 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.550
 experience there are many people if in this 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.310
 case pejerrey bars doubt lights 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.590
 pretty of the Atlantic and others is thesis 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.840
 that when they for example go to the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.460
 left or right we put 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.100
 long in the opposite direction we give 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.799
 a little blow and I do not know if the pain 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.290
 because very useful the fish turns around 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.100
 in many cases there are times that it does not 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.650
 follow 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.300
 it is a road but there is already in this case 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.620
 we started to control the brake and such 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.570
 because we should never ever let the 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.610
 fish what the fish wants 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.530
 we always have to master the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.940
 fight at all times not to be 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.620
 logically since it's something 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.240
 exaggeratedly very big and we do not have 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.500
 team to master it but good those 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.870
 cases are already very rare 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.340
 and little more I this video the truth that 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.710
 I hope it has helped you a lot 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.720
 people I 've always seen that one of the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.450
 best ways to learn is losing 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.200
 fish that I have very clear before 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.990
 to minimize as much as possible 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.660
 loss of capture I could not hit a 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.030
 day to lose 4 5 or 6 sacks when 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:11.220
 I was starting mostly for him 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.530
 at the time of stride and then as one 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.720
 with experience little by little 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.330
 already learning in the next video 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.370
 explain some things related to 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.900
 the brake spool and the braid that 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.700
 It has a lot to do 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.180
 and this 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.729
 a little bit of sawing fight of 4000 a 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.279
 pretty from the Atlantic 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.139
 so you can put a little more 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.249
 g 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.249
 a greeting mate
