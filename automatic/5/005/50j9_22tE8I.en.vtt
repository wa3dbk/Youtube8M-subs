Hello &amp; Welcome to Archana's Rasoi!

00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:06.008
Today I am going to show you how to make rava (semolina) thalipeeth (pancake).

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.487
You'll must be wondering, thalipeeth made from rava, is it possible? For that keep watching Archana's Rasoi! 

00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:27.105
These ingredients will make 2 thalipeeth (pancakes) comfortably. So let's have a look at what is required.

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:40.214
Oil, water for mixing, 1/2 bowl rava (semolina), 1 1/2 cup rice flour, 4-5 tsp grated coconut, 3-4 dried red chillies finely chopped.      

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:47.488
Salt according to taste, 3-4 chopped garlic cloves, 1 spring onion finely chopped and coriander according to requirement.   

00:00:47.721 --> 00:01:02.012
I am going to mix all these ingredients together. Rava, rice flour, coconut, dried red chillies, 
 salt, garlic cloves, spring onions and coriander with some water.    

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:06.756
I will add oil when making the thalipeeth (pancakes). So let's start mixing all the ingredients.

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:15.738
In a bowl, add 1/2 bowl rava (semolina), 1 1/2 
 cup rice flour, 3-4 tsp grated coconut. 

00:01:16.293 --> 00:01:31.723
Add 3-4 dried red chillies finely chopped, salt according to taste, 3-4 chopped garlic, 1 
 spring onion finely chopped and coriander according to requirement.    

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.461
Now add water according to requirement and start mixing. 

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:38.639
Add water if need be and in intervals. 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.560
The mixture is ready. I am going to heat oil in a pan. 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.940
The oil is hot, ensure to spread it evenly in the pan. 

00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.130
Put a ball of the mixture in the pan with your hands. 

00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:25.990
Use your fingers to spread the mixture in the pan. Do not use plastic sheets to make these pancakes.  

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:37.300
Try using a non-stick pan, to avoid these from sticking to the bottom. Let it cook for 2 minutes on each side.  

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.950
Fry it will on both sides. This thalipeeth is ready.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:50.900
Now I am switching off the gas and I will remove the pancake. 

00:02:57.068 --> 00:02:58.920
The delicious rava (semolina) thalipeeth (pancake) is ready. 

00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:07.710
This can be made so easily as most of these ingredients are in the house. So if your child is hungry, you can make instantly.
