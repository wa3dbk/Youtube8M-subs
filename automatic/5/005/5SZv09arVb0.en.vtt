00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.780
 hi how about here I'm in a new 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.059
 video and how you can see on screen 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.009
 I'm using windows 10 and I'm going to 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.380
 say how you can activate windows in the 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.360
 if you installed it because 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.259
 some problem will appear at the time of 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.210
 activate it if you see videos or something of them 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.529
 they do download a program or install 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 anything, do not do it because in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.480
 principle is not good and according to the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.660
 lido on the internet have come out a lot 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.150
 of files of this type that they tell you 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.910
 that activate it but that are not better 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.489
 do not do it 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.290
 and then there is a way to do it without 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.240
 need for any program or anything 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.350
 simply by entering a license 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.350
 what do you have 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.920
 the first one that does not work you use the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.769
 second 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.560
 then as you know and windows is 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.630
 activated when it is touching windows if 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.430
 you go here to the icon of this on the right 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.490
 next to what are the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.460
 notifications you give and click like this on 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.950
 all the options then you know this 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 window and just down here or it would come out 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 activate windows 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.760
 when I turned it off then it started to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.280
 activate online 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.840
 and if it comes out that is not practiced and that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.609
 try later 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.109
 no matter how hard he tries, he will always tell you 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.289
 the same as at this time not super 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.689
 active and believers later and with 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.119
 that message will give you a button that says 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.340
 see the error then you 'bandolier' 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.200
 know about the error because it will give you a code 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.969
 of error that I would love with that 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.420
 code so you can know what kind of 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:55.270
 mistakes then if this happens to you and what 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.090
 is to activate windows the one from vais to the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.500
 option that there is a tad lower than 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.080
 enter a new password 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.090
 then when you have the key 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.440
 you have to enter the one that I'm going to 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.440
 put down on screen 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.920
 OK 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.770
 because the one you are looking at below is the one 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.020
 you have to enter 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.450
 and if it works 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.750
 you have to enter the one I'm going to put 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.750
 now 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.230
 and then when a piece and one of the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.030
 two good passwords you give to activate 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.790
 and it will work 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.830
 when windows is activated, a 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.709
 message that you have put that has been activated 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.600
 and that you can already use windows or I do not know 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.209
 good the message that confirms you 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.420
 that is already activated I do not remember how 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.490
 it was but go 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.920
 it will be very clear that it is activated 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.190
 so when I bitch I made that window and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.750
 be back here because you would have it 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.020
 as I have it right now that we already 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.960
 the need to activate windows and 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.350
 if you go to the system 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.890
 neither will anything come out that is not 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.890
 activated ni 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.690
 Well that's it 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.690
 you just have to put it on 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.830
 for approximately solar of the new 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 windows pretty much changes the truth 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.400
 quite 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.720
 has some changes that are good and 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.460
 I do not know is not known 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.490
 so some are few he is the 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.710
 true but eye but good I think that 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.960
 apart from the icons that surely 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.150
 you can always change us 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.540
 you can create your own studies that's not 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.540
 there is a problem 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.740
 good there are programs that you can create and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.900
 what you see here seconds of this 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.640
 way and do not use any program 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.970
 rare 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.620
 yes mostly had a 27 and windows 8 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.870
 you should know since windows 10 what 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.100
 You will have free if you install it in the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.800
 first the good year before the first year 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.080
 and that's it, we'll see you in the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.400
 next videos with more information than 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.400
 go well until later
