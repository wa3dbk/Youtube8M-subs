their<00:01:17.070> BIOS<00:01:17.520> spelling<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:19.110> chances

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
their BIOS spelling right then chances

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.080 
their BIOS spelling right then chances
are<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.700> able<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.939> get

their<00:01:21.500> configuration<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
their configuration right this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
their configuration right this
motherboard<00:01:23.759> doesn't<00:01:24.299> work<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:25.409> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
didn't get my RAM correct the timing was

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.309 
didn't get my RAM correct the timing was
wrong<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> other<00:02:07.530> thing<00:02:07.920> was<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
work it will not boot it'll hear let's

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.670 
work it will not boot it'll hear let's
just<00:02:48.920> try<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:49.159> what<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.819> heck

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680

here<00:02:51.680> we<00:02:51.769> go<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.099> quick<00:02:55.099> test<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.700> an

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
here we go this is quick test this is an

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.800 
here we go this is quick test this is an
SSD<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.690> it'll<00:02:56.930> look<00:02:57.049> really<00:02:57.409> really<00:02:57.709> fast

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
SSD so it'll look really really fast

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
the board is slow see we're having to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.860 
the board is slow see we're having to
wait<00:03:02.180> here<00:03:02.590> kind<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.620> slow

cleared<00:03:59.470> old<00:04:00.470> fashioned<00:04:00.950> jumper<00:04:01.370> that's<00:04:01.640> cool

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
cleared old fashioned jumper that's cool

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.819 
cleared old fashioned jumper that's cool
I<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.420> quaintness<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:03.049> it<00:04:03.230> alright<00:04:03.620> here

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829

I like the quaintness of it alright here
we<00:04:03.860> go<00:04:04.480> one<00:04:05.480> more<00:04:05.660> time<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:06.680> is<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.920> defective

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
we go one more time this is a defective

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.890 
we go one more time this is a defective
board<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.030> it's<00:04:08.329> not<00:04:08.420> going<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:08.690> be<00:04:08.750> too

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
board so it's not going to be too

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:18.520 
board so it's not going to be too
exciting

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.699 

I've<00:04:18.980> tried<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.370> boot<00:04:19.519> off<00:04:19.640> my<00:04:19.880> USB<00:04:20.709> I've

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
I've tried to boot off my USB I've

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.470 
I've tried to boot off my USB I've
really<00:04:22.130> I've<00:04:22.340> really<00:04:22.670> tried<00:04:22.790> everything<00:04:23.150> I

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
really I've really tried everything I

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.120 
really I've really tried everything I
mean<00:04:23.600> it<00:04:23.750> comes<00:04:23.990> down<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.200> just<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.710> defective

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
mean it comes down to just a defective

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.170 
mean it comes down to just a defective
board<00:04:25.400> Oh<00:04:25.640> CMOS<00:04:26.540> fail<00:04:26.840> that's<00:04:27.170> great<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.910> if

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
board Oh CMOS fail that's great so if

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540 
board Oh CMOS fail that's great so if
we're<00:04:29.390> lucky<00:04:29.540> we'll<00:04:29.960> get<00:04:30.110> two<00:04:30.320> out<00:04:30.980> here's<00:04:31.370> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
we're lucky we'll get two out here's the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.680 
we're lucky we'll get two out here's the
drive<00:04:31.760> all<00:04:32.150> right<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:34.090> mean<00:04:35.090> this<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:35.330> this

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
drive all right so I mean this is this

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.930 
drive all right so I mean this is this
comes<00:04:35.990> with<00:04:36.230> Linux<00:04:36.950> right<00:04:37.160> here<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.730> is<00:04:37.790> the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
comes with Linux right here this is the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.600 
comes with Linux right here this is the
Linux<00:04:38.330> kernel<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.830> if<00:04:39.980> it<00:04:40.100> can't<00:04:40.280> boot<00:04:40.460> off

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
Linux kernel and if it can't boot off

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.060 
Linux kernel and if it can't boot off
this<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:42.500> know<00:04:42.730> you<00:04:43.730> can't<00:04:43.970> do<00:04:44.120> anything<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:45.070> I

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
this you know you can't do anything so I

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.400 
this you know you can't do anything so I
don't<00:04:46.310> recommend<00:04:46.910> this<00:04:47.000> board<00:04:47.260> right<00:04:48.260> now

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
don't recommend this board right now

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.670 
don't recommend this board right now
it's<00:04:48.590> about<00:04:48.710> sixty<00:04:49.400> six<00:04:49.940> dollars<00:04:50.120> plus<00:04:50.840> seven

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
it's about sixty six dollars plus seven
