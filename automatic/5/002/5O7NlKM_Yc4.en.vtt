look at a display there's resolution and
there's<00:00:17.520> ppi<00:00:17.940> ppi<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.690> called<00:00:19.050> pixels<00:00:19.560> per

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
there's ppi ppi is called pixels per

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.830 
there's ppi ppi is called pixels per
inch<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:20.490> many<00:00:20.699> pixels<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> cram

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
inch how many pixels can you cram

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.779 
inch how many pixels can you cram
together<00:00:22.050> per<00:00:22.500> inch<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.250> make<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> display

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
together per inch to make the display

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.519 
together per inch to make the display
look<00:00:24.000> great<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.420> really<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.230> kind<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.439> like

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
this big resolution you're cramming it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.240 
this big resolution you're cramming it
all<00:00:36.870> together<00:00:37.079> what's<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> happen<00:00:38.100> oh

really when you're cramming this

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.639 
really when you're cramming this
resolution<00:00:39.989> together<00:00:40.290> you're<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> get

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
resolution together you're going to get

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
resolution together you're going to get
really<00:00:41.010> crisp<00:00:41.370> images<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.390> those<00:00:42.540> pixels

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
really crisp images because those pixels

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450 
really crisp images because those pixels
don't<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.440> much<00:00:43.620> space<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> spread<00:00:44.370> out

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
don't have as much space to spread out

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.639 
don't have as much space to spread out
and<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.780> droid<00:00:46.020> DNA<00:00:46.469> on

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and this is actually the droid DNA on

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.130 
and this is actually the droid DNA on
verizon<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.910> its<00:00:48.239> main<00:00:48.539> features<00:00:48.750> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
verizon and it's its main features this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.920 
verizon and it's its main features this
1080p<00:00:49.770> display<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.640> 1080p<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> known<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.780> can

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
1080p display now 1080p is known you can

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.100 
1080p display now 1080p is known you can
get<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.260> Smart<00:00:52.980> TVs<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.670> big<00:00:54.480> displays<00:00:54.899> like

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
get it on Smart TVs a big displays like

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.529 
get it on Smart TVs a big displays like
this<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.530> big<00:00:56.010> big<00:00:56.309> displays<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.120> 1080p

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this so big big displays have this 1080p

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.660 
this so big big displays have this 1080p
resolution<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.260> look<00:00:58.469> good<00:00:58.670> imagine

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
resolution so they look good imagine

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.029 
resolution so they look good imagine
taking<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.059> big<00:01:00.359> display<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> crunching<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
taking this big display and crunching it

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.130 
taking this big display and crunching it
down<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:02.940> phone<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.870> expect

down to your phone so you would expect

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
down to your phone so you would expect
images<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> look<00:01:05.460> great

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
images are just going to look great

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.899 
images are just going to look great
crystal<00:01:06.299> clear<00:01:06.479> exactly<00:01:06.920> ok<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
crystal clear exactly ok so we have so

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.539 
crystal clear exactly ok so we have so
we<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.210> different<00:01:09.479> options<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.780> retina

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
we have different options here retina

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
we have different options here retina
1080p<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.080> 720p<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
1080p and then 720p what kind of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
1080p and then 720p what kind of
difference<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.909> between<00:01:14.939> 720<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.990> 1080

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
difference is there between 720 and 1080

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.080 
difference is there between 720 and 1080
right<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:16.979> X<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.790> many<00:01:17.909> out

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
right there's X there are so many out

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
the different types of display this is
the<00:01:30.869> iphone<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.710> left<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the iphone on the left and this is the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.140 
the iphone on the left and this is the
galaxy<00:01:33.030> s3<00:01:33.420> HTC<00:01:34.350> One<00:01:34.530> X<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> Nokia<00:01:35.250> Lumia<00:01:35.280> 900

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
galaxy s3 HTC One X and Nokia Lumia 900

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450 
galaxy s3 HTC One X and Nokia Lumia 900
so<00:01:36.630> first<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.860> where<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> pixels

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so first there this is where the pixels

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.370 
so first there this is where the pixels
per<00:01:38.610> inch<00:01:38.640> comes<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.180> handy<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.960> Apple<00:01:40.259> did

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
per inch comes in handy what Apple did

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
per inch comes in handy what Apple did
is<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.860> their<00:01:41.040> resolution<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.700> only<00:01:41.909> 6

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
is actually their resolution is only 6

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
is actually their resolution is only 6
40<00:01:42.630> p<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.220> you're<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.460> even<00:01:44.759> at

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
40 p so you don't you're not even at

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
40 p so you don't you're not even at
720p<00:01:45.420> yet<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.140> even<00:01:46.350> HD<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:46.829> why

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
720p yet so it's not even HD but why

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
720p yet so it's not even HD but why
does<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.220> look<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.670> good<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.600> because

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
does it look so good that's because

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.380 
does it look so good that's because
they've<00:01:49.110> crammed<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:49.979> actually

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
they've crammed in a lot it's actually

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.260 
they've crammed in a lot it's actually
326<00:01:51.390> ppi<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.500> they're<00:01:52.649> actually<00:01:52.770> taking<00:01:53.270> 326

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
326 ppi so they're actually taking 326

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.840 
326 ppi so they're actually taking 326
pixels<00:01:54.470> cramming<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.590> per<00:01:55.950> inch<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.460> that's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pixels cramming them per inch and that's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.789 
pixels cramming them per inch and that's
why<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.450> great<00:01:57.810> great<00:01:58.409> display

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
why you get this great great display

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.190 
why you get this great great display
without<00:01:59.119> cramming<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.210> big<00:02:00.390> resolution<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
without cramming that big resolution on

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.969 
without cramming that big resolution on
the<00:02:01.799> galaxy<00:02:02.189> s3<00:02:02.579> 720p<00:02:03.450> display<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.380> why<00:02:04.649> does

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the galaxy s3 720p display so why does

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.679 
the galaxy s3 720p display so why does
it<00:02:05.100> look<00:02:05.130> worse<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.479> higher

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
it look worse if it's a higher

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.990 
it look worse if it's a higher
resolution<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.560> doesn't<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.429> much<00:02:08.580> ppi

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
resolution it doesn't have as much ppi

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.420 
resolution it doesn't have as much ppi
as<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.899> iphone<00:02:10.229> does<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.590> what's<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.310> down

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
as the iphone does so what's going down

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.250 
as the iphone does so what's going down
here<00:02:11.489> with

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
here with

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.890 
here with
it's<00:02:13.189> kind<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.400> low<00:02:13.640> end<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.030> both<00:02:14.299> specs<00:02:14.659> of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
it's kind of low end on both specs of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780 
it's kind of low end on both specs of
the<00:02:15.349> resolutions<00:02:15.950> kind<00:02:16.129> of<00:02:16.189> low<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.519> ppi

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the resolutions kind of low and the ppi

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.130 
the resolutions kind of low and the ppi
is<00:02:16.909> kind<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.180> oh<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.299> can<00:02:17.450> actually<00:02:17.629> start<00:02:18.079> to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
is kind of oh you can actually start to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.619 
is kind of oh you can actually start to
see<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.950> individual<00:02:19.489> red<00:02:19.790> yellow<00:02:20.209> green<00:02:20.360> and

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
see the individual red yellow green and

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.259 
see the individual red yellow green and
blue<00:02:20.810> pixels<00:02:21.409> that<00:02:21.560> make<00:02:21.890> up<00:02:22.099> an<00:02:22.430> image<00:02:22.610> so

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
blue pixels that make up an image so

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.520 
blue pixels that make up an image so
when<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.629> start<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.989> see<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.260> pixel

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
when you start to see that pixel

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.229 
when you start to see that pixel
separation<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.189> they're<00:02:25.310> not<00:02:25.489> as<00:02:25.700> many

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
separation and they're not as many

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.750 
separation and they're not as many
pixels<00:02:26.629> together<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.890> know<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.310> it's<00:02:28.519> it's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
pixels together you know that it's it's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.580 
pixels together you know that it's it's
going<00:02:28.909> to<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.090> an<00:02:29.180> okay<00:02:29.480> display<00:02:29.870> but<00:02:30.349> it's<00:02:30.470> not

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
going to be an okay display but it's not

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.780 
going to be an okay display but it's not
going<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.769> be<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.010> greatest<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.459> can<00:02:31.640> get

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
going to be the greatest you can get

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.580 
going to be the greatest you can get
okay<00:02:32.269> so<00:02:32.329> i<00:02:32.540> had<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.930> put<00:02:33.049> you<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.230> spot<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
okay so i had to put you on the spot and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.979 
okay so i had to put you on the spot and
make<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.099> choose<00:02:34.310> your<00:02:34.519> favorite<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.269> do<00:02:35.900> you

make you choose your favorite but do you

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.569 
make you choose your favorite but do you
lean<00:02:36.260> towards<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.799> iphone<00:02:37.159> then<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.489> it

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
lean towards the iphone then when it

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.849 
lean towards the iphone then when it
comes<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:38.030> actual<00:02:38.209> display<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.290> there<00:02:39.680> i

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
comes to actual display on there i

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.380 
comes to actual display on there i
actually<00:02:40.340> don't<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:40.640> one<00:02:41.030> preferred

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
actually don't have one preferred

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.729 
actually don't have one preferred
preference<00:02:41.720> i<00:02:41.780> actually<00:02:42.049> after<00:02:42.319> using<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
preference i actually after using the

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.800 
preference i actually after using the
droid<00:02:42.950> DNA<00:02:43.370> i<00:02:43.549> really<00:02:44.060> found<00:02:44.209> i<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:44.629> like

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
droid DNA i really found i really like

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.750 
droid DNA i really found i really like
the<00:02:44.930> 1080p<00:02:45.319> display<00:02:45.769> it's<00:02:45.920> like<00:02:46.040> taking<00:02:46.549> a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
the 1080p display it's like taking a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.759 
the 1080p display it's like taking a
smart<00:02:47.299> TV<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.720> cramming<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.200> right<00:02:48.379> onto<00:02:48.530> your

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
smart TV and cramming it right onto your

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.890 
smart TV and cramming it right onto your
device<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.549> also<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:50.060> i<00:02:50.239> do<00:02:50.359> really<00:02:50.690> like

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
device but I also do i do really like

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.809 
device but I also do i do really like
the<00:02:51.079> iphones<00:02:51.500> display<00:02:51.920> i<00:02:52.069> mean<00:02:52.220> even<00:02:52.370> though

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
the iphones display i mean even though

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.059 
the iphones display i mean even though
it's<00:02:52.970> not<00:02:53.180> HD<00:02:53.510> resolution<00:02:54.349> they<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:54.859> did<00:02:55.010> a

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
it's not HD resolution they really did a

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.530 
it's not HD resolution they really did a
great<00:02:55.220> job<00:02:55.340> with<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.760> pixels<00:02:56.120> per<00:02:56.239> inch<00:02:56.269> and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
great job with the pixels per inch and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.599 
great job with the pixels per inch and
just<00:02:56.750> making<00:02:57.019> those<00:02:57.139> color<00:02:57.739> saturation<00:02:58.280> looks

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
just making those color saturation looks

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.430 
just making those color saturation looks
really<00:02:58.879> good<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.329> colors<00:02:59.510> actually<00:02:59.930> look

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
really good so the colors actually look

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.809 
really good so the colors actually look
real<00:03:00.680> than<00:03:00.889> what<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.159> would<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.459> like<00:03:01.609> in

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
real than what you would see like in

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.240 
real than what you would see like in
real<00:03:02.000> life<00:03:02.090> yeah<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.930> mean<00:03:02.989> both<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.859> them<00:03:04.099> have

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
real life yeah I mean both of them have

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.710 
real life yeah I mean both of them have
great<00:03:04.459> displays<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:05.090> would<00:03:05.209> really<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.599> to

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
great displays you would really have to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.449 
great displays you would really have to
see<00:03:05.930> for<00:03:05.959> yourself<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.590> mean<00:03:06.739> obviously<00:03:07.069> the

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
see for yourself I mean obviously the

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.830 
see for yourself I mean obviously the
viewers<00:03:07.730> won't<00:03:07.849> be<00:03:08.030> able<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.269> tell<00:03:08.450> really<00:03:08.629> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
viewers won't be able to tell really the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.839 
viewers won't be able to tell really the
difference<00:03:08.959> as<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.440> can<00:03:09.680> just<00:03:10.250> close<00:03:10.459> up<00:03:10.519> so

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
difference as you can just close up so

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.970 
difference as you can just close up so
really<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.569> into<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.840> store<00:03:12.230> find<00:03:12.829> your

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
really go into a store find your

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.129 
really go into a store find your
favorite<00:03:13.280> device<00:03:13.549> find<00:03:14.000> what<00:03:14.180> display<00:03:15.079> you

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
favorite device find what display you

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.720 
favorite device find what display you
actually<00:03:15.500> like<00:03:15.590> maybe<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.579> color

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
actually like maybe you like the color

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.550 
actually like maybe you like the color
saturation<00:03:17.030> better<00:03:17.720> than<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.019> iphone<00:03:18.049> maybe

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
saturation better than the iphone maybe

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.110 
saturation better than the iphone maybe
you<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.949> iphone<00:03:19.250> better<00:03:19.430> than<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.699> s3

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
you like the iphone better than the s3

you like the iphone better than the s3
it's<00:03:20.480> really<00:03:20.840> up<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.109> you<00:03:21.139> a<00:03:21.319> lot<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.680> options

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
it's really up to you a lot of options

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.589 
it's really up to you a lot of options
out<00:03:22.160> there<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.819> this<00:03:22.970> something<00:03:23.269> that's<00:03:23.389> going

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
out there is this something that's going

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.770 
out there is this something that's going
to<00:03:23.750> keep<00:03:23.900> improving<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:25.459> every<00:03:26.359> i<00:03:26.540> mean

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
to keep improving just every i mean

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.629 
to keep improving just every i mean
basically<00:03:26.959> as<00:03:27.470> time<00:03:27.709> goes<00:03:27.889> on<00:03:28.040> i<00:03:28.310> mean<00:03:28.430> are<00:03:28.549> we

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
basically as time goes on i mean are we

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.619 
basically as time goes on i mean are we
gonna<00:03:28.760> get<00:03:28.879> to<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> point<00:03:29.239> where<00:03:29.480> it

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
gonna get to the point where it

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.390 
gonna get to the point where it
basically<00:03:29.750> i<00:03:30.049> mean<00:03:30.349> looks<00:03:30.949> like<00:03:31.129> you're<00:03:31.280> just

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
basically i mean looks like you're just

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.159 
basically i mean looks like you're just
looking<00:03:31.699> at<00:03:31.879> it<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.329> actually<00:03:32.690> has<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> great

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
looking at it that actually has a great

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.020 
looking at it that actually has a great
point<00:03:33.410> when<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.190> start<00:03:34.489> cramming<00:03:34.790> this

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
point when you start cramming this

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.789 
point when you start cramming this
resolution<00:03:35.449> your<00:03:35.690> i<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:36.079> only<00:03:36.169> see<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.680> much

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
resolution your i can only see so much

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.069 
resolution your i can only see so much
pixels<00:03:37.280> per<00:03:37.459> inch<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.150> when<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.389> I<00:03:38.690> believe

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
pixels per inch so when you I believe

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.559 
pixels per inch so when you I believe
326<00:03:40.010> actually<00:03:40.310> exceeds<00:03:40.819> already<00:03:41.180> what<00:03:41.389> are

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
326 actually exceeds already what are

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.720 
326 actually exceeds already what are
human<00:03:41.900> eye<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.500> retina<00:03:42.709> that's<00:03:43.099> why<00:03:43.250> that's

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
human eye the retina that's why that's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.890 
human eye the retina that's why that's
actually<00:03:44.000> why<00:03:44.090> they<00:03:44.209> named<00:03:44.419> it<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.569> retina

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
actually why they named it the retina

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.569 
actually why they named it the retina
display<00:03:45.199> cuz<00:03:45.500> for<00:03:45.680> our<00:03:45.769> retinas<00:03:46.099> but<00:03:46.489> the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
display cuz for our retinas but the

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.129 
display cuz for our retinas but the
retina<00:03:46.879> can<00:03:47.030> actually<00:03:47.359> not<00:03:47.569> see<00:03:47.840> anything

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
retina can actually not see anything

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.740 
retina can actually not see anything
higher<00:03:48.819> there's<00:03:49.819> like<00:03:49.970> there's<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.299> set<00:03:50.540> limit

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
higher there's like there's a set limit

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.170 
higher there's like there's a set limit
this<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.169> andrey<00:03:52.040> still<00:03:52.280> I'm<00:03:52.430> ever<00:03:52.609> yeah<00:03:52.940> the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
this is andrey still I'm ever yeah the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.729 
this is andrey still I'm ever yeah the
displays<00:03:53.540> are<00:03:53.660> actually<00:03:53.930> pushing<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.379> limit

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
displays are actually pushing that limit

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.530 
displays are actually pushing that limit
so<00:03:55.099> if<00:03:55.250> they<00:03:55.400> were<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.609> actually<00:03:55.790> increase<00:03:56.419> the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
so if they were to actually increase the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.629 
so if they were to actually increase the
resolution<00:03:56.870> we<00:03:57.470> would<00:03:57.620> barely<00:03:57.859> notice<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.459> so

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
resolution we would barely notice it so

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.490 
resolution we would barely notice it so
really<00:03:58.909> is<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.239> is<00:03:59.389> it<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.930> stopping<00:04:00.349> point<00:04:00.409> I

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
really is it is it a stopping point I

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.720 
really is it is it a stopping point I
mean<00:04:00.620> they're<00:04:00.799> obviously<00:04:01.159> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.459> continue

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
mean they're obviously going to continue

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.670 
mean they're obviously going to continue
to<00:04:01.879> improve<00:04:02.359> yeah<00:04:02.659> but<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:02.959> mean<00:04:03.079> resolution

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
to improve yeah but I mean resolution

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.069 
to improve yeah but I mean resolution
PPI<00:04:04.010> wise<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.489> think<00:04:04.909> we've<00:04:05.060> kind<00:04:05.329> of<00:04:05.389> hit<00:04:05.540> it

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
PPI wise I think we've kind of hit it

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.110 
PPI wise I think we've kind of hit it
hit<00:04:06.349> it<00:04:06.379> smacks<00:04:06.739> ya<00:04:07.069> really<00:04:07.579> interesting

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
hit it smacks ya really interesting

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.460 
hit it smacks ya really interesting
