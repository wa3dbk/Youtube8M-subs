00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.929
 all day 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.929
 one month and in arrears 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.969
 besides doing 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.560
 my mother is not 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.640
 they have not reached or the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.569
 but everything goes as far as 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.569
 in the Senate 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.239
 cnn a 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.239
 maradona was said so essential 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920
 very well i the world 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 without it there is nothing to do 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.990
 the law be 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.860
 win the derby 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.030
 while I am there in that year 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 the scene morán 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.940
 nobody understands 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.630
 in the second 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.040
 I'm nothing 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.560
 nobody argued 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.680
 Manila 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 in my life 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 all there is nothing 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.870
 say it 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.970
 doubt among others 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.010
 mendoza 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 until there nothing else ends well 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 many mothers 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 from the in the monumental 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.670
 in the morning of yesterday 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.100
 the on the side by sinaloa 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 said tona 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.140
 we have put the contrast in the fifth after being 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.280
 so you can sing not a woman's voice 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.940
 at first 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.610
 next to the driver 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.799
 there is a 2 in closing a circle after 0 1 3 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.140
 that only means the following the 2 means the second test 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.580
 the zero 1 and 3 and mystic 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.530
 anahí in 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.130
 what is this is essentially the beginning of the song why not the one 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.479
 you go well 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 with the voice well placed and at the correct height 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.219
 how is it for a woman's voice then for 101 to have to enter 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.489
 more than 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.439
 workers 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.799
 everyone enjoys the current levels of the coast 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.250
 is going to sing a man who has just removed to Seville the capo fret 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.250
 especially sing here 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.039
 zerolo about 3 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.469
 everything has 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.469
 we did not enjoy smoke 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.779
 in this case two hours did certification 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.909
 with this vote in the fifth 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.529
 there is a form of documentation that the rhythmic way but in this case we have 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:58.739
 used in the 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.579
 the free tissue shape 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.989
 that is, we do not have a defined PC 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.989
 if we not only respect the bass line 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.919
 because the original rhythm for 100 more natural that should be followed via 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.109
 let's replace some of those guidelines taking 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.949
 this rhythm has always been internally 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.119
 not to lose 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.659
 percent and lack 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.639
 but 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.639
 doing a Cuyano free arpeggio the line of basses 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:40.139
 we are going to do again packages account how it moves with as headquarters to move 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.099
 bass line uu 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.489
 the first chord may be that they are older 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.679
 remember to decorate it as it did in previous months with 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:53.649
 sixth chord sometimes falls on other songs may they ask a 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.499
 only year and a half that does not allow variations 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.679
 but here we can 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:00.489
 we can not start with sun 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.989
 6a 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.989
 what do I think that has a lion 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.629
 the plot 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.629
 they forgive us 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.930
 one 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:33.469
 then we see that the framework of this fabric is simply and the line of 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.949
 work 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.719
 what do you have to follow 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.759
 ap this flavor version to me this one on the page 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.479
 41 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.729
 I feel better boleros
