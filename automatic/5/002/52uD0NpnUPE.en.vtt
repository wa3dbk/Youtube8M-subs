I<00:00:31.439> did<00:00:31.500> before<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.480> came<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.399> unexpected

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
I did before it just came so unexpected

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.150 
I did before it just came so unexpected
Roberto<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.899> decided<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> change<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.010> or

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
Roberto just decided to change it or

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.840 
Roberto just decided to change it or
just<00:00:39.020> according<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> Dino<00:00:40.469> murano<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.640> our

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
just according to Dino murano the our

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.580 
just according to Dino murano the our
style<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.420> kind<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> sum<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
style is kind of like a sum of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
style is kind of like a sum of
progressions<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:45.000> had<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
progressions and they had some kind of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.840 
progressions and they had some kind of
vision<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> beginning<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.280> create<00:00:47.670> this

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
vision from the beginning to create this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.049 
vision from the beginning to create this
brighter<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.230> focused<00:00:49.559> our<00:00:50.070> style<00:00:50.460> so

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
brighter and more focused our style so

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.700 
brighter and more focused our style so
apparently<00:00:51.390> they've<00:00:51.870> been<00:00:52.020> working<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
apparently they've been working on it

really fun in my opinion indie school
which<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> very<00:01:08.010> similar<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.430> school<00:01:08.820> too<00:01:09.030> when

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
which is very similar to school too when

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
which is very similar to school too when
you<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.780> look<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.140> another<00:01:11.100> very<00:01:11.729> nice

that activates and row motor have been

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.840 
that activates and row motor have been
talking<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.220> since<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> game<00:01:17.790> was

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
talking about since the game was

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
talking about since the game was
announced<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.810> apparently<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> same

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
announced it's apparently the same

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.460 
announced it's apparently the same
button<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> grind<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
button as the grind one I like that it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
button as the grind one I like that it
will<00:01:22.650> make<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> game<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.460> easier<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.030> play

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
will make the game a lot easier to play

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
will make the game a lot easier to play
and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.020> won't<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.380> able<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.770> miss<00:01:25.920> any<00:01:26.159> rails

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and you won't be able to miss any rails

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.030 
and you won't be able to miss any rails
now<00:01:26.880> pretty<00:01:27.210> much<00:01:27.330> we'll<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.350> how<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.710> works

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
now pretty much we'll see how this works

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
now pretty much we'll see how this works
but<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> basically<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:30.810> play

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
but I basically just think it will play

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
but I basically just think it will play
normally<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.850> been<00:01:33.030> really

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
normally I would have been really

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
normally I would have been really
annoyed<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> slam<00:01:34.740> button<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.220> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
annoyed if the slam button was like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.640 
annoyed if the slam button was like
square<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.150> place<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.619> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
square on the place here for then you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
square on the place here for then you
accidentally<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> slam<00:01:39.270> every

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
accidentally will do like a slam every

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.330 
accidentally will do like a slam every
time<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:39.930> try<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> kickflip<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:40.950> something

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
time we try to kickflip or something

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
time we try to kickflip or something

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
after Dino mentions this he basically

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
after Dino mentions this he basically
