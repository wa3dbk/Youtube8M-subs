ever<00:00:58.899> in<00:00:59.019> my<00:00:59.140> life<00:00:59.320> so<00:00:59.559> I<00:00:59.620> thought<00:00:59.800> I'd<00:00:59.949> just

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
ever in my life so I thought I'd just

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.130 
ever in my life so I thought I'd just
get<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.699> little<00:01:00.820> check<00:01:01.120> in<00:01:01.149> see<00:01:01.479> how<00:01:01.750> things<00:01:01.989> are

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
get a little check in see how things are

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.170

going

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.639 

smoke<00:01:07.180> cycle<00:01:07.570> here<00:01:07.720> that's<00:01:07.870> really<00:01:08.140> good

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
smoke cycle here that's really good

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.109 
smoke cycle here that's really good
the<00:01:09.950> hands<00:01:10.159> look<00:01:10.310> like<00:01:10.429> they're<00:01:10.609> picking<00:01:11.030> up

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
the hands look like they're picking up

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.660 
the hands look like they're picking up
quite<00:01:11.329> a<00:01:11.359> bit<00:01:11.509> of<00:01:11.539> school<00:01:12.289> color<00:01:12.530> very<00:01:13.250> nice<00:01:13.460> at

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
quite a bit of school color very nice at

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.349 
quite a bit of school color very nice at
the<00:01:13.700> stage

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
the stage

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.969 
the stage
more<00:01:15.049> than<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.259> expected

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.160 

so<00:01:18.579> I'm<00:01:18.670> probably<00:01:18.850> going<00:01:19.149> to<00:01:19.240> let<00:01:19.750> these<00:01:19.930> go

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
so I'm probably going to let these go

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.889 
so I'm probably going to let these go
for<00:01:20.439> at<00:01:20.530> least<00:01:20.829> one<00:01:21.159> hour<00:01:21.189> I<00:01:21.700> can't<00:01:22.479> even<00:01:22.659> beat

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
ready any certain that and I'll begin to

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.240 
ready any certain that and I'll begin to
check<00:01:25.630> for<00:01:25.780> doneness<00:01:25.990> at<00:01:26.259> one<00:01:26.439> hour<00:01:26.619> only

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.090 

very<00:01:47.909> nice<00:01:48.860> very<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:50.040> color

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

that's<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.110> doing<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.260> and<00:01:55.470> read<00:01:55.650> for<00:01:55.770> fun

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
that's just doing this and read for fun

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.220 
that's just doing this and read for fun
see<00:01:57.120> what<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.390> brings<00:01:57.680> check<00:01:58.680> back<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> other

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
see what it brings check back the other

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.310 
see what it brings check back the other
okay<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:01.280> are<00:02:01.310> back<00:02:01.700> just<00:02:02.570> check<00:02:02.810> one<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.230> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
okay we are back just check one in the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.500 
okay we are back just check one in the
breast<00:02:03.590> here<00:02:04.030> looks<00:02:05.030> like<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.300> showing

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
breast here looks like it's showing

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.110 
breast here looks like it's showing
about<00:02:05.660> 137<00:02:06.650> so<00:02:06.800> that's<00:02:06.950> about<00:02:07.250> right<00:02:07.790> it's

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.120 
about 137 so that's about right it's

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
about 137 so that's about right it's
obviously<00:02:08.540> not<00:02:08.750> cooked<00:02:09.020> but<00:02:09.260> well<00:02:10.190> on<00:02:10.369> its<00:02:10.520> way

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
obviously not cooked but well on its way

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.840 
obviously not cooked but well on its way
so<00:02:12.140> probably<00:02:12.800> give<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.040> another<00:02:13.190> half<00:02:13.280> an<00:02:13.700> hour

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
so probably give it another half an hour

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.560 
so probably give it another half an hour
at<00:02:14.120> very<00:02:14.510> least<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.050> check<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.440> again<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:17.450> you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
at very least to check it again it's you

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.680 
at very least to check it again it's you
know<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.900> camera<00:02:18.200> he<00:02:18.290> looks<00:02:18.470> like<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.710> can

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
know the camera he looks like you can

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.480 
know the camera he looks like you can
early<00:02:21.260> done<00:02:21.410> Cornish<00:02:21.710> hands<00:02:21.920> before<00:02:22.280> so

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
early done Cornish hands before so

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.210 
early done Cornish hands before so
really<00:02:23.180> exactly<00:02:23.570> sure<00:02:23.780> where<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.960> check

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
really exactly sure where to check

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.170 
really exactly sure where to check
assuming<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.490> like<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.670> chickens<00:02:26.000> so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
assuming it's just like the chickens so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.520 
assuming it's just like the chickens so
that's<00:02:26.330> one<00:02:26.540> bad<00:02:26.720> new<00:02:26.900> I'll<00:02:27.080> check<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.440> in

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
that's one bad new I'll check it in
