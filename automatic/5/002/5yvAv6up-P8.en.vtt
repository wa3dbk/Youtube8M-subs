00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 what the rockets drink from this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.770
 brand new of minecraft few nation 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 today I'm here in a video where it is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.740
 bring you a mod bar texture pack one 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.980
 stuff like that as a title track vi 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.460
 I want to bring the shaders mode is a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.920
 texture of the truth that comfortably sits 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.980
 dot com a simple textures vi 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.820
 I remember that this shaders is compatible 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.920
 with minecraft 0.10 zero point 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 the latest version released and maybe 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.840
 as you well know to install one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 texture pack must have block the user 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.530
 to have the latest version of brooke 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.210
 launcher then carefully download 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.489
 the right one or not doesn't start 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.989
 minecraft that myth this my see a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.450
 bit to analyze a little like this 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.600
 this mode to the bow will be given 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.899
 the water and the again changed me not 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 really like how it was changed 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.770
 when we have underwater ball will do 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.359
 I don't like this effect here 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 a lot because I preferred the effect that there is 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 normally in minecraft that you see 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.320
 all a bit darker then another 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.869
 effect that I don't like this here 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 some sand is really too gods 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.400
 colors too shot too high not me 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.400
 really like it but it's pretty nice 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.710
 other things that has been changed since 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.810
 these fashions are the caves now maybe 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 there is a cave what I think of here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.570
 in fact how to see if maybe I do a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.770
 comparison 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.200
 now with the shaders and so without without 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 nothing therefore as determined changes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.600
 a little bit the shadows really are fixed 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 look at the beautiful torches, however we say 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.790
 which is to be a first shaders is 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.490
 pretty nice has changed a nice 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.220
 some shadows and various shadows 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.619
 things even blogs changed like how 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.950
 the fab as you saw the sky and the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.799
 Trembling stars have not been changed 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.799
 the future I think will really come out 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.259
 many shaders because they will do and 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.780
 really cool things now maybe it was 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.010
 still here like the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.539
 the world so i am shaders it is so without 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.610
 shaders so there is a small one 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.440
 change that I liked enough 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.300
 so no video will end up here 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.760
 remember to leave a nice like there 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.670
 see this cricket to download the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.780
 fashions and try the ocean next to me and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.780
