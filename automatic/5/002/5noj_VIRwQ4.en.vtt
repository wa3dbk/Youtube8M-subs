00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
out though because I think this was

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.830 
out though because I think this was
promising<00:04:29.190> yes<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.150> had<00:04:30.270> good<00:04:30.480> vocal

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
promising yes and I had good vocal

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.640 
promising yes and I had good vocal
definitely<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:33.180> thing<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.870> didn't<00:04:34.560> quite

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
definitely the thing that I didn't quite

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.710 
definitely the thing that I didn't quite
like<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.550> know<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:35.970> look<00:04:36.180> really<00:04:36.510> pretty

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
like I you know I you look really pretty

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.750 
like I you know I you look really pretty
in<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.200> end<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.890> boys<00:04:38.070> look<00:04:38.340> really<00:04:38.610> cool

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
in the end and the boys look really cool

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.380 
in the end and the boys look really cool
as<00:04:39.150> well<00:04:39.420> but<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.290> staff<00:04:40.770> kind<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.700> clashed<00:04:42.060> in

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
as well but the staff kind of clashed in

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.820 
as well but the staff kind of clashed in
my<00:04:42.510> opinion<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.020> didn't<00:04:43.260> really<00:04:43.410> fit<00:04:43.620> together

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
my opinion it didn't really fit together

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.310 
my opinion it didn't really fit together
but<00:04:44.190> that's<00:04:44.430> just<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:45.000> outfits<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:45.900> then

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
but that's just the outfits and then

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.840 
but that's just the outfits and then
also<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.920> dance<00:04:47.160> yeah<00:04:48.030> why<00:04:49.850> especially

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
also the dance yeah why especially

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.460 
also the dance yeah why especially
because<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.210> wasn't<00:04:51.540> really<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.750> dance<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.350> was

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
because it wasn't really a dance it was

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.800 
because it wasn't really a dance it was
very<00:04:53.100> stepping<00:04:53.640> one<00:04:54.120> foot<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.690> other

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810
