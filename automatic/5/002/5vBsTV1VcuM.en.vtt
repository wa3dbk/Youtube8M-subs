so today I'm going to show you guys how
to<00:00:28.440> clean<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.770> protein<00:00:29.160> skimmer<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.700> very

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
to clean a protein skimmer at a very

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.190 
to clean a protein skimmer at a very
inexpensive<00:00:30.360> cost<00:00:30.930> and<00:00:32.989> here's<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
inexpensive cost and here's what a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.690 
inexpensive cost and here's what a
protein<00:00:34.410> skimmer<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:35.040> shouldn't<00:00:35.460> look

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
protein skimmer really shouldn't look

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
protein skimmer really shouldn't look
like<00:00:35.970> as<00:00:36.810> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.080> see<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.739> been

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
like as you can see it's really been

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.970 
like as you can see it's really been
abused<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.230> taking<00:00:40.590> care<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.800> him

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
abused and not taking care of him

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.960 
abused and not taking care of him
maintain<00:00:41.160> properly<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> could<00:00:44.430> take<00:00:44.700> care<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
maintain properly so could take care of

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.570 
maintain properly so could take care of
everything<00:00:45.360> taking<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.350> apart<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.430> can

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
everything taking it all apart you can

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.610 
everything taking it all apart you can
see<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> pump<00:00:48.120> needs<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.290> impeller

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
see the pump needs to get the impeller

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.340 
see the pump needs to get the impeller
needs<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.190> removed<00:00:50.580> so<00:00:51.080> everything<00:00:52.080> can<00:00:52.230> be

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
needs to be removed so everything can be

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.520 
needs to be removed so everything can be
soaked<00:00:52.940> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.480> distilled<00:00:54.989> white<00:00:55.470> vinegar

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
soaked in the distilled white vinegar

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.030 
soaked in the distilled white vinegar
and<00:00:56.360> RO<00:00:57.360> water<00:01:00.200> so<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.290> lay<00:01:01.470> it<00:01:01.530> down<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.950> the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
and RO water so you lay it down in the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.639 
and RO water so you lay it down in the
bucket<00:01:05.450> and<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.810> yourself<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:07.229> measuring

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
bucket and you take yourself a measuring

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.200 
bucket and you take yourself a measuring
cup<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:09.509> you're<00:01:09.660> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> fill<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> up

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
cup and you're going to fill it up

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:29.690 
cup and you're going to fill it up
exactly<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.509> cup<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.050> white<00:01:13.820> vinegar

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.070 

and<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.790> reason<00:01:31.000> why<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.240> recommend<00:01:31.360> using<00:01:31.780> RO

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
and the reason why we recommend using RO

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.780 
and the reason why we recommend using RO
water<00:01:32.440> is<00:01:32.680> just<00:01:32.890> because<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.250> extremely

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
water is just because it's extremely

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.380 
water is just because it's extremely
pure<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.110> don't<00:01:35.290> have<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.500> worry<00:01:35.680> about

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
pure and you don't have to worry about

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.260 
pure and you don't have to worry about
any<00:01:37.390> problems<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.280> can't<00:01:39.520> use<00:01:39.700> RO<00:01:39.940> water

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
any problems if you can't use RO water

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.720 
any problems if you can't use RO water
then<00:01:40.480> we<00:01:40.570> recommend<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.170> using<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:42.670> least

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
then we recommend you using at least

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.820 
then we recommend you using at least
some<00:01:43.090> sort<00:01:43.270> of<00:01:43.390> filtered<00:01:43.780> water<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.530> can<00:01:44.680> get

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
some sort of filtered water you can get

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.510 
some sort of filtered water you can get
it<00:01:44.920> from<00:01:45.040> your<00:01:45.190> local<00:01:45.250> supermarket<00:01:47.520> distilled

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
it from your local supermarket distilled

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.460 
it from your local supermarket distilled
water<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:49.680> exactly<00:01:50.680> what<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.010> recommend<00:01:51.520> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
water is exactly what we recommend to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.290 
water is exactly what we recommend to
use<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.250> mixture<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:58.030> now<00:01:58.180> we're

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
use to do this mixture so now we're

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.700 
use to do this mixture so now we're
going<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.450> have<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.110> sit<00:01:59.260> in<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.410> bucket<00:01:59.560> for

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
going to have it sit in the bucket for

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.040 
going to have it sit in the bucket for
24<00:02:00.190> hours<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.330> is<00:02:01.479> what<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.720> looks<00:02:01.900> like

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.150 
protein skimmer so after cleaning all
the<00:03:01.750> scum<00:03:01.989> off<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.470> want<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.800> make<00:03:02.920> sure

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
do now is place it all back in that

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.630 
do now is place it all back in that
bucket<00:03:33.290> obviously<00:03:33.860> make<00:03:34.010> sure<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.310> rinse<00:03:34.460> out

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
the bucket from all that old stuff that

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.040 
the bucket from all that old stuff that
was<00:03:37.370> in<00:03:37.520> there<00:03:37.730> cleaning<00:03:38.000> out<00:03:38.150> real<00:03:38.390> good<00:03:38.540> and

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
was in there cleaning out real good and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.420 
was in there cleaning out real good and
now<00:03:39.410> you're<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.680> gonna<00:03:39.770> fill<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.160> bucket

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
now you're just gonna fill the bucket

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.020 
now you're just gonna fill the bucket
back<00:03:40.610> up<00:03:40.850> with<00:03:41.210> your<00:03:41.840> RO<00:03:42.080> water<00:03:42.440> again<00:03:43.030> but

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
back up with your RO water again but

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.060 
back up with your RO water again but
this<00:03:44.150> time<00:03:44.210> with<00:03:44.570> no<00:03:44.600> vinegar<00:03:44.990> mixture<00:03:45.500> as<00:03:45.890> you

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
this time with no vinegar mixture as you

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.650 
this time with no vinegar mixture as you
can<00:03:46.190> see<00:03:46.310> how<00:03:46.400> clean<00:03:46.760> everything<00:03:47.270> already

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
can see how clean everything already

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.630 
can see how clean everything already
looks<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:48.470> what<00:03:48.620> we're<00:03:48.740> doing<00:03:48.950> here<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.430> we're

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
looks so what we're doing here is we're

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.460 
looks so what we're doing here is we're
just<00:03:49.790> wanting<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.150> make<00:03:50.990> sure<00:03:51.020> we<00:03:51.320> get<00:03:51.410> all

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
just wanting to make sure we get all

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.180 
just wanting to make sure we get all
that<00:03:51.650> vinegar<00:03:52.040> off<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.960> off<00:03:53.960> of<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.800> protein

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
that vinegar off of off of the protein

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.800 
that vinegar off of off of the protein
skimmer<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.760> pump<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.330> impeller

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
skimmer and the pump and impeller

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.880 
skimmer and the pump and impeller
because<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.200> don't<00:03:57.320> want<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.530> put<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.740> back

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
because you don't want to put that back

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.000 
because you don't want to put that back
in<00:03:58.100> your<00:03:58.130> system<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.650> then<00:04:00.770> you're<00:04:00.860> going<00:04:00.950> to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
in your system so then you're going to

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.650 
in your system so then you're going to
let<00:04:01.130> it<00:04:01.160> sit<00:04:01.460> like<00:04:01.610> this<00:04:01.640> for<00:04:01.970> another<00:04:02.120> 24

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
let it sit like this for another 24

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:19.180 
let it sit like this for another 24
hours<00:04:03.020> in<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:04.640> bucket<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.090> pure<00:04:05.390> RO<00:04:05.600> water

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.180 

and<00:04:19.640> after<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.150> 24<00:04:20.390> hours<00:04:20.900> this<00:04:21.860> is<00:04:22.040> what

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
and after that 24 hours this is what

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.030 
and after that 24 hours this is what
your<00:04:22.310> protein<00:04:22.640> skimmer<00:04:22.970> should<00:04:23.890> should<00:04:24.890> look

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
your protein skimmer should should look

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.260 
your protein skimmer should should look
like<00:04:26.740> nice<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.070> like<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.340> was<00:04:28.460> brand<00:04:28.700> new<00:04:28.880> out

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
like nice and like it was brand new out

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.750 
like nice and like it was brand new out
of<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.420> box<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:31.010> this<00:04:31.100> is<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.310> proper<00:04:31.610> way<00:04:31.730> of

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
of the box and this is the proper way of

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.220 
of the box and this is the proper way of
cleaning<00:04:32.090> your<00:04:32.270> protein<00:04:32.660> skimmer<00:04:34.930> as<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.110> can

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
cleaning your protein skimmer as you can

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.930 
cleaning your protein skimmer as you can
see<00:04:36.350> it's<00:04:36.470> not<00:04:36.590> very<00:04:36.860> difficult<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.490> you

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
see it's not very difficult and you

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.160 
see it's not very difficult and you
don't<00:04:38.090> really<00:04:38.210> need<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.450> whole<00:04:38.660> lot<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.990> be<00:04:39.110> able

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
don't really need a whole lot to be able

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.870 
don't really need a whole lot to be able
to<00:04:39.320> do<00:04:39.410> it<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:39.950> really<00:04:40.280> should<00:04:40.490> maintain

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
to do it and you really should maintain

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.550 
to do it and you really should maintain
your<00:04:40.970> protein<00:04:41.360> skimmers<00:04:41.780> they<00:04:42.050> should<00:04:42.350> be

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
your protein skimmers they should be

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.680 
your protein skimmers they should be
cleaned<00:04:43.720> really<00:04:44.720> well<00:04:46.240> every<00:04:47.240> couple<00:04:47.420> months

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
cleaned really well every couple months

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.000 
cleaned really well every couple months
and<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.960> reason<00:04:48.230> why<00:04:48.350> is<00:04:48.410> because<00:04:48.650> they<00:04:48.890> won't

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
and the reason why is because they won't

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.560 
and the reason why is because they won't
work<00:04:49.220> properly<00:04:49.250> they<00:04:50.030> won't<00:04:50.180> get<00:04:50.330> all<00:04:50.450> that

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
work properly they won't get all that

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.390 
work properly they won't get all that
scum<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.170> organic<00:04:51.590> compounds<00:04:52.070> out<00:04:52.190> of<00:04:52.310> your

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
scum and organic compounds out of your
