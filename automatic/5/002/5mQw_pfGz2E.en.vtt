00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.990
 including two 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.840
 omf dimensions not really the two 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.490
 best but okay it's the idea 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.439
 and level you get away on a jump 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.239
 want an ugly tram but sometimes you have to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 just when you achieve points of contact 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.110
 he finally knows how to go back 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.260
 come through a one when he the ball you god 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.820
 follow passes for 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 exactly for and then the ball 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.640
 eventually comes in with peralta 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.260
 their kind of nasi is a skill of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.610
 not really fascinate I just do 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.530
 as if but look at how the ball hits 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.570

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.890

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 many make 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.739
 oh in the end i'm very good at this 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.960
 three a tool 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.510
 no one but mangala from their tones 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.090
 and then I also go on to four one 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.720
 and come after these 4 almost no affect 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.720
 I go direction 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.140
 even though I did n't have a say 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.470
 this is tomato 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.010
 this is 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.760
 this is godfather it will eventually be 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.650
 5 5 and eventually even 7 2 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.570
 but while it gets you to the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 goals for people who watch the stream 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.620
 watching this fragment came very well known 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.510
 for namely always when I stream and I 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.920
 do it best often and it becomes 5 a move 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.330
 I always put that on I already have one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.310
 backup happening had him more 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.170
 nice things in streams and therefore want 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.190
 maybe a lot of people say that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.050
 not knowing 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.010
 extreme best of her so were you okay 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.930

 small videos of 15 seconds on youtube 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.390
 from joba now live but yes you can 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.800
 of course jean misses but in principle 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.270
 would therefore be informed 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.980
 we go so we would occasionally at 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.240
 if I do live stream then one of them 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.780
 those three things if you want it 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.670
 see 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.900
 after this very interesting story we are 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.280
 already arrived at the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.170
 next game where roelie 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.120
 beautifully will make a 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.320
 I also want to ask if you 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.300
 haven't thought of it yet 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.220
 of course the video has now come 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.440
 again on ba two ahead of ba 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.940
 ba apparently can't head but as well 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.590
 something fifa 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.600
 After those two around it is slightly again 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.160
 error if the animal yes quite random 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.480
 suddenly two becomes two that was really one 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.580
 second chance from that guest and that whole one 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.709
 game it was a grab me he 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.310
 was so deadly efficient was not 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.750
 normal 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.090
 I must of course handle it better 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.220
 chances and yes I know I did 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.989
 develop app for just put it 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.370
 fucking appie are still and then 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.010
 the three becomes two and four have years 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.330
 biryani eventually even becomes 4 2 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.790
 in the pentagon 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.500
 because yes those cross shots are just 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.390
 fucking appie and eventually i know 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.700
 also get used to this match with 4 2 and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.320
 that means three more dots there for 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 this division 5 and then we go again 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.440
 to 9 points 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.750
 And that's why it's going to look good 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.790
 9 out of three can't be better 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.709
 and then we go our next 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.530
 game and then come to this team 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.300
 just ate rolls naima ronaldo and how 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.739
 fucking a lot of good players and then know 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.570
 you this is going to be the first game since 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.220
 long time to really go 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.170
 to lose 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.700
 especially if you immediately arrived at one 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.370
 night then comes a moment later by one 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.530
 stripped someone everything to the right 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.540
 find out at 2 0 luckily I know 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.380
 hear a goal quickly to get you back 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.420
 to score 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.240
 how it finally goes yes okay 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.980
 but dad didn't make much 2 1 and then 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.390
 are you when they are not completely out of the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.490
 competition but less than 10 minutes later 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.500
 does he do so smart combination and then have 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.910
 you nothing and bring and yes as a hobby 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.670
 that ball like a sheet 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.690
 does not do anything about it height 3 one 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.810
 but fortunately 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.660
 I then go one behind those three 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.060
 putting a comeback here is people 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.420
 but with the three two and believe or lied 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.820
 not 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.330
 I am so into my game that I will such 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.350
 318 there against a team like this again by 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.340
 benzema 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.850
 can come back to three 3s as pia pia 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.820
 which in turn are cathode skill moves 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.140
 just come along for get goes 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.350
 benzema 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.700
 make his hat trick and is the 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.060
 comeback 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.060
 complete 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.310
 I have this quite often that I then 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.200
 suddenly 318 started and then suddenly I come 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.030
 once back until it comes back and all 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.680
 being came through five three 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.510
 by multimedia then I think to me what 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.100
 for I am doing a little later 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.620
 wishes but only the goal you 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.660
 for the 6 3 and then I think of what is there 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.650
 for why I have such a trouble because it 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.520
 is now boys f3 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:03.160
 but you know me and at times 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.350
 a 6464 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.560
 and it even becomes somewhat successful in the five 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.210
 true but you know me and you 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.860
 know it 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.510
 yes that I end up a competition 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.590
 is that the happy ending brain fair 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.240
 you all thought i would 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.160
 11 that I still immediately play them 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.540
 but no something in me i don't know what's there 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.860
 is only this kind 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.480
 competitions then already know that to a good 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.610
 end where it always comes first 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.950
 went wrong so far so luckily 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.380
 well and that means we are after 12 points 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.960
 go into vision 5 and that means that 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.790
 have already been promoted over four points and 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.470
 with 7 points even the title bar again 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.300
 comes with me in every division so far 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.890
 just that we also played the title 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.780
 cakes and this we actually begins 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.580
 again quite fine as chris 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.910
 way through is someone couple and him on the 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.800
 ground 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.960
 nice and then diaby who finally the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.060
 a whole inside tact and an empty goal 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.310
 I really just start the second half 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.600
 worse than you would expect 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.580
 clearly right here from the kick-off 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.500
 if he just combines, the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.180
 ball you eat we put oil back to 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.860
 stir it is the flash defend me 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.870
 filter hair and slide the ball back and 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.760
 corner for one and much worse for a moment 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.690
 later I just give my lead 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.520
 completely out of your hands 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.410
 because of two but the good thing is that 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.180
 I just have a check on the ground and 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.430
 this is what i get fantastic 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.290
 moment sharing so fantastic I found this 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.090
 moment not but I think my place 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.820
 is your cake illuminati 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.230
 forward could look or something because yes to this 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.870
 was not yet the fantastic moment 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.400
 madrid but after that fucking sick person 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.220
 safe unchecked I actually know 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.840
 make 2 2 anyway and then I think I have to 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.790
 Share this fantastic me of course 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.130
 not knowing that still live there 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.129
 fantastic moment was coming 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.139
 I was perhaps the 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.360
 whole whole second half worse me 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.270
 ultimately makes falls to you again 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.300
 just 3 2 in the 89th minute after just 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.569
 again a chic sea ​​of check but me 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.459
 was happy but logical 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.259
 but in the end the match was therefore 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:54.009
 so these laws can still be won 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:56.749
 so finally what I say again 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.119
 eventually the game ended in 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.709
