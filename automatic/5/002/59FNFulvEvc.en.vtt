00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.399
 Hi, I'm Claudia and today we are going to 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.980
 learn something really important to 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.720
 the face of your child and his teeth knew 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.520
 you that three out of four children 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.840
 they have their teeth piled up and 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.480
 maxillae developing 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.640
 incorrectly these problems can 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.830
 be very obvious to many parents and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.860
 their children from 3 to 5 years of age 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.080
 age the professional advice tells us that 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.090
 we should wait for that eruption in all 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.029
 permanent teeth and that should be 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.920
 treated with braces and extractions the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.019
 Most parents accept this 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.199
 advice and wait until your children 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.989
 have between 12 and 14 years to look 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.030
 the braces however many parents 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.829
 they have already experienced it and when 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.879
 Bridles are removed in the teeth 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.710
 these are again piling up mrc 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.379
 provides the parents of the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.719
 patients a more modern approach in 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.850
 relation to orthodontic treatment 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.850
 which is quite different from the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.030
 traditional orthodontics 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.100
 mrc in the last two decades has 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.770
 demonstrated why many children 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.560
 they develop dental stacking 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.810
 mrc has discovered that when the child 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.299
 have piled-up tooth signs 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.360
 He also has a bad facial development 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.420
 bad oral habits such as 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.850
 Atypical swallowing mouth breathing and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.030
 these are the main causes of 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.549
 condition the forces of the tongue the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.369
 cheeks and lips combined with the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.530
 bad oral habits can affect the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.340
 position of teeth and development 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.250
 facial a normal maxilla should 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.159
 look like this is shaped like that because the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.229
 tongue rests on the palate but 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.750
 when you breathe through your mouth 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.509
 falls on the floor of the mouth and the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.569
 upper jaw becomes narrow and the 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.819
 teeth pile up when you the 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.970
 Buttocks are incorrectly made 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.310
 many movements with the lower lip 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.460
 then the teeth are pressed 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.550
 backwards causing stacking 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.280
 the trainer system corrects this so that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.410
 Your maxillary teeth and face are 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.540
 develop correctly let's observe 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.209
 this girl to see what happens when 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.300
 we change the incorrect position of the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.840
 tongue towards a correct position of 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.090
 immediately you see a big difference mrc 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.670
 has a treatment approach 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.010
 orthodontics based on a 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.470
 very extensive research 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.190
 the devices designed with the technology 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.739
 most modern mrc help correct 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.940
 these bad oral habits in the child in 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.040
 increase 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.250
 these devices improve the development 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.590
 facial and dental while correcting 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.860
 orthodontic problems early 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.600
 and in many cases without the need for 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.840
 the rings 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.350
 the trainer devices and the biggest brain of 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.580
 mrc have been used at present in 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.770
 More than 90 countries 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.170
 would not want your child to have a 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.470
 better facial development and your teeth 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.510
 rights in less time will depend on the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.110
 child in changing his bad habits 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.890
 myofunctional is a little more effort 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.960
 will provide us with results 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.710
 extraordinary for more information
