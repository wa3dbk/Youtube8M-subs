I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:53.440> most<00:00:53.590> everyone<00:00:53.830> was<00:00:54.130> not<00:00:54.430> happy<00:00:54.880> with

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
I think most everyone was not happy with

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.600 
I think most everyone was not happy with
the<00:00:55.060> fabric<00:00:55.480> that<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.690> got<00:00:55.870> stuck<00:00:56.080> with<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.520> if

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
the fabric that I got stuck with but if

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.890 
the fabric that I got stuck with but if
they<00:00:57.730> were<00:00:57.790> happy<00:00:58.150> and<00:00:58.180> saw<00:00:58.420> something<00:00:58.660> right

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
they were happy and saw something right

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.820 
they were happy and saw something right
away<00:00:59.020> it<00:00:59.200> wouldn't<00:00:59.410> be<00:00:59.500> very<00:00:59.590> much<00:00:59.800> a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
away it wouldn't be very much a

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:07.410 
away it wouldn't be very much a
challenge<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.400> challenge<00:01:06.910> is<00:01:07.030> really<00:01:07.060> to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
challenge so the challenge is really to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.630 
challenge so the challenge is really to
get<00:01:07.720> two<00:01:08.230> prints<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.860> don't<00:01:09.100> go<00:01:09.310> that<00:01:09.460> much

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
get two prints that don't go that much

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.760 
get two prints that don't go that much
together<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.660> come<00:01:11.230> up<00:01:11.350> with<00:01:11.440> something

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.470 
together to come up with something
that's<00:01:11.920> beautiful<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.490> end<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.330> was

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
that's beautiful in the end if it was

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.360 
that's beautiful in the end if it was
easy<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.890> wouldn't<00:01:15.190> be<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.310> challenge

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370
