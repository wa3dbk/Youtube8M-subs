but<00:01:41.329> you<00:01:41.450> could<00:01:41.569> actually<00:01:41.689> go<00:01:41.990> inside<00:01:42.229> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
but you could actually go inside the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.499 
but you could actually go inside the
actor<00:01:42.979> tree<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.279> go<00:01:43.729> up<00:01:43.819> inside<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.359> there's

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
actor tree of go up inside and there's

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.760 
actor tree of go up inside and there's
like<00:01:44.599> a<00:01:44.630> little<00:01:44.779> kinda<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.289> suppose<00:01:45.529> half

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
like a little kinda I suppose half

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.739 
like a little kinda I suppose half
museum<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:46.459> got<00:01:46.609> a<00:01:46.639> couple<00:01:47.299> of<00:01:47.419> things<00:01:47.569> there

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
museum it's got a couple of things there

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.929 
museum it's got a couple of things there
there's<00:01:47.989> a<00:01:48.049> store<00:01:48.529> in<00:01:48.919> there<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.399> there's

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
there's a store in there and there's

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.539 
there's a store in there and there's
also<00:01:50.149> like<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.509> camera<00:01:50.959> that<00:01:50.989> shows<00:01:51.349> a<00:01:51.549> straight

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
also like a camera that shows a straight

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.129 
also like a camera that shows a straight
down<00:01:52.819> so<00:01:53.209> you<00:01:53.299> can<00:01:53.450> see<00:01:53.569> people<00:01:53.899> that<00:01:54.049> are

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
down so you can see people that are

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:55.779 
down so you can see people that are
walking<00:01:54.529> underneath<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:55.099> I<00:01:55.219> it's<00:01:55.489> pretty<00:01:55.669> cool

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
walking underneath it I it's pretty cool

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.129 
walking underneath it I it's pretty cool
there's<00:01:55.999> a<00:01:56.060> lot<00:01:56.179> of<00:01:56.209> cool<00:01:56.419> things<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:56.929> at

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
there's a lot of cool things in it at

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.609 
there's a lot of cool things in it at

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
but that was definitely at one of my

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.469 
but that was definitely at one of my
favorite<00:02:00.979> things<00:02:01.159> that<00:02:01.369> we<00:02:01.489> done<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.969> Paris<00:02:02.359> we

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
night that was actually really cool that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.500 
night that was actually really cool that
learned<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.550> bit<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.730> all<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.270> bridges

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
learned a bit about all the bridges

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
learned a bit about all the bridges
along<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.020> river<00:02:21.170> sent<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.740> different<00:02:22.400> stuff

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
along the river sent and different stuff

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.330 
along the river sent and different stuff
like<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.290> mean<00:02:24.770> we<00:02:25.010> went<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.280> an

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
like that but I I mean we went to an

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.160 
like that but I I mean we went to an
austere<00:02:25.670> damn<00:02:25.820> at<00:02:26.090> castle<00:02:26.600> or<00:02:26.720> Notre<00:02:26.990> Dame

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
austere damn at castle or Notre Dame

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.740 
austere damn at castle or Notre Dame
however<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.740> say<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.910> went<00:02:29.090> knock<00:02:29.510> castle

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
however you say and we went knock castle

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.650 
however you say and we went knock castle
it's<00:02:30.050> not<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> castle<00:02:30.440> it's<00:02:30.709> at<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.340> church

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
it's not a castle it's at it's a church

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.729 
it's not a castle it's at it's a church
but<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:32.930> really<00:02:33.140> cool<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.680> a

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
but that was really cool it's a

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.310 
but that was really cool it's a
cathedral<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.340> suppose<00:02:34.580> but<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.480> was<00:02:35.600> pretty

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
cathedral I suppose but that was pretty

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.260 
cathedral I suppose but that was pretty
cool<00:02:36.650> as<00:02:36.860> well<00:02:36.890> we<00:02:37.280> did<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.459> lot<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.670> things<00:02:37.880> add

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
cool as well we did a lot of things add

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.330 
cool as well we did a lot of things add
but<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.080> thing<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.350> I'd<00:02:39.530> say<00:02:39.709> food<00:02:40.100> is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
but the one thing is I'd say food is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.380 
but the one thing is I'd say food is
probably<00:02:40.640> one<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> most<00:02:40.940> expensive

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
probably one of the most expensive

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.940 
probably one of the most expensive
things<00:02:41.810> over<00:02:41.989> there<00:02:42.080> that's<00:02:42.260> where<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.650> spent

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
things over there that's where we spent

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.610 
things over there that's where we spent
at<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.310> majority<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.269> our<00:02:44.930> money<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.530> was

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
at the majority of our money but it was

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.449 
at the majority of our money but it was
such<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.160> fun<00:02:46.640> place<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.480> go<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:48.230> was<00:02:48.530> just<00:02:48.920> like

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
such a fun place to go it was just like

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.310 
such a fun place to go it was just like
I<00:02:49.700> know<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.060> sounds<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.360> bit<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.510> suppose<00:02:50.870> cheesy

I know it sounds a bit I suppose cheesy
and<00:02:51.470> stuff<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.890> was<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.310> beautiful

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
a lot of more videos and what I suppose

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.520 
a lot of more videos and what I suppose
more<00:03:38.269> time<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.690> training<00:03:38.959> which<00:03:39.170> is<00:03:39.320> one

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
more time in the training which is one

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.130 
more time in the training which is one
thing<00:03:39.769> at<00:03:40.010> which<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.459> wish<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.480> had<00:03:41.660> more<00:03:41.810> time<00:03:41.870> to

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
thing at which I wish I had more time to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.270 
thing at which I wish I had more time to
do<00:03:42.230> is<00:03:42.380> training<00:03:42.769> because<00:03:42.920> i'm<00:03:43.040> actually

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
do is training because i'm actually

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.850 
do is training because i'm actually
decent<00:03:43.700> at<00:03:43.940> training<00:03:44.150> yeah<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.410> suppose<00:03:45.739> I

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
decent at training yeah but I suppose I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.280 
decent at training yeah but I suppose I
just<00:03:46.070> don't<00:03:46.220> get<00:03:46.340> enough<00:03:46.519> time<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:47.390> trade<00:03:48.140> all

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
just don't get enough time to trade all

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.350 
just don't get enough time to trade all
that<00:03:48.320> often<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.769> when<00:03:49.010> I<00:03:49.040> get<00:03:49.130> home<00:03:49.400> I'm

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
that often so when I get home I'm

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.420 
that often so when I get home I'm
actually<00:03:50.540> hoping<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.049> start<00:03:51.290> at<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.890> 1000

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
actually hoping to start at the 1000

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.160 
actually hoping to start at the 1000
