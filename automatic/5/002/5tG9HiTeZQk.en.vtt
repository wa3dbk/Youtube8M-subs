00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
so it looks like all the beat all the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.150 
so it looks like all the beat all the
buildings<00:00:15.690> they<00:00:15.870> start<00:00:16.230> at<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> home<00:00:16.859> once

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
buildings they start at the home once

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
buildings they start at the home once
and<00:00:19.310> there's<00:00:20.310> actually<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.760> timer<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.720> hero

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
basis and your towers and it seems like

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790 
basis and your towers and it seems like

so put everything in a corner fill up
everything<00:03:16.170> with<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> wall<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:17.010> then<00:03:17.280> just

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
everything with a wall and then just

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.380 
everything with a wall and then just
kind<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> pack<00:03:22.910> something<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.209> this

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
kind of like a pack something like this

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.490 
kind of like a pack something like this
and<00:03:25.350> then<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> goes<00:03:25.709> all<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.010> way<00:03:26.190> down

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.010 

so<00:03:32.040> we're<00:03:32.160> gonna<00:03:32.280> give<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.790> try

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
so we're gonna give this a try

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.280 
so we're gonna give this a try
and<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:36.010> was<00:03:36.460> actually<00:03:37.050> start<00:03:38.050> updating

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
and then I was actually start updating

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.660 
and then I was actually start updating
my<00:03:38.740> wall<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.370> didn't<00:03:40.240> realize<00:03:40.300> how<00:03:41.200> much<00:03:41.670> other

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
my wall I didn't realize how much other

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.030 
my wall I didn't realize how much other
badges<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.450> takes<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:46.320> already<00:03:47.320> got<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.890> level

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
badges it takes and already got to level

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.200 
badges it takes and already got to level

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
why it's good that you don't there's no

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.960 
why it's good that you don't there's no
like<00:04:17.730> timer<00:04:19.590> doesn't<00:04:20.590> take<00:04:20.950> like<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.760> upgrade

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
like timer doesn't take like to upgrade

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.810 
like timer doesn't take like to upgrade
your<00:04:22.270> wall<00:04:23.670> only<00:04:24.670> for<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:24.970> hero<00:04:25.390> basis<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.110> your

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
your wall only for a hero basis and your

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.590 
your wall only for a hero basis and your
magic<00:04:27.820> towers<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:29.670> think<00:04:30.670> magic<00:04:30.850> towers<00:04:31.420> are

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
magic towers I think magic towers are

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.570 
magic towers I think magic towers are
gonna<00:04:31.750> be<00:04:31.870> useful<00:04:32.380> because<00:04:32.620> they<00:04:32.950> can<00:04:33.130> stunt

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
gonna be useful because they can stunt

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.270 
gonna be useful because they can stunt
but<00:04:34.480> arrow<00:04:34.750> towers<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.590> don't<00:04:35.890> think<00:04:35.980> they<00:04:36.190> can

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
but arrow towers I don't think they can

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.060 
but arrow towers I don't think they can
be<00:04:36.400> much<00:04:36.610> useful<00:04:36.910> because<00:04:37.680> there's<00:04:38.680> gonna<00:04:38.830> be

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
be much useful because there's gonna be

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.140 
be much useful because there's gonna be
so<00:04:39.310> many<00:04:40.320> heroes<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.620> troops<00:04:42.250> coming<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.850> and

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
so many heroes and troops coming in and

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.220 
so many heroes and troops coming in and
I<00:04:43.560> think<00:04:45.030> parrot<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.180> was<00:04:46.360> gonna<00:04:46.540> do<00:04:46.810> much

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
I think parrot I was gonna do much

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.800 
I think parrot I was gonna do much
damage<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.860> them<00:04:48.270> but<00:04:49.270> then<00:04:49.420> I<00:04:49.540> don't<00:04:49.720> know<00:04:49.780> a

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
damage to them but then I don't know a

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.040 
damage to them but then I don't know a
level<00:04:50.200> Teddy<00:04:50.730> I'm<00:04:51.730> gonna<00:04:51.880> have<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.120> see<00:04:52.390> how

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
level Teddy I'm gonna have to see how

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.000 
level Teddy I'm gonna have to see how
much<00:04:53.230> damage<00:04:53.470> they<00:04:53.770> actually<00:04:53.980> gonna<00:04:54.130> do<00:04:56.010> but

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
much damage they actually gonna do but

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.150 
much damage they actually gonna do but
it's<00:04:57.250> good<00:04:57.490> because<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:59.200> higher<00:04:59.620> level

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
it's good because the higher level

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.040 
it's good because the higher level
they're<00:05:00.400> more<00:05:00.700> range<00:05:01.030> they're<00:05:01.270> gonna<00:05:01.420> have<00:05:01.720> so

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
they're more range they're gonna have so

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.980 
they're more range they're gonna have so
they<00:05:02.530> might<00:05:02.710> public<00:05:03.310> even<00:05:03.550> gonna<00:05:03.730> be<00:05:03.990> shooting

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
they might public even gonna be shooting

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.750 
they might public even gonna be shooting
across<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.470> whole<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:07.530> whole<00:05:08.530> map

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
across the whole the whole map

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.290 
across the whole the whole map
and<00:05:11.270> let's<00:05:11.570> go<00:05:11.840> level<00:05:12.470> 23<00:05:15.520> it's<00:05:16.520> already<00:05:16.940> over

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
and let's go level 23 it's already over

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:25.120 
and let's go level 23 it's already over
a<00:05:17.780> million<00:05:20.200> hit<00:05:21.200> points<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:22.640> is<00:05:22.910> crazy<00:05:24.130> for
