the outside a line of velcro to keep it
30<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.710> secure<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.260> then<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.680> added<00:00:53.460> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to keep it firm when the case is closed

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.399 
to keep it firm when the case is closed
they've<00:01:04.229> added<00:01:04.650> magnets<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.510> ipad<00:01:07.140> turns

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
easily type I don't think I have too

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.550 
easily type I don't think I have too
much<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.340> say<00:03:32.670> about<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.299> case<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.870> certified

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
much to say about this case a certified

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.460 
much to say about this case a certified
that<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.150> have<00:03:36.150> not<00:03:36.330> reviewed<00:03:36.629> many<00:03:36.930> many<00:03:37.049> cases

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that I have not reviewed many many cases

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.710 
that I have not reviewed many many cases
for<00:03:37.920> for<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.909> ipad<00:03:39.299> 2<00:03:39.599> but<00:03:40.560> i<00:03:40.860> I've<00:03:41.579> seen<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.360> ton

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
for for the ipad 2 but i I've seen a ton

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.449 
for for the ipad 2 but i I've seen a ton
of<00:03:42.780> videos<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.620> I've<00:03:43.799> seen<00:03:44.129> a<00:03:44.190> lot<00:03:44.280> of

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
of videos and I've seen a lot of

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.960 
of videos and I've seen a lot of
products<00:03:45.090> in<00:03:45.209> stores<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:46.019> for<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.129> think<00:03:47.700> this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
products in stores and for I think this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.339 
products in stores and for I think this
is<00:03:48.030> young<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:50.459> comparison<00:03:50.970> term<00:03:51.180> for<00:03:51.629> every

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
is young the comparison term for every

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.539 
is young the comparison term for every
every<00:03:53.099> folio<00:03:53.579> style<00:03:53.940> case<00:03:54.860> it's<00:03:55.860> very<00:03:56.129> robust

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
every folio style case it's very robust

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.640 
every folio style case it's very robust
it's<00:03:57.269> very<00:03:57.629> secure<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.890> leaves<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.349> not<00:04:01.349> too

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
it's very secure it leaves so not too

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.050 
it's very secure it leaves so not too
much<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.579> ipad<00:04:03.239> exposed<00:04:03.720> aside<00:04:04.109> from<00:04:05.060> some

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
much of the ipad exposed aside from some

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.520 
much of the ipad exposed aside from some
some<00:04:06.780> part<00:04:07.200> on<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:07.950> side<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.489> on<00:04:09.390> top<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.200> on

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
some part on this side and on top and on

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.410 
some part on this side and on top and on
the<00:04:10.560> bottom<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:13.140> el<00:04:13.500> adds<00:04:13.890> some<00:04:14.879> ball<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.390> wait

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
the bottom in el adds some ball can wait

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.379 
the bottom in el adds some ball can wait
but<00:04:16.519> actually<00:04:17.519> it's<00:04:17.609> pretty<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.299> pretty

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
but actually it's pretty it's pretty

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.409 
but actually it's pretty it's pretty
comfortable<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.169> hold<00:04:19.430> even<00:04:20.430> when<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:20.820> only

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
comfortable to hold even when you only

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.379 
comfortable to hold even when you only
want<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.750> read<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.820> fold<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.970> case<00:04:24.150> like

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
want to read just fold the case like

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.590 
want to read just fold the case like
this<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.020> its<00:04:25.440> really<00:04:25.560> really<00:04:25.949> comfortable

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
this and its really really comfortable

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.290 
this and its really really comfortable
so<00:04:27.600> i<00:04:27.960> think<00:04:28.770> it's<00:04:29.039> pretty<00:04:29.520> much<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:30.000> for<00:04:30.030> this

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
so i think it's pretty much it for this

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300 
so i think it's pretty much it for this
review<00:04:30.630> thank<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:31.380> for<00:04:31.530> watching<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.130> i<00:04:32.280> will
