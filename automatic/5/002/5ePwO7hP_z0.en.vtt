before me are crap I used him in my

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160 
before me are crap I used him in my
Russian<00:01:14.460> team<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.939> well<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.719> as<00:01:15.899> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.140> see

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
Russian team as well and as you can see

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
Russian team as well and as you can see
he<00:01:16.950> plays<00:01:17.219> right<00:01:17.549> mid<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:17.969> team<00:01:18.180> into<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
he plays right mid for my team into the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
he plays right mid for my team into the
center<00:01:18.869> attack<00:01:19.079> you<00:01:19.259> meet<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:20.159> also

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
center attack you meet so that's also

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330 
center attack you meet so that's also
another<00:01:21.210> reason<00:01:21.360> why<00:01:21.719> he<00:01:21.780> doesn't<00:01:22.079> score<00:01:22.350> as

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
another reason why he doesn't score as
