00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.840
 good girls today I will do well and at 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.660
 make one pending of our 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.889
 earrings will be very easy going to 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.880
 be very cool we will use 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.800
 silicone 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.419
 and they're going to need to put a gun 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 silicone I'm going to use silicone from 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.410
 cinnamon itself that is hard to find 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.109
 in all those who do not have black then 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.100
 nothing catches the white silicone white and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.940
 now I will explain how to color 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.059
 I have already tried the black silicone 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.760
 Here you have it was his name and 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.949
 well here I have done a little something and 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.899
 does not have the same texture as the icons 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.059
 the chains fix how it drips and all 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.089
 those that do not have the same texture do not 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.440
 remain the same but it also serves 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.790
 white silicone because I've also 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.379
 tried 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.379
 we are going to need soap the hand 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.950
 a napkin paper and we're going to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.370
 need two bases dependent on 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.370
 these D 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.860
 let's catch 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.160
 where are we going we will need a plate of 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.160
 crystal let's take the soap 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.610
 let's take the paper and let's remove 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.750
 a little bit of excess soap 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.750
 we are a little 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.490
 the soap what will lower help us to 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.590
 not only the silicone is stuck now 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.420
 now we are dropping silicone droplets 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.090
 according to the size that we want and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.990
 the earpice 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.320
 so I'm going to make some great 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.320
 quito 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.780
 but they are for me then I'm not going 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.780
 to put a very small one 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.530
 and we would have one and now trying 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.110
 do 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.110
 another little ball more or less the same 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.340
 for rather hard and with silicone 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.580
 OK 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.890
 when I could do work on this 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.200
 with silicone always with a base 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.820
 glass and good a little bit of soap 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.120
 hands so you do not stick 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.400
 good because I 've already done 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.980
 Look how much you brillitos one stays 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.920
 with this silicone 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.930
 It is very cool but it is very expensive 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.930
 it had been done up here 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.879
 that is behind chiquitina 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.390
 that we can also use it for 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.390
 discover 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.650
 I have done my name and I had thought 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.150
 I have not made a name to try to see 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.470
 if it did not stay stuck clear 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.870
 These are the ones I had already made 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.490
 to teach how to take off but first 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.740
 we will check that it has dried you 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.170
 we have explained but good with this 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.170
 black silicone is with those who made ruby 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.470
 rubin of the channel robin lowered the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.420
 chocolate for the code 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.120
 I do not know if you have seen the video 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.739
 now with eto'o explained no I do not know if 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.980
 He found it difficult to find the 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.440
 true but this is where I live here hai 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.319
 it is very difficult to find it and in about 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.810
 Chinese that I did not find because I 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.360
 understand bad airs good realities ni 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.430
 nothing I found not to find in Chinese and 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.620
 you see that it cost me at 15 I do not know 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.640
 filled in video 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.640
 and bring 2 468 bar 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:23.050
 and good if I lower to Chinese that I will buy it 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.050
 quite this way 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.920
 of bar horn 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.630
 because I want to go down because I'm 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.330
 preparing a packet for myself 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.760
 with if I want to go down for silicone from 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.510
 these in case there is now petition we are 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.760
 open and I want to go down to buy good 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.030
 we touch here we can see that it is 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.110
 entourage and look good comes out alone with the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:51.980
 finger doing a little effort 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:58.030
 they come out perfectly fixed that shone 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.030
 but that now hunted we will take our 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.300
 work for slope 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.650
 let's go a little bit and the tip of the 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.560
 silicone 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.580
 to warm the iron 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.220
 dependent and then the rhyme does not go 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.510
 to be stuck 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.600
 and with the other 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.040
 to the same 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.040
 we paddled it a little here 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.910
 here you see me 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.430
 burning and at the same time we're going to go a 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.430
 little bit so that the iron gets hot 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.620
 and simply 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.670
 we stick the base of our earring 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.220
 we try to make it 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.350
 the manes hundred possible 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.980
 and we are already here in our 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.000
 slopes 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.000
 I catch it 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.719
 for those who 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.350
 those that we do not have lee with the black only 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.560
 white 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.930
 I will tell you how it is done we would do the 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.350
 pearlite with our silicone no 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.110
 when we do it before it 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.900
 be everything that screams at you but not at all 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:18.090
 so that not to finish them 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.090
 so let's take an eye shadow 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.289
 let's take a shadow of eyes what 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:29.499
 We want the color we want 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.340
 and with him 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:34.880
 and we would give 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:39.180
 imagine that we are looking here and 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:43.620
 above would give d 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.790
 Perlite circular shape is worth 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.800
 that would be painted 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.110
 this is the easiest method with the 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.430
 eyeshadow we could also 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:58.420
 do with nail polish or even with 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.710
 spray with spray paint 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:06.230
 but good girls, look how fast 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.230
 and how cool are you left behind
