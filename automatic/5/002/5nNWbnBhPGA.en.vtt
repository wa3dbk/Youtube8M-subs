00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.940
 for making a little present i 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.900
 I use polymer clay of two colors 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.000
 yellow and red blade stack and rolling pin 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.220
 or pasta car u whichever 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.109
 the tool you now have at hand I 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.750
 I take yellow clay by kneading it well 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.449
 just roll it in my hands 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.480
 I get such stripes to 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.830
 it was straight and i will use the blade 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.660
 This is how I cut off 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.280
 it is very easy to do if you don’t 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.770
 such a blade you can use 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.129
 with a stationery knife he cuts well too 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 hryvnia align the edge 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.260
 it we will have a ribbon for gifts 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.809
 about that wide 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.510
 you can cut it into your eyes or 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.280
 take advantage of the ruler align background 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.280
 as you already feel comfortable 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.590
 here we cut enough even 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.089
 a few ribbons and a bow and so 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.010
 ribbon we are ready now go 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.490
 red polymer clay cut off the desired 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.270
 slice and begin to also knead in 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.300
 hands and and roll the ball slightly and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.940
 We take that it was smaller in good 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.250
 he doesn’t monetize we get this 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.869
 he doesn’t look like a gift ball 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.229
 so spent the desired shape I want 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.890
 a gap in a square a chubby cube 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.380
 for this i'm so crushing in his hands 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.119
 just fingers and then about working 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.310
 surface moved to each 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.340
 I don't need a country more or less 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.259
 perfect flat cube just so he 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.119
 there was a beautiful volume of some kind and good 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.740
 Look at this size I have completely 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.470
 now we are happy with him 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.539
 finish the land wrapping the ribbon 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.539
 which can be prepared in advance with you 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.490
 so here we gently press put 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.740
 cube and start it 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.290
 just wrap in the tape tightly 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.689
 clutching after baking and knee already 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.140
 anywhere on the go or where not going anywhere 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.360
 will keep well from this side by 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.099
 Essentially, we also wrap up like real ones. 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:23.159
 gifts that we make for the holidays 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.750
 as beautiful as bright and of course 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.579
 with any 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:33.090
 wrap the second striped here 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:35.040
 we start from this side is equal tight 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.340
 just pressing cut off all unnecessary with 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.409
 using a blade like this but it is not yet 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.959
 gift we still need to refine and 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.599
 Of course to make a bow was a feeling 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.359
 completely that the tape is tied up and for this 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.060
 we need to do another striped for 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.889
 we already have a bow in fact just 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.230
 align one side with white 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.500
 the same width as the previous one here 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.880
 we are trying 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.880
 so here 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.040
 alignable 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.260
 this tidy up plus one more strip of us 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.800
 if all you want to wrap another one 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.080
 present 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.680
 take a little clay form the ball 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.080
 This is the core of our bow to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.400
 the sensations of the bundle should therefore be 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.290
 we are like this to her 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.239
 you need to be perfectly smooth 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.550
 round 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.220
 just rolled up here post look and 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.510
 sizes principle suits us but 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.850
 we need to make a bow 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.680
 fingers created by different there are many 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.980
 ways to create bows from polymer 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.620
 clay 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.239
 this is one of them here such as eyelets 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.209
 created you just fold 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.430
 a little bit shrink here is open that is 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.840
 in this way, see and start 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 post here and here tightly tight 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.630
 I press the goal side on the contrary 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.600
 springs with us years. and there is such 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.819
 air loop exactly the same 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.510
 Diane principle and here if we see that 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.700
 eg 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.830
 too they are to a loop of just by 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.750
 stack tweaks or any sticks 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.440
 toothpicks that you have on hand 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.190
 remove too much if the loop is too long 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.180
 We also lay out with one 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.820
 sides it is important to press good 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.680
 element to the base and middle 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.350
 so we had everything neatly exactly we 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.840
 We take here just the same prepared 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.199
 I am also pushing an element of it a little 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.580
 joint 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:33.850
 it first allows us better 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.830
 press the ball to the base of this item 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.110
 and secondly make feeling just 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.360
 something is imposed if the whale folds 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.210
 something is deformed something is straight 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.400
 this tape is already pretty cute 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:50.440
 but I want to add two more tape ends 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.870
 so that they are very well grouped 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.330
 curved and went down the gift 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.060
 there was still no code 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.460
 the dynamics between realism is 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.259
 make it also more difficult for 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.030
 perception of our work so how are we 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.580
 we cut into us already ride in principle 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:14.460
 stripes can be slightly aligned 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:17.479
 a little bit like that so yes here 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.210
 this region was also doing more interesting 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.550
 such a triangle 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.259
 we cut here do a little more 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.409
 take as a reserve if something else then 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.110
 you can align a little bit and bend here 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.300
 so there we will bring the joint in this 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.190
 respect us helps a lot that does not 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.949
 you can always crawl there and 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.530
 starts to bend how we can deal 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.090
 just fingers can also stack 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.330
 create a wave 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:49.440
 that is, some kind of gaps and 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.719
 bend raises underwear 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.300
 but somewhere and press the present here 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.860
 in this way 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.770
 We look if something did not like if 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.440
 the wave is not beautiful enough to lie with us 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.770
 does not look very good, but here you can 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.599
 aktara tear off the base and 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.909
 correct so when you lay out 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:11.190
 when group the folds not 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.289
 hurry at once all strength is attached 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.509
 look and we should get here 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.789
 so two stripes go and we already 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.589
 collective gift where and how we can 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.470
 use we can do this 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:24.200
 loop in it and make 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.780
 keychain can also be turned into a magnet 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.280
 on the fridge or if reliable 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.000
 for example a satin ribbon it will be 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.440
 decoration on the tree after we 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.720
 stick a present 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.360
 we cover it so glossy varnish 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.390
 glittered and shimmered especially in the market 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.930
 it will look very nice and our 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.930
 the product is ready
