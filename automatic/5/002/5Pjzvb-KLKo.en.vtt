00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.610
 we have a copy 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.990
 improved with the malagueña race 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.150
 As you can see it has a bay or light brown mantle 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.209
 this goat fiesta malagueña goat 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.919
 spanish solt 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.849
 and we are specialists in producing milk 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.250
 an average of 4 liters per day 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.869
 approximately 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.079
 It is not the most dairy face in the world 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.220
 but it is good dairy and above all rustic 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.759
 for the way we create the goats in Peru we consider that this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.820
 remarkable high 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.960
 for your taste and cia 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.820
 this is a very rustic noble very goat 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.940
 eat different types of food and cross and good amount of milk 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.840
 then we consider that it is a very important breed has characteristics of 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.810
 more measures a part the neck is a protrusion of the skin 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.140
 which were some definition apart also from the ears as they read it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.960
 long not as long as the union but initially stops 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.690
 little wounds 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.010
 hoppo 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 we are observing an animal f2 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810
 crossing with the nasa murciana 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 which is another Spanish base specialized in milk production 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880
 this goat breed 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 It also has the potential to produce 4 4 ​​and a half liters of milk per 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.260
 day 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.480
 in such a way that it is also a very representative asset 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.660
 and quite adequate for Peru 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.280
 because also in paperback 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.400
 you have a cattle that can be created 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.670
 in conditions like we typically raise our goats 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.580
 with simple corrals without much sophistication 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.750
 the badly made face was like health 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.110
 but it is very dairy and very rustic 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.479
 we have chosen this race precisely because of that dairy characteristics 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.390
 and rustic 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
 then it has a mantle committee notes of dark color 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.340
 right that it can be something less dark but also the ears and in that 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.610
 that manifestation of wounds or raised 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.880
 iy it was not very long of course 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.540
 and has also measures 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.020
 ponce who advances that we also consider important for the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.980
 development of capriculture in Peru 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.000
 for your utility product 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.560
 and in its own right 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.810
 It should be noted that they are a little small that implies that they do not eat much 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.950
 important too 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.750
 Right 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.870
 eat little and what little they produce transform it into milk the face more 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.989
 efficient 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.300
 correct for specialized milk production in that area and 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.299
 especially from ustica 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.329
 good thing in this case we are with a male f1 improved with the malagueña race 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.459
 it is appreciated to color bayón this male 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.819
 good and its horns I must highlight here the following 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.669
 in that experimental center 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.570
 by santa barbara cañete 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.419
 we have chosen the races malagueña and murcianas we can not be pleased 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.260
 if this was based on a phylogenetic study 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.949
 that was done with the agrarian elegance and the audience of Seville 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:53.889
 in which 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.290
 we had to collect cells 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.650
 of goats of the valley of cañete 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.449
 that were sent to Spain 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.439
 to analyze your chromosome if your genetics 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.039
 and based on the Peruvian Creole goat 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:10.170
 Spanish scholars chose from many possibilities 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.289
 two murcianas and malagueño breeds 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:17.609
 in such a way that they are the most complementary fats as most suitable for 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.559
 improve and cross to the other side or local goats 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.180
 that is important to point out 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.719
 the why state races 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.840
 the alex was like this better now yes 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.720
 but with a certain degree of toxicity 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.009
 that allows a 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.750
 a very good adaptation for our environment and in another form of parenting 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.019
 Unfortunately, Russia is right 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.500
 and then what is the Murcian sport foundation? 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.390
 and because Malaga is chosen 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.599
 in this sense present good in this case we are 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.919
 before an improved male f1 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.609
 with the Murcian base 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.729
 a rather impetuous male 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.339
 pretty fiery we would say 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.779
 and in this case a dark brown color as can be seen 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.719
 with his good horns i 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.399
 in this case there is no peace 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:04.460
 but it's a male f1 breeder a male that has genes 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.839
 percent and as I say in the Murcian base 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:10.790
 of dairy nature here do not forget the rusticity that what we are 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:11.959
 proposing 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.060
 this news has to see please was the fact that animals or may be 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.620
 stacked or can even graze or trace gear 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.260
 that's why the guys and typical animals unlike other races 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.379
 goats that are to be this bull 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:27.110
 and locked 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.039
 this can shepherd astor piazzola however rustic 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.360
 and at the same time milk 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.210
 in this case we have goats 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.469
 improved with the Murcian base 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.610
 the orange battering ram 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.240
 f 2 75 percent purity 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.020
 and mareque yellow color f1 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.620
 50 percent purity 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.090
 As you can see, they are male goats that if they have that impetus to ride 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.450
 it is being observed 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.379
 they are male breeders of age 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:54.960
 like the Murcian base 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.030
 which, as indicated, are dairymen, it is their appointment that produces milk 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.059
 quite 4 quiros on average the pure rate 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:06.639
 and with enough rusticity that allows to eat different stubble that is in the 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.130
 field trail jiar grazing ecétera or also of course 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.379
 be stable as in this case 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.080
 improved livestock with murciana base goats
