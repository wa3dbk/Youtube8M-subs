00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.850
 that we have the nights this time 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.490
 let's make comparative living 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.510
 through motor or motorcycle benchmarks 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.810
 people on this side and the jean pro light 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.500
 a team of good range range equipment 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.520
 middle-low 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.490
 of 2013 in which obviously not 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.500
 we will have shocking results not without 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 However, what is interesting 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 compare them 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.390
 we will proceed first with altitude to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.390
 perform the verification of the scores 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.170
 As you can see in the axis, there was already 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.480
 Once the benchmark in the 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.840
 motor now motorcycle that had not been done 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.840
 this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.729
 as a preview of in the next video 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.289
 we will have the motor or the motorcycle against the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.240
 motor a moto moto g 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.979
 also of the motor or the motorcycle against the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.979
 xperia z1 compact 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.620
 How can you see how they can see 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.290
 start the tests in 3 in 2d and in 3d 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.990
 the moto motor gp while the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.890
 lxi but light engine continues in 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.250
 the ram processor test and others 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 components 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.370
 she started the project the tests of 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.540
 2d as you can see the resolution of the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.069
 program only reaches 960 x 540 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.959
 while the translation of the engine is 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.959
 in 1280 x 720 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.160
 as you can as can be the motorola 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.940
 already finished the test 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.040
 and the results 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.930
 where 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.930
 1618 thousand 262 points 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.490
 While for 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.490
 the jeep pro light 11 thousand 732 points 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.320
 now we will continue to test 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:12.150
 with another think 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.150
 with pictures to be specific 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.930
 I want to emphasize that in this in these 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.840
 equipment there is a big difference in 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:37.330
 Regarding processor is a dual mediatek 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:42.009
 core against a snapdragon quad core 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.370
 as for a branch of a giga in both 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.370
 cases 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.420
 and you 're done, the engine or the 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.970
 moto gp with a score of 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.490
 you can not see what kind of approach 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:30.630
 8 in 1998 points 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.630
 we wait for it to finish 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.740
 and throw a score 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.750
 of 2,840 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.660
 well these are the two mentions that I have 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.229
 chosen to perform the comparison of 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.229
 our teams
