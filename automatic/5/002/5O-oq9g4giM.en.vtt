00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
degrees on all the videos I will do but

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.780 
degrees on all the videos I will do but
you<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:09.930> have<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.140> option<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.830> honor<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.340> 70

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
you do have the option of honor and 70

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.390 
you do have the option of honor and 70
which<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.180> quite<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.720> bit<00:03:12.930> wider<00:03:15.500> back<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:17.220> you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
which is quite a bit wider back then you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.449 
which is quite a bit wider back then you
have<00:03:17.670> time<00:03:18.150> lapse<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:21.980> suppose<00:03:22.980> we<00:03:23.130> could<00:03:23.310> go

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
have time lapse I suppose we could go

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.210 
have time lapse I suppose we could go
there<00:03:23.700> five-second<00:03:24.600> intervals<00:03:25.310> 10<00:03:26.310> 30<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.239> 60

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
there five-second intervals 10 30 and 60

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.860 
there five-second intervals 10 30 and 60
and<00:03:29.220> then<00:03:30.140> auto<00:03:31.140> off<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.420> set<00:03:33.750> your

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and then auto off and you can set your

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.380 
and then auto off and you can set your
date<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.440> other<00:03:34.680> stuff<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.790> kind

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
date and other stuff like that but kind

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:46.819 
date and other stuff like that but kind
of<00:03:36.480> get<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.630> idea<00:03:37.370> as<00:03:38.370> far<00:03:38.430> as<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:46.079> unit

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
of get the idea as far as the unit

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.770 
of get the idea as far as the unit
itself<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.959> very<00:03:48.959> rugged<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:52.100> it<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.280> small

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
itself it is very rugged and it is small

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.520 
itself it is very rugged and it is small
and<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.440> back<00:03:55.680> door<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.459> open<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:56.880> up

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
and it's the back door to open it up

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.140 
and it's the back door to open it up
basically<00:03:58.530> slide<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.010> do<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.700> battery

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
basically slide it do that the battery

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.229 
basically slide it do that the battery
compartment<00:04:00.299> is<00:04:00.870> kind<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.260> hard<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.530> access

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
compartment is kind of hard to access

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.640 
compartment is kind of hard to access
pull<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.420> out<00:04:03.570> what<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.019> shouldn't<00:04:04.350> do<00:04:04.470> it

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
pull it out what you shouldn't do it

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.330 
pull it out what you shouldn't do it
have<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:05.010> do<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.340> lot<00:04:05.579> but<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.920> does<00:04:08.130> have

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
have to do it a lot but it does have

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.289 
have to do it a lot but it does have
another<00:04:08.720> battery<00:04:09.720> holder<00:04:10.970> which<00:04:12.500> for<00:04:14.060> life<00:04:15.060> of

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
another battery holder which for life of

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.000 
another battery holder which for life of
me<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.450> don't<00:04:15.510> know<00:04:15.780> why<00:04:16.049> they<00:04:16.590> want<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.919> use

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
me I don't know why they want to use

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
me I don't know why they want to use
this<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.609> basically<00:04:18.030> takes<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.479> bigger

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
this that basically takes a bigger

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.830 
this that basically takes a bigger
battery<00:04:19.019> off<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:20.489> look<00:04:20.820> into<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.239> more<00:04:21.479> but

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
battery off the look into that more but

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.650 
battery off the look into that more but
the<00:04:22.109> SD<00:04:22.500> card

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.529 

and<00:04:25.660> you<00:04:25.780> do<00:04:25.990> put<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.349> in<00:04:26.580> make<00:04:27.580> sure<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.389> know

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
and you do put it in make sure you know

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.469 
and you do put it in make sure you know
your<00:04:28.569> I<00:04:29.130> guess<00:04:30.130> your<00:04:30.310> writings<00:04:30.729> up<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
your I guess your writings up and the

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.820 
your I guess your writings up and the
brass<00:04:31.780> tabs<00:04:32.229> are<00:04:32.530> down<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:34.530> it's<00:04:35.530> kind<00:04:35.740> of

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
brass tabs are down and it's kind of

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.189 
brass tabs are down and it's kind of
hard<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.099> get<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:36.490> but<00:04:36.759> not<00:04:36.970> terrible<00:04:37.509> but<00:04:37.720> I

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
hard to get in but not terrible but I

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.920 
hard to get in but not terrible but I
did<00:04:38.740> put<00:04:38.979> it<00:04:39.160> in<00:04:39.340> upside<00:04:39.520> down<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.599> actually

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
did put it in upside down and actually

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.689 
did put it in upside down and actually
snapped<00:04:41.590> in<00:04:41.830> it's<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.069> first<00:04:42.310> time<00:04:42.490> I've<00:04:42.669> ever

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
snapped in it's the first time I've ever

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.529 
snapped in it's the first time I've ever
had<00:04:43.090> any<00:04:43.330> kind<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.960> piece<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.620> electronic

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
had any kind of a piece of electronic
