00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.560 

then<00:02:13.190> an<00:02:13.280> elastic<00:02:13.910> thread<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.420> bobbin

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
then an elastic thread in the bobbin

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.020 
then an elastic thread in the bobbin
here<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.470> was<00:02:15.770> playing<00:02:16.100> but<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.490> didn't<00:02:16.880> like

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
here I was playing but I didn't like

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.330 
here I was playing but I didn't like
this<00:02:17.240> one<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> took<00:02:17.660> an<00:02:17.960> old<00:02:18.080> dress<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.650> redid

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.010 
this one I took an old dress and redid
it<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.640> didn't<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.180> how<00:02:20.210> this<00:02:20.630> wasn't

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
it but I didn't like how this wasn't

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.740 
it but I didn't like how this wasn't
centered<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.790> course<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.210> had<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.450> do

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
centered so then of course I had to do

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.230 
centered so then of course I had to do
it<00:02:23.900> again<00:02:24.260> out<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.130> some<00:02:25.310> scraps<00:02:25.640> from<00:02:25.880> another

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
lot of experimentation and clues to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.730
