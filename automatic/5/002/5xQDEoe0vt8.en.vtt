just test me out chicken came with a new
case<00:01:35.329> let's<00:01:36.329> take<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.540> double<00:01:36.869> check<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> fit

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
case let's take a double check the fit

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.969 
case let's take a double check the fit
natal<00:01:40.820> move<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.970> now

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:02:05.499 

my<00:01:46.979> quickly<00:01:47.369> aluminum<00:02:01.399> pick<00:02:02.399> us<00:02:02.579> wash<00:02:02.939> reason

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
my quickly aluminum pick us wash reason

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:29.600 
my quickly aluminum pick us wash reason
stalling<00:02:06.509> tool<00:02:27.590> yeah<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:29.040> washer<00:02:29.459> gets

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
stalling tool yeah that washer gets

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.789 
stalling tool yeah that washer gets
caught<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> spline<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.019> inside<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.680> you

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
caught on the spline the inside so you

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.120 
caught on the spline the inside so you
loosen<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.160> spin<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.700> get<00:02:33.090> free<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:34.130> once

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
loosen it spin it to get free up once

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:54.369 
loosen it spin it to get free up once
it's<00:02:35.280> over<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.579> into<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:35.880> straight<00:02:36.180> down

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
whole like that it doesn't work very

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.469 
whole like that it doesn't work very
good<00:04:23.780> after<00:04:24.139> enough<00:04:24.290> both<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.889> slot<00:04:25.479> and

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
good after enough both in the slot and

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.300 
good after enough both in the slot and
not<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.870> same<00:04:27.080> way<00:04:27.229> I<00:04:28.960> did<00:04:29.960> that<00:04:30.139> once<00:04:30.380> can

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
not the same way I did that once can

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:45.850 
not the same way I did that once can
work<00:04:31.460> forever

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:05:04.249 

most<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:47.039> stuff<00:04:47.219> you<00:04:47.370> repeat<00:05:02.990> over<00:05:03.990> here<00:05:04.139> this

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
most of stuff you repeat over here this

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:49.840 
most of stuff you repeat over here this
time<00:05:14.719> holy<00:05:15.719> treason<00:05:16.289> teasing

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.820 

that's<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:50.910> little<00:05:51.120> tight

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.710 

so<00:05:55.830> obviously<00:05:56.340> that<00:05:56.430> fitted<00:05:56.970> baron<00:05:57.300> has<00:05:57.419> a<00:05:57.449> Ron

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
so obviously that fitted baron has a Ron

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:06.170
