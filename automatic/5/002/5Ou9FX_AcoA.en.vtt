00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the one flood who has a gravity hammer

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.220 
the one flood who has a gravity hammer
at<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> bottom<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> hill<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> basically

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
at the bottom of the hill and basically

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.470 
at the bottom of the hill and basically
it's<00:00:31.859> there's<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> teleporter<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> bottom

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.639 
it's there's a teleporter at the bottom
that<00:00:33.600> keeps<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> never-ending<00:00:34.350> loop

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
that keeps you in a never-ending loop

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.080 
that keeps you in a never-ending loop
and<00:00:34.890> eventually<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> start<00:00:35.520> toppling<00:00:35.969> down

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and eventually you start toppling down

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.910 
and eventually you start toppling down
the<00:00:36.210> hill<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:36.930> pretty<00:00:36.989> crazy<00:00:37.440> or

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the hill and it can get pretty crazy or

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520 
the hill and it can get pretty crazy or
pretty<00:00:38.250> fun<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.270> either<00:00:39.390> way<00:00:39.540> still<00:00:40.350> fun

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
pretty fun can go either way still fun

people<00:00:47.280> loved<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.670> Halo<00:00:47.850> Reach<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.360> I'm

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
people loved it in Halo Reach and I'm

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240 
people loved it in Halo Reach and I'm
glad<00:00:48.930> someone<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.379> able<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.829> bring<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> back

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
glad someone was able to bring it back

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.459 
glad someone was able to bring it back
inhale<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.879> however<00:00:51.570> had<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.020> modded

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
inhale for however had to be modded

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.819 
inhale for however had to be modded
because<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.750> flood<00:00:54.750> loadouts<00:00:55.140> can't<00:00:55.530> go

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
because the flood loadouts can't go

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.920 
because the flood loadouts can't go
can't<00:00:56.370> start<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.879> anything<00:00:57.180> other<00:00:57.329> than<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
can't start with anything other than the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
can't start with anything other than the
flood<00:00:58.230> town<00:00:58.440> nor<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> energy<00:00:58.920> sword<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
flood town nor the energy sword so the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
flood town nor the energy sword so the
person<00:01:00.090> who<00:01:00.300> made<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.570> obviously<00:01:01.079> modded<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
person who made this obviously modded it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.380 
person who made this obviously modded it
so<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:01.980> could<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.250> gravity<00:01:02.640> hammers<00:01:03.000> energy

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
so they could put gravity hammers energy

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
so they could put gravity hammers energy
swords<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.899> plasma<00:01:04.290> grenades<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> flood

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
swords and plasma grenades and the flood

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.219 
swords and plasma grenades and the flood
loadout<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.240> works<00:01:06.420> fine<00:01:06.600> plays<00:01:06.960> great

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
loadout but it works fine plays great

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.050 
loadout but it works fine plays great
and<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.400> good<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.790> Halo<00:01:08.970> Reach

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and it's just as good as in Halo Reach

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.120 
and it's just as good as in Halo Reach
