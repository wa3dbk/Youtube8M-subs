00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 another 50 euros so I got it right 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 I spent a lot of things 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 bought so let's just quickly 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.920
 to start 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.140
 By the way, everything I bought is from 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.550
 so make up revolution if you put it on the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.470
 regular site would like to order from 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.360
 make up revolution itself can also be like 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 first this beautiful palette I have 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.010
 here of all brown variant first name 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200
 this too is the naked chocolate ' palette 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 and right kind of white chocolate led 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.350
 and this is just a palette with a lot 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.329
 very nice neutral colors really one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.860
 beautiful fid palette 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.260
 we are as shimmer colors in as 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.079
 matte colors and yes he is just real 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 beautifully it costs 10 euros but for that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.590
 you get really many colors 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 about all products that Tunisia 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.530
 shoplog shows a review of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.850
 on my blog 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.799
 so a link to it is all here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 in the description with all reviews then 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.640
 you can also view everything that you have 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040
 I have the floor here as full of palette 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.450
 shui for palette and on the back can 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 you can already say the colors 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.659
 but of course I'm just going to see a and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.100
 the palette will show this is the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.840
 packaging of the palette and so that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 all really nice almost from make up 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.590
 revolution out of it I find it real myself 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.600
 terribly awkward but save 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.520
 just send all the box to the can 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 easy to see what palette it is that too 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.990
 it is a pity that it is shiny 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.820
 black is making you say very quickly 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.439
 fingerprints on it looks 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 packaging is not too convenient though 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.920
 luckily the eyeshadows make you 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.020
 well all cambuur palette that i am going to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 so they show 8 euros each 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.130
 then I say right away for that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.020
 I forget to say that this is again 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.850
 a kind of yes new palette 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.860
 below you have all matte colors 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 and here are driver colors 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.259
 all a bit of that again 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.420
 neutral colors but I think so 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.200
 always very nice to wear 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.030
 whoever really has some special color 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.340
 in between like this golden color in this one 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.439
 pink color oh generally it's just one 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.759
 very handy everyday palette 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.350
 portal is to my voice i am one 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.570
 little cold route my voice off and on 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.979
 toe it and you start to 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.230
 hopefully you will not find that either 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.160
 seat on I am now serving you the mountains 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.720
 japan it 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.790
 and this is a combination palette of 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 eye shadows and face powders 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.209
 and so that palette you see that you have 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.580
 here again those contour colors and now 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.140
 I have to say that I have the eyeshadows 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360
 so the quality of this east goes 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.940
 less wind than the other palette 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.620
 but it is still very good 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.180
 I especially like the yes my face 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.130
 muscles very nice 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.709
 the blush that is in it seems horrified or 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.810
 sleek rose gold and therefore grathem 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.430
 therefore if you look for tube van he sees 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.720
 also in this palette and there you also have 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.209
 other nice colors as one 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.700
 highlighter and bronzer and eye shadows 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.170
 so this is really a must also the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.360
 Oostvaarders you will see matte color again 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.950
 in and shimmer colors so you would do on it 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.780
 great look 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.130
 I totally got that last eye shadow palette 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.780
 otherwise pay attention but none 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.630
 eye shadow that is the coeur body 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.940
 palette I think it is really a nice box d 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.160
 sheep zoiezo really save a lot of fun 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.870
 looks really nice this is alone again 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.030
 classified the same as that of the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.889
 is your opinion for it already here 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.540
 matte colors and with two he 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.340
 shimmer colors a lesson if you maybe 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.840
 can see here sit though 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.090
 news colors someone who really does it 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.859
 very special colors in such as 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.310
 this this is the color and the one i like 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.139

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.230

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.690

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.350
 you are black again from my site 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.150

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.739
 because there are really whole you 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.389
 very nice colors in between 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.040
 if late it prevents but not last 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.650
 product that I have ordered much more 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.150
 is this blush palette i think we are whole 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.849
 seen many other people but I have me 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.160
 never ordered and yes I saw the role 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.540
 new approach and that was the sugar and 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.519
 spice palette 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.230
 it so that I have the best style and 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.049
 as you can see this is in the eight beers 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.799
 here a highlighter kind of shiny 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.690
 bakeplus 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.220
 and here all other colors and 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.650
 for example this and this you would too 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 great to use as bronzers me 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.330
 find it a lot really a super 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.490
 handy palette 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.690
 is woman 7 we army I really am not 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.000
 good at things like this so sorry 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.890
 before that but I think it's really super 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.960
 beautiful palette there are many beautiful 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.880
 blouses in and it's just very bad 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.290
 handy us a palette have one more 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.940
 I ordered some rocks 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.280
 would like to show you 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.520
 first very boring and concealer this in the 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.100
 medium color and yes fine 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.660
 link with concealer we was on it and that 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.280
 worked light I actually always use 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.810
 essence far the gang's idea becomes the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.630
 color 20 and is for me at the moment 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.150
 really far too light I ordered this 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.580
 this is also a bit perfect for me 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.860
 and this one was 2 euros and other lip gloss 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.630
 the only bad buy of the whole 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.910
 order 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.040
 yes this piece of crystal i thought hey nice 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.110
 transparent lip gloss but I had it 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.090
 can actually predict about name 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.920
 You really have a lot of glitter in this one 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.320
 lip gloss and I really don't like that 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.970
 I am going to find a way that I will 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.060
 can make it beautiful but on it 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.440
 moment i am really not going to use this 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.060
 So I'll have to look it song 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.250
 going to do 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.660
 this was 1 euro 50 so such a very bad one 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.700
 it's not a disaster either 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.290
 thanks a blush and is in the 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.930
 color checker 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.390
 or drivers would be nice rid plus 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.160
 a very, very simple color 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.690
 little good you can see this well I go 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.060
 not there for view because I don't think so 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.530
 it's nice to really have a wish you 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.710
 read or order one 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.810
 couple so this one was 1 euro 50 2 euro 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.790
 I thought so or very cheaply but they 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.410
 just very nice r vd bosch 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.360
 there is no hole there is a matte blush 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.770
 where there is then you can easily 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.610
 even if you use a highlighter 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.730
 want that 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.780
 very last I ordered 3 lipsticks 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.610
 yes 3 lipsticks 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.080
 i like them i try here and me 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.060
 being a lipstick is no fun either 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.310
 from more views and I actually thought so 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.960
 more colored fun so i will take 3 of these 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.850
 the lipsticks from make up revolution whole 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.800
 like to give it a try because usually if 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.720
 I then come looking for budget lipsticks 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.060
 you soon out with sns of action or 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.440
 catrice but I hoped another time 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.430
 so I try a make-up myself 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.620
 revolution 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.990
 first I have your color devil and 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.669
 a bright pink color and red color 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.919
 of course always good this is the time 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.040
 People with you press you a little more type 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.260
 red color as the color with cheese and is 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.790
 a purple color and packaging of 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.620
 feels a bit cheap on you can 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.690
 really feel it and hear it 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.490
 is real plastic but I like it 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.930
 fine you say it handy here 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.610
 but the two are on top 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.500
 it's not like bee and gray that you say 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.330
 but the upside can collect but 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.070
 it is handy if you turn them upside down 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.150
 put you can easily see which color 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.919
 it's in stash 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.930
 150 wires each and here is also one 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.370
 link from my site you link it 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.199
 is again in the description 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.240
