00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.330
 I do not know where this comes from a friend 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.190

 laugh not like the human evolved to that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.229

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.059

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.000

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.159

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.060
 which is I think it's a problem it's not 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.370
