starts<00:00:14.950> had<00:00:15.670> trailed<00:00:16.000> in<00:00:16.209> every<00:00:16.540> game<00:00:16.720> this

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779

year<00:00:17.070> until<00:00:18.070> this<00:00:18.369> one<00:00:18.580> against<00:00:18.849> Kentucky<00:00:19.330> got

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
year until this one against Kentucky got

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.330 
year until this one against Kentucky got
off<00:00:20.410> to<00:00:20.529> a<00:00:20.560> great<00:00:20.619> start<00:00:20.800> what<00:00:21.220> do<00:00:21.279> you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
off to a great start what do you

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.880 
off to a great start what do you
attribute<00:00:21.400> that<00:00:21.670> to<00:00:22.380> circumstances<00:00:23.380> I<00:00:23.619> think

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
attribute that to circumstances I think

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.439 
attribute that to circumstances I think
we<00:00:24.190> had<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.340> good<00:00:24.550> week<00:00:24.699> of<00:00:24.820> practice<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:25.390> I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
we had a good week of practice and I

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.180 
we had a good week of practice and I
think<00:00:25.660> our<00:00:25.810> guys<00:00:26.020> were<00:00:26.320> confident<00:00:26.859> in<00:00:27.010> what<00:00:27.039> we

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
think our guys were confident in what we

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.560 
think our guys were confident in what we
were<00:00:27.400> going<00:00:27.520> to<00:00:27.580> try<00:00:27.789> to<00:00:27.820> accomplish<00:00:28.180> on

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
were going to try to accomplish on

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.220 
were going to try to accomplish on
offense<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.230> defense<00:00:30.840> offense<00:00:31.840> kept<00:00:32.110> the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
offense and defense offense kept the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.290 
offense and defense offense kept the
ball<00:00:32.379> very<00:00:33.190> efficient<00:00:33.820> and<00:00:33.970> then<00:00:34.090> when

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
ball very efficient and then when

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.119 
ball very efficient and then when
Kentucky<00:00:34.809> got<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.230> football<00:00:35.559> we<00:00:35.769> were<00:00:35.860> very

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
Kentucky got the football we were very

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.490 
Kentucky got the football we were very
aggressive<00:00:36.250> on<00:00:36.730> defense<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.510> at<00:00:37.900> several

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
aggressive on defense and at several

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.979 
aggressive on defense and at several
three<00:00:38.710> announce<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:39.129> think<00:00:39.309> that<00:00:39.460> their<00:00:39.729> first

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
three announce I think that their first

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.960 
three announce I think that their first
first<00:00:40.989> down<00:00:41.110> was<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.860> a<00:00:41.890> fake<00:00:42.159> punt<00:00:42.190> right<00:00:42.670> and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
first down was on a fake punt right and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.049 
first down was on a fake punt right and
then<00:00:43.120> we<00:00:43.269> you<00:00:43.930> know<00:00:44.049> stuff<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.409> drive<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
then we you know stuff that drive the

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.810 
then we you know stuff that drive the
next<00:00:46.210> three<00:00:46.510> place<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:47.400> couldn't<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.460> ask<00:00:48.610> much

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
next three place so couldn't I ask much

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.149 
next three place so couldn't I ask much
more<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:49.180> our<00:00:49.360> defense<00:00:50.049> and<00:00:50.320> our<00:00:50.769> off<00:00:50.920> that's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
more of our defense and our off that's

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.310 
more of our defense and our off that's
really<00:00:51.640> picked<00:00:52.180> it<00:00:52.330> up<00:00:52.449> and<00:00:52.720> I<00:00:52.900> think<00:00:52.960> had

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
really picked it up and I think had

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.780 
really picked it up and I think had
their<00:00:53.470> best<00:00:53.650> half<00:00:53.979> of<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.220> year<00:00:54.430> let's<00:00:54.640> take<00:00:54.729> a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
their best half of the year let's take a

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.610 
their best half of the year let's take a
look<00:00:54.909> at<00:00:54.970> first<00:00:55.210> half<00:00:55.420> now<00:00:55.659> from<00:00:55.930> Lexington<00:00:56.500> it

look at first half now from Lexington it

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.250

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
was a cold windy night as you can tell

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.560 
was a cold windy night as you can tell
fortunately<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.280> rain<00:01:00.549> stopped<00:01:01.210> right

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
fortunately the rain stopped right

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.939 
fortunately the rain stopped right
before<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:02.019> game<00:01:02.199> or<00:01:02.409> it<00:01:02.470> would<00:01:02.589> have<00:01:02.619> really

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
before the game or it would have really

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.829 
before the game or it would have really
been<00:01:03.100> more<00:01:03.670> miserable<00:01:04.000> it<00:01:04.360> actually<00:01:04.659> wasn't

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
been more miserable it actually wasn't

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.280

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
started Chris because we felt like we

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.160 
started Chris because we felt like we
would<00:01:09.939> run<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.240> quarterback<00:01:10.689> a<00:01:10.719> little<00:01:11.049> bit

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
would run the quarterback a little bit

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.349 
would run the quarterback a little bit
more<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:11.409> he<00:01:12.039> finds<00:01:12.460> gerald<00:01:12.759> hawkins<00:01:12.880> going

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
right here and the putter does a good

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.500 
right here and the putter does a good
thing<00:04:47.740> is<00:04:47.919> wide<00:04:48.220> open<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.790> outside<00:04:48.820> I

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
thing is wide open to the outside I

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.420 
thing is wide open to the outside I
don't<00:04:49.930> know<00:04:50.020> if<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.260> was<00:04:50.410> playing<00:04:50.770> by<00:04:51.160> them

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
don't know if that was playing by them

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.520 
don't know if that was playing by them
or<00:04:51.669> he<00:04:51.850> did<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.240> but<00:04:52.750> it's<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.960> very<00:04:52.990> good<00:04:53.229> play

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
or he did it but it's a very good play

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.529 
or he did it but it's a very good play
but<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:54.010> is<00:04:54.220> what<00:04:54.430> was<00:04:54.640> important<00:04:55.150> we

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
but this is what was important we

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.779 
but this is what was important we
stepped<00:04:55.870> up<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.680> made<00:04:56.740> some<00:04:57.100> big<00:04:57.220> plays<00:04:57.400> that

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
stepped up and made some big plays that

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.330 
stepped up and made some big plays that
was<00:04:57.910> fourth<00:04:58.240> down<00:04:58.570> so<00:04:59.470> we<00:04:59.620> get<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.919> ball<00:05:00.130> back

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
was fourth down so we get the ball back

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.090 
was fourth down so we get the ball back
and<00:05:00.840> we<00:05:01.840> got<00:05:01.990> an<00:05:02.080> opportunity<00:05:02.350> to<00:05:02.710> get<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:02.919> down

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
and we got an opportunity to get it down

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.430 
and we got an opportunity to get it down
here<00:05:03.340> maybe<00:05:03.580> try<00:05:03.850> still<00:05:04.120> going<00:05:04.539> it<00:05:04.810> was<00:05:05.140> a<00:05:05.200> good

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
here maybe try still going it was a good

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.850 
here maybe try still going it was a good
run<00:05:05.650> by<00:05:05.950> Jared<00:05:06.880> Hawking<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:08.500> we<00:05:08.650> keep

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
run by Jared Hawking and we keep

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.740 
run by Jared Hawking and we keep
plugging<00:05:09.310> away<00:05:09.400> got<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.120> little<00:05:10.270> bit<00:05:10.450> of<00:05:10.539> time<00:05:10.690> I

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
plugging away got a little bit of time I

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.230 
plugging away got a little bit of time I
think<00:05:10.930> we<00:05:11.080> have<00:05:11.110> one<00:05:11.440> timeout<00:05:12.030> right<00:05:13.030> here

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
think we have one timeout right here

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.270 
think we have one timeout right here

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
of felt like a the stats were so
