so<00:00:00.780> I<00:00:00.810> bought<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.230> from<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.500> control<00:00:01.860> car<00:00:02.070> for

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so I bought this from a control car for

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.300 
so I bought this from a control car for
my<00:00:02.370> kids<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:03.090> very<00:00:03.720> very<00:00:03.929> cheap<00:00:04.170> about<00:00:05.040> ten

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
my kids a very very cheap about ten

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.839 
my kids a very very cheap about ten
dollars<00:00:05.460> or<00:00:05.759> so<00:00:06.440> runs<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.680> four<00:00:08.460> triple-a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
dollars or so runs on four triple-a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.419 
dollars or so runs on four triple-a
batteries<00:00:09.650> it's<00:00:10.650> pretty<00:00:11.040> good<00:00:11.219> for<00:00:11.400> what

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
batteries it's pretty good for what

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.339 
batteries it's pretty good for what
you'd<00:00:11.610> expect<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.540> price<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.259> got

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
you'd expect for the price like it's got

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.400 
you'd expect for the price like it's got
a<00:00:13.380> diff<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:15.240> steering<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.780> obviously<00:00:16.199> like

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
a diff the steering is obviously like

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.760 
a diff the steering is obviously like
you<00:00:16.440> know<00:00:17.240> it<00:00:18.240> jumps<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.960> not<00:00:19.140> variable<00:00:19.710> or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
you know it jumps it's not variable or

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.120 
you know it jumps it's not variable or
whatever<00:00:20.570> that's<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> remote<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> but

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
whatever that's the remote for it but

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.550 
whatever that's the remote for it but
then<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.550> decided<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.090> wanted<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.449> too<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
then I decided I wanted one too but of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.390 
then I decided I wanted one too but of
course<00:00:25.830> these<00:00:26.640> were<00:00:27.529> 27<00:00:28.529> megahertz<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
course these were 27 megahertz and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.420 
course these were 27 megahertz and
they're<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> same<00:00:30.390> frequency<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.619> have

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
they're all the same frequency so I have

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.139 
they're all the same frequency so I have
to<00:00:32.610> upgrade<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> little<00:00:33.660> bit<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to upgrade my a little bit so here you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.389 
to upgrade my a little bit so here you
can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> insides<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> car<00:00:37.350> I've<00:00:38.219> got

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
can see the insides of the car I've got

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
can see the insides of the car I've got
the<00:00:38.579> six<00:00:38.910> volt<00:00:39.120> battery<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> same

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the six volt battery which is the same

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.959 
the six volt battery which is the same
voltage<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> original<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> tends

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
voltage as the original but it tends

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.190 
voltage as the original but it tends
have<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> bit<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.390> punch<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.870> guess<00:00:43.050> because

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
have a bit more punch me I guess because

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.299 
have a bit more punch me I guess because
it's<00:00:43.500> nickel<00:00:44.370> metal<00:00:44.460> hydride<00:00:44.610> rechargeable

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
it's nickel metal hydride rechargeable

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.840 
it's nickel metal hydride rechargeable
then<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.390> ESC<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:50.610> me<00:00:50.760> an

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
then you can see the ESC there to me an

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
then you can see the ESC there to me an
ESC<00:00:52.219> fly<00:00:53.219> sky<00:00:53.520> receiver<00:00:54.110> then<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.530> tangi

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
ESC fly sky receiver then the tangi

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
ESC fly sky receiver then the tangi
Metal<00:00:56.399> Gear<00:00:56.489> server<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> as<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.390> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
Metal Gear server so as you can see the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.650 
Metal Gear server so as you can see the
steering<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.079> much<00:01:01.770> more<00:01:01.949> precise<00:01:02.570> with<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
steering is much more precise with the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.039 
steering is much more precise with the
little<00:01:03.899> servo<00:01:04.430> which<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> it's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
little servo which is good and it's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
little servo which is good and it's
named<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.409> throttle<00:01:07.970> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
named with the throttle you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:40.539 
named with the throttle you
feather<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.910 

this<00:01:41.549> servo<00:01:42.479> mount<00:01:42.719> here<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.289> actually<00:01:43.649> 3d

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
this servo mount here is actually 3d

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.899 
this servo mount here is actually 3d
printed<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.350> also<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.799> suspension<00:01:47.490> mount

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
printed and also the suspension mount

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.709 
printed and also the suspension mount
that's<00:01:48.569> a<00:01:48.750> touch<00:01:48.929> to<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.380> well<00:01:50.450> but<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
that's a touch to it as well but if I

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.330 
that's a touch to it as well but if I
had<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.990> cut<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.350> everything<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:53.039> was<00:01:53.159> there

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
had to cut out everything that was there

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.559 
had to cut out everything that was there
because<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:53.939> an<00:01:54.030> electric<00:01:54.360> motor

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
because there was an electric motor

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.840 
because there was an electric motor
there<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.469> year<00:01:55.709> before<00:01:58.429> it<00:01:59.429> has<00:01:59.640> been

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
there just year before it has been

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
there just year before it has been
designed<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.569> if<00:02:00.959> the<00:02:01.319> suspension<00:02:02.069> is<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
designed so if the suspension is a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
designed so if the suspension is a
little<00:02:02.459> bit<00:02:02.549> lower<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.149> before<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
little bit lower because before it is a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
little bit lower because before it is a
little<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.170> higher<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.489> loose<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
little bit higher and a bit loose I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.359 
little bit higher and a bit loose I
guess<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.380> better<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.709> going<00:02:08.099> over

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
guess but this is better for going over

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
guess but this is better for going over
kind<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:09.000> rough<00:02:09.179> terrain<00:02:09.360> makes<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.019> bit

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
kind of rough terrain makes it a bit

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.479 
kind of rough terrain makes it a bit
