 cotton 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.389

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.210
 stones are full of ideal then 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.430
 I wanted to bring the ladies the material and a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.220
 very easy model to make 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.039
 our shoulders and lower 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.140
 right now, always in the two tones and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.699
 well there are several other changes now go 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 step by step we will show 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.710
 trial would also not be fashionable 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.200
 that is important they are very factors 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 so many for a love since he knows very 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.100
 well what point your tips with success 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.649
 we are updated is to see we are going to 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 work to work very well gentlemen I'll 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 to start as always to show in the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.079
 molds are very easy, they can be ordered 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.170
 in production you can come to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.039
 withdraw the day that you want as 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.210
 always supposedly the double if 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.449
 you remember that we always 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.149
 we draw half of the mold because 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.750
 because when cutting out they have to be the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.000
 equal parts 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.460
 to place it on the TV that we have left 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.950
 ok then the front body and 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.190
 back are exactly the same two 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.340
 pieces here you can give is very very 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.770
 easy if I repeat it again they ask 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.729
 in production it has a draft of 6 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.860
 centimeters a length of 55 if it's a 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.410
 size 1 today we work a size or not 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.970
 you can expand it if you want 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.070
 well this is the bodies are cut 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.080
 two pieces exactly the same I'll return 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.970
 to repeat and here is the manga that 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.880
 I want you to see if you guys 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.490
 they are encouraged to draw them and then that the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.950
 same curve of sisa has to have the 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.890
 sleeve the same equal sleeve curve 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.240
 same curve of sisa if this is what you 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.259
 gives more capacity 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.100
 the neckline and sleeve is very capita 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.040
 you can give 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.860
 now that I showed you the molds 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.960
 when assembling the shirt is very easy to 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.750
 do and I say again they cut two 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.090
 Equal parts without the bodies 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.160
 because they are exactly the same for the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.870
 front then what are we going to 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.290
 do they are going to cut the body parts 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.590
 Two-piece sleeves then 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.160
 we are going to sew facing the rights and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.920
 the sleeves to the armhole I in this case 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.030
 I will be placing pins 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.310
 remember to work with all of 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.739
 points we would need to have the beard what 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.200
 otherwise I repeat it always but 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.330
 there may be new people that I'm not 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.930
 watching or welcome all of you 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.640
 who want to learn then good with 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.450
 the little machine that they have at home 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.810
 Straight family look for a point similar to 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.709
 gave pain and there you can take this shirt 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.069
 to this once we know well the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.190
 manga the armhole we do the same job 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.880
 with the back and again place the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.880
 another sleeve 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.500
 to the armholes then we know the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.600
 sleeves to the bodies 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.720
 now I show you how we are staying 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.030
 this 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.310
 and here I worked as you can see 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.230
 with a contrasting thread so that 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.730
 you can appreciate well the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.480
 seams 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.450
 these sleeves got the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.019
 armholes is something else that happens 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.310
 following once we do this 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.940
 work always remember the fine needle 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:42.030
 if the ball point 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.480
 this work we are going to close this 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.879
 way and we have to do we close the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:54.329
 low sleeves if we went to his row the 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:58.200
 contour of the front rear neckline and 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.510
 the outline of the mana base if its 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.980
 row that remember with high thread no 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.790
 in this case I work nilo in 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.440
 contrast so that you can 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.350
 appreciate well in the seams 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.200
 well once we get to this point 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.600
 we already have signal practically the shirt 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.459
 finished so they will not stop 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.650
 make them are going to be fashionable as you 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.780
 said the IBI that's what we go with that 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.230
 step let's continue we 're going to double and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.310
 llar the neckline and the sleeves if in this 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.840
 case to a centimeter and a half then I 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.450
 in this case I will place a pin 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.310
 so you can see and we're going to 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.970
 stop at one of the junctions of the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.480
 sleeves a mask to be able to go through 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.450
 there the elastic 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.210
 I in this case that I know so you 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.460
 they are going to make these seams as more 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.310
 like it can be a simple seam 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.650
 straight a zig zag or you can place the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.430
 two needles like that and spend a remaining 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.950
 double once we have that way by the 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.020
 face made we are going to place the 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.140
 elastic for the contour of the neckline in 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.170
 this detail is 60 centimeters let's go 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.120
 to go through with a hook pin if 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.690
 the elastic 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.730
 This way, all the contour and in 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.400
 the sleeves for this workshop I go back to 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.430
 repeat is going to be 25 centimeters and 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.310
 let's do exactly the same 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.740
 we fold and let the mask pass the 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.930
 Elastic we close with a few stitches 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.930
 hands of the masks and I now 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.230
 show how we will get this in 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.170
 this form in this case I chose to place 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.440
 in a machine two needles if then 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.570
 you can see how that makes us 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.190
 drawing that really does the 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.420
 industrial machine that is called 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.130
 teaspoon 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.320
 last thing that is what we do fold and 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.690
 we call with the same system of two 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.730
 needles the base of the shirt and there 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.030
 you can see lady work 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.280
 finished very easy to do do not stop 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.270
 be in fashion to do this in little 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.060
 weather 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.610
 and good is the proposal already for 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.860
 this cards I one I want to tell you that 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.750
 We are going to need 25 centimeters of 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.070
 cotton fence that you most 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.160
 like it can be 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.900
 in this way or printed with flowers 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.850
 or did it change and one meter 10 of 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.760
 elastic one centimeter and a half good 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.620
 now if we go to the book if we're going to 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.620
 let us know that we like girls
