00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
trip yet actually yeah I think it looks

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.510 
trip yet actually yeah I think it looks
pretty<00:00:25.000> good<00:00:25.330> for<00:00:25.660> for<00:00:26.410> how<00:00:26.590> easy<00:00:27.160> it<00:00:27.460> really

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
pretty good for for how easy it really

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
pretty good for for how easy it really
is<00:00:27.939> once<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.480> find<00:00:28.750> it<00:00:28.930> I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:31.119> it's<00:00:31.240> easier

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
is once you find it I think it's easier

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.570 
is once you find it I think it's easier
than<00:00:31.689> those<00:00:31.930> nuts<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.500> I<00:00:32.800> think<00:00:33.040> it's<00:00:33.160> easier

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
than those nuts and I think it's easier

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.320 
than those nuts and I think it's easier
and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:36.100> continue<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.580> take<00:00:36.790> out<00:00:36.970> or<00:00:37.180> not

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
and I don't continue to take out or not

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.170 
and I don't continue to take out or not
but<00:00:37.570> it's<00:00:38.050> pretty<00:00:38.500> easy<00:00:38.739> i<00:00:39.040> would<00:00:39.430> suggest<00:00:39.610> let

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
but it's pretty easy i would suggest let

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.520 
but it's pretty easy i would suggest let
me<00:00:40.330> take<00:00:40.570> out<00:00:41.100> before<00:00:42.100> this<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.320> learn

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
me take out before this so learn

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.920 
me take out before this so learn
takeouts<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:46.480> those<00:00:46.780> down<00:00:47.080> hangouts<00:00:48.930> Burke's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
takeouts if those down hangouts Burke's

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.840 
takeouts if those down hangouts Burke's
products<00:00:50.409> the<00:00:50.530> same<00:00:50.710> thing<00:00:50.890> about<00:00:50.920> only

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
products the same thing about only

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.130 
products the same thing about only
you're<00:00:52.030> taking<00:00:52.360> them<00:00:52.510> down<00:00:52.750> through<00:00:53.049> the

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
you're taking them down through the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.219 
you're taking them down through the
pattern<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:54.129> instead<00:00:54.549> of<00:00:54.629> taking<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:55.930> ball

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
pattern so instead of taking this ball

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.740 
pattern so instead of taking this ball
out<00:00:56.949> of<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.370> pattern<00:00:57.729> you're<00:00:58.360> going<00:00:58.479> to<00:00:58.629> get

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
out of the pattern you're going to get

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.890 
out of the pattern you're going to get
underneath<00:00:59.080> here<00:00:59.589> um<00:00:59.769> I<00:01:00.549> had<00:01:01.330> trouble<00:01:01.629> with

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
underneath here um I had trouble with

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.009 
underneath here um I had trouble with
this<00:01:02.580> for<00:01:03.580> a<00:01:03.610> while<00:01:03.820> because<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.659> would<00:01:04.809> take<00:01:04.989> it

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
this for a while because I would take it

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.060 
this for a while because I would take it
under<00:01:05.290> and<00:01:05.500> then<00:01:05.619> I<00:01:05.680> wouldn't<00:01:05.860> know<00:01:05.950> how<00:01:05.979> to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
under and then I wouldn't know how to

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.520 
under and then I wouldn't know how to
link<00:01:06.340> it<00:01:06.520> but<00:01:07.090> just<00:01:07.330> like<00:01:07.510> in<00:01:07.570> take<00:01:07.960> outs<00:01:08.229> if

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
link it but just like in take outs if

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.920 
link it but just like in take outs if
you<00:01:08.680> watch<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.920> purple<00:01:11.920> ball<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:13.570> the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
you watch this purple ball they the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.570 
you watch this purple ball they the
verbal<00:01:14.260> ball<00:01:14.440> goes<00:01:14.650> back<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.159> forth<00:01:15.189> between

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
verbal ball goes back and forth between

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.210 
verbal ball goes back and forth between
the<00:01:15.880> hands<00:01:16.119> right<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.780> then<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.680> other<00:01:17.710> balls

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
the hands right and then the other balls

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.600 
the hands right and then the other balls
stay<00:01:19.180> in<00:01:19.540> that<00:01:19.780> one<00:01:19.990> hand<00:01:20.320> there's<00:01:20.979> underhand

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
stay in that one hand there's underhand

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.740 
stay in that one hand there's underhand
throw<00:01:21.850> I'm<00:01:21.940> going<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.180> come<00:01:22.330> back<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.630> grab

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
throw I'm going to come back and grab

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.210 
throw I'm going to come back and grab
it's<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.710> same<00:01:23.980> thing<00:01:25.020> only<00:01:26.020> you're<00:01:26.650> just

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
it's the same thing only you're just

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.870 
it's the same thing only you're just
bringing<00:01:27.520> your<00:01:27.820> arms<00:01:27.850> through<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.420> pattern

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bringing your arms through the pattern

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.280 
bringing your arms through the pattern
instead<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.090> out<00:01:31.870> of<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.260> pattern<00:01:32.650> um<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
instead of out of the pattern um you

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.380 
instead of out of the pattern um you
gotta<00:01:35.500> know<00:01:35.770> take<00:01:36.010> outs<00:01:36.220> takeouts<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:36.910> easier

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
gotta know take outs takeouts is easier

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.440 
gotta know take outs takeouts is easier
to<00:01:37.450> learn<00:01:37.630> than<00:01:37.690> first<00:01:38.200> brush<00:01:39.270> once<00:01:40.270> you've

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
to learn than first brush once you've

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.820 
to learn than first brush once you've
learned<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.720> take<00:01:40.840> out<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.200> will<00:01:41.380> take<00:01:41.530> five

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
learned to take out this will take five

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.070 
learned to take out this will take five
minutes<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:42.880> really<00:01:43.180> it's<00:01:43.480> really<00:01:43.630> not<00:01:44.020> hard

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
minutes it's really it's really not hard

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.740 
minutes it's really it's really not hard
once<00:01:44.410> you<00:01:44.680> know<00:01:44.830> take<00:01:45.070> outs<00:01:45.300> but<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.330> think

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
once you know take outs but I think

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.720 
once you know take outs but I think
what's<00:01:46.960> fun<00:01:47.200> about<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.560> stress<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.159> it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
what's fun about the stress is that it

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.010 
what's fun about the stress is that it
it<00:01:49.659> looks<00:01:49.990> good<00:01:50.290> but<00:01:51.100> it's<00:01:51.220> very<00:01:51.580> easy<00:01:51.970> so<00:01:52.390> you

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
it looks good but it's very easy so you

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.140 
it looks good but it's very easy so you
can<00:01:53.260> move<00:01:53.650> this<00:01:53.890> into<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.190> routine<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.880> kind<00:01:55.060> of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
can move this into a routine and kind of

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.690 
can move this into a routine and kind of
check<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.510> off<00:01:55.630> as<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:56.860> don't<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.460> really

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
check it off as you don't have to really

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.540 
check it off as you don't have to really
think<00:01:57.730> about<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.480> much<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:59.260> um<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:03.310> make

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
think about it that much so um just make

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.160 
think about it that much so um just make
sure<00:02:03.820> if<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.240> have<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.510> different<00:02:04.960> college

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
sure if you have a different college

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.830 
sure if you have a different college
ball<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.500> suggest<00:02:05.800> using<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:07.510> same<00:02:07.720> way

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
ball I suggest using it and the same way

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.820 
ball I suggest using it and the same way
you<00:02:07.900> going<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.140> take<00:02:08.319> after<00:02:08.470> you've<00:02:08.619> drawn

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
you going to take after you've drawn

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.350 
you going to take after you've drawn
over<00:02:11.010> over<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.099> pattern<00:02:12.400> throw<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.940> don't<00:02:13.299> know

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
over over the pattern throw I don't know

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.170 
over over the pattern throw I don't know
whatever<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.560> throw<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.890> over<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.459> then<00:02:15.489> you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
whatever you throw it over and then you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.680 
whatever you throw it over and then you
go<00:02:16.360> into<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:20.110> now<00:02:21.010> one<00:02:21.700> thing<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.299> you<00:02:22.480> got

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
go into this now one thing that you got

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.780 
go into this now one thing that you got
to<00:02:22.720> look<00:02:22.930> at<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.379> is<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:25.319> discolored<00:02:26.319> ball

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
to look at is is that discolored ball

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.710 
to look at is is that discolored ball
going<00:02:27.790> back<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.300> forth<00:02:28.569> between<00:02:28.780> hands

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
going back and forth between hands

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.170 
going back and forth between hands
or<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:29.930> changing<00:02:30.380> if<00:02:31.220> it's<00:02:31.520> changing

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
or is it changing if it's changing

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.910 
or is it changing if it's changing
you're<00:02:32.360> doing<00:02:32.600> something<00:02:32.780> wrong<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.350> think<00:02:33.860> I'm

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
you're doing something wrong I think I'm

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.740 
you're doing something wrong I think I'm
going<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.130> put<00:02:34.250> some<00:02:34.280> slow<00:02:34.700> motion<00:02:35.210> into<00:02:35.600> this

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
going to put some slow motion into this

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.230 
going to put some slow motion into this
so<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.830> see<00:02:37.220> exactly<00:02:37.880> what's

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
so that you can see exactly what's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.330 
so that you can see exactly what's
happening<00:02:38.720> because<00:02:39.230> it's<00:02:39.500> really<00:02:39.650> not<00:02:39.980> I

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
happening because it's really not I

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.450 
happening because it's really not I
can't<00:02:40.910> put<00:02:41.120> many<00:02:41.300> words<00:02:41.540> into<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.460> it's

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
can't put many words into it it's it's

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.030 
can't put many words into it it's it's
take<00:02:43.850> outs<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:45.170> you're<00:02:45.410> bringing<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.890> down

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
take outs but you're bringing it down

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.070 
take outs but you're bringing it down
instead<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.580> out<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.120> mean<00:02:47.420> that's<00:02:47.510> really<00:02:47.900> all

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
instead of out I mean that's really all

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.280 
instead of out I mean that's really all
this<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.620> um<00:02:49.180> offer<00:02:50.180> some<00:02:50.570> slow<00:02:50.780> motion<00:02:51.140> in

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
this so um offer some slow motion in

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.310 
this so um offer some slow motion in
right<00:02:52.040> now
