00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
this is what was supposed to be the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.650 
this is what was supposed to be the
lounge<00:00:27.570> area<00:00:28.880> but<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
lounge area but now it's kind of like a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.209 
lounge area but now it's kind of like a
study<00:00:31.019> area<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.679> there's<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.610> writing<00:00:33.210> desk<00:00:34.219> so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
study area so there's a writing desk so

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
study area so there's a writing desk so
if<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.399> gate<00:00:35.610> looks<00:00:35.790> familiar<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
if this gate looks familiar it is it's a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.959 
if this gate looks familiar it is it's a
gate<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.530> saw<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> previous<00:00:38.250> video<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
gate you saw in the previous video it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.410 
gate you saw in the previous video it
was<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.570> gate<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.079> front<00:00:40.320> door<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.940> didn't

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
was the gate to my front door it didn't

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.910 
was the gate to my front door it didn't
work<00:00:42.629> though<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:43.440> reason<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
work though because for some reason the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.950 
work though because for some reason the
doorway<00:00:44.460> became<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:44.969> narrow<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
doorway became very narrow so we have to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.560 
doorway became very narrow so we have to
take<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> off<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> furniture<00:00:47.789> came<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
take it off when the furniture came in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.790 
take it off when the furniture came in
and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.020> realized<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> looked

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and then I realized that it looked

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.350 
and then I realized that it looked
better<00:00:49.920> without<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.430> gate<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.969> we've<00:00:51.120> got<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
better without the gate so we've got to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
better without the gate so we've got to
get<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.690> give<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> fresh<00:00:52.920> coat<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.190> paint<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
get in give it a fresh coat of paint and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.709 
get in give it a fresh coat of paint and
voila<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.230> wall<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.770> sleep<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
voila it is not a wall to sleep this is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.319 
voila it is not a wall to sleep this is
the<00:00:58.050> living<00:00:58.260> room<00:00:58.350> area<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.730> you're

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the living room area so if you're

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.869 
the living room area so if you're
wondering<00:01:00.960> where<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.949> TV<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
wondering where the TV is which I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.009 
wondering where the TV is which I
realize<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> lot<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.420> people<00:01:03.660> need<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> live

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
realize a lot of people need to live

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
realize a lot of people need to live
with<00:01:04.199> TV<00:01:04.559> well<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.129> electronics<00:01:05.670> are

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
with TV well I think the electronics are

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
with TV well I think the electronics are
ugly<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> kept<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.290> hidden<00:01:09.619> welcome<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
ugly so I kept it hidden welcome to the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
ugly so I kept it hidden welcome to the
