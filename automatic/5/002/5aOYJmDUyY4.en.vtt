00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello to everyone then this video 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.549
 could also be included in the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.820
 very short questions, however, is a little bit 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.250
 plus a feeling h to a warning for 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.019
 who is willing to buy or to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.000
 compact to know a little bit how he 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.539
 relates or who has found what 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.689
 similar has the power I will tell shortly about 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.560
 lego city undercover and this is a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.210
 important problem goes to practices too 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 after all I will recommend 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.009
 game strongly not very difficult but 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 it is immense after a few minutes already produced 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.510
 start counting quotes and and it is 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.250
 fucking fun honestly is 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.530
 very much fun is not much 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.100
 difficult but aiming for another exploration 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 I know therefore in sap it is usually with problem 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 which was what I wanted to point out 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.059
 today and by chorus three video examples with 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.719
 Registered one a little while ago is a pair of 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.210
 evening and the first loadings 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.989
 exaggeratedly slow and continuous of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.149
 this title 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.550
 let's say I just solved it 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.030
 problem to a res 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.860
 already humanly livable in the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.490
 system loading level 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.979
 operating 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.820
 going out of games and so on now is a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.740
 normal leader though 2013 new consumption 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.350
 this game is made by tt games 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.130
 that you think of an internal group and I mean 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.490
 and I don't know if a before the game itself but 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.799
 programming may be or why 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.079
 in short, the game needed a lot 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.400
 great for an installation and nintendo 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.619
 given the very little knowledge of wewaii 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.649
 true memory so as not to force a 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.560
 buy veti import external disks 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.500
 maybe in some games it will push 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.119
 especially in its interior and not 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.700
 have mandatory installation done 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.649
 a bit like passion 3 to say no 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.689
 viper signed a written enemy 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.729
 message with written here may be 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.890
 downloadable digital delivery this 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.409
 climate does not hide come can be 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.110
 in the console which is that anyway 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.540
 premium and there is there because the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.470
 game and if I'm not mistaken to install on 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.240
 downloaded 28 giga my console later 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.030
 don beyou the update e 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.860
 updating the antigua console 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.760
 black remained 26 years of seven people 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.810
 there might not have been digital 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.390
 delivery and would have solved just not 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.220
 so now I'll show you these three 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.790
 examples of this business of 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.130
 uploads that I want to point out 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.400
 happens every logic minutes but not every 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.950
 once he's out the door and give me 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.370
 a new mission city, etc. also 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.269
 if there is no written call or 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:00.230
 chat between two colleagues and captain 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.230
 often often often and I am very boring 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.420
 I read yes under 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:15.300
 there is the television there is a corner of 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.300
 do and then see when the game starts 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.470
 this is the view already day with 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.330
 update and finally has one 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:32.940
 normal speed and look at this is the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.940
 game and this is the loading bar 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.790
 look at what supreme speed he has 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.110
 polite you will see what charge is 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.500
 barra sees the others as anthology 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.500
 vision 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.680
 sorry for the video quality that is not excellent 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:04:02.680
 but to me as you see can song go in 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:07.630
 bathroom in the neighborhood is absolutely 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:18.299
 loaded the first home screen 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:18.299
 start on the padule places a little bit up 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.180
 I start 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.310
 and another bar immediately behind also 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.580
 this really fast you do n't 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.290
 go load another page where 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.150
 I was the last time you were 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.700
 created a file and say that a spoiler 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.430
 adro but it is a new interior there are 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:49.950
 accidents that there was who knows who knows who 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:56.040
 what this also volume for what less 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:58.860
 do not feel that I know what comes next and 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.030
 does not start from who knows what but a 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.140
 environment a room so see one 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:14.340
 tina room small spoiler building 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:15.750
 therefore we do not say that as he tells us not 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.850
 is who I have to upload who knows what and how 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.550
 load a bang after I will show 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.380
 another really another upload 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:29.460
 really interesting this instead ad 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:31.530
 example when practically loading the 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.450
 game map that we say is a 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.150
 little bit big is not as immense as 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.590
 maybe other games though when you load 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.890
 the game map every time that gives us 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.980
 a palace of this kind has little cost 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.290
 is the result 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.910
 let's say in real time they have already passed 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.910
 almost twenty seconds 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.509
 real fun that when so many don't 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:02.139
 issue and exit in this sense of 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:07.150
 police exits every time and this 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:09.969
 wait here you will soon understand that too 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.580
 on entering a place to treat it 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:17.020
 what you say i do when to become 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.550
 really for the game and not because 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.259
 I just want to check it out why 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.309
 up to 20 really really diet 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:25.749
 long and unnerving at least for the 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.639
 undersigned 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:29.860
 we remember that we are in 2013 with a 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.189
 console practically for the exit of the 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.189
 new generation 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:39.729
 you can see it's over and this is it 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.009
 let 's say the map of the city the map of 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:45.580
 game as we have seen slowness is 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.759
 exaggerating exasperating and followed five 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.889
 26 years ago when the cable was comfortable 64 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:53.649
 I could also wait three four 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.529
 five hours to load the game a 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:58.990
 game and now 2010 with a console 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:01.810
 new generation because let's remember 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.919
 always or nothing remains this thing is me 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.389
 on the bales 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.669
 now I don't want to say this will be the 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:11.199
 nintendo's near future with yours 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:14.879
 games maybe and I only hope with 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:18.879
 this title or a few other elected but is 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:22.330
 briefly I think the installation is 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:25.539
 lost the pink hard drive could do 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.149
 the difference and maybe let me know 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:29.560
 now the very short questions for you in 

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:32.860
 in any case I recommend the game but the 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.800
 video was dedicated for those who are intense from 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.229
 buy it and a nice game awaits us but 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.830
 with this problem alongside ea 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:43.870
 question was this problem for you is 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.330
 important who I think will give 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.569
 boots in the game were the 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:51.729
 games in the past that maybe this for 

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:55.259
 who played it maybe you have 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:59.069
 dropped the end vote of the game ho 

00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:02.350
 filled in including both the bag and 

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:05.020
 you have abandoned it or 

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.850
 playing with it he retired because 

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.070
 it was too boring too long 

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.380
 read for private in more wine acts 

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:16.570
 rhythm let me know 

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.570
 I'm waiting for your answers
