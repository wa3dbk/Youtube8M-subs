00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
sure what to name it but yeah limpa will

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.110 
sure what to name it but yeah limpa will
be<00:03:10.629> able<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.049> provide<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.709> good<00:03:11.980> base<00:03:12.670> for<00:03:12.970> that

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
be able to provide a good base for that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.699 
be able to provide a good base for that
because<00:03:13.269> they<00:03:13.540> do<00:03:13.599> have<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.989> funds<00:03:14.230> compared

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
because they do have the funds compared

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.250 
because they do have the funds compared
to<00:03:14.799> Sunderland<00:03:15.510> Sandlin<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.750> will<00:03:16.930> won't<00:03:17.079> be

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
to Sunderland Sandlin it will won't be

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.479 
to Sunderland Sandlin it will won't be
good<00:03:17.379> to<00:03:17.500> buy<00:03:17.650> young<00:03:17.709> players<00:03:18.129> because<00:03:18.370> they

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
good to buy young players because they

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.710 
good to buy young players because they
don't<00:03:18.639> have<00:03:18.699> good<00:03:18.970> players<00:03:19.120> apart<00:03:19.540> from<00:03:19.690> that

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
don't have good players apart from that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.259 
don't have good players apart from that
so<00:03:20.019> Liverpool<00:03:20.500> would<00:03:20.680> suit<00:03:20.889> that<00:03:21.099> too<00:03:21.430> bill

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
so Liverpool would suit that too bill

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.610 
so Liverpool would suit that too bill
from<00:03:22.419> that<00:03:22.480> way<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.900> course<00:03:23.079> Liverpool<00:03:23.530> is

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620
