if<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.020> can<00:04:55.140> get<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.410> camera<00:04:55.800> around<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.340> where

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
if I can get the camera around to where

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.660 
if I can get the camera around to where
i<00:04:57.560> had<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.680> skim<00:04:58.950> over<00:04:58.980> although<00:04:59.760> i<00:05:01.370> think<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
i had the skim over although i think the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.620 
i had the skim over although i think the
wind<00:05:02.850> direction<00:05:03.000> will<00:05:03.330> stop<00:05:03.570> me<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:06.330> i<00:05:06.420> can<00:05:06.450> get

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
wind direction will stop me so i can get

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.360 
wind direction will stop me so i can get
around<00:05:06.930> with<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.320> now<00:05:07.500> wind<00:05:07.920> direction<00:05:08.070> will

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
around with it now wind direction will

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.990 
around with it now wind direction will
stop<00:05:08.580> me<00:05:08.730> it'll<00:05:09.600> tip<00:05:09.780> me<00:05:09.930> over
