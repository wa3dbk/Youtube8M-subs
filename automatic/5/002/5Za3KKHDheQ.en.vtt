there's no real significant changes

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.579 
there's no real significant changes
besides<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.429> fairings<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.120> did<00:01:00.359> add<00:01:00.659> a<00:01:00.690> big

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
besides the fairings they did add a big

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.179 
besides the fairings they did add a big
piston<00:01:02.100> show<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> fork<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.500> also<00:01:04.710> added

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
piston show a fork and they also added

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.780 
piston show a fork and they also added
split<00:01:06.149> spoke<00:01:06.509> wheels<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.320> guys<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.549> there

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
split spoke wheels as you guys see there

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.730 
split spoke wheels as you guys see there
those<00:01:09.000> split<00:01:09.360> spoke<00:01:09.659> wheels<00:01:09.990> look<00:01:10.530> identical

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
those split spoke wheels look identical

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.660 
those split spoke wheels look identical
to<00:01:11.549> those<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.759> are<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.299> 2012<00:01:13.110> CBR<00:01:13.680> 1000w<00:01:14.490> R

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to those that are on my 2012 CBR 1000w R

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
to those that are on my 2012 CBR 1000w R
so<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.479> probably<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.990> added<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> same

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so they probably just added the same

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
so they probably just added the same
wheels<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> bike<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.689> guys<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:19.049> it
