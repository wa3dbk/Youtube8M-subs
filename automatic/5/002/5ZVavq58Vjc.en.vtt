number<00:00:02.850> six<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:04.140> week<00:00:04.350> I'm<00:00:04.500> going<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.710> talk

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
number six this week I'm going to talk

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.000 
number six this week I'm going to talk
about<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.640> motion<00:00:06.330> or<00:00:06.629> distance<00:00:07.589> sensor

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
about this motion or distance sensor

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.240 
about this motion or distance sensor
that<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.189> plug<00:00:08.490> into<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.820> camera<00:00:09.150> axe<00:00:10.250> this

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
that can plug into the camera axe this

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.549 
that can plug into the camera axe this
is<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> sonar<00:00:11.940> based<00:00:12.300> sensor<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.990> I'll<00:00:13.259> put<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
is a sonar based sensor and I'll put the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.120 
is a sonar based sensor and I'll put the
data<00:00:13.799> sheet<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.660> show<00:00:16.020> notes<00:00:16.130> so

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
data sheet for this in the show notes so

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.550 
data sheet for this in the show notes so
you<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.369> read<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> technical<00:00:18.300> specs<00:00:19.230> if

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
you can read all the technical specs if

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.099 
you can read all the technical specs if
you<00:00:19.680> want<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.460> basically<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.660> way<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> works

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
you want but basically the way it works

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.009 
you want but basically the way it works
is<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.490> sonar<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> sends<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.660> sound

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
is it's a sonar so it sends out sound

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.349 
is it's a sonar so it sends out sound
waves<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.099> an<00:00:26.220> object<00:00:26.369> comes<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.090> front

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
waves and when an object comes in front

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.900 
waves and when an object comes in front
of<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> those<00:00:28.289> sound<00:00:28.560> waves<00:00:28.769> reflect<00:00:29.369> back<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
of it those sound waves reflect back and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.780 
of it those sound waves reflect back and
you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.990> detect<00:00:31.320> how<00:00:31.710> far<00:00:31.949> away<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.340> object

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
you can detect how far away that object

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.450 
you can detect how far away that object
is<00:00:32.910> within<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.390> few<00:00:33.630> inches<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:35.250> maximum

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
is within a few inches and the maximum

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.600 
is within a few inches and the maximum
range<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> sensor<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.380> 23<00:00:38.100> feet<00:00:38.129> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
range for the sensor is about 23 feet so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.139 
range for the sensor is about 23 feet so
anything<00:00:38.969> between<00:00:39.270> zero<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.899> 23<00:00:40.559> feet<00:00:40.770> in

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
anything between zero and 23 feet in

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.190 
anything between zero and 23 feet in
this<00:00:42.149> cone-shaped<00:00:43.760> sensing<00:00:44.760> region<00:00:45.570> it'll<00:00:46.020> be

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
this cone-shaped sensing region it'll be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
this cone-shaped sensing region it'll be
able<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.530> detect<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:50.039> advantage<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.820> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
able to detect now the advantage of this

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.979 
able to detect now the advantage of this
over<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:52.050> typical<00:00:52.530> PIR<00:00:53.370> type<00:00:53.730> sensor<00:00:54.360> which

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
over your typical PIR type sensor which

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
over your typical PIR type sensor which
is<00:00:55.170> those<00:00:55.410> white<00:00:55.949> domed<00:00:56.430> sensors<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
is those white domed sensors that you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
is those white domed sensors that you
often<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.859> detecting<00:00:59.370> motion<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.850> that

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
often see for detecting motion is that

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.729 
often see for detecting motion is that
with<00:01:00.510> photography<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.530> lot<00:01:01.710> more

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
with photography you want a lot more

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.340 
with photography you want a lot more
control<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.690> let<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.960> detect

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
control and this will let you detect

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
control and this will let you detect
exactly<00:01:04.530> where<00:01:05.369> something<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.119> know

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
exactly where something is you know

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
exactly where something is you know
within<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.570> few<00:01:06.780> inches<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.280> want<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
within a few inches so if you want to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.270 
within a few inches so if you want to
use<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> camera<00:01:10.439> acts<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.920> detect

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
use this with the camera acts and detect

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
use this with the camera acts and detect
you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.909> something's<00:01:12.360> between<00:01:12.750> seven<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
you know something's between seven and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.030 
you know something's between seven and
eight<00:01:13.799> feet<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:16.470> with

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
eight feet you can do that and with

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.070 
eight feet you can do that and with
photography<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.390> extra<00:01:18.659> control

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
photography you want that extra control

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080 
photography you want that extra control
you<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> know<00:01:19.680> where<00:01:19.950> something<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you want to know where something is and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
you want to know where something is and
only<00:01:21.720> take<00:01:21.990> pictures<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.250> sort<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
only take pictures when it is in sort of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.870 
only take pictures when it is in sort of
that<00:01:23.880> region<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.580> show<00:01:26.610> how

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that region so now I'm going to show how

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.070 
that region so now I'm going to show how
to<00:01:26.939> set<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> camera<00:01:27.720> acts<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
to set up the camera acts with the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.399 
to set up the camera acts with the
motion<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.590> distance<00:01:28.979> sensor<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
motion or distance sensor so we have the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.460 
motion or distance sensor so we have the
distance<00:01:32.130> sensor<00:01:32.790> plugged<00:01:33.030> into<00:01:33.290> sensor<00:01:34.290> port

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
distance sensor plugged into sensor port

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.620 
distance sensor plugged into sensor port
number<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.220> you'd<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.030> either<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
number one and you'd have either a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.590 
number one and you'd have either a
camera<00:01:37.110> flash<00:01:37.409> plugged<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.340> kemah<00:01:39.210> flash

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
camera flash plugged in to kemah flash

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.850 
camera flash plugged in to kemah flash
port<00:01:40.500> number<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:42.530> holding<00:01:43.530> down<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
port number one holding down the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.499 
port number one holding down the
activate<00:01:44.310> button<00:01:44.340> while<00:01:44.729> turning<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
activate button while turning it on just

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.370 
activate button while turning it on just
to<00:01:45.630> reset<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.649> camera<00:01:46.829> acts<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> defaults<00:01:51.380> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to reset the camera acts the defaults so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.249 
to reset the camera acts the defaults so
that's<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.180> first<00:01:54.450> line<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.930> trigger

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that's the this first line this trigger

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.249 
that's the this first line this trigger
sensor<00:01:55.740> line<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:58.130> basically<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.159> saying

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
sensor line is basically just saying

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.870 
sensor line is basically just saying
that<00:02:01.259> device<00:02:01.950> number<00:02:02.130> one<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.610> your

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that device number one which is your

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.080 
that device number one which is your
camera<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.750> triggered<00:02:04.140> by<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
camera is going to get triggered by the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
camera is going to get triggered by the
motion<00:02:06.090> sensor<00:02:06.540> which<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.229> plugged<00:02:07.560> into

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
motion sensor which is plugged into

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
sensor number one the delay for this

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.760 
sensor number one the delay for this
type<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> sensor<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.690> usually<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
type of sensor is usually going to be

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.050 
type of sensor is usually going to be
easy

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
easy

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.699 
easy
but<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.299> wanted<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.049> have<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.349> delay

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
but if you wanted to have a delay

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.440 
but if you wanted to have a delay
between<00:02:16.769> when<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.370> sensor<00:02:18.060> detects

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
between when the sensor detects

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.149 
between when the sensor detects
something<00:02:18.719> and<00:02:19.140> when<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.349> take<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> photo<00:02:19.829> you

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
something and when you take a photo you

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.319 
something and when you take a photo you
could<00:02:20.370> add<00:02:20.549> a<00:02:20.780> value<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.959> here<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:23.159> make<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
could add a value in here to make that

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.220 
could add a value in here to make that
delay<00:02:24.629> happen<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:26.340> bulb<00:02:26.640> time<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.780> basically

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
delay happen the bulb time is basically

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.110 
delay happen the bulb time is basically
how<00:02:28.409> long<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.890> camera<00:02:29.400> acts<00:02:29.579> is<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
how long the camera acts is going to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.170 
how long the camera acts is going to
trigger<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.810> camera<00:02:31.409> or<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.829> flash<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:35.180> two

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
trigger the camera or the flash so two

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.589 
trigger the camera or the flash so two
seconds<00:02:36.689> means<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.310> if<00:02:38.310> your<00:02:38.640> cameras<00:02:39.299> in

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
seconds means that if your cameras in

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.750 
seconds means that if your cameras in
single<00:02:40.170> shot<00:02:40.349> mode<00:02:40.590> it'll<00:02:40.889> take<00:02:41.099> one<00:02:41.459> shot

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
single shot mode it'll take one shot

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.640 
single shot mode it'll take one shot
wait<00:02:42.329> for<00:02:42.569> two<00:02:42.720> seconds<00:02:43.139> and<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:43.409> take

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
wait for two seconds and then take

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.530 
wait for two seconds and then take
another<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.189> if<00:02:44.370> something's<00:02:44.849> still

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
another one if something's still

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.170 
another one if something's still
triggering<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.139> camera<00:02:46.500> acts<00:02:46.819> if<00:02:47.819> it's<00:02:48.060> in

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
triggering the camera acts if it's in

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.050 
triggering the camera acts if it's in
multi<00:02:48.569> shot<00:02:48.810> mode<00:02:49.489> your<00:02:50.489> camera<00:02:50.849> would

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
multi shot mode your camera would

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.629 
multi shot mode your camera would
continue<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.840> take<00:02:52.079> photos<00:02:52.620> for<00:02:52.650> two<00:02:53.159> seconds

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
continue to take photos for two seconds

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.199 
continue to take photos for two seconds
as<00:02:53.970> fast<00:02:54.239> as<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.599> can<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.019> then<00:02:56.030> after<00:02:57.030> two

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
as fast as it can and then after two

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.940 
as fast as it can and then after two
seconds<00:02:57.659> it<00:02:57.750> would<00:02:57.810> either<00:02:57.989> stop<00:02:58.379> if<00:02:58.739> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
seconds it would either stop if the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.149 
seconds it would either stop if the
thing<00:02:59.159> is<00:02:59.310> moved<00:02:59.579> out<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.739> sensing<00:03:01.739> region

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.179 
thing is moved out of the sensing region
for<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.760> camera<00:03:03.090> acts<00:03:03.239> or<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:04.189> still

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
for the camera acts or if it's still

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.740 
for the camera acts or if it's still
triggering<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.790> camera<00:03:06.120> acts<00:03:06.269> then<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.629> will

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
triggering the camera acts then it will

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.780 
triggering the camera acts then it will
take<00:03:07.019> photos<00:03:07.409> for<00:03:07.439> another<00:03:07.859> two<00:03:08.129> seconds

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.390 

pre-focus<00:03:11.790> if<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.689> a<00:03:13.049> camera<00:03:14.040> plugged

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
pre-focus if you have a camera plugged

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.860 
pre-focus if you have a camera plugged
in<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.669> might<00:03:14.849> want<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.120> change<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.540> yes

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
in you might want to change that to yes

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.530 
in you might want to change that to yes
to<00:03:16.230> reduce<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.370> shutter<00:03:17.849> lag<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:20.549> trigger

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
to reduce the shutter lag the trigger

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.479 
to reduce the shutter lag the trigger
type<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.949> trigger<00:03:23.190> value<00:03:24.859> really<00:03:25.859> depend

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
type and the trigger value really depend

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.259 
type and the trigger value really depend
on<00:03:26.849> how<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.780> want<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.229> use<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:29.190> motion<00:03:29.790> sensor

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
on how you want to use the motion sensor

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.259 
on how you want to use the motion sensor
so<00:03:31.049> in<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.590> room<00:03:31.889> it<00:03:32.040> looks<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
so in this room it looks like the

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.000 
so in this room it looks like the
standard<00:03:33.900> value<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:35.549> about<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> hundred<00:03:36.139> to<00:03:37.139> 107

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
standard value is about a hundred to 107

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.909 
standard value is about a hundred to 107
and<00:03:38.190> that's<00:03:38.909> basically<00:03:39.799> detecting<00:03:40.799> the

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
and that's basically detecting the

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.189 
and that's basically detecting the
ceiling<00:03:41.400> if<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.669> had<00:03:41.849> a<00:03:41.879> taller<00:03:42.269> ceiling<00:03:42.930> it

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
ceiling if I had a taller ceiling it

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.449 
ceiling if I had a taller ceiling it
would<00:03:43.349> go<00:03:43.470> up<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.970> 999<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.150> an<00:03:45.540> open<00:03:45.870> space<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
would go up to 999 in an open space and

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.920 
would go up to 999 in an open space and
when<00:03:47.459> something<00:03:47.849> passes<00:03:48.060> in<00:03:48.449> front<00:03:48.479> of<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
when something passes in front of it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.569 
when something passes in front of it
like<00:03:51.930> my<00:03:52.109> hand<00:03:52.379> is<00:03:52.620> just<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.979> few<00:03:53.190> inches<00:03:53.310> above

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
like my hand is just a few inches above

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.089 
like my hand is just a few inches above
it<00:03:53.849> right<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:55.019> get<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> value<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.889> around

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
it right now you get a value of around

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.759 
it right now you get a value of around
you<00:03:56.609> know<00:03:56.729> 20<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.049> if<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.439> go<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.590> little

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
you know 20 or so if I go a little

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.599 
you know 20 or so if I go a little
higher<00:03:59.989> mouths<00:04:00.989> maybe<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.590> foot<00:04:01.859> and<00:04:01.949> a<00:04:02.010> half<00:04:02.040> i

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
higher mouths maybe a foot and a half i

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.469 
higher mouths maybe a foot and a half i
get<00:04:02.879> a<00:04:02.909> value<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.239> 42<00:04:04.669> so<00:04:05.669> you<00:04:05.819> can<00:04:06.150> correlate

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
get a value of 42 so you can correlate

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.849 
get a value of 42 so you can correlate
those<00:04:06.930> numbers<00:04:07.439> to<00:04:07.889> actual<00:04:08.699> feet<00:04:09.449> and<00:04:09.859> let's

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
those numbers to actual feet and let's

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.249 
those numbers to actual feet and let's
say<00:04:11.069> we<00:04:11.250> wanted<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.609> set<00:04:11.939> the<00:04:11.970> camera<00:04:12.569> acts<00:04:12.689> to

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
say we wanted to set the camera acts to

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.860 
say we wanted to set the camera acts to
take<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.739> photo<00:04:14.099> when<00:04:14.790> something<00:04:15.329> got<00:04:15.569> pretty

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
take a photo when something got pretty

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.039 
take a photo when something got pretty
close<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.370> I'll<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.269> I'll<00:04:20.810> change<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
close so what I'll do is I'll change the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:33.559 
close so what I'll do is I'll change the
triggering<00:04:22.409> value<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.039> something<00:04:23.490> like<00:04:24.650> 40

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.549 

and<00:04:34.069> we<00:04:35.069> want<00:04:35.279> it<00:04:35.399> to<00:04:35.429> trigger<00:04:35.819> when<00:04:36.559> something

00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:37.559 
and we want it to trigger when something

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.739 
and we want it to trigger when something
gets<00:04:37.679> close<00:04:38.099> and<00:04:38.129> when<00:04:38.819> something<00:04:39.270> gets<00:04:39.360> close

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 
gets close and when something gets close

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:41.629 
gets close and when something gets close
to<00:04:39.779> the<00:04:40.110> sensor<00:04:40.589> the<00:04:40.800> value<00:04:41.129> is<00:04:41.249> lower<00:04:41.520> so

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
to the sensor the value is lower so

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.399 
to the sensor the value is lower so
we're<00:04:41.999> going<00:04:42.179> to<00:04:44.330> we're<00:04:45.330> going<00:04:45.509> to<00:04:45.629> trigger<00:04:46.139> on

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
we're going to we're going to trigger on

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.619 
we're going to we're going to trigger on
a<00:04:46.439> low<00:04:47.159> value<00:04:47.399> instead<00:04:47.819> of<00:04:47.999> a<00:04:48.029> high<00:04:48.209> value

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.519 

that's<00:04:51.629> pretty<00:04:51.839> much<00:04:52.020> all<00:04:52.199> you<00:04:52.259> should<00:04:52.499> need

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:52.529 
that's pretty much all you should need

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.419 
that's pretty much all you should need
to<00:04:52.709> do<00:04:53.009> for<00:04:53.249> this<00:04:53.389> sensor<00:04:54.389> so<00:04:55.379> when<00:04:56.189> I<00:04:56.219> hit

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:56.429 
to do for this sensor so when I hit

00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:00.260 
to do for this sensor so when I hit
activate<00:04:57.209> and<00:04:58.729> nothing<00:04:59.729> sort<00:04:59.909> of<00:04:59.969> happens

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
activate and nothing sort of happens

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.820 
activate and nothing sort of happens
when<00:05:00.569> I<00:05:00.659> press<00:05:00.719> my<00:05:00.990> hand<00:05:01.319> right<00:05:01.469> in<00:05:01.529> front<00:05:01.740> of

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
when I press my hand right in front of

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.859 
when I press my hand right in front of
it<00:05:02.009> this<00:05:02.909> led<00:05:03.149> goes<00:05:03.689> on<00:05:03.869> which<00:05:04.199> is<00:05:04.409> basically

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:05.869 
it this led goes on which is basically

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:08.839 
it this led goes on which is basically
indicating<00:05:06.869> that<00:05:06.990> this<00:05:07.499> camera<00:05:08.189> or<00:05:08.399> the<00:05:08.430> flash

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
indicating that this camera or the flash

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.429 
indicating that this camera or the flash
plugged<00:05:09.479> into<00:05:09.659> this<00:05:09.869> port<00:05:10.199> would<00:05:10.319> be

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:10.439 
plugged into this port would be

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:15.619 
plugged into this port would be
triggered<00:05:11.389> so<00:05:14.119> that's<00:05:15.119> pretty<00:05:15.360> much<00:05:15.449> it

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
triggered so that's pretty much it

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.770 
triggered so that's pretty much it
thanks<00:05:16.319> for<00:05:16.439> watching
