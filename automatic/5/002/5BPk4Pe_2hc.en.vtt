so<00:00:10.770> clockwise<00:00:11.220> rotation

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.620 

so<00:00:21.810> 200<00:00:22.050> photos<00:00:22.530> quite<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> high<00:00:23.340> quality<00:00:23.820> we're

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so 200 photos quite a high quality we're

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.470 
so 200 photos quite a high quality we're
doing<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.930> rotation<00:00:25.110> all<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> them<00:00:26.190> yeah<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.360> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
doing a rotation all of them yeah at the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.569 
doing a rotation all of them yeah at the
same<00:00:27.690> time<00:00:27.920> yeah

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.290 

so<00:00:35.210> yeah<00:00:35.480> it's<00:00:35.749> probably<00:00:36.079> going<00:00:36.379> to<00:00:36.469> take<00:00:36.559> time

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.790 

the<00:00:41.300> progress<00:00:41.780> bar<00:00:41.989> sometimes<00:00:42.620> that

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
the progress bar sometimes that

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.500 
the progress bar sometimes that
understand<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.429> picasa<00:00:43.760> bit<00:00:44.000> it's<00:00:44.449> still

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
understand the picasa bit it's still

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.630 
understand the picasa bit it's still
rotating<00:00:45.019> sometimes<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:45.739> progress<00:00:46.129> bar<00:00:46.370> gets

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
rotating sometimes the progress bar gets

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.700 
rotating sometimes the progress bar gets
stuck<00:00:46.909> but<00:00:47.269> you'll<00:00:47.510> see<00:00:47.719> what<00:00:48.140> i'll<00:00:48.260> do<00:00:48.440> is<00:00:48.559> as

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
stuck but you'll see what i'll do is as

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.110 
stuck but you'll see what i'll do is as
soon<00:00:48.739> as<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.159> rotates<00:00:49.339> them<00:00:49.760> do<00:00:49.879> another

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
soon as it rotates them do another

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.049 
soon as it rotates them do another
rotation<00:00:50.949> so<00:00:51.949> don't<00:00:52.219> don't<00:00:52.430> pay<00:00:52.609> attention<00:00:52.670> to

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
rotation so don't don't pay attention to

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.829 
rotation so don't don't pay attention to
progress<00:00:53.539> bar<00:00:57.280> yeah<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.519> did<00:00:59.089> it<00:00:59.210> early<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.570> it

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
progress bar yeah I did it early on it

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.079 
progress bar yeah I did it early on it
was<00:00:59.869> it<00:01:00.649> was<00:01:00.859> showing<00:01:01.039> a<00:01:01.219> progress<00:01:01.579> bar<00:01:01.640> but

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
was it was showing a progress bar but

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.749 
was it was showing a progress bar but
here<00:01:02.649> so<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.739> can<00:01:03.890> see<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.220> how<00:01:04.369> this<00:01:04.549> is

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
here so you can see the how this is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:12.730 
here so you can see the how this is
quite<00:01:05.000> slow<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:08.479> SSD<00:01:09.020> seems<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.590> be<00:01:11.440> swayed<00:01:12.440> it

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
quite slow the SSD seems to be swayed it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:22.710 
quite slow the SSD seems to be swayed it
will<00:01:12.950> rotate<00:01:13.220> not<00:01:13.549> Roy<00:01:13.759> thanks<00:01:14.420> right

if you want I'll show you also how to
clone<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.060> software<00:01:47.660> how<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:47.900> clone<00:01:48.380> how<00:01:48.680> easy

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
clone the software how to clone how easy

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.100 
clone the software how to clone how easy
the<00:01:49.220> bundle<00:01:49.550> is<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.970> use<00:01:50.150> let's<00:01:50.840> do<00:01:51.050> another

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
the bundle is to use let's do another

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.340 
the bundle is to use let's do another
rotation<00:01:51.620> quickly

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.280 

yeah<00:01:58.350> but

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
yeah but

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.400 
yeah but
back<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.010> up<00:02:00.100> yeah<00:02:00.520> exactly<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.840> game<00:02:02.020> can

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
back it up yeah exactly so the game can

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.380 
back it up yeah exactly so the game can
you<00:02:02.500> seal<00:02:02.680> probably<00:02:02.860> as<00:02:03.040> well<00:02:03.220> yeah<00:02:03.640> is<00:02:04.240> it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
you seal probably as well yeah is it

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.700 
you seal probably as well yeah is it
better<00:02:04.540> yeah

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.660 

so<00:02:09.310> yeah<00:02:09.580> we<00:02:09.760> are<00:02:10.240> really<00:02:10.450> not<00:02:11.260> very<00:02:12.040> nice<00:02:12.430> with

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
so yeah we are really not very nice with

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.400 
so yeah we are really not very nice with
the<00:02:12.760> poor<00:02:12.940> laptops<00:02:13.330> here<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.020> desktop

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
the poor laptops here on the desktop

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.350 
the poor laptops here on the desktop
it's<00:02:14.830> also<00:02:15.010> good<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.610> benchmarks<00:02:16.240> on

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
it's also good to do benchmarks on

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.090 
it's also good to do benchmarks on
desktop<00:02:16.810> because<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.200> got<00:02:17.350> more<00:02:17.500> powerful

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
desktop because you got more powerful

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.740 
desktop because you got more powerful
you<00:02:18.130> know<00:02:18.310> systems<00:02:18.760> but<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.450> have<00:02:19.570> anything

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you know systems but we have anything

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.220 
you know systems but we have anything
like<00:02:20.020> HD<00:02:20.500> attack<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:21.570> don't<00:02:22.570> have<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.870> don't

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
like HD attack I don't have it I don't

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.840 
like HD attack I don't have it I don't
know<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.710> dual<00:02:24.250> internet<00:02:24.730> you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
know if you have dual internet you

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.790 
know if you have dual internet you
because<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.330> would<00:02:25.660> definitely<00:02:25.960> show<00:02:26.290> that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
because that would definitely show that

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.710 
because that would definitely show that
configures<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:28.030> read<00:02:28.410> okay<00:02:29.410> yeah<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.860> could<00:02:30.040> I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
configures the read okay yeah we could I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.080 
configures the read okay yeah we could I
think<00:02:31.720> I've<00:02:31.930> got<00:02:31.960> let<00:02:32.890> me<00:02:33.040> see<00:02:33.250> how<00:02:33.490> color<00:02:33.700> USB

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
think I've got let me see how color USB

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.320 
think I've got let me see how color USB
stick<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.750> check<00:02:34.990> here<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:36.760> get

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
stick so we can check here we get

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.470 
stick so we can check here we get
internet<00:02:37.720> somewhere<00:02:37.960> it's<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.010> free<00:02:39.190> software

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
internet somewhere it's a free software

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.570 
internet somewhere it's a free software
okay<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.960> yeah<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.830> ask<00:02:41.980> probably<00:02:42.340> for<00:02:42.550> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
okay so yeah we can ask probably for the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.280 
okay so yeah we can ask probably for the
internets<00:02:43.060> yeah<00:02:45.090> by<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.150> way<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.600> told<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:47.140> use

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
internets yeah by the way I told you use

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.960
