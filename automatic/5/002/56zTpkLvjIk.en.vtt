 will be 34 guilty 80 g of butter 200 g of 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:16.909
 philadelphia 20 grams of sugar 25 ml 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.909
 of milk two sheets of gelatin 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:27.790
 2 teaspoons of lemon juice a 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.170
 pinch of salt and whipping cream 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.060
 since the utensils we will go 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.970
 use for this recipe will be 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.620
 several hairs will list each time 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.230
 then first we will take the 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:43.870
 our oreo cakes and we share a 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:51.369
 half we remove the cream and put it a 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:56.619
 flat let's review the last one then put on 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:02:01.390
 aside the filling of oreo we take 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:06.490
 a fair mix and slowly put them on 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.260
 oreo inside here also the last ones 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.420
 biscuit and we finely chopped 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.780
 we consider the homeland 4 5 tablespoons per 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.250
 table because we will use them as 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.200
 final decoration of our cake e 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.910
 this is where we will first dissolve the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.480
 our pure in the saucepan and then give it to him 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.310
 we will put together 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.030
 everything here wants our butter to be 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.320
 let's mix well with ours 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.320
 they arrive that we have ground 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.540
 let's take our cake tin mi 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.950
 I recommend this way to facilitate 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.060
 better after when you have to remove the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 we take our baking paper 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.330
 we pour our compound inside 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.310
 and we look for it we see everything well 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.780
 then we put in the refrigerator for a quarter 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.700
 from this point in cold water 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.090
 we will put our two sheets of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.970
 jelly and let's set aside in a 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.010
 small pot we are full of 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:26.560
 our synthetic philadelphia biscuits 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.560
 of sugar salt the lemon juice 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.209
 we mention the fire we begin to mix 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.739
 to facilitate the operation you can use 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.090
 even a whip 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.829
 when the compounds are mixed but 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:50.170
 however there will be no groups 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.170
 we will also add our milk 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.000
 continue mixing until the mixture 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:02.540
 it will not be smooth and lacking in days when 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.230
 our compound would have achieved this 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.859
 consistency as smooth or devoid of 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.720
 lumps we will take our jelly mi 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.669
 I recommend if we are the good and 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.380
 let's add it down now with 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:20.359
 gelatin incorporated we turn off 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.950
 let's put aside and go to assemble 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.889
 of our whipped cream I call i 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.990
 our 100 ml of cream with the mixer 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.930
 electric we do not have and must not be 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.340
 neither too firm nor too much 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.990
 in short, it must not be buttery 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.710
 now I'll show you the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.710
 consistency 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.680
 and too liquid of too solid 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.020
 now let's take our filling that 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.900
 we left it to cool 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.380
 we meet with the time of mixing 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.590
 always from the bottom upwards now that 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.380
 we have incorporated everything we take 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:05.740
 our cake pan with our fund 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:08.290
 we pour over the dough we reveal well 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.030
 all and then we put in the fridge 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.220
 for about three hours 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.350
 here it is, three hours have passed, I have removed 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:20.080
 our seascape from the freezer and in the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:26.440
 meanwhile I printed myself from the writing 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:29.350
 oreo I cut out the letters and now the 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.120
 dust on the surface a 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.930
 of biscuit that we have put aside 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.350
 from the beginning with a colander and in the sparco 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.350
 over it 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.930
 here it is now with the help of one 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.150
 toothpick we will merge designs when 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:06:01.479
 we also did the last letter 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:06:03.490
 covered the zipper we remove the cake la 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.909
 your oar cake and I just have to 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.909
