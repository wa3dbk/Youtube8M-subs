00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
about 23 inches from center of the hole

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.380 
about 23 inches from center of the hole
stand<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.279> hole<00:00:21.430> so<00:00:21.640> it's<00:00:21.759> there<00:00:21.939> now<00:00:22.149> all

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
stand the hole so it's there now all

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.530 
stand the hole so it's there now all
right<00:00:22.509> let<00:00:23.500> me<00:00:23.529> give<00:00:23.710> you<00:00:24.180> make<00:00:25.180> sure<00:00:25.300> you<00:00:25.419> love

something after you set the length of

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.049 
something after you set the length of
the<00:00:28.390> arm<00:00:28.599> so<00:00:29.259> I<00:00:29.349> do<00:00:29.410> is<00:00:29.739> tied<00:00:30.040> up<00:00:30.070> this<00:00:30.309> jamb<00:00:30.640> nut

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
the arm so I do is tied up this jamb nut

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.970 
the arm so I do is tied up this jamb nut
and<00:00:31.390> we<00:00:31.509> tell<00:00:31.750> them<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:31.960> jam<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:32.380> be<00:00:32.529> careful

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
and we tell them to jam that be careful

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.100 
and we tell them to jam that be careful
that<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:35.890> careful<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.489> make<00:00:37.000> sure<00:00:37.240> that<00:00:37.690> both

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
that be careful that make sure that both

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.070 
that be careful that make sure that both
either<00:00:38.560> both<00:00:39.250> flat<00:00:39.550> sizes<00:00:39.940> of<00:00:40.060> flat<00:00:40.660> surfaces

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
either both flat sizes of flat surfaces

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.130 
either both flat sizes of flat surfaces
of<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.410> joint<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:42.370> this<00:00:43.270> cleave<00:00:43.630> eye<00:00:43.750> bushing

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
of the joint and this cleave eye bushing

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.200 
of the joint and this cleave eye bushing
are<00:00:44.320> flat<00:00:44.650> alright<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.700> if<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:45.820> tighten<00:00:46.150> it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
are flat alright so if you tighten it

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.300 
are flat alright so if you tighten it
down<00:00:46.240> make<00:00:46.690> sure<00:00:46.720> they<00:00:47.050> don't<00:00:47.170> look<00:00:47.350> like<00:00:47.410> ones

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
down make sure they don't look like ones

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.980 
down make sure they don't look like ones
up<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:48.730> ones<00:00:48.880> down<00:00:49.150> when<00:00:49.329> you<00:00:49.420> install<00:00:49.780> them

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
up and ones down when you install them

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.090 
up and ones down when you install them
right<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:51.420> easiest<00:00:52.420> way<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.960> do<00:00:53.650> this<00:00:53.829> is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
right so easiest way to do this is

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.290 
right so easiest way to do this is
install<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.360> flesh<00:00:55.600> go<00:00:55.780> up<00:00:55.840> first<00:00:57.300> I'm

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
install the flesh go up first I'm

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.979 
install the flesh go up first I'm
friggin<00:00:58.900> all<00:00:59.020> here<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.640> have<00:01:03.970> put<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.390> nut<00:01:04.839> in

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
friggin all here you have put the nut in

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.429 
friggin all here you have put the nut in
yet

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
yet

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.780 
yet
now<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.990> part<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.470> installing<00:01:09.130> levite

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
now one part is installing levite

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.390 
now one part is installing levite
bushing<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.950> needs<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.280> little

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
bushing it just needs a little

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.740 
bushing it just needs a little
motivation

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.430

will encounter this problem after you
have<00:01:22.090> one<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:23.380> know<00:01:23.500> arm<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:23.950> bolted<00:01:24.280> in<00:01:24.370> there

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
have one you know arm so bolted in there

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.670 
have one you know arm so bolted in there
the<00:01:24.640> other<00:01:24.729> ones<00:01:24.970> out<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:26.020> axle<00:01:26.350> tends<00:01:26.560> to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
the other ones out the axle tends to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.640 
the other ones out the axle tends to
shift<00:01:27.010> or<00:01:27.280> rotate<00:01:27.700> now<00:01:28.630> right<00:01:29.140> now<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.320> hole

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
shift or rotate now right now the hole

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.880 
shift or rotate now right now the hole
on<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.580> bracket<00:01:30.790> is<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.630> little<00:01:31.930> forward<00:01:32.409> than

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
on the bracket is a little forward than

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.609 
on the bracket is a little forward than
the<00:01:33.700> one<00:01:33.909> on<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.540> hole<00:01:34.720> for<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.080> control<00:01:35.409> arm

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
the one on the hole for the control arm

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.370 
the one on the hole for the control arm
so<00:01:36.280> what<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.490> want<00:01:36.760> is<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.720> slower<00:01:37.960> controller

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
axle to go that way to go forward to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.280 
axle to go that way to go forward to
rotate<00:02:34.079> up<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:35.069> would<00:02:35.220> put<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.760> jack<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
rotate up you would put this jack on the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.110 
rotate up you would put this jack on the
tie<00:02:37.530> rod<00:02:37.769> bar<00:02:38.040> itself<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.670> right<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> try<00:02:39.060> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
tie rod bar itself all right I try to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.880 
tie rod bar itself all right I try to
put<00:02:39.359> it<00:02:39.450> closest<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.019> actual<00:02:40.140> tie<00:02:40.439> rod<00:02:40.650> end

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
