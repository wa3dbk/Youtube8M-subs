hey guys how you go on this is Billy
Edwards<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.910> today<00:00:06.330> we're<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.629> compare

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
Edwards and today we're going to compare

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.070 
Edwards and today we're going to compare
the<00:00:07.170> SKS<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.250> qbu-88<00:00:09.030> DMR's

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the SKS and the qbu-88 DMR's

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.320 
the SKS and the qbu-88 DMR's
I've<00:00:10.320> had<00:00:10.740> quite<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.070> few<00:00:11.160> people<00:00:11.460> asking<00:00:12.090> me<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
I've had quite a few people asking me to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.940 
I've had quite a few people asking me to
take<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.540> look<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:12.870> both<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.080> these<00:00:13.380> weapons<00:00:13.650> in

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
take a look at both of these weapons in

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.650 
take a look at both of these weapons in
my<00:00:14.070> weapon<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> week<00:00:14.700> series<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
my weapon of the week series so I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.269 
my weapon of the week series so I
thought<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> just<00:00:16.080> might<00:00:16.379> cover<00:00:16.650> them<00:00:16.830> both<00:00:16.980> at

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
thought I just might cover them both at

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.570 
thought I just might cover them both at
the<00:00:17.460> same<00:00:17.670> time<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.359> far<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.140> DMR's<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.010> SKS

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the same time as far as DMR's go the SKS

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.730 
the same time as far as DMR's go the SKS
and<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.970> Q<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.539> both<00:00:21.600> fast<00:00:22.020> firing<00:00:22.439> lower

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and the Q are both fast firing lower

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.859 
and the Q are both fast firing lower
damage<00:00:23.039> DMR's<00:00:23.670> which<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> think<00:00:24.539> would<00:00:24.720> be

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
damage DMR's which you think would be

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.240 
damage DMR's which you think would be
better<00:00:25.050> suited<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.500> close-range<00:00:25.980> combat

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
better suited for close-range combat

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.400 
better suited for close-range combat
they<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> few<00:00:27.990> pretty<00:00:28.199> big

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
they do have a few pretty big

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
they do have a few pretty big
differences<00:00:28.920> though<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.849> video

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
differences though so in this video

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.550 
differences though so in this video
we're<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> take<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> look<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:31.080> both<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
we're going to take a look at both and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.500 
we're going to take a look at both and
figure<00:00:32.009> out<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.790> actually<00:00:33.059> better

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
figure out which one is actually better

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.860 
figure out which one is actually better
for<00:00:33.570> CQB<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.640> video<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.360> fair<00:00:36.600> I'm

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
for CQB now in this video to be fair I'm

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
for CQB now in this video to be fair I'm
running<00:00:37.140> both<00:00:37.320> guns<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.860> pretty<00:00:38.070> much<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
running both guns with pretty much the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
running both guns with pretty much the
same<00:00:38.640> attachments<00:00:39.360> I'm<00:00:39.480> using<00:00:39.930> each<00:00:40.230> guns

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
same attachments I'm using each guns

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
same attachments I'm using each guns
default<00:00:41.040> hollow<00:00:41.309> sight<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.879> heavy<00:00:42.090> barrel

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
default hollow sight the heavy barrel

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.930 
default hollow sight the heavy barrel
ergo<00:00:42.870> grip<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> target<00:00:43.739> detector<00:00:44.219> both

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
ergo grip and the target detector both

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
ergo grip and the target detector both
of<00:00:45.149> these<00:00:45.270> weapons<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.840> similar<00:00:46.110> enough<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
of these weapons are similar enough that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
of these weapons are similar enough that
these<00:00:46.680> attachments<00:00:47.340> should<00:00:47.370> help<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> pretty

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
these attachments should help in pretty

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
these attachments should help in pretty
much<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> same<00:00:48.539> way<00:00:48.960> without<00:00:49.530> creating<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
much the same way without creating a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
much the same way without creating a
noticeable<00:00:50.820> disadvantage<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:52.199> anyone<00:00:52.530> who

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
noticeable disadvantage for anyone who

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
noticeable disadvantage for anyone who
wants<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> try<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.489> either<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.940> these<00:00:54.120> guns<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
wants to try out either of these guns I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
wants to try out either of these guns I
definitely<00:00:55.350> recommend<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.890> setup<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.399> both

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
definitely recommend this setup for both

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
definitely recommend this setup for both
but<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.030> anyone<00:00:57.420> has<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.629> different<00:00:58.020> setup

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
but if anyone has a different setup

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
but if anyone has a different setup
they'd<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> suggest<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.640> feel<00:00:59.940> free<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
they'd like to suggest then feel free to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.580 
they'd like to suggest then feel free to
leave<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> comment<00:01:01.260> section<00:01:01.559> below

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
leave it in the comment section below

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
leave it in the comment section below
I'm<00:01:02.190> sure<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> lot<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I'm sure a lot of you are going to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
I'm sure a lot of you are going to
suggest<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.049> higher<00:01:04.229> powered<00:01:04.589> optic<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
suggest a higher powered optic but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.440 
suggest a higher powered optic but
honestly<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> save<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
honestly I like to save the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.789 
honestly I like to save the
magnification<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.470> harder-hitting

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
magnification for the harder-hitting

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.730 
magnification for the harder-hitting
DMR's<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.760> actually<00:01:09.180> need<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.409> anyway

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
DMR's that actually need it but anyway

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.990 
DMR's that actually need it but anyway
the<00:01:10.920> most<00:01:11.100> important<00:01:11.610> difference<00:01:11.939> between

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the most important difference between

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
the most important difference between
these<00:01:12.420> two<00:01:12.630> guns<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.140> their<00:01:13.409> design<00:01:13.740> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
these two guns is their design in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
these two guns is their design in
general<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.850> SKS<00:01:15.509> being<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
general with the SKS being a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.929 
general with the SKS being a
conventional<00:01:16.470> design<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> QB<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> being

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
conventional design and the QB you being

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
conventional design and the QB you being
a<00:01:18.090> bullpup<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.750> bullpup<00:01:19.409> design<00:01:19.470> puts<00:01:20.040> the

a bullpup a bullpup design puts the

a bullpup a bullpup design puts the

action and magazine of the weapon behind
the<00:01:22.290> trigger<00:01:22.590> group<00:01:22.710> allowing<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.700> an

the trigger group allowing for an

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
the trigger group allowing for an
overall<00:01:24.119> shorter<00:01:24.540> weapon<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.020> better<00:01:25.200> in

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
overall shorter weapon that is better in

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
overall shorter weapon that is better in
CQB<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> trade-off<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> slightly

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
CQB but as the trade-off is slightly

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.170 
CQB but as the trade-off is slightly
slower<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> reload<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.490> real<00:01:29.759> life<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
slower on the reload in real life the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
slower on the reload in real life the
SKS<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> carbine<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:31.979> sure<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
SKS is a carbine so it's pretty sure to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.700 
SKS is a carbine so it's pretty sure to
begin<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.390> even<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.200> comes<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.560> at

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
begin with but even so it comes in at

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
make a big difference but what does make

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.990 
make a big difference but what does make
a<00:02:00.750> difference<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> SKS<00:02:02.430> has<00:02:02.640> double

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
a difference is that the SKS has double

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.120 
a difference is that the SKS has double
the<00:02:03.060> magazine<00:02:03.540> size<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> 21<00:02:04.920> round

capacity versus the 11 round capacity of
the<00:02:07.560> qbu<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.759> reason<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.360> important<00:02:09.810> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the qbu the reason this is important is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
the qbu the reason this is important is
because<00:02:09.989> both<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.470> these<00:02:10.770> guns<00:02:11.069> fire<00:02:11.370> small

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
because both of these guns fire small

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.970 
because both of these guns fire small
intermediate-sized<00:02:12.780> rounds<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.799> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
intermediate-sized rounds and not the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.369 
intermediate-sized rounds and not the
full-sized<00:02:14.459> rounds<00:02:14.969> of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.420> other<00:02:15.659> DMR's<00:02:16.200> in

full-sized rounds of the other DMR's in
the<00:02:16.469> category<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.489> means<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.150> need

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
the category this means that they need

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.209 
the category this means that they need
three<00:02:18.659> shots<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.989> kill<00:02:19.230> at<00:02:19.439> close<00:02:19.739> range<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
three shots to kill at close range and

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.160 
three shots to kill at close range and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
four shots to kill at long range and you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.140 
four shots to kill at long range and you
can<00:02:22.319> see<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.799> qbu<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.700> doesn't<00:02:24.030> give

can see with the qbu this doesn't give

you a lot of breathing room to miss any

QB you should be able to hit targets a

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.809 
QB you should be able to hit targets a
lot<00:02:30.870> more<00:02:31.049> easily<00:02:31.470> because<00:02:31.739> not<00:02:32.400> only<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.790> it

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
lot more easily because not only is it

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.580 
lot more easily because not only is it
more<00:02:33.060> accurate<00:02:33.510> than<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.750> SKS<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.409> got<00:02:34.560> a

m/s<00:02:42.120> muzzle<00:02:42.209> velocity<00:02:42.840> which<00:02:43.260> means<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.709> you

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
m/s muzzle velocity which means that you

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.410 
m/s muzzle velocity which means that you

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.979 
leading your targets a fair bit the QB U
is<00:02:50.129> maybe<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.489> fraction<00:02:50.730> easier<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.480> handle<00:02:51.870> as

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
isn't all that important when it comes

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.330 
isn't all that important when it comes

down to it the main things that really

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.759 
down to it the main things that really
set<00:03:02.549> these<00:03:02.669> guns<00:03:02.970> apart<00:03:03.329> our<00:03:03.750> capacity<00:03:04.409> muzzle

set these guns apart our capacity muzzle

close-range DMR well I sort of expect
you<00:03:12.359> guys<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.659> have<00:03:12.959> mixed<00:03:13.260> opinions<00:03:13.349> on<00:03:13.829> this

you guys to have mixed opinions on this
one<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.639> I<00:03:14.669> think<00:03:14.909> I'm<00:03:15.030> definitely<00:03:15.480> gonna

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
one but I think I'm definitely gonna

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.439 
one but I think I'm definitely gonna
have<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> side<00:03:16.199> with<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> SKS<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.819> qbu<00:03:18.299> is

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
have to side with the SKS the qbu is

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.030 
have to side with the SKS the qbu is
fine<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:18.930> long-range<00:03:19.290> shots<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.889> just

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
fine for long-range shots but it just

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.740 
fine for long-range shots but it just
doesn't<00:03:20.400> have<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.639> capacity<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.180> make<00:03:21.419> it<00:03:21.629> a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
doesn't have the capacity to make it a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.659 
doesn't have the capacity to make it a
competitive<00:03:22.019> close-range<00:03:22.680> weapon<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
competitive close-range weapon and it

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.430 
competitive close-range weapon and it
sort<00:03:23.879> of<00:03:23.970> fails<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.479> a<00:03:24.540> long-range<00:03:24.930> weapon<00:03:25.319> as

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
sort of fails as a long-range weapon as

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.259 
sort of fails as a long-range weapon as
well<00:03:25.470> when<00:03:26.159> you<00:03:26.250> get<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.729> the<00:03:26.849> 4<00:03:27.030> shot<00:03:27.239> kill

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
well when you get out to the 4 shot kill

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.379 
well when you get out to the 4 shot kill
range<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:28.500> SKS<00:03:29.010> isn't<00:03:29.400> perfect<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:29.970> honestly

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
range the SKS isn't perfect and honestly

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.569 
range the SKS isn't perfect and honestly
it's<00:03:30.599> not<00:03:30.780> even<00:03:31.019> my<00:03:31.139> favorite<00:03:31.319> DMR<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:32.489> it

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
it's not even my favorite DMR but it

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.069 
it's not even my favorite DMR but it
still<00:03:32.790> seems<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.150> whole<00:03:33.329> lot<00:03:33.510> more<00:03:33.659> effective

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
still seems a whole lot more effective

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.659 
still seems a whole lot more effective
than<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.319> qvu<00:03:34.680> when<00:03:35.040> going<00:03:35.340> head-to-head

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
than the qvu when going head-to-head

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.000 
than the qvu when going head-to-head
with<00:03:35.819> automatic<00:03:36.389> weapons<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:37.199> you're<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.739> beast

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
with automatic weapons if you're a beast

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.649 
with automatic weapons if you're a beast
player<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.669> you<00:03:38.729> can<00:03:38.879> land<00:03:39.090> consistent

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
player and you can land consistent

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.839 
player and you can land consistent
headshots<00:03:40.049> though<00:03:40.319> I<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:41.040> see<00:03:41.069> why<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.549> cube

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
headshots though I can see why the cube

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.099 
headshots though I can see why the cube
youyou<00:03:42.060> might<00:03:42.209> be<00:03:42.389> better<00:03:42.599> because<00:03:42.840> it's

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
youyou might be better because it's

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.599 
youyou might be better because it's
definitely<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.620> better<00:03:43.829> gun<00:03:44.040> when<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.370> forget

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
definitely a better gun when you forget

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.000 
definitely a better gun when you forget
about<00:03:44.729> the<00:03:44.970> capacity<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:46.290> anyway<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.650> finish

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
about the capacity but anyway to finish

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.349 
about the capacity but anyway to finish
up<00:03:47.159> this<00:03:47.310> video<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.669> should<00:03:47.940> point<00:03:48.120> out<00:03:48.299> that

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
up this video I should point out that

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.210 
up this video I should point out that
while<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.750> don't<00:03:48.900> hate<00:03:49.290> either<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.769> these<00:03:49.919> guns

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
while I don't hate either of these guns

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.430 
while I don't hate either of these guns
I<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.000> smaller<00:03:51.239> caliber<00:03:51.720> DMR's<00:03:52.169> are

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
I think the smaller caliber DMR's are

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.020 
I think the smaller caliber DMR's are
much<00:03:52.590> less<00:03:52.799> effective<00:03:53.040> than<00:03:53.370> they<00:03:53.489> used<00:03:53.729> to<00:03:53.819> be

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
much less effective than they used to be

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.390 
much less effective than they used to be
when<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.810> game<00:03:54.989> first<00:03:55.019> launched<00:03:55.590> DMR's<00:03:56.129> all

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
when the game first launched DMR's all

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.399 
when the game first launched DMR's all
took<00:03:56.609> 4<00:03:56.909> shots<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.239> kill<00:03:57.479> at<00:03:57.720> long<00:03:57.900> range

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
took 4 shots to kill at long range

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.530 
took 4 shots to kill at long range
but<00:03:58.769> since<00:03:58.979> the<00:03:59.159> buff<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.579> other<00:03:59.819> DMR's<00:04:00.359> are

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
but since the buff the other DMR's are

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.539 
but since the buff the other DMR's are
now<00:04:00.629> a<00:04:00.659> whole<00:04:00.900> lot<00:04:01.079> more<00:04:01.229> effective<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:02.040> you

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
now a whole lot more effective if you

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.189 
now a whole lot more effective if you
really<00:04:02.849> want<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.090> be<00:04:03.150> effective<00:04:03.239> at<00:04:03.780> close<00:04:04.019> to

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
really want to be effective at close to

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.589 
really want to be effective at close to
mid<00:04:04.349> range<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.859> m16a4<00:04:05.729> or<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.359> scar-h

mid range the m16a4 or the scar-h
assault<00:04:07.109> rifles<00:04:07.560> will<00:04:07.739> both<00:04:07.919> do<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.189> pretty

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
assault rifles will both do a pretty

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.189 
assault rifles will both do a pretty
good<00:04:08.519> job<00:04:08.669> as<00:04:09.000> well<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.449> will<00:04:09.870> handle

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
good job as well and will handle

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.399 
good job as well and will handle
themselves<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.799> bit<00:04:10.979> better<00:04:11.159> in<00:04:11.459> CQB<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.900> SKS

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409
