00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.259
 but look 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.610
 you do not have to find such a small thumbnail is enough 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.639
 completely out of the question 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.330
 yes the Gelateria Amerell background information 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.250
 We might not need that around the entire markets but we do not need to 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.499
 is enough without knowing who 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.340
 Of course we can also go up here 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.779
 you are the ideal one can click on it here 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.270
 and then we have so different here 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.360
 Option for example the heads between the transmitters percent between 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.809
 what he comes to the sound also Werder and students 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.349
 Tony Lechler can chirp between stations to see what's happening today 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.039
 Evening on ask station 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.349
 is sent on 17 Rachna survey he as Chansonnier above 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.550
 operating quasi the remote control of the border between Le Mans categories yet 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.759
 kick it between times 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.779
 documentaries 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.779
 News for example 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.979
 Series of course so there they can go directly to their needs then stuff 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.629
 if they say okay 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.770
 that's sensational among others gets him 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.400
 Pröll sending order from Arta displayed so to speak, they also know 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.870
 That's what I say other things like that 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.360
 Gerold but then they come back to a normal option 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.410
 So everything is personal to yourself optimizable that we can do this 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.279
 rtr very nice we can also go here 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.629
 We are looking for shipments here 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.990
 around with these stars 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.419
 around 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.159
 certain 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.529
 yes search terms specific areas the weir all television see how to 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.270
 For example football or cooking or tv-tipps ads will leave us then 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.900
 displayed under Favorites 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.069
 and percent after 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.069
 We know that with Flatrate Würzner 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.009
 In itself, the Apple is very clear coffins very around the years 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.460
 Here you can view more information 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.749
 I find a very nice rtr if you just have a look 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.860
 We know that watching TV people can do more here 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.560
 The designer can choose which of course up and down 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.139
 push as needed so that 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.499
 Percent we can now watch very much, then we push back and forth here 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.279
 that is maybe too 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.429
 Quite sensible there can of course add new channels or synonymous 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.179
 We also see NRW TV Smith as well 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.110
 regional program will be in these applications 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.809

 Percent of a very old values ​​application I can only give them all 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.609

 Percent you can register for free one of course then 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:08.699
 also in 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.440
 rebook the flatrate option Rome but divine 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.789
 so it is already a nice RP 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.400
 Spam fell on edge for those who are afraid that they will 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.539
 be bombarded with advertising 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.789
 Not so but for all who still are still 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:29.430
 Something calm down there percent 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.830
 I say 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.830
 Traffic contract so that would be sinking again 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:37.560
