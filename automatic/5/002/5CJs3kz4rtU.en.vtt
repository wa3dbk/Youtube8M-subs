00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.200 
noticed that the track is reminiscent of
the<00:04:33.470> crappy<00:04:33.740> music<00:04:33.860> video<00:04:34.639> that<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.940> crazy

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
the crappy music video that the crazy

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.180 
the crappy music video that the crazy
frog<00:04:35.570> did<00:04:35.979> yeah<00:04:38.289> so<00:04:39.289> from<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.650> footage<00:04:40.039> you

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
frog did yeah so from the footage you

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.060 
frog did yeah so from the footage you
can<00:04:40.310> probably<00:04:40.610> gather<00:04:40.970> it's<00:04:41.330> an<00:04:41.510> f0<00:04:42.320> wipeout

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
can probably gather it's an f0 wipeout

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.629 
can probably gather it's an f0 wipeout
mario<00:04:43.520> kart<00:04:44.090> kind<00:04:44.389> of<00:04:44.570> thing<00:04:44.780> but

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
mario kart kind of thing but

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.540 
mario kart kind of thing but
the<00:04:47.000> tracks<00:04:47.300> are<00:04:47.479> kind<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.530> crappy<00:04:48.979> but<00:04:49.160> this

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
the tracks are kind of crappy but this

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.490 
the tracks are kind of crappy but this
is<00:04:49.669> probably<00:04:50.000> one<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.570> best<00:04:51.020> tracks<00:04:51.320> in

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
is probably one of the best tracks in

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.920 
is probably one of the best tracks in
the<00:04:51.620> game<00:04:51.740> believe<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:52.340> or<00:04:52.460> not<00:04:52.639> you<00:04:53.180> go<00:04:53.539> around

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
the game believe it or not you go around

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.990 
the game believe it or not you go around
race<00:04:54.320> around<00:04:54.650> trying<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.430> pick<00:04:55.699> up<00:04:55.880> the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
race around trying to pick up the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.510 
race around trying to pick up the
power-ups<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:56.840> you<00:04:57.530> know<00:04:57.650> stop<00:04:58.190> people

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
power-ups and you know stop people

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.120 
power-ups and you know stop people
getting<00:04:58.550> ahead<00:04:59.419> of<00:04:59.479> you<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.990> think<00:05:00.710> in<00:05:00.919> most

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
getting ahead of you I think in most

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.460 
getting ahead of you I think in most
racing<00:05:01.639> games<00:05:01.900> except<00:05:02.900> for<00:05:02.930> this<00:05:03.110> one's<00:05:03.289> not

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
racing games except for this one's not

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.430 
racing games except for this one's not
too<00:05:03.650> great<00:05:04.270> as<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.510> can<00:05:05.630> see<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.050> graphics

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
too great as you can see the graphics

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.740 
too great as you can see the graphics
are<00:05:06.560> nothing<00:05:06.680> special<00:05:07.090> but<00:05:08.090> then<00:05:08.240> again<00:05:08.360> if

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
are nothing special but then again if

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.089 
are nothing special but then again if
you're<00:05:08.870> gonna<00:05:09.050> buy<00:05:09.320> this<00:05:09.380> game<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.889> weren't

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
really going to buy it for their

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.400 
really going to buy it for their
graphics<00:05:11.389> now<00:05:11.660> you've<00:05:11.810> probably<00:05:11.930> gonna<00:05:12.169> buy

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
graphics now you've probably gonna buy

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.670 
graphics now you've probably gonna buy

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
look at some of the power-ups then the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.000 
look at some of the power-ups then the
top<00:05:17.870> middle<00:05:18.169> part<00:05:18.380> of<00:05:18.440> your<00:05:18.560> screen<00:05:18.740> you'll

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
see a rocket there which probably far

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.560

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
from waste there you go there's many

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.420 
from waste there you go there's many
many<00:05:23.900> power-ups<00:05:24.830> in<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.039> game<00:05:25.190> which

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
many power-ups in the game which

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.830 
many power-ups in the game which

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
faster this one what it does is it puts

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.870 
faster this one what it does is it puts
a<00:05:33.169> little<00:05:33.289> gas<00:05:33.560> makes<00:05:33.830> them<00:05:33.979> go<00:05:34.070> slower<00:05:34.370> this

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
a little gas makes them go slower this

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.879 
a little gas makes them go slower this
one<00:05:35.120> trace<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.389> whirlwind<00:05:35.900> generally<00:05:36.440> they're
