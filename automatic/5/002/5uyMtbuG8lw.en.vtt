00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.779
 what is the clipboard now I tell you 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
 I will tell what it is used for 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.910
 what is he like 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.150
 the clipboard is generally starting from the most 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.980
 first windows versions were implemented 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 prine idea to work with several 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.650
 programs that is, users rated 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.380
 the benefits of such work but at the same time 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.539
 there were some problems 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 transfer data that is with one 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.710
 programs for another one ie clipboard 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.899
 what does it allow you to do that is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 suppose here and see me and shame 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.340
 then hello to all of us we take suppose 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.059
 I copy it when we somehow copy 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.440
 any file picture she is automatic 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.340
 enters buffer 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.690
 to our clipboard that is we can 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.590
 Now here 's a Word open me we will open with 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.400
 you 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.350
 excel and let's press right 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.680
 click and put the grandfather here exactly 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.180
 well here we set that is absolutely 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.180
 two different programs 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.960
 and with one program we thanks buffer 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.560
 exchange have moved 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.509
 that is, you almost every program well 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.220
 that is, if there are opportunities 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.670
 editing 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.270
 or suppose some graphic 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.370
 programs yes you can drag 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.330
 text pictures basically put them all 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:47.200
 clipboard also for example if here you are 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.620
 copied up suppose text 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 notice that text is color size 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.990
 remained the same we for example 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.580
 let's create some 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.190
 folder and click here also put it 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.760
 I put here Hello only has 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.810
 will be just plain text and standard 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.140
 let's say so in a font that is given 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:21.200
 line still contains buffer 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:25.430
 sharing how to change how to change also 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.280
 absolutely take it you can copy 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.430
 not necessary 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.520
 text thought for example folder 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:39.330
 click copy and throw it 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.130
 somewhere 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.040
 need to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.590
 well, computer local disk c click 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.360
 insert a long time there will be a new 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.690
 the folder actually works that way 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.120
 clipboard he keeps himself 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:03.740
 information that you honestly 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.740
 he put there and this is not all
