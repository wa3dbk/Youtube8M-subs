00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
megapixel webcam on top of that the

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.330 
megapixel webcam on top of that the
screen<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.080> raising<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.590> actually<00:01:51.860> 15<00:01:52.220> is

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
screen that raising and actually 15 is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.880 
screen that raising and actually 15 is
so<00:01:52.580> 180<00:01:52.970> p<00:01:53.270> wide<00:01:54.049> viewing<00:01:54.290> angle<00:01:54.619> kind<00:01:54.800> of

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
so 180 p wide viewing angle kind of

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.380 
so 180 p wide viewing angle kind of
screen<00:01:55.100> meaning<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.820> can<00:01:55.850> view<00:01:56.000> this

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
screen meaning that you can view this

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.060 
screen meaning that you can view this
screen<00:01:56.659> from<00:01:56.810> practically<00:01:57.229> any<00:01:57.409> angle

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
screen from practically any angle

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.410 
screen from practically any angle
without<00:01:58.280> any<00:01:58.490> distortion<00:01:59.030> that's<00:01:59.180> actually

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
without any distortion that's actually

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.580 
without any distortion that's actually
one<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> strongest<00:02:00.140> points<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
one of the strongest points of the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.760 
one of the strongest points of the
system<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:02.990> want<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.200> turn<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.350> screen<00:02:03.530> over

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
system so I want to turn the screen over

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.560 
system so I want to turn the screen over
here<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.040> can<00:02:04.159> actually<00:02:04.250> see<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:05.240> colors<00:02:05.479> are

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
here you can actually see the colors are

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.940 
here you can actually see the colors are
not<00:02:05.659> distorted<00:02:06.049> at<00:02:06.170> all

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.130 

so<00:02:10.550> will<00:02:10.700> become<00:02:10.940> some<00:02:11.300> new<00:02:11.480> benchmark<00:02:11.900> videos

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
so will become some new benchmark videos

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.990 
so will become some new benchmark videos
for<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.500> x<00:02:12.620> 3<00:02:12.770> 15<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.370> show<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.550> how<00:02:13.760> good

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
for the x 3 15 to just show you how good

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.089 
for the x 3 15 to just show you how good
the<00:02:14.090> 7<00:02:14.360> 6<00:02:14.510> 5<00:02:14.599> m<00:02:14.780> graphics<00:02:15.170> card<00:02:15.349> is<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.920> far

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
the 7 6 5 m graphics card is so far

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.860 
the 7 6 5 m graphics card is so far
we're<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.489> impressed<00:02:16.640> yup<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.599> that's<00:02:17.720> it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
we're really impressed yup and that's it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.739 
we're really impressed yup and that's it
we've<00:02:18.050> come<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.349> end<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.500> our<00:02:18.590> video
