 Log in to your ASUSTOR NAS I: Mount the folder using ASUSTOR Control Center (ACC) 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.966
 The easiest way to log in to the NAS is to mount the folders in your NAS to your computer through the ASUSTOR Control Center. 

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:27.566
 It should be noted that your NAS and PC essentials are in the same domain. 

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:33.733
 First, please confirm that you have opened ASUSTOR Control Center 

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:40.999
 ASUSTOR Control Center is used to search for any ASUSTOR NAS in the same domain. 

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:54.132
 In this case, please ignore the multiple NAS devices you see on the list on the left, because you will only see your NAS in your domain. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.800
 Choose your NAS 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.533
 Next, press [Connect] and select [Connect to Network Drive] 

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:12.766
 Enter the username and password on your NAS and press [Next] 

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:20.033
 Select the folder you want to mount and specify the drive 

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.033
 When finished, press [Finish] 

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:30.333
 In this case, we selected the [Media] folder and specified Y as the mounted disk slot. 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.000
 Once it's done, it's like a network disk, you can see the folder of the mounted NAS on the PC. 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 Now you can drag the files on your PC to the mounted NAS. 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 You can also create new folders 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.900
