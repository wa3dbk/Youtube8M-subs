00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.270
 and if you think we make a cake 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.180
 whim will start with the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.510
 ingredients of the mass hurry or broken 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.050
 for this we are going to need 400 grams 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.050
 of all- purpose wheat flour also 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.990
 we need 2 eggs a pinch of salt 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.700
 and 200 grams of butter we can 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.620
 also use margarine but you 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.000
 I recommend that they be butter for 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.530
 make this sample we will use 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.660
 you are processors can do 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.030
 perfectly at hand but if we have a 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.650
 We will use the only processor 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.300
 feature that this recipe has is 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.159
 that we have to be very careful when 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.750
 knead because you can not knead as if 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.690
 out a bread would have to be done 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.280
 simply with the fingertips in 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.080
 this case we are going to do with the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.420
 machine this will not bring any 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.610
 heat the problem is that we do not have 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.979
 that give heat to the dough as I say 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.979
 if you do it by hand with the tip of 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:10.030
 the fingers without kneading we will put the flour 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.540
 with the butter and the pinch of salt 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 i 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.850
 to butter that is well chilled 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 ah 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.680
 ah 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.900
 and once we get the texture of the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.900
 wet 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.400
 two 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.140
 now 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.150
 We will extend the mass between two papers 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.920
 of baking and so will facilitate us the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.880
 work we will not have to manipulate it 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 so much to stretch 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.460
 well you have me thrown away we're going to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.350
 take him to liberal for an hour and 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.930
 now we will pass the dough to our source 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.810
 where are we going to enter this mold 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.180
 It measures 24 centimeters and the mass is going to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.180
 give to make 2 the same as they are 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.340
 ah 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.659
 ah 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.020
 I have punctured the base so that it does not rise 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.020
 how it will not be enough to click 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.200
 our mass we are going to place a paper of 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.590
 aluminum where on top we're going to put a 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.930
 chickpea base this will make it weigh and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.680
 yes that really is not going to raise us for 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.600
 doubt these chickpeas are recycled the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.670
 we will use as many times as 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.660
 we want or just until they look 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.660
 ugly and we are left 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.280
 ah 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.950
 we go to the preheated oven to 160 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.750
 degrees 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.989
 once in science to worship our 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.259
 base we will remove it 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.310
 After 15 minutes we will remove the 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.530
 chickpeas and we will put another 15 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.220
 minutes more until it is completely 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.410
 golden 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.230
 and these are the ingredients of the filling 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.220
 of our caprice good cake then 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:44.960
 This letter needs about 200 grams of 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.670
 cream or cream to beat another 200 cream 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.900
 pastry 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.750
 50 or 100 grams of caramelized walnuts 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.810
 and if I double this is chocolate two of 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.370
 We have these recipes in the channel os 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.610
 I'm going to put it under the box 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.620
 information there I will put the links 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.260
 to do any of these four 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.540
 ingredients that are super easy and 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.660
 quick to make with the briseida dough 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.970
 baked and cold let's start putting 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.760

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.210

 chocolate syrup
