is<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.960> important<00:00:19.859> especially<00:00:20.070> at<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> moment

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
is so important especially at the moment

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.939 
is so important especially at the moment
with<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> big<00:00:21.300> trend<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.080> beauty<00:00:22.470> being<00:00:22.710> all

about<00:00:23.250> really<00:00:23.820> kind<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.180> pared<00:00:24.570> back<00:00:24.779> makeup

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
about really kind of pared back makeup

about really kind of pared back makeup

depending on the look that you're going

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
for but I think that the most important

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.250 
for but I think that the most important
place<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.920> start<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> primer<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> I'm

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
place to start is with the primer so I'm

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.929 
place to start is with the primer so I'm
just<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> start<00:01:07.920> by<00:01:08.100> applying<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.729> primer

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
just going to start by applying a primer

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.289 
just going to start by applying a primer
all<00:01:09.689> over<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:10.409> face<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> foundation

all over my face just with a foundation
brush<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.840> essentially<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.590> does<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
brush and essentially what this does is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.120 
brush and essentially what this does is
allow<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.299> foundation<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> everything

important just because it stops it from
slipping<00:01:29.670> around<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:32.430> also<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.970> great<00:01:33.180> a

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
is always to test your foundation on

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.699 
is always to test your foundation on
your<00:03:31.540> face<00:03:31.720> not<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.079> back<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.409> your<00:03:32.500> hand

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
your face not the back of your hand

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.710 
your face not the back of your hand
because<00:03:33.099> that's<00:03:33.729> a<00:03:33.879> completely<00:03:34.239> different

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
because that's a completely different

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.110 
because that's a completely different
color<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.470> test<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.189> your<00:03:36.250> side<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.639> see

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
color so test it on your side and see

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.670 
color so test it on your side and see
make<00:03:37.359> sure<00:03:37.569> that<00:03:37.750> there<00:03:37.900> isn't<00:03:38.109> a<00:03:38.290> line<00:03:38.500> and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
make sure that there isn't a line and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.069 
make sure that there isn't a line and
also<00:03:39.400> test<00:03:39.729> it<00:03:39.909> in<00:03:40.060> natural<00:03:40.479> light<00:03:40.599> even<00:03:40.989> if

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
also test it in natural light even if

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.960 
also test it in natural light even if
that<00:03:41.109> means<00:03:41.409> going<00:03:41.799> into<00:03:42.159> priceline<00:03:42.609> or

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
that means going into priceline or

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.969 
that means going into priceline or
wherever<00:03:43.299> with<00:03:43.479> the<00:03:43.569> body<00:03:43.780> trying<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:44.919> your

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
wherever with the body trying on your

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.890 
wherever with the body trying on your
foundation<00:03:45.759> and<00:03:45.790> then<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.299> popping<00:03:46.599> outside

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
foundation and then just popping outside

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.009 
foundation and then just popping outside
out<00:03:47.379> of<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.009> kind<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.489> luminous<00:03:49.329> light<00:03:49.479> like

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
out of the kind of luminous light like

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.559 
out of the kind of luminous light like
exactly<00:03:50.470> what<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.680> wonder<00:03:51.099> now<00:03:51.250> just<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.359> really

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
exactly what I wonder now just to really

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.969 
exactly what I wonder now just to really
test<00:03:52.900> whether<00:03:53.199> it's<00:03:53.409> the<00:03:53.500> right<00:03:53.680> color<00:03:53.829> for

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
test whether it's the right color for

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.469 
test whether it's the right color for
you<00:03:54.189> because<00:03:54.519> those<00:03:54.669> lights<00:03:54.909> can<00:03:55.120> distort

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:55.479 
you because those lights can distort

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.649 
you because those lights can distort
things<00:03:55.689> a<00:03:55.870> little<00:03:55.989> bit<00:03:56.169> so<00:03:57.129> um<00:03:57.519> what<00:03:58.299> shade<00:03:58.509> i'm

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
things a little bit so um what shade i'm

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.539 
things a little bit so um what shade i'm
using<00:03:58.989> sandy<00:03:59.349> beige<00:03:59.500> here<00:03:59.829> that's<00:04:00.040> my<00:04:00.250> color

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
using sandy beige here that's my color

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.580 
using sandy beige here that's my color
and<00:04:00.849> this<00:04:00.939> is<00:04:01.120> my<00:04:01.329> formula<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.199> i'm<00:04:02.349> going<00:04:02.470> to

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
and this is my formula so i'm going to

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.499 
and this is my formula so i'm going to
go<00:04:02.709> ahead<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.310> just<00:04:03.909> apply<00:04:04.060> my<00:04:04.479> foundation

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:04.509 
go ahead and just apply my foundation

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.629 
go ahead and just apply my foundation
with<00:04:05.259> a<00:04:05.290> foundation<00:04:05.919> brush<00:04:05.949> now<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.489> course

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
with a foundation brush now of course

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.369 
with a foundation brush now of course
you<00:04:06.849> can<00:04:07.000> use<00:04:07.150> your<00:04:07.299> fingers<00:04:07.659> but<00:04:08.049> if<00:04:08.259> you<00:04:08.349> use

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
you can use your fingers but if you use

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.020 
you can use your fingers but if you use
your<00:04:08.620> fingers<00:04:08.979> make<00:04:09.459> sure<00:04:09.609> they're<00:04:09.759> really

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
your fingers make sure they're really

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.249 
your fingers make sure they're really
clean<00:04:10.359> because<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.780> don't<00:04:10.959> want<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.169> be

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
clean because we don't want to be

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.869 
clean because we don't want to be
plugging<00:04:11.500> our<00:04:11.680> pores<00:04:11.949> with<00:04:12.189> any<00:04:12.340> dirt<00:04:12.609> that's

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
plugging our pores with any dirt that's

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.689 
plugging our pores with any dirt that's
left<00:04:13.509> over<00:04:13.659> on<00:04:13.930> our<00:04:14.049> fingers<00:04:14.439> and<00:04:14.680> also<00:04:15.519> with

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
left over on our fingers and also with

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.969 
left over on our fingers and also with
foundation<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.750> don't<00:04:16.930> really<00:04:17.229> need<00:04:17.680> to

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
foundation you don't really need to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.189 
foundation you don't really need to
apply<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.459> all<00:04:18.639> over<00:04:18.729> your<00:04:19.269> face<00:04:19.419> so<00:04:19.659> I<00:04:19.810> start

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
apply it all over your face so I start

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.070 
apply it all over your face so I start
from<00:04:21.099> my<00:04:21.279> nose<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.549> work<00:04:22.210> outwards<00:04:22.719> because

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
from my nose and work outwards because

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.779 
from my nose and work outwards because
that's<00:04:23.289> the<00:04:23.500> area<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:23.889> kind<00:04:24.310> of<00:04:24.400> needs<00:04:24.580> the

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
that's the area that kind of needs the

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.000 
that's the area that kind of needs the
most<00:04:24.940> coverage

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
most coverage

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.330 
most coverage
so<00:04:26.730> start<00:04:27.480> here<00:04:27.810> cover<00:04:28.170> all<00:04:28.410> those<00:04:28.590> paws<00:04:28.920> cover

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
so start here cover all those paws cover

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.760 
so start here cover all those paws cover
any<00:04:29.610> redness<00:04:30.000> really<00:04:30.780> use<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.170> brush<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.410> get

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
any redness really use the brush to get

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.340 
any redness really use the brush to get
in<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.340> around<00:04:32.580> your<00:04:32.820> nose<00:04:33.060> take<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.170> right

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
in and around your nose take it right

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.870 
in and around your nose take it right
under<00:04:34.680> your<00:04:34.770> eyes<00:04:34.920> they're<00:04:35.250> not<00:04:35.460> too<00:04:35.670> close

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
under your eyes they're not too close

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.980 
under your eyes they're not too close
obviously<00:04:36.120> because<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.660> don't<00:04:36.810> want<00:04:36.840> to

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
obviously because you don't want to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.480 
obviously because you don't want to
irritate<00:04:37.110> them<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.800> your<00:04:37.890> concealer<00:04:38.250> can

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
irritate them and your concealer can

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.630 
irritate them and your concealer can
come<00:04:38.670> in<00:04:38.790> later<00:04:39.440> but<00:04:40.440> really<00:04:40.740> work<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.400> color

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
come in later but really work the color

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.300 
come in later but really work the color
out<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:42.150> lot<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.140> times<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.710> foundation

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
out a lot of the times the foundation

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.650 
out a lot of the times the foundation
doesn't<00:04:44.490> even<00:04:44.670> need<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.120> go<00:04:45.300> near<00:04:45.570> your

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
doesn't even need to go near your

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.780 
doesn't even need to go near your
hairline<00:04:46.050> which<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.470> probably<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.340> good<00:04:47.400> thing

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
hairline which is probably a good thing

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.130 
hairline which is probably a good thing
because<00:04:47.910> it<00:04:48.120> tends<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.510> get<00:04:48.690> stuck<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:49.080> know

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
because it tends to get stuck I know

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.380 
because it tends to get stuck I know
sometimes<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.800> know<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:50.130> do<00:04:50.220> my<00:04:50.820> makeup<00:04:51.210> and

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
sometimes you know I do my makeup and

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.210 
sometimes you know I do my makeup and
you<00:04:51.540> see<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.750> little<00:04:51.990> bit<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.200> hound<00:04:52.860> ation<00:04:53.130> in

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
you see a little bit of hound ation in

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.040 
you see a little bit of hound ation in
the<00:04:53.280> hairline<00:04:53.460> that's<00:04:54.330> probably<00:04:54.780> another

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
the hairline that's probably another

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.150 
the hairline that's probably another
thing<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.440> we<00:04:55.470> don't<00:04:55.650> really<00:04:55.770> want<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.100> be

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
thing that we don't really want to be

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.820 
thing that we don't really want to be
looking<00:04:56.460> for<00:04:56.670> so<00:04:57.240> foundation<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.260> key<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:58.800> not

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
looking for so foundation the key is not

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.860 
looking for so foundation the key is not
to<00:04:59.040> cover<00:04:59.430> your<00:04:59.580> faces<00:04:59.820> we<00:05:00.300> don't<00:05:00.390> want<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.750> to

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
to cover your faces we don't want it to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.320

foundations on all I need to do is just

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.010

add a little bit of translucent powder
now<00:05:58.350> this<00:05:58.500> is<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.680> really<00:05:59.010> great<00:05:59.130> way<00:05:59.340> just<00:05:59.610> to

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
now this is a really great way just to

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.340 
now this is a really great way just to
set<00:06:00.030> your<00:06:00.180> base<00:06:00.390> and<00:06:00.720> basically<00:06:01.050> what<00:06:01.290> that

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
set your base and basically what that

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.830 
set your base and basically what that
means<00:06:01.500> is<00:06:01.950> just<00:06:02.610> allowing<00:06:02.940> all<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.450> product

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
means is just allowing all the product

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.370 
means is just allowing all the product
to<00:06:04.050> kind<00:06:04.530> of<00:06:04.650> be<00:06:05.250> set<00:06:05.550> I<00:06:05.700> guess<00:06:05.970> so<00:06:06.300> making<00:06:07.230> sure

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
to kind of be set I guess so making sure

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.200 
to kind of be set I guess so making sure
that<00:06:07.650> doesn't<00:06:07.950> slip<00:06:08.160> around<00:06:08.460> it<00:06:08.820> doesn't<00:06:09.060> move

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
that doesn't slip around it doesn't move

translucent powder you can't really see

translucent powder you can't really see
which<00:06:44.229> is<00:06:44.409> ideal<00:06:44.620> this<00:06:45.159> is<00:06:45.340> really<00:06:45.490> just<00:06:45.639> to

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
which is ideal this is really just to

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.550 
which is ideal this is really just to
set<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.240> look<00:06:46.539> you<00:06:46.690> don't<00:06:46.870> want<00:06:47.110> to<00:06:47.169> see<00:06:47.409> the

set the look you don't want to see the

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
powder the last thing you want is

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.420 
powder the last thing you want is
noticeable<00:06:50.139> that<00:06:50.199> kind<00:06:50.530> of<00:06:50.560> powdery<00:06:51.159> finish

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
noticeable that kind of powdery finish

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.820 
noticeable that kind of powdery finish
as<00:06:51.819> well<00:06:51.879> as<00:06:52.509> you<00:06:52.990> don't<00:06:53.139> really<00:06:53.349> want<00:06:53.650> to<00:06:53.680> keep

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
as well as you don't really want to keep

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.830 
as well as you don't really want to keep
the<00:06:53.979> pattern<00:06:54.669> near<00:06:54.849> any<00:06:55.090> fine<00:06:55.389> lines<00:06:55.569> and

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
the pattern near any fine lines and

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.700 
the pattern near any fine lines and
things<00:06:55.870> like<00:06:56.050> that<00:06:56.139> I've<00:06:56.349> just<00:06:56.379> got<00:06:56.620> a<00:06:56.650> few

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
things like that I've just got a few

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.559 
things like that I've just got a few
coming<00:06:57.190> through<00:06:57.370> here<00:06:57.580> so<00:06:57.729> I<00:06:57.909> try<00:06:58.270> not<00:06:58.419> to

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
coming through here so I try not to

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.689 
coming through here so I try not to
powder<00:06:58.780> that<00:06:58.990> area<00:06:59.319> too<00:06:59.409> much<00:06:59.770> just<00:07:00.099> because<00:07:00.460> I

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
powder that area too much just because I

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.189 
powder that area too much just because I
don't<00:07:01.000> want<00:07:01.180> the<00:07:01.360> powder<00:07:01.569> getting<00:07:01.930> in<00:07:02.020> there

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
don't want the powder getting in there

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.619 
don't want the powder getting in there
and<00:07:02.259> accentuating<00:07:02.979> my<00:07:03.099> lines<00:07:03.280> so<00:07:04.000> just<00:07:04.240> really

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:04.629 
and accentuating my lines so just really

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:07.350 
and accentuating my lines so just really
lightly<00:07:04.990> brush<00:07:05.349> that<00:07:05.560> whole<00:07:05.860> area<00:07:06.220> with<00:07:07.210> the

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
lightly brush that whole area with the

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.089 
lightly brush that whole area with the
translucent<00:07:08.020> powder<00:07:08.169> and<00:07:08.560> what<00:07:08.740> that<00:07:08.889> does<00:07:09.069> is

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:09.099 
translucent powder and what that does is

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.540 
translucent powder and what that does is
just<00:07:09.430> essentially<00:07:09.849> modify<00:07:10.449> your<00:07:10.960> t-zone<00:07:11.550> once

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
just essentially modify your t-zone once

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.240 
just essentially modify your t-zone once
again<00:07:12.789> if<00:07:13.120> you<00:07:13.240> have<00:07:13.270> really<00:07:13.720> oily<00:07:13.900> skin<00:07:14.409> you

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
again if you have really oily skin you

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.620 
again if you have really oily skin you
probably<00:07:15.490> want<00:07:15.819> to<00:07:15.849> go<00:07:15.970> for<00:07:16.180> the<00:07:16.240> map<00:07:16.419> mousse

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 
probably want to go for the map mousse

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.499 
probably want to go for the map mousse
finish<00:07:17.020> and<00:07:17.319> then<00:07:17.530> put<00:07:18.039> the<00:07:18.509> translucent

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:19.509 
finish and then put the translucent

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:21.629 
finish and then put the translucent
powder<00:07:19.630> a<00:07:19.960> little<00:07:20.020> bit<00:07:20.470> more<00:07:21.039> over<00:07:21.370> your<00:07:21.490> face

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 
powder a little bit more over your face

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.159 
powder a little bit more over your face
or<00:07:21.880> the<00:07:21.909> areas<00:07:22.300> where<00:07:22.449> you<00:07:22.569> get<00:07:22.750> really<00:07:22.930> oily

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
or the areas where you get really oily

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.710 
or the areas where you get really oily
if<00:07:23.770> you've<00:07:24.099> got<00:07:24.130> really<00:07:24.550> dry<00:07:24.789> skin<00:07:24.849> you<00:07:25.569> might

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 
if you've got really dry skin you might

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.240 
if you've got really dry skin you might
not<00:07:25.840> need<00:07:25.990> the<00:07:26.110> translucent<00:07:26.740> powder<00:07:26.860> at<00:07:27.130> all

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
not need the translucent powder at all

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.620 
not need the translucent powder at all
although<00:07:27.550> I<00:07:27.699> do<00:07:27.909> think<00:07:28.030> setting<00:07:28.449> your

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.630 
although I do think setting your

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.290 
although I do think setting your
foundation<00:07:29.229> and<00:07:29.349> is<00:07:30.009> always<00:07:30.370> a<00:07:30.400> good<00:07:30.610> step<00:07:30.849> so

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
foundation and is always a good step so

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.059 
foundation and is always a good step so
just<00:07:31.509> remember<00:07:31.690> printers<00:07:32.289> whatever<00:07:32.740> you<00:07:32.919> want

just remember printers whatever you want

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:34.559 
just remember printers whatever you want
