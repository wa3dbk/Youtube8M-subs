00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.590
 friendship thank you for being here 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.050
 again on my channel and this day 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.180
 gentlemen we brought there was a boxing of a 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.449
 capture of a brand's laptop 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.730
 call to media what is this 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.590
 capturing that makes the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.760
 others in the course of a boxing what 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.430
 we'll see 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.610
 to begin this is it costs around 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.930
 of 175 dollars here in the description of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.910
 to leave all the information of the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.059
 company so that you can 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.590
 visit because it's very different is 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.180
 for that we have the knife to jump and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.730
 whether they wanted to hear that task 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.510
 to be like gentlemen who helps us a lot 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.430
 to keep doing these sub boxes and 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.680
 first of all I wanted to thank the 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.809
 average company that took the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.480
 bother to send me this product to 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.890
 review a boxing and all that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.649
 it's very likely what we're going to have 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.970
 here on the channel in an interview to 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.780
 talk to them what they are 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.960
 pretend 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.220
 to reach the community in Spanish 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.560
 what does different gentlemen do is 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.470
 a portable grabber that can 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.509
 take wherever you want ok that's very 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.350
 well also because sometimes we go 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.540
 where friends 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 and we can take it there is no 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.680
 export problem before and another of the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.330
 very good things is that if you have what 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 that you have to do the configuration is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.830
 very simple is very simple when the act 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.200
 we go to the one that brings us to the unique 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.630
 what you have to do is place with the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.140
 capture between your console and all that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.619
 using key cable 6 10 may to be able 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.799
 this point so that they see that also 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.140
 work with explained ok we already have to 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.560
 pen connects them like on the TV and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.780
 hitler and the console cable system and there 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.759
 you will be able to connect another of the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.220
 most amazing things that 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.490
 characters I really liked is that this 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.590
 capture of the gentlemen who have 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.860
 tickets for cards that for the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.890
 sd cards so if they do not want you 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.850
 Carry the computer can save your 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.830
 games there or very very good and very 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.870
 very simple the only thing you have to do 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.930
 is 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.840
 of the plan capture wherever you go 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.239
 ok and carrying the card since not 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.810
 comes with the cd that is not included 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.269
 but you can buy it and you do not have to 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.519
 be carrying your computer as you can 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.010
 see a box that I have empty and here 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.569
 we can see is what this brings us what 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.120
 we're going to be talking to this side 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.329
 and it is a very nice case for the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.510
 take and you will not be ruined very 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.120
 pretty the box we do it aside and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.280
 over here we have the wires gentlemen like 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.709
 they all have the cables so the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.750
 truth is that the cables a lot here 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:06.390
 other cables come but you can see 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.610
 over here and more cables like insurance 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.250
 White brand of cables and signature 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.960
 team 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.820
 and increasingly we will end them 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.800
 do everything we're going to teach image of 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.500
 all the cables they bring and some 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.670
 instructions and instructions that do not 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.080
 we want to see let's go to what is the matter 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.340
 we really go what is what is 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.099
 capturing can not be seen in that caste 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.260
 a very elegant capture the truth that 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.260
 it looks to be very pretty very small very 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.720
 practice nor does it even happen to me all the 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.700
 hand so very good here you can see 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.890
 that the button here have no means 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.890
 to turn it on and start recording 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.260
 and here says latin gamer 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.280
 ok very important latin gamer that is 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.190
 they are working hard for our 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.750
 community to see average and we'll see by 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.569
 here and here you have the entrance sir 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.950
 steibi and here but also here what 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.180
 with this appearance of images ingame 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.720
 there is a stigma out audio and audio up or 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.400
 be very easy if there is no where to get lost 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.930
 so one of the 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.959
 features say that the size is 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.410
 ultra compact easy to transport the 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.789
 hardware coding h points 264 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.210
 intuitive software and much more 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:27.850
 we can record completely full hd 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.470
 1080 which is done to me is very good and 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.479
 as I had mentioned that if not 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.830
 they carry the computer and they just want 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.750
 bring the ticket 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.510
 for the card 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.700
 it's going to be very easy the only thing they have 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.670
 What to do is out here, the only thing 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.200
 there will be the most serious in 720 but 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.790
 which is simply very acceptable 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.170
 because they are not and if they want your 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.480
 computer is taking care of us 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.630
 old computer made me very good 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.590
 the price again is 175 dollars very 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.090
 very good and you know that if they leave very 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.500
 good comments and all that we are going to 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.390
 see if what we do with is captured 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.580
 because they are going to give away and we are going to 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.500
 do the review first we're going to 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.270
 capture to see how it looks we're going to 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.160
 make about 43 videos of this too 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.320
 we see an interview with her like no 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.090

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.460
 capturing anyway if you 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.810
 are thinking of buying it here in the 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.820
 description I will keep all 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.920

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.980
