00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.710 
yes now this color scheme is really ugly
you<00:00:25.650> know<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.420> candy<00:00:27.420> banana<00:00:28.109> yellow

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720

really<00:00:35.489> fit<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> figure<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:38.030> think<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
really fit the figure I think this is a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.580 
really fit the figure I think this is a
repaint<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.910> Cybertron<00:00:41.910> slingshot<00:00:42.809> finally<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
