00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
natural curve to them and I chose to do

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.350 
natural curve to them and I chose to do
that<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> way<00:02:18.510> they<00:02:18.690> pop<00:02:18.930> out

proving this way you could curve it

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.860 
proving this way you could curve it
along<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.460> face<00:02:23.730> which<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.660> nice
