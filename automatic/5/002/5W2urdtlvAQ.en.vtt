00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
then just follow along after that now I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
then just follow along after that now I
changed<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.170> video<00:01:13.409> output<00:01:13.860> directory<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
changed my video output directory to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.820 
changed my video output directory to
custom<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> I'm<00:01:15.600> using<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.990> desktop<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
custom and I'm using my desktop and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
custom and I'm using my desktop and
under<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> options<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.450> for<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> title

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
under the options here for the title

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.410 
under the options here for the title
length<00:01:19.170> I've<00:01:19.380> switched<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.070> 120<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> 600

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
length I've switched it from 120 to 600

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
length I've switched it from 120 to 600
the<00:01:21.930> reason<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> bumped<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> 600<00:01:23.549> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the reason that I bumped it up to 600 is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
the reason that I bumped it up to 600 is
that<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> gets<00:01:24.180> rid<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> little

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that it gets rid of all of the little

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
that it gets rid of all of the little
erroneous<00:01:26.130> movie<00:01:27.119> files<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
erroneous movie files that are going to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
erroneous movie files that are going to
be<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> disc<00:01:28.619> when<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.850> search

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
be on the disc when you do this search

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390 
be on the disc when you do this search
so<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.200> basically<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.950> rid<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.159> those

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
so this will basically get rid of those

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
so this will basically get rid of those
and<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.329> lot<00:01:33.479> less<00:01:33.659> complicated<00:01:34.049> in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and make it a lot less complicated in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.010 
and make it a lot less complicated in
the<00:01:34.619> end<00:01:34.799> once<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.759> finish<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.720> click

the end once you finish all that click

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
directory for my output now normally I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.499 
directory for my output now normally I
wouldn't<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.880> run<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.240> regular

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
wouldn't do this if you run in a regular

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.270 
wouldn't do this if you run in a regular
hard<00:02:06.719> drive<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.350> choose<00:02:07.649> different

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
hard drive I would choose different

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.710 
hard drive I would choose different
directories<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.910> since<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.300> running<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.599> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
directories but since I'm running out on

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.900 
directories but since I'm running out on
SSD<00:02:10.349> it's<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.400> big<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.760> difference

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
SSD it's not that big of a difference

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
SSD it's not that big of a difference
for<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> writing<00:02:12.930> capability

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
for the writing capability

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.430 
for the writing capability
so<00:02:14.129> I've<00:02:14.489> chosen<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.720> same<00:02:15.959> Drive

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
so I've chosen to have the same Drive

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.040 
so I've chosen to have the same Drive
for<00:02:16.769> both<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.700> other<00:02:18.120> thing<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.900> need

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
for both now the other thing is you need

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.780 
for both now the other thing is you need
to<00:02:19.110> make<00:02:19.200> sure<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:20.069> least<00:02:20.489> at<00:02:20.730> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
to make sure that you have at least at a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.900 
to make sure that you have at least at a
minimum<00:02:20.940> 50<00:02:21.780> gigabytes<00:02:22.290> per<00:02:22.700> destination<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
minimum 50 gigabytes per destination so

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.970 
minimum 50 gigabytes per destination so
if<00:02:24.120> you're<00:02:24.330> using<00:02:24.569> an<00:02:24.810> SSD<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.500> me<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.890> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
if you're using an SSD like me and you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.710 
if you're using an SSD like me and you
keep<00:02:26.160> them<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> same<00:02:26.730> Drive<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.599> you

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
keep them on the same Drive then you

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.240 
keep them on the same Drive then you
need<00:02:27.870> at<00:02:27.989> least<00:02:28.019> 100<00:02:28.590> gigabytes<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.099> free

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
need at least 100 gigabytes of free

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.339 
need at least 100 gigabytes of free
space<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.970> start<00:02:30.330> doing<00:02:30.480> these<00:02:30.720> processes

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
space to start doing these processes

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.780 
space to start doing these processes
that<00:02:31.799> way<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.010> make<00:02:32.310> sure<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.640> have

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that way you make sure that you have

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.610 
that way you make sure that you have
enough<00:02:32.970> space<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.780> don't<00:02:33.810> error<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.410> in

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
enough space and you don't error out in

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710 
enough space and you don't error out in
the<00:02:34.920> middle<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.190> one<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.459> processes<00:02:35.910> okay

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the middle of one of the processes okay

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.880 
the middle of one of the processes okay
once<00:02:36.959> you're<00:02:37.080> done<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.319> all<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.500> click

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
and one of them is under our HD lossless

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.599 
and one of them is under our HD lossless
basically<00:03:43.680> what<00:03:43.829> I'm<00:03:43.919> going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.160> do<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.459> I'm

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
basically what I'm going to do is I'm

basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.760> click<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.329> HD<00:03:45.750> lossless<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.410> I'm

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
going to click the HD lossless and I'm

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.080 
going to click the HD lossless and I'm
gonna<00:03:46.650> get<00:03:46.859> rid<00:03:47.069> of<00:03:47.099> all<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.430> these<00:03:47.669> other<00:03:48.000> ones

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
gonna get rid of all of these other ones

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.190 
gonna get rid of all of these other ones
why<00:03:48.930> because<00:03:49.799> if<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:51.269> HD<00:03:51.450> lossless

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
why because if you have the HD lossless

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.319 
why because if you have the HD lossless
which<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.859> best<00:03:53.130> audio<00:03:53.579> stream<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
which is the best audio stream in the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.930 
which is the best audio stream in the
entire<00:03:54.660> DVD<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.799> don't<00:03:56.010> really<00:03:56.220> need<00:03:56.459> any<00:03:56.730> of

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
entire DVD you don't really need any of

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.220 
entire DVD you don't really need any of
the<00:03:57.090> other<00:03:57.239> ones<00:03:57.510> unless<00:03:57.930> you're<00:03:58.109> doing

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
the other ones unless you're doing

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.559 
the other ones unless you're doing
another<00:03:58.560> language<00:03:59.150> because<00:04:00.150> all<00:04:00.389> you're

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
another language because all you're

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.420 
another language because all you're
really<00:04:00.690> doing<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.169> making<00:04:01.590> your<00:04:01.739> finished

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
really doing is making your finished

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.400 
really doing is making your finished
file<00:04:02.760> larger<00:04:03.450> than<00:04:03.660> what<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.900> really<00:04:04.049> needs<00:04:04.169> to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
file larger than what it really needs to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.229 
file larger than what it really needs to
be<00:04:04.500> because<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.160> have<00:04:05.310> extra<00:04:05.669> audio<00:04:05.940> streams

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
be because you have extra audio streams

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.550 
be because you have extra audio streams
in<00:04:06.389> there<00:04:06.569> that<00:04:06.720> you're<00:04:06.840> never<00:04:07.049> going<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.290> use

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
in there that you're never going to use

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.500 
in there that you're never going to use
you're<00:04:08.130> never<00:04:08.280> going<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.459> use<00:04:08.669> an<00:04:08.910> inferior

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
you're never going to use an inferior

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.150 
you're never going to use an inferior
audio<00:04:10.109> stream<00:04:10.440> when<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.680> have<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.010> HD

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
audio stream when you have the HD

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.360 
audio stream when you have the HD
lossless<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.780> just<00:04:13.200> check<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.620> one<00:04:13.799> go

movies in the same space as one if you
recode<00:06:37.500> it<00:06:37.680> now<00:06:38.370> the<00:06:38.430> downsides<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.330> recoding

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
recode it now the downsides to recoding

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.239 
recode it now the downsides to recoding
are<00:06:40.050> that<00:06:40.650> it<00:06:40.770> takes<00:06:40.920> a<00:06:41.040> long

time on my computer it takes anywhere

best system in the world but not the

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.149 
best system in the world but not the
worst<00:06:54.029> so<00:06:54.629> if<00:06:54.929> you<00:06:55.199> have<00:06:55.409> a<00:06:55.439> better<00:06:55.859> system

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
worst so if you have a better system

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.279 
worst so if you have a better system
than<00:06:56.399> that<00:06:56.729> you're<00:06:57.119> coding<00:06:57.809> time<00:06:57.989> is<00:06:58.169> probably

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
than that you're coding time is probably

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:00.769 
than that you're coding time is probably
going<00:06:58.559> to<00:06:58.619> be<00:06:58.679> a<00:06:58.739> lot<00:06:59.009> less<00:06:59.249> or<00:06:59.669> if<00:07:00.209> your<00:07:00.389> system

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:00.779 
going to be a lot less or if your system

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.689 
going to be a lot less or if your system
is<00:07:01.049> a<00:07:01.079> lot<00:07:01.439> older<00:07:01.769> than<00:07:01.799> mine<00:07:02.129> or<00:07:02.369> a<00:07:02.399> lot<00:07:02.669> less

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 
is a lot older than mine or a lot less

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.459 
is a lot older than mine or a lot less
powerful<00:07:03.479> than<00:07:03.599> mine<00:07:03.779> it's<00:07:04.049> going<00:07:04.199> to<00:07:04.259> take<00:07:04.439> a

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:04.469 
powerful than mine it's going to take a

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:06.709 
powerful than mine it's going to take a
lot<00:07:04.709> longer<00:07:04.919> to<00:07:05.129> code<00:07:05.489> so<00:07:06.059> you<00:07:06.149> have<00:07:06.479> to<00:07:06.599> weigh

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:06.719 
lot longer to code so you have to weigh

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:08.869 
lot longer to code so you have to weigh
the<00:07:06.929> benefits<00:07:07.049> of<00:07:07.649> smaller<00:07:08.279> file<00:07:08.549> size

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 
the benefits of smaller file size

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.759 
the benefits of smaller file size
against<00:07:09.329> your<00:07:09.509> time<00:07:09.749> and<00:07:10.049> see<00:07:10.439> which<00:07:10.589> one

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:10.769 
against your time and see which one

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:13.639 
against your time and see which one
works<00:07:10.919> out<00:07:11.189> for<00:07:11.399> you<00:07:11.579> and<00:07:11.789> if<00:07:12.569> this<00:07:12.869> is<00:07:13.109> where

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:13.649 
works out for you and if this is where

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.399 
works out for you and if this is where
you<00:07:13.829> stop<00:07:14.309> using<00:07:14.669> our<00:07:14.939> tutorials<00:07:15.689> I<00:07:15.869> hope<00:07:16.259> that

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.409 
you stop using our tutorials I hope that

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:18.139 
you stop using our tutorials I hope that
they've<00:07:16.589> helped<00:07:16.860> you<00:07:16.949> out<00:07:16.979> if<00:07:17.279> not<00:07:17.729> we<00:07:18.029> will

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:18.149 
they've helped you out if not we will

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:22.579 
they've helped you out if not we will
see<00:07:18.209> you<00:07:18.479> in<00:07:18.509> tutorial<00:07:19.049> number<00:07:19.469> two<00:07:19.649> thank<00:07:20.429> you
