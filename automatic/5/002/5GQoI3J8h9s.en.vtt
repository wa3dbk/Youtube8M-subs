00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
think like five different times you to

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.350 
think like five different times you to
get<00:04:08.739> like<00:04:08.830> five<00:04:09.099> different<00:04:09.340> endings<00:04:09.849> yikes

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
get like five different endings yikes

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.220 
get like five different endings yikes
ends<00:04:11.019> yeah<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.950> it's<00:04:12.580> such<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.090> slog<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.989> first

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
ends yeah and it's such a slog the first

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.020 
ends yeah and it's such a slog the first
time<00:04:14.410> because<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.739> text<00:04:15.040> crawls<00:04:15.400> like<00:04:15.790> you

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
time because the text crawls like you

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.699 
time because the text crawls like you
can't<00:04:16.239> even<00:04:16.359> skip<00:04:16.989> everything<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.590> so

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
can't even skip everything it's so

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.199 
can't even skip everything it's so
fucking<00:04:18.040> annoying<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.489> think<00:04:18.760> some<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.060> that

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
fucking annoying I think some of that

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.870 
fucking annoying I think some of that
has<00:04:19.510> been<00:04:19.540> improved<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> iOS<00:04:21.190> release<00:04:21.310> I

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
has been improved in the iOS release I

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.760 
has been improved in the iOS release I
think<00:04:22.240> it's<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.570> pretty<00:04:22.720> slim<00:04:23.110> down<00:04:23.260> version

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
think it's a pretty slim down version

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.469 
think it's a pretty slim down version
you<00:04:23.919> can<00:04:24.040> actually<00:04:24.220> set<00:04:24.639> it<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.850> auto<00:04:25.060> play<00:04:25.450> i

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
you can actually set it to auto play i

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.909 
you can actually set it to auto play i
believe<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.990> just<00:04:26.169> kind<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.380> watch<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:26.889> a

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
believe and just kind of watch it as a

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.070 
believe and just kind of watch it as a
visual<00:04:27.250> novel<00:04:27.820> i<00:04:28.000> thought<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:28.960> actually

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
visual novel i thought it actually

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.240 
visual novel i thought it actually
didn't<00:04:29.410> have<00:04:29.530> any<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.860> puzzles

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
didn't have any of the puzzles

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.920 
didn't have any of the puzzles
whatsoever<00:04:30.820> they<00:04:31.120> just<00:04:31.330> took<00:04:31.479> those<00:04:31.660> out<00:04:31.870> i

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
whatsoever they just took those out i

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.540 
whatsoever they just took those out i
made<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.290> like<00:04:32.410> just<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.800> straight-up<00:04:33.130> visual

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
made it like just a straight-up visual

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.629 
made it like just a straight-up visual
novel<00:04:34.470> maybe<00:04:35.470> that's<00:04:35.710> what<00:04:35.889> I'm<00:04:36.040> talking

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
novel maybe that's what I'm talking

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.730 
novel maybe that's what I'm talking
about<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:37.210> doesn't<00:04:37.540> sound<00:04:37.690> like<00:04:37.990> fun<00:04:38.020> anyway

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740
