up they did have the baku boost of like
darkest<00:02:17.860> helix<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.810> higher<00:02:20.140> aslam<00:02:20.530> II

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
darkest helix and like higher aslam II

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.380 
darkest helix and like higher aslam II
know<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.220> mean<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.520> already<00:02:21.640> got<00:02:21.880> them<00:02:22.150> from

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
know but I mean I already got them from

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.030 
know but I mean I already got them from
triads<00:02:22.810> I'm<00:02:23.020> sure<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> boost<00:02:23.590> are<00:02:23.830> more

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
triads I'm sure the boost are more

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.610 
triads I'm sure the boost are more
powerful<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:24.790> I'm<00:02:25.569> more<00:02:25.990> concerned<00:02:26.230> about

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
powerful but I'm more concerned about

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
powerful but I'm more concerned about
getting<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.190> Aqua<00:02:27.550> stuff<00:02:27.880> right<00:02:28.090> now<00:02:28.120> since

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
getting the Aqua stuff right now since

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.100 
getting the Aqua stuff right now since
that's<00:02:28.780> still<00:02:29.080> my<00:02:29.260> main<00:02:29.470> attribute<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:31.110> you

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that's still my main attribute so you

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.420 
that's still my main attribute so you
know<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.260> wasn't<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.680> worried<00:02:33.100> about<00:02:33.220> it

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
know I wasn't that worried about it

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.520 
know I wasn't that worried about it
already<00:02:33.760> had<00:02:34.000> those<00:02:34.239> attributes<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.110> them<00:02:35.290> so

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
already had those attributes of them so

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.190 
already had those attributes of them so
I<00:02:35.590> don't<00:02:35.739> care<00:02:35.920> about<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.159> Jeep<00:02:36.430> hours

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200

else<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.230> did<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.100> can't<00:02:51.459> remember<00:02:51.819> their

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
else in I did I can't remember their

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.460 
else in I did I can't remember their
user<00:02:52.150> name<00:02:52.390> off<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> top<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.870> my<00:02:52.990> head<00:02:53.080> but

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
user name off the top of my head but

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.250 
user name off the top of my head but
they<00:02:53.680> told<00:02:53.739> me<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:55.660> they<00:02:55.870> had<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.050> video

they told me that like they had a video

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.160 
they told me that like they had a video
with<00:02:56.709> uh<00:02:56.739> i<00:02:57.160> think<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.459> was<00:02:57.580> up<00:02:57.760> XE<00:02:58.150> on<00:02:58.300> &amp;<00:02:58.630> Co

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
with uh i think it was up XE on &amp; Co

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.940 
with uh i think it was up XE on &amp; Co
brackets<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.000> someone<00:03:01.000> else<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.709> they<00:03:02.709> told

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
brackets and someone else and they told

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.380 
brackets and someone else and they told
me<00:03:03.069> that<00:03:03.270> they<00:03:04.270> got<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:05.910> box<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.090> gone<00:03:07.180> that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
me that they got the box is gone that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.460 
me that they got the box is gone that
toys<00:03:07.690> are<00:03:07.870> off<00:03:08.020> so<00:03:08.470> I'm<00:03:09.400> assuming<00:03:09.910> that<00:03:10.720> if

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
toys are off so I'm assuming that if

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.460 
toys are off so I'm assuming that if
that's<00:03:11.650> true<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.750> they're<00:03:13.750> starting<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.260> pop

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
that's true that they're starting to pop

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.670 
that's true that they're starting to pop
up<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.800> toys<00:03:15.040> r<00:03:15.220> us<00:03:15.280> now<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.820> was<00:03:16.810> at<00:03:16.959> my<00:03:17.200> toys<00:03:17.500> r

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
up the toys r us now I was at my toys r

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.809 
up the toys r us now I was at my toys r
us<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:19.680> don't<00:03:20.680> think<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.070> was<00:03:21.160> about<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.519> week<00:03:21.790> ago

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
us I don't think it was about a week ago

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.759 
us I don't think it was about a week ago
i'm<00:03:22.209> sure<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.510> was<00:03:22.660> less<00:03:22.870> than<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:23.590> they

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
i'm sure it was less than that but they

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.229 
i'm sure it was less than that but they
still<00:03:24.069> didn't<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.459> anything<00:03:24.670> they<00:03:25.030> didn't

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
still didn't have anything they didn't

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
even have these guys the second set of

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.870 
even have these guys the second set of
the<00:03:27.850> wave<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.360> but<00:03:29.319> uh<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.830> might<00:03:30.220> as<00:03:30.550> well<00:03:30.700> give

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880
