00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 table it must be that the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 federation was giving me a wild card so 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.440

 of auto small phone you are going to go to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.490
 paul and peter paul bernard by the bone and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.840
 the rugbymen so here you call 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.150
 spoiled it's you little you limit 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.350
 stop a little influenced too when 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.369
 even one can directly access 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.790
 quarter-finals that's it yeah yeah of 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.540
 come to the beach to go abdominals and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 half and who wait would have it done 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.820
 no but it's true that it's after 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.900
 several protos and spend the evening 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 because he goes to bed at 5 o'clock 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.740
 morning the case actually when you have to 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.479
 to make a big tournament in tournament of the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.040
 Grand Slam you have to go through 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.140
 qualifiers when you have no wild card 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 what is a pre tournament actually 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.810
 it's almost as hard as the case 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 true tournament because everyone is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.860
 died of starvation the source colors yeah and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.619
 then here even if this spells and 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.320
 after between 100 and 250 and there is very 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.119
 good players so that's gone 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.409
 three rounds won three rounds to win 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.250
 to qualify is not easy 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.319
 So here it is necessarily going to preach you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.480
 your daily workout 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.000
 drive here I did by 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.580
 example this morning 2h 2:15 of physics on 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 played on the training lg done on 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.069
 do three hours of tennis so you 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.650
 do you do physics a little bit of 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.610
 all of the land the muscu the top of the bottom 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.900
 of the speed the muscu days that you the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.810
 do the muscu because I saw you 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.549
 on TV the other day there no I'm kidding 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 I'm kidding you as you start doing 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:47.079
 developed-lying trick that's the question 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:51.690
 it's the question of weight I do not know 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.690
 which is roughly 90 between 90 and 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:09.670
 sublime anne sure it lasts at the 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.049
 baguette but well after your everyday 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.190
 so what is these five hours 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.230
 drive 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.150
 yeah yeah according to periods that advance 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.609
 it depends on the tournaments if we are 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.200
 in winter preparation period by 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.780
 example have prepared season so this is 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.730
 big days sometimes 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.630
 get in there three four days it's a 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.540
 little recovery 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.280
 a little bit of both and a sparring word for 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.540
 train you, that's you guys 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.400
 to trade bullets that 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.040
 hold the road kill more or so that's 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.780
 that a tournament you want you do you play 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.340
 as a tournament alongside a guy from ta 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.410
 value containing alain and thoune one is 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.730
 always good sparring players 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.419
 French who do not necessarily play 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:55.209
 atp circuit that enjoys permanent swiss 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:57.459
 already or not during the minute I 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.799

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.000
 rogers and sequin luthiers and as one 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.650
 know him well 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.720
 koned his coach they offered us 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.940
 to come a week weeks to 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.750
 dubai but serious for you it's like 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.730
 recognition 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.440
 yeah so yeah that's so damn and then 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.180
 yeah it's rewarding even 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.130
 to train with with these choices there 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.660
 still thanks to the training with these 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.040
 guys there they give you advice from 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.750
 outfits stuff or so you have to 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.490
 return the ball 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.590
 1 and that's not it's pros who what 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.060
 you play the pro through another yeah 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.190
 we train, we train 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.660
 it's not everyone for us it's not 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.800
 one shot we train each for the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.110
 unless I go there too, it's for 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.580
 to train to progress after there 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.680
 stuff to take their way feel 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.419
 very well in the head they are always 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.620
 it's very rare that they are 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.910
 accounts between them are always in 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.010
 and lucas so two questions a tent 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.600
 a favorite player is if you had to 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.479
 compare for our listeners that they're 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.669
 not particularly present in the 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.490
 game you look like acquired on the 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.860
 intros federer nadal and djokovic what 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.840
 So groundstrokes crocodile 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.310
 attacking a bottom-court fisherman 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.770
 what is it more total I have 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.770
 not too these guys used to spinnaker 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.320
 Courteous favorite players to have less 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.280
 good players it was ephemeral 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.440
 opportunity to play it after its debut 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:53.970
 most resembles who beats federer yes 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:56.160
 I do not know, I'm not 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.479
 I try to serve well to hit hard the 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.070
 weight watchers background only has to cannes from 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.440
