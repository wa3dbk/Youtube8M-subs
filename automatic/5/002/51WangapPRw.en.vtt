00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to play on Team Red though you're like

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.370 
to play on Team Red though you're like
absolutely<00:01:26.640> beasted<00:01:27.119> team<00:01:27.390> blue<00:01:27.659> last<00:01:27.900> game<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.260 
absolutely beasted team blue last game I
just<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.729> easier<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> pay
