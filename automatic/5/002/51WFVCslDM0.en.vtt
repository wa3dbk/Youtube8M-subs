00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.240
 bodybuilding in general 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.089
 as you can see I 'm worried 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.430
 so regularly what is not seen 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.100

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.050
 what I mean 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.849
 do not waste time train yourself 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.199
 to have the perfect body and caen 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 gay good after I do not criticize them 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 town halls are hated the obese if he is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.480
 simple like that so much better but the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.559
 most people like to have a raven 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.969
 but do not make the necessary effort 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.680
 to achieve this 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.329
 in this little video I'm going 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.920
 precisely you quote excuses from 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 people who do not want his muscles and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.390
 his excuses are many and you 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.489
 go see there are not necessarily 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.680
 excuses for having a nice body would have 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.670
 a lot but if we do not get up for it 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.800

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.809
 you fall asleep and last longer what are you 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.859

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.840
 my answers

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.369

 that's why I do not work well 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.330
 I admit organic products are expensive 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.090
 add bulbs and it will go yes but that 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.340
 hurts the next day well ie 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.890
 that you worked well is too much 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.709
 training is called training 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.650

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.330

 I was hurt but it's nothing 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.190
 to be like American football 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.510

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.240
 now but to listen wider 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:58.900
 stronger a power during while 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.370
 that it is and may be stronger in truth 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.720
 I was inspired by my virtual side 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.580
 mike chang 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.950

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.959

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.060
 youtuber coach on youtube 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.680

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.150
 and thanks to him in two months I took the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.950
 double of my initial musculature so 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.690
 I hold a lot right after I 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.490
 will not oblige you to but know that 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.260
 you only have one body and that's 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.570
 in this body there that people judge you 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.100
 look at you so take care if that 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.550
 is not your physique or less for 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.470
 your health 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.120
 I can explain it to you but I do not want 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.730

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.019
 hate the same 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.499
 because you are a reflection of skis 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.499
 of titles 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.130
 and also I have heard that most 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.150
 mosques are warriors apparently 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.440
