00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
about container gardening there are a

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.990 
about container gardening there are a
lot<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.870> different<00:00:07.379> soils<00:00:08.069> out<00:00:08.309> there<00:00:08.519> for

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
lot of different soils out there for

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.830 
lot of different soils out there for
container<00:00:09.360> mixes<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:11.360> don't<00:00:12.360> like<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.660> use

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
container mixes I don't like to use

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.990 
container mixes I don't like to use
right<00:00:13.440> off<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.860> rack<00:00:14.040> container<00:00:14.490> mix<00:00:14.730> because

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
right off the rack container mix because

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.599 
right off the rack container mix because
quite<00:00:15.269> often<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:16.230> got<00:00:16.440> fertilizers<00:00:17.220> already

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
quite often it's got fertilizers already

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.970 
quite often it's got fertilizers already
added<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.779> quite<00:00:19.080> simply<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.680> peeped

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
added or it's quite simply just peeped

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.519 
added or it's quite simply just peeped
with<00:00:20.189> perlite<00:00:20.640> mixed<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.990> organic

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
with perlite mixed in I do organic

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
with perlite mixed in I do organic
culture<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> mix<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.510> more

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
culture I like to mix a little more

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.540 
culture I like to mix a little more
readily<00:00:25.109> available<00:00:25.500> food<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.160> there<00:00:26.310> some

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
readily available food in there some

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550 
readily available food in there some
more<00:00:26.730> humise<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.480> whatnot<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.080> i'm<00:00:28.470> going

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
more humise is and whatnot so i'm going

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
more humise is and whatnot so i'm going
to<00:00:28.619> show<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.800> how<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> make<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.220> good<00:00:29.429> organic

to show you how to make a good organic
mix<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.630> containers<00:00:32.480> first<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> start

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
mix for containers first thing to start

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.370 
mix for containers first thing to start
with<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.829> good<00:00:34.980> old-fashioned<00:00:36.380> potting

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
with is some good old-fashioned potting

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.310 
with is some good old-fashioned potting
mix<00:00:37.590> now<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.850> people<00:00:39.050> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
mix now for a lot of people this is the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.530 
mix now for a lot of people this is the
one<00:00:40.469> step<00:00:40.829> that'll<00:00:41.790> get<00:00:41.940> them<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> rest<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
one step that'll get them the rest of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.830 
one step that'll get them the rest of
the<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:44.309> would<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.879> able<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> grow<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the way and would I be able to grow and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110 
the way and would I be able to grow and
my<00:00:45.960> container<00:00:46.350> mix<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.100> well<00:00:47.910> yeah

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
my container mix like this well yeah

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.860 
my container mix like this well yeah
probably<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> again<00:00:50.280> heat<00:00:51.180> does<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.600> break

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
probably but again heat does not break

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
probably but again heat does not break
down<00:00:52.110> readily<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> does<00:00:53.550> break<00:00:53.820> down

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
down readily and what it does break down

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
down readily and what it does break down
and<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.390> tend<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> acidic<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and can tend to be kind of acidic and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
and can tend to be kind of acidic and
the<00:00:56.180> perlite<00:00:57.180> doesn't<00:00:57.480> break<00:00:57.629> down<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:58.020> all

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the perlite doesn't break down at all

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
the perlite doesn't break down at all
there's<00:00:58.859> not<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> extra<00:00:59.730> food<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.210> for

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there's not a lot of extra food here for

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.729 
there's not a lot of extra food here for
my<00:01:00.510> plants<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.550> I'd<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
my plants so what I'd like to do is to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.590 
my plants so what I'd like to do is to
add<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:06.439> gardening<00:01:07.439> soil<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.270> this<00:01:09.270> case

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
add in a gardening soil in this case

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.270 
add in a gardening soil in this case
from<00:01:10.020> my<00:01:10.170> friends<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> coast<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.100> Maine

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
from my friends at the coast of Maine

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.020 
from my friends at the coast of Maine
and<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:12.600> made<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> lot<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.100> extra<00:01:14.520> humise

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and it's made with a lot of extra humise

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.310 
and it's made with a lot of extra humise
with<00:01:15.930> kelp<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.890> other<00:01:17.040> fertilizers<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
with kelp with other fertilizers in it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.399 
with kelp with other fertilizers in it
that<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> help<00:01:20.630> add<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:22.080> lot<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that are going to help add a lot of

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.160 
that are going to help add a lot of
organic<00:01:22.860> component<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.640> humans<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.990> can

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
organic component in humans and you can

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.859 
organic component in humans and you can
tell<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.830> look<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> how<00:01:27.030> black<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
tell just to look at it how black and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.649 
tell just to look at it how black and
rich<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:29.460> we're<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:29.939> adding

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
rich this is now we're really adding

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.039 
rich this is now we're really adding
some<00:01:30.840> organic<00:01:31.380> content<00:01:31.619> back<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> soil

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
some organic content back to this soil

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.149 
some organic content back to this soil
it's<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> make<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.920> bit

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it's going to make it a little bit

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.359 
it's going to make it a little bit
heavier<00:01:35.520> than<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> original<00:01:36.600> mix<00:01:36.810> would<00:01:37.369> but

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
heavier than the original mix would but

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.210 
heavier than the original mix would but
that's<00:01:38.520> okay<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.060> me<00:01:39.500> again<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.770> we're

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that's okay with me again if we're

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.730 
that's okay with me again if we're
building<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:42.180> organic<00:01:42.600> soil<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.530> going

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
building a good organic soil it's going

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 
building a good organic soil it's going
to<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> fungal<00:01:44.579> structures<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> things

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to have the fungal structures and things

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
to have the fungal structures and things
that<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.380> help<00:01:46.560> keep<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.159> light<00:01:47.520> open<00:01:48.000> airy

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that will help keep it a light open airy

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.319 
that will help keep it a light open airy
soil<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.869> woodland<00:01:49.290> soil<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.119> one<00:01:51.119> last

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
soil like woodland soil and one last

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.690 
soil like woodland soil and one last
secret<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:54.000> Kokomo<00:01:55.369> now<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.549> that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
secret for me is Kokomo now with that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.749 
secret for me is Kokomo now with that
same<00:01:56.939> idea<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.420> mind<00:01:58.280> cocoa<00:01:59.280> mulch<00:01:59.490> has<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
same idea in mind cocoa mulch has a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.539 
same idea in mind cocoa mulch has a
light<00:02:00.180> springy<00:02:00.960> texture<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:02.310> back<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
light springy texture I go back to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.219 
light springy texture I go back to
compact<00:02:03.030> asst<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.689> bounces<00:02:04.049> right

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
compact asst and it just bounces right

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.210 
compact asst and it just bounces right
back<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.680> shape<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:06.079> Coco<00:02:07.079> mulch<00:02:07.320> although

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
back to shape and Coco mulch although

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.880 
back to shape and Coco mulch although
the<00:02:08.369> name<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:09.539> suggest<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.259> mulch<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the name would suggest that it's mulch I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.010 
the name would suggest that it's mulch I
don't<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.879> as<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> mulch

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
don't like it as a mulch

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.640 
don't like it as a mulch
but<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.830> love<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.820> soil<00:02:15.210> amendment<00:02:15.870> because

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
but I love it the soil amendment because

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.040 
but I love it the soil amendment because
it<00:02:16.920> helps<00:02:17.250> build<00:02:17.490> those<00:02:17.790> fungal<00:02:18.270> soil<00:02:18.540> strains

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
it helps build those fungal soil strains

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.540 
it helps build those fungal soil strains
that<00:02:20.630> really<00:02:21.630> work<00:02:21.840> well<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:23.070> I'm<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.460> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
that really work well now I'm going to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
that really work well now I'm going to
mix<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.970> big<00:02:24.330> batch<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.900> because<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.200> have

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
mix a big batch of this because we have

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.530 
mix a big batch of this because we have
a<00:02:25.350> lot<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.620> containers<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.460> but<00:02:27.210> this<00:02:27.390> is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
a lot of containers to do but this is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.000 
a lot of containers to do but this is
something<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.990> can<00:02:28.140> certainly<00:02:28.410> mix<00:02:28.860> yourself

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
something you can certainly mix yourself

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.130 
something you can certainly mix yourself
in<00:02:29.630> smaller<00:02:30.630> quantities<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> mixed<00:02:32.640> about

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
in smaller quantities so I mixed about

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.770 
in smaller quantities so I mixed about
three<00:02:34.140> parts<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.890> potting<00:02:35.310> mix<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:36.150> one<00:02:36.420> part

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
three parts of potting mix to one part

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.060 
three parts of potting mix to one part
soil<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:38.370> one<00:02:38.730> part<00:02:39.090> Coco<00:02:39.630> molt<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.320> I'm<00:02:40.920> going

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
soil to one part Coco molt and I'm going

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.210 
soil to one part Coco molt and I'm going
to<00:02:41.130> give<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.460> good<00:02:41.670> fluffing<00:02:42.180> up<00:02:43.190> with<00:02:44.190> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
to give that a good fluffing up with a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.420 
to give that a good fluffing up with a
fork<00:02:45.050> give<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> good<00:02:46.350> mix<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:47.220> we'll<00:02:47.310> be

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
fork give it a good mix and we'll be

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.900 
fork give it a good mix and we'll be
ready<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.670> pop<00:02:47.910> containers<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.720> minute
