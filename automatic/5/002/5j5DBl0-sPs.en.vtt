00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 speak drug gang here bringing another 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.649
 video for you guys this time I'll show 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.900
 how to shell five goals of venus because 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.519
 the feedback from others was such a good day 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.410
 had 80 views when I was 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.599
 recording it will probably have more 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.859
 when you cast more than 100 then let's go 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 I'll show you how the key in the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 pocket the first to leave first 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.539
 I'm sorry because two or three do not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.279
 two of them I had not already had and not 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 appears again but can trust them 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.650
 go there we go then first you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.260
 What are you going to do? 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.030
 patrol mode but I highly recommend it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.739
 You make inventions very easy to reach. 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.660
 in most of them fast 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 the first and second you make a 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.460
 mission only that there is winter suffering in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.770
 Portuguese I do not know how English in the area 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.000
 open you have to jump for some 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.739
 rocks and you can not see the video is very 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.180
 It's hard to explain by saying you're not going. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.910
 have a few stones on top of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.890
 map is going through the tunnel in these jumps 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.699
 stones will have a golden stab shot 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.320
 will not have the second you will see that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 I had seen from the top there is not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.760
 sure if they will even see but it gives 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.340
 to see from up there is behind 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.310
 of the ship is quite easy to find 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 emphasizes enough attack on that wash and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.490
 Okay, now you're going to the mission call. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.439
 cooperative is you arrive in an area 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.009
 middle at the end of the map will have a house 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.770
 top 11 place in establishment 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.080
 say the one above him will have a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.729
 they bug him on the go 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.729
 having him down there behind him almost 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 falling off the map then you will make a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.229
 called a stranger I think that if I 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 I know one in English is the strange skal 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.740
 I do not know, I think many of you have 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.000
 a game in Portuguese does not have 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 I need you 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.619
 one hour you will arrive a tunnel and a 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.939
 in the dark as well as business 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.880
 will be behind a pillar 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 This is the second one I had already taken and more. 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.869
 can believe in stab where he 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.009
 was he going to be okay and 11 points 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.619
 difference around them to have 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.930
 sure that it was there that he is the fifth 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.820
 and the last one you will do in nexus s 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.430
 This is very easy and I had not yet 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.079
 So I thought we were going to see the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.080
 damage in the next will reach this area 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.239
 Open well at first I think you'll turn 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.410
 to the right will have this full of greed 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.650
 You'll never go back. 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.240
 bilbao will be there and they were five 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.190
 people, if you like, do not forget 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.900
 show that you liked leaving one is 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.790
 That 's it, you're new to the channel, I'm going. 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.950
 bring more destiny tutorials than the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.600
 feedback is very good and I will bring 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.930
 some series of 10 in case you want 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.060
 see me playing and no more is this I'm 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.060
