River is that I would think they'd be

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.440 
River is that I would think they'd be
more<00:03:07.470> likely<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.920> snowmobiling<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.330> are

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
more likely go snowmobiling if there are

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.160 
more likely go snowmobiling if there are
such<00:03:09.690> things

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
such things

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.360 
such things
