or short it is I mean well I but this is

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.809 
or short it is I mean well I but this is

my opinion if movies are really too
short<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.360> think<00:04:42.419> they<00:04:42.630> should<00:04:42.780> be<00:04:42.840> longer<00:04:43.020> then

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.990 
I won't like the movie but the movies
too<00:04:45.210> long<00:04:45.449> and<00:04:46.160> alright<00:04:47.160> if<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.520> movie's<00:04:47.789> long

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
too long and alright if a movie's long

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.300 
too long and alright if a movie's long
then<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.210> won't<00:04:48.569> like<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.780> obviously<00:04:49.620> because

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
then I won't like that obviously because

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.159 
then I won't like that obviously because
it<00:04:50.430> wastes<00:04:50.580> my<00:04:50.729> time<00:04:50.759> but<00:04:51.419> if<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.780> movie<00:04:52.139> is

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
it wastes my time but if the movie is

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.189 
it wastes my time but if the movie is
interesting<00:04:53.069> and<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.580> captivates<00:04:54.330> me<00:04:54.479> then<00:04:55.050> I

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
interesting and it captivates me then I

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.050 
interesting and it captivates me then I
will<00:04:55.530> like<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.979> movie<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.280> that's<00:04:56.610> what<00:04:56.880> King
