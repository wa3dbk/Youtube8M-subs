00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.070
 welcome to Italian home cooking 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.370
 Today's recipe is ham 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.800
 in oil a very simple recipe yes 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.910
 it prepares entirely raw and can be 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.189
 also a nice gift idea on 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.150
 ham that we will use are the bottoms 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:28.659
 which is quite simple to find without 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.880
 big expense is in good delicatessen 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.920
 than in supermarkets 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.649
 naturally ham should be 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.730
 good and not too fat for this 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.850
 recipe we cut the ham into cubes 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.220
 regular and manual we also eliminate the 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.380
 beads or cuticles that could 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.540
 to annoy 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.330
 we are preparing a suitable recipe 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.860
 to the aperitif then something that 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.290
 must be very tasty and simple to 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.020
 take from a buffet and then data from it 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.839
 they must be small once 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.939
 we prepared the ham 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.130
 we prepare the aromas in which we want it 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.640
 to preserve 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.429
 I prefer to use oregano garlic 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.469
 chilli and bay leaves 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.310
 but of course it goes to taste you can 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.619
 add or remove what you want 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.829
 we just have to put in a jar 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.689
 which of course we have well washed and 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.450
 sterilized it already has 90 large in 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:35.170
 dishwasher and sufficient 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.619
 we alternate the ham with a pinch 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.069
 of the aromas we have chosen so 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.209
 to get more distribution 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.209
 possible homogeneous 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.610
 we continue until we have filled up well 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.300
 the jar so we will no longer use oil 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 strictly necessary 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.060
 when the jar is full, fill it 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.130
 with excellent olive oil we will have to 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.840
 then store it in the refrigerator 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.690
 keep for a long time 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.240
 but if you want ham to be good 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.640
 before serving as an appetizer 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.530
 aperitif wait at least two or three 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.650
 days otherwise it will not text a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.840
 soon become fresh for a new one 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.840
