00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 hello people welcome to one 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:28.349
 ambulatory special as welcome 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.000
 He hardly wants to be a subscriber special 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.290
 video referring to the two 8500s 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 yes we have had the feeling now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 that we make up a bit 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.239
 need for 7 and 8 k have thought us 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.239
 yes you can already run around here 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 we give away a bit of mainstream moderately 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.840
 a bit of fabric patrick if you like that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.800
 so what we are giving away to take turns 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.210
 read aloud so okay so via loose five 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 kids forever 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.800
 this money forever, not people now 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:11.549
 then two times a week pro on mtv and 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 now pay close attention 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.979
 we also give away two times 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:34.290
 week mwp and as highlight once a 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:38.670
 month on how much money you get 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:45.210
 rather 10,000 would be around 8000 hungary that would 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.560
 easily weigh two tons because it was 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.409
 the joke was actually that way 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 Currency is cold weight of the earth 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.149
 Change of power is physically 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 In any case, you want to, of course 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.300
 have the whole day and now wonders 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.960
 You know what's coming now 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.650
 logically, you have to subscribe to wine 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.110
 be from the channel in german games hd 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.070
 and this video also with a 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.070
 positive rating 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.750
 however, rate 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.160
 you know and others 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.290
 Solution found to be easy 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.550
 we just told each other what the kit 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.530
 you want to write in the comments 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.390
 So either wins if theirs 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.400
 you would write sketch if you child 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.990
 win winning kit but when the kids 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400
 and are giving away and then would you 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.480
 Stop a week either 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.990
 prologue, and yes we will too 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.580
 watch if a profile should win 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.140
 that it's kinda yes 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.760
 but I have to look again 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.470
 I guess they'll be that one 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.070
 solution in any case is the main message 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.170
 Thank you 8100 subscribers to say what the 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.090
 I have described integrated 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.840
 then said the kit but also the in 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.030
 game 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.640
 Oh, and the ingame after, of course 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.940
 but also know and and still important 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.720
 is 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.910
 you may not spam anymore 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.050
 as 5 message so 5 comments 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.560
 consecutively write us that 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.840
 unfair 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.280
 So up to five quarters in a row 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.610
 and then you should already a bit 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.470
 wait like the magic because of me 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.790
 we can not control it yes 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.500
 but if we should see that at the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.260
 Unfortunately, you will not win 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.700
 then the other one will win over 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.760
 win or it depends on who 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.840
 next one will definitely come 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.520
 exaggerate you can take your chance with 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.250
 several comments I say increase 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.880
 the thing is we make the resolution 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.870
 at 9000 subscribers then that's 200 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.550
 only two so not like people otherwise 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.020

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:10.040
