question on life straws QA that says the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.499 
question on life straws QA that says the
exact<00:02:02.739> same<00:02:02.770> thing<00:02:03.039> how<00:02:03.970> do<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.119> clean<00:02:04.390> this

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
clean it up like maybe washing the thing

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.320 
clean it up like maybe washing the thing

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
or is it necessary that filter itself is

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.509 
or is it necessary that filter itself is
antimicrobial<00:02:19.330> which<00:02:20.080> means<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.980> bacteria

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
antimicrobial which means that bacteria

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.119 
antimicrobial which means that bacteria

place but let's look at a more expensive
filter<00:02:53.670> being<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.790> MSR<00:02:55.269> Sweetwater<00:02:55.900> now<00:02:56.590> this

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
filter being the MSR Sweetwater now this

filter being the MSR Sweetwater now this
one<00:02:57.040> unlike<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.880> LifeStraw<00:02:58.480> can<00:02:59.079> be

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
one unlike the LifeStraw can be

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.430 
one unlike the LifeStraw can be
disassembled<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:01.420> can<00:03:01.629> take<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.019> housing

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
disassembled and I can take the housing

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.920 
disassembled and I can take the housing
away<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.129> pull<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.700> entire<00:03:04.030> filter<00:03:04.569> out<00:03:04.780> of

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
away and pull the entire filter out of

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.289 
away and pull the entire filter out of
its<00:03:05.079> unit<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.129> is<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> ceramic<00:03:06.730> filter

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
its unit and this is a ceramic filter

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.839 
its unit and this is a ceramic filter
and<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.140> clean<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.440> by<00:03:09.099> just<00:03:09.340> rubbing<00:03:09.579> off

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
and I can clean it by just rubbing off

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.640 
and I can clean it by just rubbing off
the<00:03:10.120> dirt<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.450> debris<00:03:10.510> from<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.079> exterior<00:03:11.470> of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the dirt and debris from the exterior of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.680 
the dirt and debris from the exterior of
the<00:03:11.769> cartridge<00:03:12.450> furthermore<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.510> can

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
the cartridge furthermore I can

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.289 
the cartridge furthermore I can
sterilize<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.250> boiling<00:03:15.640> pot<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:15.940> water

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
sterilize this in a boiling pot of water

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.440 
sterilize this in a boiling pot of water
so<00:03:16.959> per<00:03:17.230> MSR<00:03:17.709> recommendations<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.060> boil

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
so per MSR recommendations you can boil

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.840 
so per MSR recommendations you can boil
this<00:03:19.690> entire<00:03:20.049> unit<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.709> then<00:03:21.250> once<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.670> has

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
this entire unit and then once it has

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.059 
this entire unit and then once it has
met<00:03:22.299> its<00:03:22.480> maximum<00:03:23.109> time<00:03:23.319> or<00:03:23.530> minimum<00:03:23.829> time

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
met its maximum time or minimum time

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.340 
met its maximum time or minimum time
boiling<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:25.150> can<00:03:25.329> take<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.720> out<00:03:25.930> set<00:03:26.319> it

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
boiling you can take this out set it

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.250 
boiling you can take this out set it
aside<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.980> let<00:03:27.069> it<00:03:27.430> dry<00:03:27.549> so<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.450> bone-dry

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
aside and let it dry so it is bone-dry

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.660 
aside and let it dry so it is bone-dry
so<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.010> am<00:03:30.250> 100%<00:03:31.000> assured<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:32.470> when<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.680> pack

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
so I am 100% assured that when I pack

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.360 
so I am 100% assured that when I pack
this<00:03:33.940> away<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:34.959> safe<00:03:35.380> for<00:03:35.410> use<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.069> next

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
this away it is safe for use the next

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.740 
this away it is safe for use the next
time<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.970> use<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:38.349> LifeStraw<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.480> much

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
time I use it the LifeStraw not so much

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.610 
time I use it the LifeStraw not so much
now<00:03:42.269> don't<00:03:43.269> get<00:03:43.359> me<00:03:43.510> wrong<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.900> do<00:03:43.989> like<00:03:44.380> life

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
now don't get me wrong I do like life
