directly linked into the hangar module
this<00:03:08.430> will<00:03:08.580> be<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.330> different<00:03:09.690> room

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you'll go into a different more pod you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.360 
you'll go into a different more pod you
put<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.330> thing<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.690> all<00:03:19.170> your<00:03:19.980> integrate

that<00:03:24.209> way<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:25.080> design<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.620> Herald<00:03:25.950> is

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
that way the design for the Herald is

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.830 
that way the design for the Herald is
still<00:03:26.640> totally<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.090> flux<00:03:27.300> they<00:03:27.570> don't<00:03:27.780> really

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
still totally in flux they don't really

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.210 
still totally in flux they don't really
know<00:03:28.200> what<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.440> going<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.590> look<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.800> they

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
especially the Cutlass specifically said

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.470 
especially the Cutlass specifically said
the<00:03:42.870> Cutlass<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.320> really<00:03:43.830> not<00:03:43.950> finished<00:03:44.480> the

way of accessing arena commander will be

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.150 
way of accessing arena commander will be
changing<00:03:47.850> as<00:03:48.000> well<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.020> expect<00:03:49.890> there'll<00:03:50.040> be<00:03:50.070> a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
changing as well I expect there'll be a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.100 
changing as well I expect there'll be a
physical<00:03:50.520> room<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.390> your<00:03:51.989> actual<00:03:52.770> hangar<00:03:54.110> crg

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
physical room in your actual hangar crg

physical room in your actual hangar crg
have<00:03:55.230> said<00:03:55.470> they<00:03:55.739> specifically<00:03:56.580> want<00:03:56.820> to

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
have said they specifically want to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.880

support eSports so this can is going to
be<00:03:58.980> with<00:03:59.220> them<00:03:59.810> lots<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.870> different<00:04:01.140> ideas<00:04:01.440> but

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
be with them lots of different ideas but

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.070 
be with them lots of different ideas but
thinking<00:04:02.459> about<00:04:02.640> like<00:04:02.820> can<00:04:03.030> ship<00:04:03.510> outfitting

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
thinking about like can ship outfitting

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.229 
thinking about like can ship outfitting
point<00:04:04.470> systems<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.130> like<00:04:05.340> you'd<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> team

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
point systems so like you'd have a team

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.120 
point systems so like you'd have a team
of<00:04:06.270> people<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.900> you'd<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.260> 100<00:04:07.860> points<00:04:08.070> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
of people and you'd have 100 points to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.580 
of people and you'd have 100 points to
spare<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:09.030> with<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.270> you'd<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:10.140> outfit

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
spare and with that you'd have to outfit

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.620 
spare and with that you'd have to outfit
different<00:04:11.519> guns<00:04:11.820> about<00:04:12.060> different<00:04:12.300> points

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
different guns about different points

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.090 
different guns about different points
and<00:04:12.840> different<00:04:13.410> ships<00:04:13.560> worth<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:13.950> what's

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
and different ships worth it and what's

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.460 
and different ships worth it and what's
that<00:04:14.190> sort<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.580> thing<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.570> see<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.780> AG<00:04:16.080> really

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
that sort of thing so see I AG really

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.740 
that sort of thing so see I AG really
