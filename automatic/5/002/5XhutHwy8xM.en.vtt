religion existentialism greed power

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.339 
religion existentialism greed power
everything<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.329> questions<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.079> the

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
everything I think the questions the the

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.580 
everything I think the questions the the
philosophical<00:03:53.250> questions<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.260> moral

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
philosophical questions and the moral

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.649 
philosophical questions and the moral
questions<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.310> play<00:03:56.489> proposes<00:03:57.090> are

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
questions that the play proposes are

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.930 
questions that the play proposes are
ones<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.140> we<00:03:58.829> have<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> responsibility<00:03:59.159> to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
ones that we have a responsibility to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.789 
ones that we have a responsibility to
confront<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.079> play<00:04:01.260> kind<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.560> just

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
confront and so the play kind of just

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.369 
confront and so the play kind of just
like<00:04:01.920> put<00:04:02.549> some<00:04:02.760> into<00:04:02.940> your<00:04:03.030> face<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.019> I

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
like put some into your face and so I

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.410 
like put some into your face and so I
think<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:05.099> people<00:04:05.400> should<00:04:05.430> come<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.239> know
