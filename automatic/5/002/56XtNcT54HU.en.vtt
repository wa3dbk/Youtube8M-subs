 hello network welcome in this video 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.160
 i want to give you the android app shortly 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.379
 introduce an app with the blacklist 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 call her and sms from 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.610
 particular number block her comes that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.810
 whole is very simple 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.230
 You can do that under google player 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.189
 Download and we can see are 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.849
 already over a million times 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.109
 downloaded 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.840
 there's from android 2.1 and yes it is the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.300
 all just long in which I'm the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 app start and we have the here 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.320
 screen for black lets as can 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.020
 we add phone numbers from the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 Call logs from contacts 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.129
 messages or manual messages so 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.250
 with manual one gives then here simply 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.520
 the phone number 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.800
 if someone calls you then it will become one 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.079
 leave a message and it lands 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.789
 then here in the log and the caller 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.920
 are then either directly on the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.960
 mailbox forwarded or if you 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.530
 no mailbox was set up then 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.590
 is simply displayed and busy 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 under settings you can private 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.240
 papers all calls block sms 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.170
 block or sms then block times 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.569
 to adjust 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.440
 Regarding the privacy of her 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:28.800
 would specify password and here still 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.110
 Notify me and I will 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.369
 Try it all now and live 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.369
 test by not calling myself 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.039
 and then we'll see what's there 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039
 happens 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.820
 because normally the call should be 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:56.909
 be blocked directly so that always 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:01.200
 Incoming calls blocked a call 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.630
 in absence and we have here once 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.860
 the notifications from android 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.679
 even that it just went unanswered 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.820
 calls is and which we here with calls 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.560
 practice on it 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.110
 then this logs me protocol 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.540
 called me and yes so 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.370
 he is great and just for stalker or 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 as a preventive measure against stocker 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.050
 or against mad one night 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.709
 stands or anything else 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.550
 recommend 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.550
 and yes
