I found him on the side of the road he

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.500 
I found him on the side of the road he
looks<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.840> Jesus<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> we're<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

race<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.920> end<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.700> parkour<00:00:39.120> map<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
race to the end of this parkour map I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750 
race to the end of this parkour map I
don't<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.350> end<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:41.280> assuming

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
don't know what the end is I'm assuming

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
don't know what the end is I'm assuming
it<00:00:41.850> might<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> end<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.780> crane<00:00:43.170> right

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it might be the end of that crane right

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.160 
it might be the end of that crane right
there<00:00:43.680> either<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.809> top<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
there either that or it's the top of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869 
there either that or it's the top of
that<00:00:46.260> air<00:00:46.379> traffic<00:00:46.649> control<00:00:46.860> tower<00:00:47.070> i'm<00:00:47.309> black

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that air traffic control tower i'm black

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
that air traffic control tower i'm black
so<00:00:47.910> i<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.329> jump<00:00:48.539> farther<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.140> i've<00:00:49.260> also<00:00:49.350> got

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so i can jump farther and i've also got

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
so i can jump farther and i've also got
all<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.730> these<00:00:51.149> skills<00:00:51.840> maxed<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.430> on
