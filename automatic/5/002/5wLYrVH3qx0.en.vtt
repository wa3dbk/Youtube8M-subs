are built using multiple layers if you

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.500 
are built using multiple layers if you
look<00:00:05.850> at<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.830> life<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.280> packet<00:00:08.730> as<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.300> goes

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
look at the life of a packet as it goes

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.280 
look at the life of a packet as it goes

many many times so if you count the

of<00:01:32.820> operation<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.990> three

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
of operation is really to have three

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.380 
of operation is really to have three
layers<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> first<00:01:35.369> layer<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
layers this is the first layer the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.380 
layers this is the first layer the
second<00:01:36.750> layer<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.590> third<00:01:37.829> layer<00:01:38.240> these<00:01:39.240> are

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
second layer the third layer these are

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.039 
second layer the third layer these are
three<00:01:39.600> layers<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.020> switches<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:42.049> what

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
three layers of switches and what

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
three layers of switches and what
juniper<00:01:43.409> has<00:01:43.619> already<00:01:43.799> rolled<00:01:44.190> out<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.369> market

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
juniper has already rolled out to market

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.859 
juniper has already rolled out to market
is<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.310> these<00:01:47.520> three<00:01:47.700> layers<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is to go from these three layers to a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.309 
is to go from these three layers to a
two-layer<00:01:49.289> approach<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> essentially<00:01:52.110> what

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
two-layer approach so essentially what

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.050 
two-layer approach so essentially what
we<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:52.950> eliminate<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.549> aggregation

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
we do is we eliminate this aggregation

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
we do is we eliminate this aggregation
layer<00:01:54.390> altogether<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.740> core<00:01:56.039> layer

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
layer altogether we have a core layer

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.839 
layer altogether we have a core layer
and<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> top<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> rack<00:01:57.450> layer<00:01:57.689> and

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
and we have a top of rack layer and

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:05.389 
and we have a top of rack layer and
finally<00:01:59.849> with<00:02:00.479> our<00:02:00.599> fabric<00:02:01.020> technology<00:02:04.399> we're

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
finally with our fabric technology we're

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.730 
finally with our fabric technology we're
going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.580> go<00:02:05.729> from<00:02:06.060> two<00:02:06.360> layers<00:02:06.599> to<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.319> single

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
going to go from two layers to a single

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.130 
going to go from two layers to a single
layer<00:02:09.920> we're<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.640> hop<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.540> from<00:02:12.810> a
