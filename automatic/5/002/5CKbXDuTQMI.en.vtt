through any sort of amplifier decoder

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.609 
through any sort of amplifier decoder
anything<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.810> could<00:01:18.960> potentially<00:01:19.049> cause

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
anything that could potentially cause

anything that could potentially cause
audio<00:01:20.100> lag<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.580> short<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> most

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
audio lag in short this is the most

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.730 
audio lag in short this is the most
direct<00:01:22.080> connection<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
direct connection you can get so and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.780 
direct connection you can get so and
that's<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.420> cable<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:29.579> see

if<00:02:13.860> there's<00:02:14.069> any<00:02:14.360> cross<00:02:15.360> compatibility<00:02:16.079> or

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
if there's any cross compatibility or

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.059 
if there's any cross compatibility or
incompatibility<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:18.209> said<00:02:18.709> again<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:19.950> is

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
incompatibility that said again this is

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.000 
incompatibility that said again this is
probably<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:22.110> biggest<00:02:22.319> draw<00:02:22.680> when<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
probably the the biggest draw when it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160 
probably the the biggest draw when it
comes<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> band<00:02:23.640> fused<00:02:23.939> hardware<00:02:24.360> simply

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
comes to the band fused hardware simply

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.360 
comes to the band fused hardware simply
because<00:02:25.700> it's<00:02:26.700> got<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.209> headphone<00:02:27.720> jack

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
because it's got that headphone jack

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.309 
because it's got that headphone jack
wouldn't<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.519> surprised<00:02:29.939> to<00:02:30.090> see<00:02:30.359> if<00:02:30.629> people

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
wouldn't be surprised to see if people

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.869 
wouldn't be surprised to see if people
use<00:02:31.500> these<00:02:31.680> from<00:02:31.920> more<00:02:32.099> than<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.400> band<00:02:32.609> views

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
use these from more than just band views

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.210 
use these from more than just band views
especially<00:02:33.689> if<00:02:34.079> that<00:02:34.109> headphone<00:02:34.590> jack<00:02:34.829> works

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
especially if that headphone jack works

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.630 
especially if that headphone jack works
as<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.579> standard<00:02:36.000> Jack<00:02:36.239> with<00:02:36.480> everything

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
as a standard Jack with everything

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.599 
as a standard Jack with everything
because<00:02:38.640> I'm<00:02:39.120> having<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.720> direct<00:02:40.379> access<00:02:40.920> on

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
because I'm having that direct access on

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.520 
because I'm having that direct access on
a<00:02:41.670> console<00:02:42.269> while<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.569> come<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.109> think<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.379> it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
a console while we come to think of it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.259 
a console while we come to think of it
probably<00:02:44.129> hasn't<00:02:44.400> been<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.609> standard<00:02:45.060> feature

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
probably hasn't been a standard feature

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.170 
probably hasn't been a standard feature

original Sega Genesis came with the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.509

these days of gaming when we're all

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
game with headphones is quite the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.879 
game with headphones is quite the
convenience<00:03:03.689> especially<00:03:04.349> if<00:03:04.409> you<00:03:04.500> don't<00:03:04.680> need

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
convenience especially if you don't need

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.670 
convenience especially if you don't need
a<00:03:05.099> lot<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.670> excess<00:03:05.970> Hardware<00:03:06.389> all<00:03:07.200> right<00:03:07.379> this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
a lot of excess Hardware all right this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
a lot of excess Hardware all right this
has<00:03:07.709> been<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> quick<00:03:08.220> look<00:03:08.459> at<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.120> bad<00:03:09.599> if<00:03:09.750> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
has been a quick look at the bad if you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.649 
has been a quick look at the bad if you
use<00:03:09.930> hardware<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:11.250> soon<00:03:11.519> as<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:12.389> have

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
use hardware and as soon as we have

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.899 
use hardware and as soon as we have
something<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.829> say<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.220> game<00:03:14.430> we'll<00:03:14.700> be

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
something to say on the game we'll be

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.889 
something to say on the game we'll be
sure<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.359> post<00:03:15.629> impressions<00:03:16.170> thanks
