right now it's kind of early and this is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.429 
right now it's kind of early and this is
what<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> looks<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> first<00:01:36.990> take

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
what it looks like when you first take

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.420 
what it looks like when you first take
it<00:01:37.560> down<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> play<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430

it down so now it's time to play with it
and<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:45.290> separate<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:47.090> cuz<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.270> want<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.810> be

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and just separate it cuz I want it to be

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.290 
and just separate it cuz I want it to be
much<00:01:49.229> fuller

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.870 

okay<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:54.360> I'm<00:01:55.290> gonna<00:01:55.500> call<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.250> fail

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.100 

okay<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:45.840> I've<00:02:46.230> manipulated<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.310> hair<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.510> I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
okay so I've manipulated the hair and I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.470 
okay so I've manipulated the hair and I
moved<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.530> my<00:02:49.650> middle<00:02:49.950> part<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.550> side<00:02:51.030> part

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
moved to my middle part to a side part

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.680 
moved to my middle part to a side part
and<00:02:51.840> I'm<00:02:52.500> feeling<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.220> lot<00:02:53.550> better<00:02:53.760> than<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and I'm feeling it a lot better than the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.800 
and I'm feeling it a lot better than the
middle<00:02:54.989> part<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.370> mean<00:02:56.819> it's<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.120> perfect

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
middle part and I mean it's not perfect

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.390 
middle part and I mean it's not perfect
it<00:02:58.019> could<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.290> been<00:02:58.380> better<00:02:58.680> maybe<00:02:59.069> I

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it could have been better maybe I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.970 
it could have been better maybe I
shouldn't<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.239> put<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.720> small<00:03:01.050> ones<00:03:01.290> at<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
shouldn't have put the small ones at the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.410 
shouldn't have put the small ones at the
top<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.519> large<00:03:02.730> uns<00:03:02.849> at<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.120> bottom

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
top and the large uns at the bottom

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.020 
top and the large uns at the bottom
because<00:03:03.810> my<00:03:04.650> hair<00:03:04.920> obviously<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.670> gonna<00:03:05.880> get

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
because my hair obviously is gonna get

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.900 
because my hair obviously is gonna get
shorter<00:03:06.480> than<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> weave<00:03:06.989> when<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.910> curled

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
shorter than the weave when it's curled

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.610 
shorter than the weave when it's curled
or<00:03:09.209> crinkled<00:03:09.870> or<00:03:10.080> anything<00:03:10.319> like<00:03:10.560> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
or crinkled or anything like that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.530 
or crinkled or anything like that
because<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.370> shorter<00:03:11.880> than<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> weave<00:03:12.269> so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
because it is shorter than the weave so

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.380 
because it is shorter than the weave so
you're<00:03:13.049> obviously<00:03:13.170> gonna<00:03:13.769> see<00:03:14.160> where<00:03:14.970> my<00:03:15.120> hair

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
you're obviously gonna see where my hair

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.199 
you're obviously gonna see where my hair
stops<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.650> where<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.950> weave<00:03:17.130> starts<00:03:17.819> which<00:03:18.060> I

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
stops and where the weave starts which I

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.180 
stops and where the weave starts which I
don't<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.380> not<00:03:19.470> too

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
don't really like but it's not too

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.210 
don't really like but it's not too
drastic<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.150> change<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.350> doable<00:03:22.799> for

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
drastic of a change so it's doable for

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.699 
drastic of a change so it's doable for
right<00:03:23.730> now<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.180> gonna<00:03:24.330> try<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.750> redo<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.349> and

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
right now I'm gonna try to redo it and

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.070 
right now I'm gonna try to redo it and
see<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.310> should<00:03:26.370> put<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> larger<00:03:27.299> ones<00:03:27.540> on

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
see if I should put the larger ones on

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.600 
see if I should put the larger ones on
the<00:03:28.260> top<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.739> small<00:03:28.950> ones<00:03:29.220> on<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.489> bottom

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the top and the small ones on the bottom

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.670 
the top and the small ones on the bottom
and<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.450> how<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.630> works<00:03:30.959> out

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
and see how that works out

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.160 
and see how that works out
