00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.519
 remember she was at the salon of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 Geneva 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.490
 and she was part of the disappointments 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.809
 but yes you have to be 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.280
 honest that his parents 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 they do not care a bit about the market 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 European it is calibrated for usa 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 for canada where they sell some 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.109
 tons and at home necessarily the anpe 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.269
 malvieille drunk but it's a legend 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 and we legends have to try them on 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.760
 like them elsewhere today 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.760
 the test on caradisiac subaru wrx sti 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.820
 then this new vintage of the wrx sti 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 she differs from the old from not big 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.239
 thing in fact we first have a style 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.710
 we see here that was a thousand times more 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.510
 pretty on the concept that everybody is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.590
 okay that's pretty commonplace there is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.399
 even rooms to find that that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.800
 looks like a mitsubishi 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 well we still have the air intake here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.370
 and there the pie shovel behind we know 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 that it's a subaru actually in length 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.520
 we have two more centimeters in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.080
 wheelbase of centimeters and a half on 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.820
 is almost on the same car 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.090
 than before under the hood 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.270
 even topo we have a flat fort of the it 5 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 300 horsepower and 407 newton turbo 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.979
 meters inside in an interior 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.509
 which is still pretty transparent the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.189
 quality is a bit better than before 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.630
 it's true but we are very very very 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.420
 very far from the standard premium dd 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.450
 German that remains of Japan is to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 say what is this so this car 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.460
 she is of another age 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.320
 so the fact that it is aging 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.000
 is a problem they heard that 54 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 last year but it's not the only one 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.890
 problem no no there is also the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.720
 competition 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460
 so be careful not to mitsu mitsu 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.240
 she died to the missing the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240
 modern competition 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.619
 before 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.909
 at 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.500
 the question of behavior 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610
 it arises then in relation to 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.200
 the old generation that is what has 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.100
 been done so I tell you it was 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.870
 much worked on the suspension 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.150
 even breaks a little stiffer 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.190
 lotto obviously turn a little more to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.920
 flat without actually degrading the comfort 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.990
 we are on a crane mix between the two 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.790
 but what is interesting about wrx sti 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.530
 What is this is the kinematic 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.750
 traction so you have a boxer to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.960
 front engine flat to avoid 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.360
 to have center of gravity too that's 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.860
 beneficial to agility and you have 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.330
 especially a 4 wheel drive that is not 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.370
 not that of the competition 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.400
 and yes, we have a true real of true 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.380
 four wheel drive with du 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.390
 limited slip differential in front 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.550
 behind and a central differential that 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.630
 we can drive here by putting the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.040
 power at the back or power 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.050
 forward or letting him handle 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.880
 automatically then compared to 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.360
 the old version that could send 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.410
 65% back here we have more than 59% 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.350
 overall that what we can say is 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.140
 that the car is more calibrated 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.160
 from now on to go to the track 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.550
 on the road it's over we can 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.430
 enjoy 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.200
 so the car is really calibrated 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.209
 for the track versus a car 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.170
 of the competition that can be said it's 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.820
 we really feel like 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.340
 a 4-wheel drive in the hands in 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.270
 blood the torque vectoring that is active 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.860
 right here 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.360
 red hair that slow one side 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.010
 accelerates on the other to help you 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.200
 to return alone have stepped on 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.090
 the accelerator you took it up the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.070
 car behaves differently if you 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.960
 touch the settings as you feel 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.780
 a change it's not a pull 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.450
 improved it's a real real four 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.520
 driving wheels and despite everything despite 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.200
 all we can say about the 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.210
 soul that's what people are looking for and 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.620
 unfortunately they are less and less 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.680
 many looking for this stuff 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.790
 old school cars the soup that's 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.620
 a new but vintage car and it's 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.620
 not super seller banon 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.180
 so in the end of this day I 'm going 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.959
 not hold you long I already have you 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.360
 everything says in the video 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.980
 this car and old school she gets 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.220
 for people who are also old 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.810
 school it costs 40 4950 euros in 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.040
 this entry-level version 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.540
 forty nine thousand nine hundred and fifty 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.859
 euros in a cloud version with the 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.630
 sunroof the gps is much more 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.180
 of equipment do not forget that the 8000 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.620
 euros of malus to which she claims they 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.870
 are supported by subaru during 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.850
 we do not know when 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.570
 are finally driving may not be what is 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.570
 the one that you will need 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.860
