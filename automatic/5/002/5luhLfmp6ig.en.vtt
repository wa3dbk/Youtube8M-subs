00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.599
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.230
 where today we will see the set of real numbers 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.759
 continuing in the room of numerical sets 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.539
 before but I left a message for you 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.850
 subscribe to our channel on youtube 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.920
 because only then will you keep track of all your news was worth it 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.380
 people 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.080
 without a doubt the numerical set that the most used people in their set of the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.930
 real 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 it will involve all the sets that we have learned 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.190
 if we pick up the set of funders effigy the set of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.750
 we will have a set of bones 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.770
 real 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.760
 their loss of social 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.920
 the same properties are vacant 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.190
 the previous clashes 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.160
 and besides these will change to add action 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.959
 remembering that radiation 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.579
 it is not defined 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.619
 when everyone has index participated in timor and active bebeto 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.780
 I would talk to you guys 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.730
 when it says there is square root of kitty number that did not exist 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.810
 same thing changes continuing the goalkeeper in the other cases 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.900
 more than once the action 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 they continued to exist crucial course paper 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.980
 then the parent of that action the operation that is defined 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.939
 only with the wing assembly part 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.530
 real 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.010
 other representations 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.420
 we had here then the set of branches or more 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 together with your mother assumes that the two are separated and if people 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.979
 get together 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.520
 the group of nationals 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.049
 with relational sets make the union of them we go looking for funds 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.170
 real 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.880
 you see that all sets with previous 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.820
 they are super sets 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.390
 of all channels 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.850
 sex the natural the internal 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.869
 the nationals 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.109
 and those that are national subsets of gifts 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.590
 real 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.230
 set of complex numbers 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.309
 however the most complex 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.339
 it will be the one that will solve problems the following type 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.339
 how much are square root of -4 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.139
 I went to hide 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.450
 This question does not make sense if you just told us 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.450
 that we have not defined more square of negative number 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.949
 it's true people really did not define it but when the negative number 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.769
 but I give 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.499
 the field of pine forests 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:35.169
 When we work with complex works, we are going to define 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.420
 the square root 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.640
 is the best country to incite 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.239
 of negative numbers 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.099
 why that 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.859
 the prosecution together so far taken advantage of this issue had not 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:47.839
 answer 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.120
 however with the advancement of science 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.949
 the set of real numbers was no longer sufficient for example 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.739
 some phenomena studied and engineering and also in other areas they 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.100
 they needed a tool that would justify 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.990
 which 24 the number of assets 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.350
 that is personal with the development of science some areas of engineering and 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.410
 other areas also 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.919
 need a tool that would justify 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.419
 the existence of infrastructure that the actor negative numbers 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.279
 there are phenomena for example is in aerodynamics 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.010
 and other phenomena in electronics that exist 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:27.069
 at the time they existed they compete with the result 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.200
 but square with negative index in them incidentally did not want to get with the donors 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.789
 depend to exist 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.299
 Eighteen square root diogo arrives active 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.019
 we asked the championship well what happened then what we are 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.099
 doing so much that we have to do we have to change math not to 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.020
 people are adapted to mathematics 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.269
 so that it can respond to these emerging problems 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.419
 That's why it came together one of the complexes is not just for make you more 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.499
 issue of the sewer agent 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.809
 we are going to study the set of two complexes at the end of our 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:01.479
 mathematics 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.649
 other representations 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:07.339
 so if we want the giant of the hill we'll have to go 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.049
 set of irrational 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.489
 the set of almost duster and natural burials of the real all 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.340
 these sets that we have the three 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.239
 they are subsets 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.600
 of the set of complexes the complexes the complexes that actually involve all 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.309
 with the other sets it is a larger set 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:30.240
 and all these other sets are subsets 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.890
 of the complexes 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.300
 that we are going to study closer to our course 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.139
 personal perish then it is wrong for you the notion of complete sets 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.139
 I say the numbers 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.059
 logical 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.039
 is the set of reals is contained in the set of 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.700
 complexes or 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.539
 complex sets and complex subsets 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.709
 now, people are social
