00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.760 
of the more or higher grade peroxides
like<00:01:45.539> for<00:01:45.749> instance<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.139> coming<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
like for instance for coming here that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.919 
like for instance for coming here that
can<00:01:46.950> actually<00:01:47.249> cause<00:01:47.849> internal<00:01:48.420> damage<00:01:48.599> so<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
can actually cause internal damage so we

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.089 
can actually cause internal damage so we
want<00:01:49.109> to<00:01:49.170> stay<00:01:49.289> away<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.499> that<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:49.829> use

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
want to stay away for that so just use

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.969 
want to stay away for that so just use
the<00:01:50.219> 3%<00:01:50.700> peroxide<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.359> find<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the 3% peroxide that we find the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.300 
the 3% peroxide that we find the
guidelines<00:01:53.189> are<00:01:53.609> 1<00:01:53.789> cc<00:01:54.319> per<00:01:55.319> pound<00:01:55.919> of<00:01:56.219> an

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
guidelines are 1 cc per pound of an

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.849 
guidelines are 1 cc per pound of an
animal<00:01:56.609> we<00:01:57.509> don't<00:01:57.659> want<00:01:57.779> to<00:01:57.840> exceed<00:01:58.020> 60<00:01:58.439> CCS

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
animal we don't want to exceed 60 CCS

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.909 
animal we don't want to exceed 60 CCS
and<00:01:59.099> a<00:01:59.310> cc<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.779> 1<00:02:00.929> tablespoon<00:02:01.409> equals<00:02:01.679> 30

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:01.919 
and a cc you know 1 tablespoon equals 30

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:04.059 
and a cc you know 1 tablespoon equals 30
cc<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.549> that's<00:02:02.669> just<00:02:02.849> if<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> don't<00:02:03.419> have<00:02:03.539> a

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
cc so that's just if you don't have a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.739 
cc so that's just if you don't have a
syringe<00:02:05.069> around<00:02:05.429> them<00:02:05.669> that's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.419> good<00:02:06.599> thing

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
syringe around them that's a good thing

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.440 
syringe around them that's a good thing
to<00:02:06.899> use<00:02:07.319> as<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.499> guideline<00:02:07.739> so<00:02:08.130> one<00:02:08.970> cc<00:02:09.300> per

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to use as a guideline so one cc per

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
to use as a guideline so one cc per
pound<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> exceed<00:02:10.349> 60<00:02:10.739> pounds<00:02:11.039> so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
pound for not to exceed 60 pounds so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.580 
pound for not to exceed 60 pounds so
usually<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.390> know<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.840> his<00:02:13.080> case<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.440> would

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
usually you know in his case I would

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.820 
usually you know in his case I would
probably<00:02:13.709> use<00:02:13.860> about<00:02:14.069> 40<00:02:14.580> CCS<00:02:15.120> initially<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
probably use about 40 CCS initially and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.050 
probably use about 40 CCS initially and
you<00:02:16.830> know<00:02:16.920> most<00:02:17.370> useful<00:02:17.700> thing<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.880> have

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you know most useful thing to have

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.699 
you know most useful thing to have
around<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> syringe

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
around is a syringe

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.869 
around is a syringe
you<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.129> syringe<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.459> use<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.700> turkey

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
you have a syringe of use a turkey

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.430 
you have a syringe of use a turkey
baster<00:02:21.030> anything<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.780> nature<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.200> get

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
baster anything of that nature to get

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.420 
baster anything of that nature to get
them<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.680> drink<00:02:22.830> because<00:02:23.099> they're<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.280> going

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
them to drink because they're not going

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.309 
them to drink because they're not going
to<00:02:23.489> drink<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.970> row<00:02:24.090> unfortunately<00:02:24.690> so

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
to drink it on the row unfortunately so

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:33.410 
to drink it on the row unfortunately so
basically<00:02:26.159> what<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> do<00:02:26.549> is<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:30.950> sure<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.420> so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
basically what you do is you sure but so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.199 
basically what you do is you sure but so
you<00:02:33.870> know<00:02:33.900> you'll<00:02:34.349> drop<00:02:34.560> your<00:02:34.620> peroxide<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
you know you'll drop your peroxide just

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.789 
you know you'll drop your peroxide just
in<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> strange<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.200> I'll<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.680> it

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
in a strange like this and I'll do it

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.530 
in a strange like this and I'll do it
here<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.069> make<00:02:38.190> them<00:02:38.310> throw<00:02:38.489> up<00:02:38.579> but<00:02:38.730> just

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
here that make them throw up but just

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
here that make them throw up but just
draw<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.099> you're<00:02:41.190> going<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
draw it up and you know you're going to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.460 
draw it up and you know you're going to
have<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.579> force<00:02:42.239> force<00:02:42.690> them<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.900> eat<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.349> drink

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
have to force force them to eat or drink

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.080 
have to force force them to eat or drink
it<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:44.340> get<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.579> stand<00:02:44.790> over<00:02:44.879> them

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it so you just get to stand over them

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.580 
it so you just get to stand over them
and<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.390> put<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> little<00:02:46.170> bit<00:02:46.349> at<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.560> time

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and just put it a little bit at a time

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.470 
and just put it a little bit at a time
and<00:02:46.980> they<00:02:47.310> will<00:02:47.459> drink<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.879> as<00:02:48.030> you're<00:02:48.209> forcing

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
and they will drink it as you're forcing

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.130 
and they will drink it as you're forcing
it<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.060> found<00:02:51.299> works<00:02:51.540> best<00:02:51.629> from<00:02:52.049> my

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it to what I found works best from my

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.509 
it to what I found works best from my
personal<00:02:52.470> experience<00:02:52.920> unfortunately<00:02:53.250> is

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
personal experience unfortunately is

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.220 
personal experience unfortunately is
that<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.299> kind<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.569> watching<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:55.019> pot

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
that it's kind of like watching a pot

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.259 
that it's kind of like watching a pot
boil<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:56.280> will<00:02:56.400> occur<00:02:56.579> fast<00:02:56.849> if<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.120> don't

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
boil it it will occur fast if you don't

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.839 
boil it it will occur fast if you don't
watch<00:02:57.420> them<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.099> you<00:02:59.099> know<00:02:59.190> put<00:02:59.489> them<00:02:59.640> away<00:02:59.760> in

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
watch them so you know put them away in

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.490 
watch them so you know put them away in
a<00:03:00.030> kettle<00:03:00.239> have<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.690> give<00:03:00.840> them<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.989> peroxide

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
a kettle have to give them the peroxide

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.190 
a kettle have to give them the peroxide
or<00:03:01.739> somewhere<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.629> garage<00:03:03.629> somewhere<00:03:03.930> where

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
or somewhere a garage somewhere where

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.869 
or somewhere a garage somewhere where
you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.409> clean<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> mess<00:03:05.190> up<00:03:05.220> easily<00:03:05.670> enough

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
you can clean the mess up easily enough

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.729 
you can clean the mess up easily enough
and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.200> know<00:03:07.290> check<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
and then you know check on the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.170 
and then you know check on the
periodically<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.609> know<00:03:08.700> what<00:03:08.849> can

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
periodically because you know what can

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.430 
periodically because you know what can
happen<00:03:09.359> is<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:09.780> they<00:03:09.840> throw<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.140> up<00:03:10.230> they<00:03:10.319> can

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
happen is if they throw it up they can

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.319 
happen is if they throw it up they can
actually<00:03:10.560> eat<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.799> again<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.400> that's<00:03:12.060> going<00:03:12.269> to

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
actually eat it again so that's going to

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.960 
actually eat it again so that's going to
be<00:03:12.420> an<00:03:12.510> issue<00:03:12.629> so<00:03:12.890> once<00:03:13.890> they<00:03:14.040> throw<00:03:14.250> up<00:03:14.400> you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
be an issue so once they throw up you

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.009 
be an issue so once they throw up you
know<00:03:15.060> that's<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.480> good<00:03:15.599> thing<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.810> get<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
know that's a good thing to get the

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.250 
know that's a good thing to get the
toxin<00:03:16.409> up<00:03:16.500> versus<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> most<00:03:17.670> important<00:03:18.260> second

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
toxin up versus a most important second

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.479 
toxin up versus a most important second
thing<00:03:19.409> you<00:03:19.620> know<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.859> I<00:03:19.890> would<00:03:20.069> recommend

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
thing you know that I would recommend

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.190 
thing you know that I would recommend
having<00:03:20.579> your<00:03:20.760> on<00:03:20.909> is<00:03:21.030> activated<00:03:21.540> charcoal<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
having your on is activated charcoal and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.930 
having your on is activated charcoal and
even<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:23.190> make<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.459> throw<00:03:23.609> up<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.819> could

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
even if you make it throw up it could

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.460 
even if you make it throw up it could
still<00:03:24.090> be<00:03:24.180> some<00:03:24.389> residue<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.109> system

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
still be some residue in the system

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.640 
still be some residue in the system
already<00:03:25.650> absorbing<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.639> causing<00:03:26.940> damage<00:03:27.060> so

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
already absorbing and causing damage so

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.990 
already absorbing and causing damage so
the<00:03:28.650> activated<00:03:29.069> charcoal<00:03:29.370> actually<00:03:29.700> serves

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the activated charcoal actually serves

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.690 
the activated charcoal actually serves
as<00:03:30.590> something<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.709> will<00:03:31.799> help<00:03:32.160> absorb<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
as something that will help absorb the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.009 
as something that will help absorb the
toxins<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:33.389> move<00:03:33.569> through<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.840> body

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
toxins and then move through the body

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:34.819 
toxins and then move through the body
and<00:03:34.380> hopefully

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
and hopefully

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.159 
and hopefully
minimizing<00:03:35.459> damage<00:03:35.579> so<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.629> is<00:03:36.780> charcoal

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
minimizing damage so this is charcoal

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.349 
minimizing damage so this is charcoal
and<00:03:37.319> once<00:03:37.530> again<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.859> is<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.250> messy<00:03:38.700> project

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
and once again this is a messy project

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.490 
and once again this is a messy project
so<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.480> have<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.720> take<00:03:39.840> them<00:03:39.959> outside<00:03:40.079> let

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
so you have to take them outside let

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.470 
so you have to take them outside let
immediate<00:03:40.829> yeah<00:03:41.310> because<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:42.000> will<00:03:42.120> get<00:03:42.239> black

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
immediate yeah because it will get black

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.909 
immediate yeah because it will get black
all<00:03:42.720> over<00:03:42.870> your<00:03:42.989> carpet<00:03:43.319> or<00:03:43.349> when<00:03:43.799> we're

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
all over your carpet or when we're

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.400 
all over your carpet or when we're
trying<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.160> do<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.780> know<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.019> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
trying to do it but you know the the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.080 
trying to do it but you know the the
dosages<00:03:46.859> are<00:03:46.919> on<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.280> activated<00:03:47.669> charcoal<00:03:48.000> so

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
dosages are on the activated charcoal so

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.939 
dosages are on the activated charcoal so
you<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.329> do<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.109> according<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.470> weight<00:03:49.709> and

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
you just do it according to weight and

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.770 
you just do it according to weight and
then<00:03:50.160> make<00:03:50.910> them<00:03:51.060> eat<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.359> and<00:03:51.660> then

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
then make them eat this and then

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.599 
then make them eat this and then
hopefully<00:03:52.769> they<00:03:52.859> won't<00:03:53.040> throw<00:03:53.129> it<00:03:53.280> back<00:03:53.400> up

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
hopefully they won't throw it back up

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.439 
hopefully they won't throw it back up
and<00:03:53.730> it'll<00:03:53.879> stay<00:03:54.060> down<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.449> do<00:03:55.049> its<00:03:55.169> work<00:03:55.379> so

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
and it'll stay down and do its work so

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.699 
and it'll stay down and do its work so
other<00:03:57.449> thing<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.750> talk<00:03:57.870> about<00:03:58.139> if<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.349> Natalie

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
other thing to talk about if I Natalie

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.250 
other thing to talk about if I Natalie
it's<00:03:58.829> like<00:03:58.949> a<00:03:59.010> sharp<00:03:59.280> object<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.959> know<00:04:01.049> during

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
it's like a sharp object you know during

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.890 
it's like a sharp object you know during
Christmas<00:04:01.680> time<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:02.069> sometimes<00:04:03.000> common<00:04:03.840> to

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
Christmas time it's sometimes common to

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.240 
Christmas time it's sometimes common to
see<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.109> neat<00:04:04.260> Christmas<00:04:04.620> balls<00:04:04.980> or

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
see the neat Christmas balls or

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.189 
see the neat Christmas balls or
ornaments<00:04:05.639> you<00:04:06.389> don't<00:04:06.569> want<00:04:06.690> them<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.900> vomit

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
ornaments you don't want them to vomit

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.479 
ornaments you don't want them to vomit
that<00:04:07.349> back<00:04:07.530> up<00:04:07.739> or<00:04:07.859> like<00:04:07.949> a<00:04:08.010> chicken<00:04:08.340> balls

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
that back up or like a chicken balls

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.189 
that back up or like a chicken balls
another<00:04:08.760> thing<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.030> hear<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.599> lot<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.019> don't

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
another thing I hear a lot so you don't

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.509 
another thing I hear a lot so you don't
want<00:04:10.319> them<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.590> bother<00:04:10.769> those<00:04:10.949> things<00:04:11.160> back<00:04:11.310> up

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
want them to bother those things back up

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.309 
want them to bother those things back up
because<00:04:11.639> they<00:04:11.790> can<00:04:11.940> actually<00:04:12.090> get<00:04:12.870> caught<00:04:13.139> in

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
because they can actually get caught in

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.750 
because they can actually get caught in
the<00:04:13.440> esophagus<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.220> once<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.489> can<00:04:14.609> cause

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
the esophagus and once you can cause

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
the esophagus and once you can cause
damage<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.329> way<00:04:15.389> back<00:04:15.569> up

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
damage of the way back up

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.099 
damage of the way back up
so<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:17.250> way<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.400> deal<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.639> those<00:04:17.940> would<00:04:18.930> be

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
so the way to deal with those would be

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.140 
so the way to deal with those would be
to<00:04:19.289> you<00:04:19.530> know<00:04:19.590> feed<00:04:19.829> them<00:04:19.979> like<00:04:20.099> say<00:04:20.639> four<00:04:21.120> or

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
to you know feed them like say four or

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.540 
to you know feed them like say four or
five<00:04:21.239> or<00:04:21.479> six<00:04:21.630> pieces<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.320> bread<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:23.370> can

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
five or six pieces of bread and that can

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.969 
five or six pieces of bread and that can
actually<00:04:23.669> help<00:04:23.910> pad<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:25.110> objects<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.710> help

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
actually help pad the objects and help

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.700 
actually help pad the objects and help
pass<00:04:26.130> them<00:04:26.400> through

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.900 

if<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.950> do<00:04:29.070> feed<00:04:29.280> them<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> bread<00:04:29.670> though<00:04:29.850> you

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
if you do feed them the bread though you

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.780 
if you do feed them the bread though you
need<00:04:30.060> they<00:04:30.180> still<00:04:30.540> make<00:04:31.110> sure<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.590> you

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
need they still make sure that you

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.650 
need they still make sure that you
observe<00:04:32.790> them<00:04:32.910> for<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.090> next<00:04:33.300> four<00:04:33.480> or<00:04:33.510> five

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
observe them for the next four or five

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.420 
observe them for the next four or five
days<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:33.930> probably<00:04:34.800> have<00:04:34.890> them<00:04:35.010> taken<00:04:35.280> and

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
days and probably have them taken and

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.740 
days and probably have them taken and
have<00:04:35.580> an<00:04:35.670> x-ray<00:04:35.910> taken<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.330> make<00:04:36.450> sure<00:04:36.480> there's

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
have an x-ray taken to make sure there's

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.960 
have an x-ray taken to make sure there's
not<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.530> know<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.860> for<00:04:38.340> instance<00:04:38.430> something

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
not you know like for instance something

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.940 
not you know like for instance something
lodged<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.570> intestine<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:40.620> may<00:04:40.740> cause<00:04:40.920> a

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
lodged in the intestine that may cause a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.070 
lodged in the intestine that may cause a
perforation<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:42.600> be<00:04:42.690> aware<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:42.930> those

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
perforation so just be aware of those

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.840 
perforation so just be aware of those
kind<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.350> things<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.830> hopefully<00:04:44.760> you'll

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
kind of things and hopefully you'll

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.980 
kind of things and hopefully you'll
never<00:04:44.880> have<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.180> experience<00:04:45.420> a<00:04:45.630> little<00:04:45.720> for

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
never have to experience a little for
