like a very light purple and it'll

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.810 
like a very light purple and it'll
spread<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.810> the<00:00:36.960> water<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:38.280> need<00:00:38.460> room

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
spread out in the water you need room

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.650 
spread out in the water you need room
temperature<00:00:39.510> water<00:00:40.640> I'm<00:00:41.640> using<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.240> different

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
temperature water I'm using a different

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.040 
temperature water I'm using a different
color<00:00:43.130> pink<00:00:44.130> it's<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.240> a<00:00:45.270> coral<00:00:45.780> color<00:00:46.310> and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
color pink it's like a coral color and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.520 
color pink it's like a coral color and
I'm<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.410> rotating<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.310> back<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.790> forth

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
I'm just rotating them back and forth

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.870 
I'm just rotating them back and forth
these<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.890> colors

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
these two colors

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.510 
these two colors
and<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.930> water<00:00:56.230> should<00:00:56.590> be<00:00:56.650> filtered<00:00:57.250> water

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
and the water should be filtered water

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.110 
and the water should be filtered water
and<00:00:58.000> it<00:00:58.870> also<00:00:59.400> should<00:01:01.980> sit<00:01:02.980> for<00:01:03.370> about<00:01:03.490> an<00:01:03.820> hour

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
and it also should sit for about an hour

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.730 
and it also should sit for about an hour
or<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:06.100> in<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.090> bowl<00:01:07.300> so<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.440> will

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
or so it in the bowl so that it will

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.350 
or so it in the bowl so that it will
spread<00:01:09.460> properly<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:14.620> as<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.460> as<00:01:15.910> you<00:01:15.970> can

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
spread properly and as you as you can

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.090 
spread properly and as you as you can
see<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:16.720> spreading<00:01:17.170> really<00:01:17.830> nicely<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:20.440> you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
see it's spreading really nicely and you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.280 
see it's spreading really nicely and you
just<00:01:21.340> keep<00:01:21.550> doing<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:22.240> until<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:22.870> build<00:01:23.110> it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
just keep doing this until you build it

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
just keep doing this until you build it
to<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:24.370> desired<00:01:24.850> shape<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:28.979> wit<00:01:29.979> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to the desired shape and and wit I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.540 
to the desired shape and and wit I
should<00:01:31.390> say<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:38.050> this<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.070> very<00:01:39.400> easy

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
should say and this is a very easy

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.080 
should say and this is a very easy
design<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.840> am<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.350> going<00:01:41.710> basically<00:01:42.490> lines

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
design I am just going basically lines

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.600 
design I am just going basically lines
now<00:01:43.660> I've<00:01:43.900> built<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.500> bullseye<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.340> want

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
now I've built the bullseye that I want

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.520 
now I've built the bullseye that I want
to<00:01:45.729> build<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.540> I'm<00:01:46.990> just<00:01:47.320> making<00:01:48.100> these<00:01:48.759> lines

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to build and I'm just making these lines

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.550 
to build and I'm just making these lines
right<00:01:50.530> here<00:01:50.560> come<00:01:51.430> across<00:01:51.790> my<00:01:52.119> nail<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.660> so

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
right here come across my nail and so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.830 
right here come across my nail and so
I'm<00:01:53.890> just<00:01:54.220> kind<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.670> dragging<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.570> little

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
I'm just kind of dragging it a little

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.609 
I'm just kind of dragging it a little
bit<00:01:56.369> from<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.400> center<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.180> pull<00:01:58.990> these<00:01:59.200> lines

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
bit from the center to pull these lines

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.359 
bit from the center to pull these lines
apart<00:02:00.340> some<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:05.200> all<00:02:05.380> I'm<00:02:05.590> doing<00:02:05.979> and

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
apart some and that's all I'm doing and

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.180 
apart some and that's all I'm doing and
then<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.640> will<00:02:06.970> take<00:02:07.210> my<00:02:07.259> thumbnail<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:09.060> dip<00:02:10.060> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
just leave it in there for a few seconds

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.590 
just leave it in there for a few seconds
and<00:02:14.080> clean<00:02:14.830> up<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.250> water<00:02:15.280> around<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.390> that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
and clean up the water around it so that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.980 
and clean up the water around it so that
you<00:02:16.720> don't<00:02:16.900> end<00:02:17.050> up<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.300> goop<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.600> stuff

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
you don't end up with the goop and stuff

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.610 
you don't end up with the goop and stuff
all<00:02:20.260> over<00:02:20.290> your<00:02:20.770> nail<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:22.200> then<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.410> set

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
there's my water marbling design and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.640 
there's my water marbling design and
then<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.319> let<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.709> dry<00:02:30.010> for<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> few<00:02:30.400> seconds

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.430 

after<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.740> dries<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:41.390> simply<00:02:41.840> took<00:02:42.110> a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
after it dries I just simply took a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.400 
after it dries I just simply took a
glitter<00:02:43.370> polish<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.480> didn't<00:02:44.810> coat<00:02:45.110> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
glitter polish and I didn't coat the

glitter polish and I didn't coat the
whole<00:02:45.620> nail<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:47.950> went<00:02:48.950> across<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.810> pink

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810

pink<00:02:51.800> lines<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:53.660> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.890 

just<00:03:02.640> very<00:03:03.180> simply<00:03:03.540> John<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:09.269> take<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.569> little

just very simply John to take a little

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.170 
just very simply John to take a little
bit<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.230> time<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.099> don't<00:03:11.129> have<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.670> rush<00:03:11.909> or
