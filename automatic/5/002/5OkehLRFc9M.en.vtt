with our card and we're going to start
with<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:44.819> smoky<00:03:45.540> slate<00:03:45.690> let's<00:03:46.049> put<00:03:46.260> some

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
with the smoky slate let's put some

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.129 
with the smoky slate let's put some
dimensionals<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.220> back<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.639> this<00:03:48.139> alright

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
dimensionals on the back of this alright

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.229 
dimensionals on the back of this alright
I've<00:03:49.290> got<00:03:49.319> about<00:03:49.560> three<00:03:49.919> dimensionals<00:03:50.790> there

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
I've got about three dimensionals there

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.800 
I've got about three dimensionals there
we're<00:03:52.079> just<00:03:52.410> going<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.769> press<00:03:53.730> our<00:03:54.060> star<00:03:54.510> right

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
we're just going to press our star right

there here's the white one I went ahead
I<00:03:57.569> put<00:03:57.930> some<00:03:58.169> dimensionals<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.069> one<00:03:59.250> too

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
I put some dimensionals on that one too

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.699 
I put some dimensionals on that one too
I<00:03:59.760> may<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.389> may<00:04:00.720> be<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.900> little<00:04:01.139> heavy<00:04:01.470> with

I may I may be a little heavy with

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.589 
I may I may be a little heavy with
dimensionals<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.849> don't<00:04:03.269> know<00:04:03.359> can<00:04:03.569> you
