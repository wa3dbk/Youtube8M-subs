the black and pink ones actually sold

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
the black and pink ones actually sold
them<00:00:53.489> already<00:00:53.760> when<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> tried<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> make<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
them already when I tried to make a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.250 
them already when I tried to make a
video<00:00:55.170> two<00:00:55.469> days<00:00:55.620> ago<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.190> they're<00:00:56.370> gone<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
video two days ago but they're gone and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
video two days ago but they're gone and
so<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> decent<00:00:59.070> price<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.609> think<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so them for a decent price I think it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
so them for a decent price I think it
was<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> fair<00:01:00.149> price<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> condition<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
was a fair price for the condition it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.810 
was a fair price for the condition it
was<00:01:01.440> in

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
was in

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780 
was in
I<00:01:03.530> also<00:01:04.530> learned<00:01:04.890> something<00:01:05.159> from<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
I also learned something from it as I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490 
I also learned something from it as I
jumped<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> gun<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> offers<00:01:07.320> because

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
jumped the gun on on the offers because

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.990 
jumped the gun on on the offers because
somebody<00:01:07.830> else<00:01:07.890> made<00:01:08.159> an<00:01:08.280> even<00:01:08.580> higher<00:01:08.760> offer

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
somebody else made an even higher offer

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.510 
somebody else made an even higher offer
at<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> letter<00:01:09.869> standpoint<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.740> my

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
at I have the letter standpoint so my

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
at I have the letter standpoint so my
fault<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> Zen's<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.439> just

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
fault on that but the Zen's I'm just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
fault on that but the Zen's I'm just
gonna<00:01:13.740> leave<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> alone<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.490> eBay<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:14.939> let<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
gonna leave it alone on eBay and let it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.719 
gonna leave it alone on eBay and let it
sit<00:01:15.570> where<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.110> unless<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.159> kill<00:01:17.520> or

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
sit where it's at unless I get a kill or

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
sit where it's at unless I get a kill or
offer<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.750> wouldn't<00:01:19.740> expect<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:21.950> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
offer that I wouldn't expect so the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.940 
offer that I wouldn't expect so the
reasoning<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.380> just<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> few<00:01:25.680> things

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
reasoning to it is just a few things

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.910 
reasoning to it is just a few things
since<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> month<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
since it's you know about a month and a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
since it's you know about a month and a
half<00:01:28.950> ago<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.400> would<00:01:29.670> say<00:01:29.909> around<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.479> time

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
half ago I would say around that time

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
half ago I would say around that time
I've<00:01:31.259> met<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.070> many<00:01:32.100> very<00:01:32.549> great<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:37.490> I'd

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
I've met so many very great and I'd

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
I've met so many very great and I'd
rather<00:01:38.729> focus<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.420> time<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:40.350> her<00:01:41.479> then<00:01:42.479> my

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
rather focus my time with her then my

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.950 
rather focus my time with her then my
shoes<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.790> few<00:01:45.180> other<00:01:45.329> things<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.780> still

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
shoes then a few other things I'm still

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.109 
shoes then a few other things I'm still
gonna<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.380> videos<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.040> shoes<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.430> whatnot<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
gonna do videos on shoes and whatnot I

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.660 
gonna do videos on shoes and whatnot I
would<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.840> maybe<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.259> few<00:01:49.530> reviews<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.430> year

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
would have maybe a few reviews this year

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.390 
would have maybe a few reviews this year
but<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.119> many

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
but not as many

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.700 
but not as many
I<00:01:51.430> usually<00:01:52.030> would<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:53.320> don't<00:01:53.500> want<00:01:53.650> to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
I usually would really don't want to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
I usually would really don't want to
spend<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:54.040> time<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.840> money<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:57.100> dudes<00:01:57.490> shoe

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
spend the time and money into dudes shoe

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.920 
spend the time and money into dudes shoe
reviews<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.210> whatnot<00:01:58.450> because<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.780> gets

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
reviews and whatnot because it gets

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.660 
reviews and whatnot because it gets

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.159 
and pink ones really it and partially
the<00:05:49.849> reason<00:05:50.090> why<00:05:50.180> I'm<00:05:50.270> letting<00:05:50.719> go<00:05:50.930> with<00:05:51.020> the

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
the reason why I'm letting go with the

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.570 
the reason why I'm letting go with the
kernel<00:05:51.650> ones<00:05:51.800> that<00:05:51.889> I<00:05:51.919> have<00:05:52.130> is<00:05:52.280> either<00:05:52.460> a

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
kernel ones that I have is either a

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.600 
kernel ones that I have is either a
fitment<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.830> B<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:55.639> like<00:05:56.120> to<00:05:56.210> slimmer<00:05:56.509> look<00:05:56.750> to

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
fitment and B I like to slimmer look to

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.379 
fitment and B I like to slimmer look to
trim<00:05:58.610> down<00:05:58.820> looks<00:05:59.630> like<00:05:59.750> back<00:06:00.050> up<00:06:00.080> shades<00:06:00.530> off

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
trim down looks like back up shades off

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.439 
trim down looks like back up shades off
