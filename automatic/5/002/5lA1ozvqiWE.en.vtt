00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 a question from hector in the sub-20 of 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.779
 USA that participated in the championship of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.309
 concacaf there are four players who 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.120
 could have played with the national team 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.030
 Mexican too 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.230
 and there are many cases of 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.580
 those selections there is some form of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.720
 especially follow up on that guy 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.760
 of players who have the option of 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.160
 play in two selections or up to 3 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.590
 so that talent does not go away from 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.350
 very early in the American team and 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.050
 the question for miguel is if 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.960
 worries that both player not born in 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.660
 mexico may be the holder with 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.820
 the Mexican teams finished we have 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.520
 an important big divide the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.550
 truth is a very good job we have 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.290
 identified several Mexican youth 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.020
 who live here who can form hobby 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.629
 Mexican are in fact 33 to 3 that can 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.070
 alone we have in the generation 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.110
 that was also in jamaica that we were 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.370
 at the level of I have two girls and 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.540
 our united is also salced by 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.909
 example be intensive also already 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.920
 we have identified made sense but 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.330
 not to dinner they are only very good 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.520
 players will be the players this at 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.979
 final account the coaching staff has 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.390
 that deciding who is like that would be better 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.580
 that we believe 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.590
 are in a certain position obviously the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.030
 of marian if there are players left over but 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.070
 him for today what lead to use what 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.650
 what we call the body 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.300
 technical considers 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.250
 is so high that those who are right now 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.650
 when they are alone with all respect is 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.870
 good if it was organized no longer from the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.070
 sub-15 sub-17 we do clinic semi 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.620
 visorÃ­as in california illinois in texas 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.120
 and there are great players extracting to 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.000
 vote i came here in usa 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.520
 well also thing the player who has 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.410
 that will and with the Mexican national team 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.570
 many times you are studying is 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.940
 complicated for the kids and for her or 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.830
 with a given moment they are more 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.810
 convinced to play with the song 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.690
 American but we have done the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.190
 effort to see when question came 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.590
 already of porter in commission and in 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.150
 opposition are already covered and what 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.610
 what we have right now is at a level 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.560
 above what they were seeing in those 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.410
 players in the event that you come and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.100
 uniting to that is the result of all the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.130
 reason 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.500
 that is if yes these players that you 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.020
 names were above those that 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.910
 is calling you the decisions of 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.240
 minors in Mexico in this case the sub 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.490
 20 sergio almaguer then they had 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.590
 up higher that wins the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.200
 pre-Olympic forgiveness the premundial of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.110
 Mexico does it with great solvency what 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.510
 does with a lot of strength physically that 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.400
 decided to call they were for a 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.980
 level above those who could be 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.280
 if it's visuo-versed and spoken with 16 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.830
 the director that sergio arteaga the same 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.890
 raul have been completely visoreando 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.970
 other favors and incongruous case of 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.040
 the ministers and if what are you 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.500
 asking first I am to me then 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.010
 that keep watching games not born in 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.080
 Mexico yes with Mexican descent 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.240
 Our words are in the USA but not 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.520
 born in mexico then what we have 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.890
 prioritized I think what we have 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.890
 shown the selection technicians in 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.920
 Mexico is that he was not born in Mexico or 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.720
 foreigner who is naturalized then be 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.150
 above the level of Mexicans 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.650
 but they are not ruled out either 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.540
 we need to fight with the situation is 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.460
 the great example put us germany 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.620
 winning a world cup with players 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.150
 naturalized then we are not 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.210
 fought with the circumstances and there are 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.700
 any 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.100
 one two or three or five or six in the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.270
 better understand what the best 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.540
 selection and the strongest and the most 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.070
 solid and get to win them and win and 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.050
 look for the results that we too 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.180
 continue and that the fans ask us and 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.860
 our managers then we are not 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.780
 fought with no games that are not 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.150
 doing in Mexico to the contrary while 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.570
 more because you see our selection as 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.570
 for us
