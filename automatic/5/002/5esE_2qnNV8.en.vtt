 Since 1956 he has been playing an important role for Ford since this new 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.930
 milled marketed since a few months 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.070
 maybe even more than his predecessor 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.770
 officially launched at the 2008 Geneva show it was presented 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.360
 the next summer in version connectivity on the occasion of the bp china 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.489
 in the national motor show of london 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.750
 more than thirty years at Ford Fiesta is like good wine 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.039
 during this period 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.860
 she has not stopped improving 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.170
 today she only took three centimeters in length and remain 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.540
 well under the bar of 4 meters 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.760
 it is noticeably lighter 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.980
 aesthetically, kinetic design makes all its effects again with a 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.900
 elegant and sculpted line that exudes a certain expressiveness 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.010
 a finding that also prevails for the cabin that deviates a little from the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.060
 traditional German austerity 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.670
 complete well thought out and of a quality of finish of good quality it releases a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.120
 pleasant atmosphere 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.790
 the accounting box is traditionally flexible for 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 clear up to 1000 cubic decimetres 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.360
 it is precisely the economics econetic version been evoked above case of the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.400
 strip once your magazines corner of the eyes wanted to test for you this 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.020
 week 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.040
 diestar next to and politics on the other hand you have the good outfit of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.840
 keywords 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.120
 I am helping to corner them the format for Europe 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.540
 under the hood 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.910
 you who allow the whole of this world 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.820
 optimized it is fitted with a particulate filter in series and handsets to 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 a transmission whose last reports have been lengthened 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 this mechanics is coupled with other measures to reduce consumption 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.870
 the issue 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.140
 low rolling resistance 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.200
 the fluctuations improved 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.370
 given the low friction and low viscosity aerodynamic abbes 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.789
 these aids or not diminished the suspensions reviewed 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:57.680
 morality 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.920
 SO2 emissions are announced to our customers per kilometer only 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.400
 currently record 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 to these things in perspective 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.230
 the green indicator on the dashboard that invites eco-driving by mentioning 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.689
 copy the German daily change gear ratios 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.290
 it is therefore possible to go under 4 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.599
 without having to deal with a car to his credit 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.599
 since his services 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:32.189
 a set of things that make this city car attractive and respectful of 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.609
 the environment fails to seduce many audiences in November
