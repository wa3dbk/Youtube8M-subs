00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 but gentlemen how is it so good 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.390
 welcome to another video today 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
 I'll show you how to get the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.800
 new special weapon called Venom 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.780
 ex on the new extinction map ok 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.299
 here in night fall there is a special weapon 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.730
 and this one is special weapon is called venom 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.920
 xxi is made or works rather to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.869
 base of scorpion acid 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.800
 practically let's say that as in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.150
 zombies is an acidity is the same idea 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.710
 So, well, let's say it's like 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.359
 I do not know I see it as a shotgun but 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 well suppose it is a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.239
 Shotgun with different cartridges 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.100
 acid is now good ex the problem is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.079
 that only give you four bullets 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 four ammunition cartridges four 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.730
 shots then let's say that the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.739
 main problem here is to get the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.890
 ammunition is not that difficult to get the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.629
 ammunition however as it may take 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.510
 a little bit then good now let's go 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.510
 with that is good next the shots that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.949
 they are like some bags loaded ok and these 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.050
 balls that you win and your not the ones you do not 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.340
 you do nothing you just shoot them 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.800
 they catch and after a certain time 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 they explode they explode and everything that is 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.040
 around like it fills all of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 acid and starts to make them burn 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 I tell you it's the similar effect as to the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.869
 singer in zombies no or as a sprinkler 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.640
 it's like that kind of effect in what cause 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.500
 What is left for them like acid 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 in the skin to the enemies and they're going 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.210
 like eating little by little until 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.190
 die is quite strong and if you have 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.630
 enough damage against rhinos to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.000
 I work a lot and control 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.259
 scorpions too then because as 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.149
 the fact that it's not just like they 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.460
 hit and doing like that is causing them 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.990
 damage as time passes which is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 quite pretty good and good if I 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 I was telling you if you throw these 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 nice acid and do not squeeze any 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 button in the control what is going to happen is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.410
 it's going to be a while and they're going to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.520
 burst these balls 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.649
 now if you want your 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.450
 shots are activated long before 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.030
 Well, all they have to do is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.830
 press the aim button ok you 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 throw your ball and press the button 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.700
 point and let's say it's like a c4 is 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.759
 ok are you 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.770
 diaper with poop ds4 and you tighten obviously 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.079
 I gather to burst it is exactly what 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.080
 same you shoot and squeeze the 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.239
 button to point so that you can 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.680
 you can activate this this little ball as 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.629
 acid I do not say the buttons change from 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
 federico I'm just playing but it is the 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.590
 same button ok is the button to point the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.690
 which serves to detonate these balls of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.120
 acid ok now comes the complicated part 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.860
 how to get good ammunition 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.989
 ammunition is achieved with these eggs 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.930
 that you are seeing those little eggs 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.970
 that you see those eggs out there 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.310
 the aliens give them ok it's not a number 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.989
 specific of aliens good at least me 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.549
 I did not notice any specific number because 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.239
 sometimes I get very fast and sometimes 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.680
 It takes a lot of time these little eggs 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.120
 you are letting go out you kill a 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.980
 scorpion and is an egg but not 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.780
 necessarily a scorpion you can 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.329
 kill I killed a little boy if they give me 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.760
 eggs of killed aliens of asphalt ni 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.900
 give me eggs then it depends as 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.840
 I'm sorry that it's like a little bit 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.569
 mouse not then these eggs that you 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.060
 You get it back to give another 4 of 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.829
 ammunition then well I tell them here 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.210
 let's say the little problem with this 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.280
 weapon is that you can not use it with 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.050
 again ok can not shoot at 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.430
 crazy and always bring her for the fact of 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.550
 that you have to be getting these 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.410
 eggs then but it made up a little 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.660
 because I tell them it's pretty strong and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.570
 those four shots are not nothing 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.790
 despicable besides that the aliens are 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.730
 they release enough eggs that is I do not know 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.260
 as I believe in one at a time in 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.000
 which is the drill and easy to come out 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.520
 like about six eggs then on top is 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.630
 that you have so few suns as 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.910
 but rather find everything is not 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.670
 both the problem now as you get 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.580
 it's good it's good to get to this 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.130
 vena a ex what we have to do is 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.020
 get to area number 3 ok let's go to 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.610
 pass the first two areas that are in 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.200
 the outside and when we get to 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.850
 the third area that is like inside 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.380
 after this building no where 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.460
 would arrive as to the offices and 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.480
 buildings that are like 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.520
 laboratories 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.220
 that's where you can find this 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.140
 vein ex ok what they have to do is go 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.910
 open the hive the first hive that 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.740
 I recommend you always open when 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.600
 reach this area is the middle one 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.970
 so that you can achieve 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.950
 it's super gun ok this special weapon is 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.360
 will find just inside when 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.840
 pass the hive just will be 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.000
 in front 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.070
 and there it is like an exhibition bed and 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.690
 there is another one on the table ok s you are going 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.400
 simply by pressing the button 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.560
 action and it will be automatically 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.720
 you are not going to drop any gun 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.130
 when they have this penalty pex at the moment 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.470
 that you in the garrett are going to put 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.630
 as an extra in your inventory you do not need 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.610
 replace the ball then it's cool 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.010
 because it does not affect you then as a 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.990
 Chinese weapon and I tell them the problem is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.280
 a few bullets , however, I do not know 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.870
 affects how the inventory is not that 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.449
 I'm going to lose my special weapon or gone and 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.610
 best main erna then that 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.979
 It's pretty cool because it's not like a 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.120
 factor that influences is not better not 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.070
 combines that Robert is not always 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.990
 always if the true bait really 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.940
 that will come quite useful now 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.650
 how many can hold this weapon all 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.330
 they can grab him because he is more 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.460
 it's just like and on top of 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.740
 a table and all four characters 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.450
 can go and grab the come upex no no 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.639
 there is no problem that only you 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.889
 attract one you can not go all 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.450
 the four characters grab their weapon 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.310
 special ok there is no problem for 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.169
 that sense and good gentlemen finally 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.360
 what I recommend when you go 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.580
 to use if they are like in a situation 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.879
 very very closed and with many friends 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.120
 and the shit all very very crazy do not we 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.650
 shoot the bullets crazy because 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.840
 remember that the cool effect of this 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.939
 weapon is not only the impact but more 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.520
 well it's like all this acid that 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:34.050
 leave the aliens then if you 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.370
 they start shooting as well as how crazy 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.930
 they are going to spend the bullets and 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.669
 all the aliens are going to have 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.560
 acid then like that they will not be 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.280
 wasting ss let's say effects 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.830
 secondary 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.229
 then they raise it activate it or leave it 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.759
 that activate themselves so that you 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.530
 may cause this effect in the 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.030
 aliens since you start them like no 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.340
 the body is destroyed by acid and 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.960
 shit then later since you see how 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.669
 do not know ones that will be 30 seconds of 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.590
 it catches beings as the effect returns to 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.569
 shoot another and so continue so that 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.009
 you optimize those bullets and not then 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.500
 do not waste it where you get the most 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.360
 profit to these eggs of the aliens 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.949
 and well, gentlemen, that would be all 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.509
 for this video he just wants to teach 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.729
 it's like the weapons where to get them and 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.319
 more or less so that it works so more 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.819
 that nothing for the playstation though 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.800
 Well, the other month will come for us 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.169
 that they know where to find things and 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.350
 how to take advantage is super weapon not 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.480
 So, gentlemen, I take care of myself 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.190
 then good gentlemen take care of me a lot 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.660
 I'm time you know you can follow me 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.940
 twitter and join the facebook group 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.420
 if they are in touch we are 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.420
 goodbye
