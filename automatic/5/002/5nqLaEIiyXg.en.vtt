00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
there's also using water so what a water

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.520 
there's also using water so what a water
also<00:04:31.300> unfortunately<00:04:32.300> can<00:04:32.479> kill<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:32.900> it's<00:04:33.169> you

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
can have a big tsunami and it can really

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.390 
can have a big tsunami and it can really
harm<00:04:35.419> people<00:04:35.840> but<00:04:35.990> also<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.800> save<00:04:37.040> people

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
harm people but also it can save people

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.469 
harm people but also it can save people
so<00:04:37.639> I<00:04:37.669> thought<00:04:38.120> that's<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:38.389> interesting

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.900 

Taiki<00:04:42.479> is<00:04:42.630> so<00:04:42.960> precise<00:04:43.949> that<00:04:44.250> even<00:04:44.669> if<00:04:44.759> your

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
Taiki is so precise that even if your

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.430 
Taiki is so precise that even if your
hands<00:04:45.090> like<00:04:45.270> this<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.720> has<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:46.020> be<00:04:46.110> like<00:04:46.259> this

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
hands like this it has to be like this

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.080 
hands like this it has to be like this
and<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.800> makes<00:04:46.979> like<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.160> big<00:04:47.370> difference<00:04:47.550> so

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
and it makes like a big difference so

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.360 
and it makes like a big difference so
the<00:04:48.900> moves<00:04:49.139> learning<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.680> moves<00:04:49.830> was<00:04:50.130> hard

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
the moves learning the moves was hard

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.640 
the moves learning the moves was hard
but<00:04:50.759> when<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.389> see<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.690> with<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:51.990> water<00:04:52.319> in

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
but when you see it with the water in

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.710 
but when you see it with the water in
the<00:04:52.740> movie<00:04:53.130> it's<00:04:53.370> unreal

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.110 

there<00:04:57.470> is<00:04:57.590> one<00:04:57.770> scene<00:04:58.100> that<00:04:58.160> was<00:04:58.520> challenging

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
there is one scene that was challenging

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.690 
there is one scene that was challenging
but<00:04:59.450> one<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.810> my<00:04:59.990> favorites<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.680> shoot<00:05:00.950> was

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
but one of my favorites to shoot was

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.890 
but one of my favorites to shoot was
that<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.120> katara<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.810> zuko<00:05:02.960> fighting<00:05:03.800> and

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
that it's katara and zuko fighting and

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.510 
that it's katara and zuko fighting and
it's<00:05:05.900> challenging<00:05:06.500> but<00:05:06.800> also<00:05:06.830> one<00:05:07.400> of<00:05:07.430> my

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
it's challenging but also one of my

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.790 
it's challenging but also one of my
favorites<00:05:08.060> because<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:08.780> get<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:09.080> use<00:05:09.200> acting

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800
