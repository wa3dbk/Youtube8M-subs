00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 later we consider important of his career to converse with some 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.200
 colleagues of the international press to know their confines and their points of 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.079
 seen in this process 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.979
 good and what was the end of the Latin American presentation of the new 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.589
 pri 2004 for the claim among others in almost all the parties to which 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:19.710
 I belong extract efe 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.609
 but that is our wish that you have that in the coming years percent 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.820
 is and messi for patients with their magazine and television program consumption 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.730
 while in this type of fairs like this one, how many would be distributed 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.130
 Thank you 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.790
 for everything that I lived 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.750
 I love that we can contract 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.340
 look as soon as the wheat separates from its position as they have told us several 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.740
 fish the car of the future is a car that is handled exactly the same 1 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.650
 without anyone telling you it's a hybrid car you will never notice 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.800
 but with the little screen we can realize that when it seems that we are 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.580
 using an engine 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.360
 normal and current what we are looking for is only electricity in 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.050
 the moments that the field needs then work under both engines 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.410
 at the same time and neither do they feel narvaez is exceptional is a 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.390
 an ordinary car is not a car with a lot of technology that is handled very 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.860
 tasty is a car with good stability 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.930
 having the batteries in the back of the weight is compensated very well 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.180
 We have a family car but with a certain set of characteristics of a 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.540
 sports car with a very good weight balance has very good stability in 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.010
 curve letter feels 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.890
 despite the fast 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.990
 otherwise as I say 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.800
 people who have the feeling that a hybrid car is handled differently than 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.120
 we are going to adopt the leading role 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.240
 I do not think so 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.380
 henry was retarded 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.030
 the government of this country approved April nike inc they live when a 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.270
 official in electricity when it works against your life or when 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.260
 it works zone 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.380
 they will never 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.330
 the title differences 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.150
 look at this vehicle is a little bigger killings more comfortable in the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.110
 inside 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.740
 she had a number of things in the previous version like the screen 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.669
 central that distract 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:14.590
 in that state 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.239
 together recover 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.869
 you may have been able to see 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:21.359
 cicinho that hit the first 500 kilometers of goal 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.669
 so far in the contest 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.939
 and it was basically because everyone who rode edgar renteria of 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:26.650
 start 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.649
 he now works with a broken heart 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.929
 in this success and effectiveness of the system they wore with a small blanket and removed 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.169
 in the center of the carmen percent very subtle 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:43.309
 there are not so many things to be distracted from theft of the car you can see it 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:48.159
 that it's been six or seven years since they first initially designed 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.189
 the second generation to this one has a series of things 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.599
 that comfort and convenience that we find in August triminio 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.939
 basically and that in the previous state model 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.589
 in terms of handling characteristics other than that this one is supposed to be 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:04.829
 faster 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.909
 and more economically basically the other topple it heavier 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:14.249
 this one Carlos carlos martÃ­nez coal was noticed with a certain sporty air despite 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.669
 which is a purely family car 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.849
 I would basically say that life greatly differentiates between one and the other 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:24.679
 in terms of handling is to say that it feels lighter this reacts more 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:25.409
 Quick 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.629
 I bought this sport from claramonte 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.119
 yes it was even in panama we were successful 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:35.099
 with toyota people brought one for tests lillo times an offer for 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.599
 to stay with the office unfortunately the agency decided that this car 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.549
 they will not sell it initially and pleasant and toyota of the office 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.670
 regional in panama also did not want to sell me but insists I did not know why 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.010
 example in a car like this as a bus for the family is a car that 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.409
 in parana to move within the party ranks or not in front of the fort 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.379
 low speed will run the day with electricity 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.989
 so I think that with the type of traffic we have from guatemala in san 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.230
 pedro sula in tegucigalpa here in costa rica and panama is a car that emits for 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.749
 go to this the distance not very long 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.389
 at low speed between traffic is a car that is practically going to 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.520
 be using a very high percentage of time at a level of 100% electric 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.090
 then it will be noticed 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.900
 economy for our pockets and apart let's help actress 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.550
 decontaminate a bit all our cities that all suffer from it 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.540
 problem good nobody something deaf that wants to send to all the people who are 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.800
 seeing in guatemala in honduras yes yes 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.389
 there are still two wheels both in Honduras and in annual average between 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.290
 4 410 grams for the worse 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.910
 again any other test that we do shortly oden project a 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.980
 some time to good time thanks to people who have not studied is no longer 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.889
 falling rain newly created corporation for this show 2011 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.380
 and is that the country remembers other sectors to place their orders of 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.379
 new prius 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.729
 of course you 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.240
 once a riot 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.499
 the works 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.499
 me 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:21.740
 the
