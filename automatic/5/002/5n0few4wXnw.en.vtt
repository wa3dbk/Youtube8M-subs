00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.690
 the other implies last warfare and 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.040
 good and we have another review of the 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.780
 model of weapon on this occasion is a 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.150
 model to teach in a pair of streaming 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.490
 the s 6 cycle that is pretty good the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.139
 true is a model of six cadet 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.330
 but how good you already know many 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.890
 Sometimes it does not have to be the best 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.210
 the best models of weapons be of 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.430
 elite can not be professionals like 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.620
 for the punch is because the cadet is like 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.480
 the people and several others like the 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.830
 single is here all that so in 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.360
 this case we are going to bring a weapon from which 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.860
 they do not talk much I just did the guide and the 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.140
 genesis say I also have pending 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.270
 do it but I wanted to teach is yes 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.560
 because it goes spectacularly well I've 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.570
 left a background job in solar a 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.070
 domain the last piece of the first 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.780
 side that the truth is amazing what 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.910
 who loses to kill is an exaggeration 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.070
 this is a rifle kill very fast and 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.360
 then you have the second piece in which 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.620
 taught the final score of the game 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.510
 and a few girls that is at the end 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.970
 a few casualties that is a game 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.590
 with which he ended up with more work I think 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.690
 as it goes there and what happened in the 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.010
 9,929 points which is a 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.989
 exaggeration also the tired screen 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.489
 with this armitano then if you think 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.960
 let's talk first about it and then 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.180
 I commented a couple of things in first 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.380
 place we have it already on the top right 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.780
 we simply gain decadence and pierre 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.030
 9 damage you already know that you can lose damage 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.610
 it's not always bad, they suddenly sell 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.590
 birds on his rifle is that at the time of 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.780
 remove or add damage many times just 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.700
 affects the last damage with the rifles 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.740
 because in quotes they do not look very 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.750
 harmed because you are going to use it 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.520
 up close and in this case then we get 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.640
 something very positive as is an increase in 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.170
 cadence then it's really profitable 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.180
 change this damage by this cadence like this 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.979
 because in addition the l6 is a sub-machine gun that 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.530
 with the last super union patch 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.000
 precise and practically does not move that 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.740
 it's a submachine gun that is super comfortable 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.119
 shoot still having so much cadence 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.799
 then let's move on with the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.350
 Real external statistics at first 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.330
 place every 32 goes the 48 with extended in 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.880
 second place recharges one with eight the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.830
 normal two with a fast one and one with three 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.540
 the empty although really the cancer of 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.250
 luque this fast weapon with which the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.080
 recharge are reduced enough recharge 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.240
 pretty fast and then we have a 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.740
 very low recoil I actually in this 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.740
 gameplay if you are interested I carry with 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.299
 fast and unstrained game grip 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.070
 but we can also add a loaded 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.629
 so that instead of wearing them 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.759
 example hilt changed these two 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.069
 things for the ribbed for what 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.769
 a little further the damages of four and 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.150
 five bullets then here comes the trick 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.549
 of cadence cadence very much the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.870
 four first bullets thousand 90 bullets by 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.010
 minute that is higher cadence per 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.709
 example hell 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.299
 superior cadence what has the 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.519
 win not to the writing does not arrive but 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.349
 good a very good cadence the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.459
 truth and secondly the following 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.500
 bullets also has an increase of 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.209
 cadence which is 923 which is the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.069
 cadence for example from the mp 11 of the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.959
 goleada let's go and you understand me then 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.280
 if he yesterday is armed to fast fire apart 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.379
 of not moving too much and that the laying 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.299
 in a hard way because good for putting it on 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.099
 no but really if you take it to handle 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.230
 well although the plan was fast not 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.959
 you need to put the hilt 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.579
 so if we put a little bit fast this 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.840
 weapon we give the cadence over 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.069
 the clicker or above the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.409
 knowing what the weapon is that is not 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.849
 I understand shoots very fast and close 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.349
 kills very fast we have to try 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.359
 take not shoot very far because 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.060
 as you are seeing from the 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.150
 flights from scratch 13 meters marta de 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.310
 four bullets between 13 and 19 meters kills 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.079
 of 5 and the passivity is 7 is a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.430
 kind of speakeasy just stay close 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.450
 you have to give a beacon more what 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.639
 happens that it has more shortcomings than 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.660
 triquis and with which, well, that is 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.660
 very comfortable 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.310
 the truth for rus in this temple was 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.990
 very well so a joke that you 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.280
 I recommend that if you are like me 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.260
 you are tired of simple and with the same 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.880
 weapon that always with the m1 that always 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.200
 when I know you can because this weapon 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.030
 that is head and again many people 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.740
 he has it and he distributes that the adjustment is not 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.150
 that the precision and such goes very well 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.310
 for the lack he has is super 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.260
 controllable that's why I that is cadence 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.150
 very precise because so few weapons with 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.860
 so much cadence have this precision of 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.140
 when you shoot it you will see it going very well 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.910
 so well then warned that this 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.130
 week attend the comparison between 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.810
 style option and hell I do not know what 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.310
 day and maybe be a little 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.480
 sick and such and such well there is no 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.330
 a small effort to bring the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.690
 videos and also you have tomorrow 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.100
 surely a streaming of zombies from 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.450
 new map of how they have devoured the 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.520
 tau did not get the infection but 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.040
 from the map so pay attention because what 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.300
 you will have about 5 so in the afternoon 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.620
 I know because as I have that less and that I do not 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.910
 I would arrive at home but new ones I promise 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.200
 nothing what was promised that there will be 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.460
 streaming be attentive when citing because 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.960
 As I say I have to know in the afternoon 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.640
 so to say is start with 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.260
 the direct then it is possible also 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.519
 you have the global subsidiary of chaotic 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.470
 Give me what I said, liked it 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.010
 leave your liked favorites and if 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.010
 you separate 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.010
 Amen
