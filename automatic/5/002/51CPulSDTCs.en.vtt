00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the jittery Gemini planets it's almost

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.889 
the jittery Gemini planets it's almost
like<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.909> absorbed<00:01:51.149> with

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
like we can get so absorbed with

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.740 
like we can get so absorbed with
distractions<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:53.220> things<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.570> don't

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
distractions or things that we don't

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
distractions or things that we don't
we're<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.500> quiet<00:01:55.890> enough<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.520> feel<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.060> magic

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
we're not quiet enough to feel the magic

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
we're not quiet enough to feel the magic
that's<00:01:57.750> sitting<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.950> think

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that's sitting out there and I think

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.469 
that's sitting out there and I think
it's<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.340> important<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.240> we

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it's really important that we

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.139 
it's really important that we
consciously<00:02:01.130> make<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> time<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> space

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
consciously make the time in the space

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.760 
consciously make the time in the space
to<00:02:03.390> allow<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.170> were<00:02:04.290> talking<00:02:04.680> about
