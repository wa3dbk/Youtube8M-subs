00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 today we have a very theme 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.819
 interesting that they have asked us a lot 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.130
 also on social networks and it's like I should 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.540
 Make up my cheekbones depending on the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.540
 proportion that they have 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.000
 we are going to tell you a little about your 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.830
 proportion observe here too 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.880
 commonly the cheekbones are slightly 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.830
 more defined the forehead is elongated the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.240
 maxillary area reaching towards the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.610
 chin also what a face does 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.640
 slightly more elongated 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.200
 let's use a pink blush and the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.570
 technique is very simple for our 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.700
 elongated face let's smile a 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.280
 little if you realize here 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.290
 define the cheekbones we are going to take two 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.930
 little fingers and we will place them next to 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.550
 the corner of your nose starting from that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.859
 point out 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.690
 there you must deposit it if you deposit it 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.969
 more towards the center then the face 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.340
 lose balance you take your product that 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.789
 is the pink course we smile and what 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.320
 Deposits from the center out 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.400
 you can use with the elongated face 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.500
 slightly more satin tones slip 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.160
 brush your way up 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.440
 inclined 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.350
 I would like you to observe very well 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.510
 this tilted up in direction 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.060
 towards the temple towards the birth of 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.860
 hair I do not recommend taking advantage of 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.620
 pink course 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.060
 in high areas or nose and chin because 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.470
 are areas where a woman in a way 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.970
 Natural I do not know are pink or do not blush 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.430
 as it is a pink tone if you consider that 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.350
 you applied too much you take one 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.990
 brush with the same one that applies this 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.540
 powder you apply the product you apply 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.000
 dust out this is going to be the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.380
 color a little more theme remember 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.970
 when we want the relief of the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.400
 cheekbones it is very important that you 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.200
 observe the mirror that you smile and 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.710
 exactly here you are going to locate them 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.570
 this lower area is the cheek is the 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.640
 area that we want to hide and later 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.440
 let's go see more tips now let's 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.350
 see what we have to do with 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.660
 the face redondito those faces that 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.479
 they have slightly more cheeks 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.940
 curved both cheeks this area 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.050
 of the maxilla this area of ​​the forehead and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.380
 let's use more pearls 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.510
 tanning machines 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.560
 we will ask lords to smile one 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.690
 little but very light this area is the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.530
 area of ​​your cheekbones and here they are 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.100
 cheeks 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.400
 unlike expensive that was our 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.110
 slightly more face 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.230
 lengthened with loren what we are going to do 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.100
 here is to apply it under the zone of 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.380
 cheekbone from the temple starting at 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.380
 pin inward 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.200
 also here you will take care of 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.510
 reference these two fingers what 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.060
 we mentioned a moment ago you take two 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.040
 you will apply them to the side of the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.080
 commissure of your nose from there you're not going to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.070
 move more towards the center 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.120
 otherwise you're going to make the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.040
 face had become unbalanced 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.989
 then here you deposit deposits 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.340
 gently concentrate the color from outside 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.340
 towards the center 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.270
 you can apply in this area which is the 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.640
 maxillary and you can apply also on 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.510
 this area that is the front we closed it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.510
 a little here 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.760
 I already saw the long face we saw 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.310
 the redondito face now we go with 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.970
 sushi that will accompany me here to 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.709
 show them how we are going to correct these 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.010
 faces the girls especially that have 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.890
 slightly more defined cheekbones 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.150
 let's take here the same brush we have 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.329
 been working with the brush to 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.799
 for blush and we will also continue 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.209
 working with a bronze flush me 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.040
 they asked around why do you like 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.870
 so much that color is not about if I 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.310
 question like that is a color very 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.859
 neutral I think it's a color that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.970
 every woman elevates very well then what 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.799
 can use with confidence 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.239
 because all women get tanned and 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.579
 at the same time it can also 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.620
 correct and we'll start by applying 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.659
 so if we smile a little bit over there 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.780
 their and they will be able to observe their cheekbones 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.630
 here more defined apply it is going to be 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.669
 very simple, you will lightly mark a 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.810
 triangle from this high area from the 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.910
 cheekbone 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.040
 you are going to mark this area going down 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.310
 slightly down the cheek towards the 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.070
 center 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.260
 also in the form of a triangle 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.230
 in such a way that what we are 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.660
 doing is closing here we are closing 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.120
 a little the area of the cheekbones do that 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.340
 they notice a little less so what 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.380
 you can apply from outside to the center 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.420
 in case your forehead is slightly 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.110
 wider 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.060
 It happens when the face is more 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.940
 triangular they remember we're not 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.500
 talking about faces we talk about 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.760
 characteristics that your face has and 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.230
 this is going to be much easier than 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.230
