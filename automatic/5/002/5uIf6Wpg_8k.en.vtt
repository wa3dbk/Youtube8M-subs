RAM and if you purchase a ram through
Apple<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.320> highway<00:00:43.649> robbery

it's like half the price of what Apple
would<00:01:19.380> charge<00:01:20.060> yeah<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.540> did<00:01:21.840> 32

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
would charge yeah because if I did 32

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.700 
would charge yeah because if I did 32
that<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.790> -<00:01:24.210> 16<00:01:24.600> gigabyte<00:01:25.229> packs<00:01:25.470> which

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that would be - 16 gigabyte packs which

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700 
that would be - 16 gigabyte packs which
would<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.890> $300<00:01:26.580> Apple<00:01:27.210> charges<00:01:27.540> $600<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.619> it's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
would be $300 Apple charges $600 so it's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.140 
would be $300 Apple charges $600 so it's
a<00:01:28.770> quick<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.400> save<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> few<00:01:29.880> hundred

a quick way to just save a few hundred

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
a quick way to just save a few hundred
bucks<00:01:30.180> each<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.079> upgrade<00:01:31.439> yourself

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
bucks each one upgrade yourself

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.649 
bucks each one upgrade yourself
I<00:01:32.220> didn't<00:01:33.180> upgrade<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> full-blown

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
I didn't upgrade you know the full-blown

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
I didn't upgrade you know the full-blown
32<00:01:37.259> gigs<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.040> comes<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.340> eight<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
32 gigs because it comes with eight and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.730 
32 gigs because it comes with eight and
I<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.270> don't<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> take<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.500> what's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I just don't want to take out what's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410 
I just don't want to take out what's
already<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.060> because<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.299> probably

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
already there because I don't probably

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
already there because I don't probably
don't<00:01:42.600> need<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.899> much<00:01:43.259> RAM<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.770> actually<00:01:44.579> was

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
don't need that much RAM I actually was

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.969 
don't need that much RAM I actually was
gonna<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.509> 16<00:01:46.020> gigabytes<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> RAM<00:01:46.770> but

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
gonna just do 16 gigabytes of RAM but

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.940 
gonna just do 16 gigabytes of RAM but
then<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> thought<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.619> if<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.740> bought

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
then I thought about it and if I bought

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.160 
then I thought about it and if I bought
two<00:01:50.189> sticks<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> eight<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.450> would<00:01:51.570> happen<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
two sticks of eight what would happen I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.319 
two sticks of eight what would happen I
know<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.740> would<00:01:52.860> happen<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:54.000> day<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> would

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
know it would happen is one day I would

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
know it would happen is one day I would
probably<00:01:54.570> need<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.470> would<00:01:55.590> kill

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
probably need more and they would kill

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.350 
probably need more and they would kill
me<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.969> Ram<00:01:57.180> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
me to have to like take out Ram I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.020 
me to have to like take out Ram I
purchased<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.140> put<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.560> more<00:01:58.740> RAM<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.490> spent

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
purchased and put in more RAM so I spent

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.330 
purchased and put in more RAM so I spent
a<00:02:00.090> few<00:02:00.210> extra<00:02:00.450> dollars<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:00.990> I'm<00:02:01.170> putting<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
a few extra dollars now I'm putting the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.819 
a few extra dollars now I'm putting the
16<00:02:02.700> gigabytes<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.590> hopefully

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
16 gigabytes in so I think hopefully

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.670 
16 gigabytes in so I think hopefully
that<00:02:05.070> should<00:02:05.219> hold<00:02:05.369> me<00:02:05.520> over<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.060> while

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
that should hold me over for a while

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.059 
that should hold me over for a while
this<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:07.979> RAM<00:02:08.369> slots<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.890> there's<00:02:10.890> so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
this for RAM slots and there's so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.640 
this for RAM slots and there's so
applications<00:02:11.730> -<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.540> stick<00:02:12.810> Rams

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
applications - for stick Rams

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.699 
applications - for stick Rams
for<00:02:14.459> gigabyte<00:02:15.090> sticks<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.690> RAM<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.290> I'm

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
for gigabyte sticks of RAM and then I'm

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.440 
for gigabyte sticks of RAM and then I'm
gonna<00:02:16.890> add<00:02:17.069> another<00:02:17.250> two<00:02:17.640> eight<00:02:18.000> gigabyte

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
gonna add another two eight gigabyte

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.350 
gonna add another two eight gigabyte
sticks<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.129> take<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> look<00:02:20.640> at<00:02:21.060> where

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
sticks so if you take a look at where

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.759 
sticks so if you take a look at where
the<00:02:21.450> plug<00:02:21.750> plugs<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.790> zoom<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.739> you<00:02:25.739> see

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
the plug plugs in you zoom in you see

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.369 
the plug plugs in you zoom in you see
that<00:02:26.069> little<00:02:26.250> notch<00:02:26.430> above<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.060> plug<00:02:27.379> that

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
that little notch above the plug that

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.130 
that little notch above the plug that
you<00:02:28.470> need<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.709> push<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:30.390> causes<00:02:30.720> this

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
you need to push in and that causes this

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.000 
you need to push in and that causes this
little<00:02:31.440> hatch<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> back<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.480> pop<00:02:33.659> open<00:02:34.010> now

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
little hatch in the back to pop open now

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.770 
little hatch in the back to pop open now
I've<00:02:35.430> tried<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:35.849> this<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.090> my<00:02:36.180> finger<00:02:36.540> but

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
I've tried to do this with my finger but

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.780 
I've tried to do this with my finger but
it<00:02:36.989> just<00:02:37.170> doesn't<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.799> can't<00:02:38.040> push<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.579> in<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it just doesn't I can't push it in and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.910 
it just doesn't I can't push it in and
off<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.900> fingers<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> little<00:02:40.440> too<00:02:40.680> big<00:02:40.890> so

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
off I can fingers a little too big so

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.369 
off I can fingers a little too big so
you<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.610> get<00:02:41.760> something<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.390> help<00:02:42.540> when<00:02:43.290> I

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
you have to get something to help when I

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.270 
you have to get something to help when I
use<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> knife<00:02:43.799> like<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.129> back<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:45.060> spoon

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
use the knife like a back of a spoon

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.780 
use the knife like a back of a spoon
it's<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.459> too<00:02:47.730> sharp<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:50.099> fits<00:02:50.430> right<00:02:50.609> in

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
it's not too sharp and it fits right in

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460 
it's not too sharp and it fits right in
there<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.299> I'm<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:51.569> gonna<00:02:51.750> quickly<00:02:52.019> go<00:02:52.170> in

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
there so I'm just gonna quickly go in

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.360 
there so I'm just gonna quickly go in
and<00:02:53.599> pop<00:02:54.599> that<00:02:55.700> push<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.849> in<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:58.680> pops

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and pop that push it in like this pops

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.080 
and pop that push it in like this pops
open<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> pull<00:03:01.530> out<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> back<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
open so pull out the back here and

open so pull out the back here and
you'll<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.569> we<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:04.560> zoom<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.599> bit

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
you'll see we just zoom in a little bit

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.089 
you'll see we just zoom in a little bit
see<00:03:08.940> those<00:03:09.060> two<00:03:09.329> white<00:03:09.599> levers<00:03:10.079> well<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.859> pull

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
those out and it kind of unfastens the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.430 
those out and it kind of unfastens the
the<00:03:15.030> memory<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.629> you<00:03:15.750> could<00:03:15.930> kind<00:03:16.349> of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
the memory so that you could kind of

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.500 
the memory so that you could kind of
install<00:03:16.799> some<00:03:16.980> more<00:03:17.159> so<00:03:17.400> I'm<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> set

the<00:03:51.329> one<00:03:52.169> stick<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.560> RAM<00:03:52.709> looks<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.160> oops<00:03:53.699> and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
the one stick of RAM looks like oops and

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.360 
the one stick of RAM looks like oops and
if<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.959> look<00:03:55.199> on<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.680> bottom<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.190> RAM

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
if you look on the bottom of the RAM

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.619 
if you look on the bottom of the RAM
there's<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:58.190> little<00:03:59.190> notch<00:03:59.459> which<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.389> off

think that's good now slide in the lever
is<00:05:51.360> back<00:05:52.850> back<00:05:53.850> in<00:05:54.030> action<00:05:54.770> good<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.980> go<00:05:56.190> check

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
is back back in action good to go check

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.720 
is back back in action good to go check
out<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.420> computer<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:57.960> make<00:05:58.050> sure<00:05:58.320> it<00:05:58.440> has<00:05:58.730> 24

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
out the computer and make sure it has 24

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.710 
out the computer and make sure it has 24
gigs<00:05:59.910> of<00:06:00.060> memory<00:06:00.090> all<00:06:00.810> right<00:06:02.300> push<00:06:03.300> that<00:06:03.480> back

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
gigs of memory all right push that back

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.350 
gigs of memory all right push that back
in<00:06:03.960> that's<00:06:04.950> it<00:06:05.160> all<00:06:05.730> right<00:06:05.820> it<00:06:05.970> was<00:06:06.060> a<00:06:06.090> little

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
in that's it all right it was a little

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.520 
in that's it all right it was a little
harder<00:06:06.570> than<00:06:06.600> I<00:06:06.780> thought<00:06:06.960> to<00:06:07.020> get<00:06:07.230> that<00:06:07.410> in

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
harder than I thought to get that in

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.220 
harder than I thought to get that in
there<00:06:07.740> but<00:06:08.100> you<00:06:08.700> could<00:06:08.850> see<00:06:09.090> it<00:06:09.390> does<00:06:09.780> have<00:06:09.810> the

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
there but you could see it does have the

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.780 
there but you could see it does have the
full<00:06:10.470> 24<00:06:11.400> gigabytes<00:06:12.740> to<00:06:13.740> 4<00:06:14.070> gigabytes<00:06:14.220> sticks

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
full 24 gigabytes to 4 gigabytes sticks

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.000 
full 24 gigabytes to 4 gigabytes sticks
which<00:06:15.030> came<00:06:15.270> with<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.450> computer<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.260> then<00:06:16.530> 2

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
which came with the computer and then 2

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.120 
which came with the computer and then 2
gigabytes<00:06:17.730> sticks<00:06:18.000> I<00:06:18.120> just<00:06:18.300> added<00:06:18.800> alright<00:06:19.800> I
