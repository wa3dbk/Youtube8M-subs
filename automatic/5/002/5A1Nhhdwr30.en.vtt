the 3d printers the level of detail that

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.740 
the 3d printers the level of detail that
can<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> little

something<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> owl<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.420> printed<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
something like the owl that we printed I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.350

think<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.320> about<00:01:46.500> 2.6<00:01:47.340> meters<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.149> that's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
