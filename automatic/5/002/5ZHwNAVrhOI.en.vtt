okay<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:00.900> I've<00:00:01.530> got<00:00:01.740> one<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.220> these<00:00:02.310> pac-man

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay so I've got one of these pac-man

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.700 
okay so I've got one of these pac-man
plug-and-play<00:00:03.419> systems<00:00:04.290> you've<00:00:04.500> probably

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
plug-and-play systems you've probably

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.039 
plug-and-play systems you've probably
seen<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.069> million<00:00:05.310> ease<00:00:05.580> before<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.180> don't<00:00:06.870> know

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
seen a million ease before I don't know

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.040 
seen a million ease before I don't know
if<00:00:07.440> it's<00:00:07.710> on<00:00:08.189> just<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.030> newer<00:00:09.210> model<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.840> this

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
if it's on just a newer model of this

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.280 
if it's on just a newer model of this
and<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:11.550> doesn't<00:00:11.969> work<00:00:12.120> every<00:00:12.450> time<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.929> can

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and it doesn't work every time but I can

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.010 
and it doesn't work every time but I can
get<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.740> into<00:00:13.980> debug<00:00:14.610> mode<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.240> you're<00:00:15.750> about

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
get it into debug mode as you're about

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.019 
get it into debug mode as you're about
to<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> want<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> do<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> just

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
to see you what you want to do is just

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.290 
to see you what you want to do is just
start<00:00:18.630> spinning<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.170> joy<00:00:19.380> stick<00:00:19.439> around<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
start spinning the joy stick around and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.410 
start spinning the joy stick around and
pressing<00:00:21.300> these<00:00:21.420> two<00:00:21.689> buttons<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.640> it<00:00:23.640> should

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
pressing these two buttons and it should

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.089 
pressing these two buttons and it should
work<00:00:24.449> well<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.230> said<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.619> every<00:00:25.890> time

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
work well like I said not every time

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.009 
work well like I said not every time
you're<00:00:26.340> gonna<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.789> play<00:00:27.480> around<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
you're gonna have to play around with it

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.150 
you're gonna have to play around with it
a<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.250> but<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.670> should<00:00:30.060> start<00:00:30.570> working<00:00:34.160> see

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
a little but it should start working see

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.810 
a little but it should start working see
there<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.450> debug<00:00:36.750> mode<00:00:37.550> you're<00:00:38.550> able<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
there it is in debug mode you're able to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.130 
there it is in debug mode you're able to
see<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.590> lots<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.800> tests<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.870> then

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
see there's lots of tests and then

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
see there's lots of tests and then
there's<00:00:44.780> hardware<00:00:45.780> test<00:00:46.079> mode<00:00:46.430> save<00:00:47.430> data

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
there's hardware test mode save data

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.760 
there's hardware test mode save data
test<00:00:48.260> you've<00:00:49.260> got<00:00:49.649> color<00:00:50.489> tests<00:00:51.440> music<00:00:52.440> test

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
test you've got color tests music test

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.689 
test you've got color tests music test
I'll<00:00:53.370> give<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:54.239> example<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.809> packing<00:00:55.230> pal<00:00:58.699> C

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I'll give an example from packing pal C

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.959 
I'll give an example from packing pal C
or<00:01:00.680> they've<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:02.129> Junior<00:01:02.550> pac-man

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
or they've actually got Junior pac-man

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
or they've actually got Junior pac-man
sounds<00:01:03.420> which<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.690> weird<00:01:03.960> cuz<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.409> even

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
sounds which is weird cuz it's not even

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:24.950 
sounds which is weird cuz it's not even
on<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> compilation<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:23.430> color<00:01:24.420> tests

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
on this compilation and then color tests

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.219 
on this compilation and then color tests
a<00:01:25.140> bunch<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.689> sleep<00:01:27.990> mode

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
a bunch of them and then a sleep mode

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.630 
a bunch of them and then a sleep mode
test<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.549> gonna<00:01:29.820> skip<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:31.640> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
test but I'm gonna skip it because it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.960 
test but I'm gonna skip it because it
just<00:01:32.909> goes<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.450> sleep<00:01:33.689> mode<00:01:33.720> nothing<00:01:34.320> else

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
just goes into sleep mode nothing else

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
just goes into sleep mode nothing else
and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.240> after<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.140> plays<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> normal

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and then after that it plays is normal

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
and then after that it plays is normal
but<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.520> save<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.390> screens<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
but to save time from all the screens I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.690 
but to save time from all the screens I
will<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.920> turn<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:43.340> look<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:45.420> plays

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
will just turn it on and look it plays

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
will just turn it on and look it plays
well<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> minute<00:01:48.659> or<00:01:49.530> two<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.170> goes

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
well in a minute or two and so it goes

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:04.010 
well in a minute or two and so it goes
through<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.430> intro

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.659 

see<00:02:06.420> still<00:02:07.420> works
