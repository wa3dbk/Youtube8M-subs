number<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.740> what<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.820> know

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
number one for what they do and you know

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
number one for what they do and you know

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it's a really good thing to get so it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
it's a really good thing to get so it's
not<00:01:47.159> exactly<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.450> sales<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
not exactly you know like sales like I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.999 
not exactly you know like sales like I
gotta<00:01:49.710> sell<00:01:51.049> grandpa<00:01:52.049> diapers<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:52.950> know

gotta sell grandpa diapers I don't know

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.380 
gotta sell grandpa diapers I don't know
it's<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.909> something<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it's just you know it's something that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's just you know it's something that
actually<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.229> works<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
actually you know works and it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
actually you know works and it's
actually<00:01:56.159> useful<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.450> general

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
actually useful for the general

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
actually useful for the general
population<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:59.009> something<00:01:59.280> that's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
population so that's something that's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.800 
population so that's something that's
easy<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.939> sell<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.719> need<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.350> so

easy to sell because you need it and so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.260 
easy to sell because you need it and so
