Ramadan and the second one is because

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.540 
Ramadan and the second one is because
like<00:01:25.810> some<00:01:26.140> people<00:01:26.440> talk<00:01:26.680> about<00:01:26.710> us<00:01:27.160> because

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
like some people talk about us because

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
we wear short skirts and all I don't

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.010 
we wear short skirts and all I don't
think<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.190> it<00:01:30.280> really<00:01:30.460> gets<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.880> us<00:01:31.150> because<00:01:31.450> if

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
think so it really gets to us because if

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.920 
think so it really gets to us because if
we<00:01:32.080> are<00:01:32.770> scared<00:01:33.220> about<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:33.940> we<00:01:34.240> wouldn't

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
we are scared about that we wouldn't

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.920 
we are scared about that we wouldn't
join<00:01:35.290> so<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.370> think<00:01:36.850> we<00:01:37.330> know<00:01:37.510> what<00:01:37.750> we<00:01:37.900> are

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
join so I think we know what we are

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.730 
join so I think we know what we are
doing<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:39.780> really<00:01:40.780> want<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.020> continue<00:01:41.200> cheer

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
doing I really want to continue cheer

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.580 
doing I really want to continue cheer
because<00:01:41.890> I've<00:01:42.190> been<00:01:42.400> doing<00:01:42.550> it<00:01:42.790> for<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.270> long

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
because I've been doing it for so long

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310 
because I've been doing it for so long
so<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.980> think<00:01:45.250> I'm<00:01:45.820> just<00:01:46.030> going<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.270> go<00:01:46.450> till<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
so I think I'm just going to go till the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.530 
so I think I'm just going to go till the
