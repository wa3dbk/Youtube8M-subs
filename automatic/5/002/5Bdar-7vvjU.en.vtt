and<00:01:39.300> crossings<00:01:39.750> whatever<00:01:40.470> drive<00:01:40.710> around

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and crossings whatever drive around

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
and crossings whatever drive around
afterwards<00:01:41.430> I'll<00:01:41.610> watch<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.270> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
afterwards I'll watch the way that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
afterwards I'll watch the way that
you're<00:01:42.570> using<00:01:42.720> these<00:01:42.960> signalling<00:01:43.380> also<00:01:44.100> how

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you're using these signalling also how

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.740 
you're using these signalling also how
you<00:01:44.340> deal<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.640> pedestrian<00:01:45.180> crossings<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you deal with pedestrian crossings and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.870 
you deal with pedestrian crossings and
if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.530> need<00:01:46.680> any<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.100> help<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.490> course<00:01:47.730> I

alright<00:02:11.469> well<00:02:11.620> let's<00:02:11.950> start<00:02:12.189> off<00:02:12.280> by<00:02:12.340> asking

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
alright well let's start off by asking

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.399 
alright well let's start off by asking
you<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.849> few<00:02:13.030> things<00:02:13.209> about<00:02:13.390> signalling<00:02:14.260> them

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
you a few things about signalling them

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.099 
you a few things about signalling them
what<00:02:15.189> different<00:02:15.489> types<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.969> signaling<00:02:16.420> can

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
what different types of signaling can

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.239 
what different types of signaling can
you<00:02:17.290> think<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.769> were<00:02:20.859> wanting<00:02:21.219> to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.249 
you think of if you were wanting to

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.309 
you think of if you were wanting to
signal<00:02:21.670> left<00:02:21.999> which<00:02:22.359> way<00:02:22.540> would<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.810> stock<00:02:23.109> go

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
signal left which way would the stock go

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.309 
signal left which way would the stock go
down<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.730> would<00:02:24.849> go<00:02:24.969> down<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.329> indicate<00:02:26.170> it

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
down it would go down and indicate it

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.240 
down it would go down and indicate it
right

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
right

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.300 
right
what<00:02:27.639> other<00:02:27.790> form<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.389> you<00:02:28.450> think<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:32.310> hand

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
what other form can you think of hand

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.020 
what other form can you think of hand
signals<00:02:33.849> yes<00:02:34.569> have<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.780> been<00:02:34.959> saw<00:02:35.109> those<00:02:36.030> well

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
signals yes have you been saw those well

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.190 
signals yes have you been saw those well
yes<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:38.139> did<00:02:38.260> go<00:02:38.439> through<00:02:38.650> them<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.840> back<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.109> a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
yes we did go through them the back of a

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.349 
yes we did go through them the back of a
car<00:02:41.409> oh<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.769> brake<00:02:42.519> lights<00:02:42.790> they're<00:02:43.030> coming

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
car oh you brake lights they're coming

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.520 
car oh you brake lights they're coming
aren't<00:02:43.510> they<00:02:43.659> yeah<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.930> think<00:02:44.109> anymore

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
aren't they yeah you think anymore

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.720 
aren't they yeah you think anymore
loads<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.519> different<00:02:45.639> ones<00:02:45.939> on<00:02:46.090> them<00:02:47.730> reverse

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
loads of different ones on them reverse

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.339 
loads of different ones on them reverse
lights<00:02:48.969> well<00:02:49.239> done<00:02:51.629> what<00:02:52.629> if<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> broke<00:02:53.139> down

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
lights well done what if you broke down

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.000 
lights well done what if you broke down
oh<00:02:53.620> yes<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.579> has<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.329> one<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:55.659> mind<00:02:55.840> okay<00:02:56.799> all

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
oh yes you has it one in mind okay all

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.199 
oh yes you has it one in mind okay all
right<00:02:57.159> so<00:02:57.310> what's<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.609> routine<00:02:57.939> that<00:02:58.090> you're

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
right so what's the routine that you're

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.530 
right so what's the routine that you're
gonna<00:02:58.359> use<00:02:58.449> that<00:02:58.840> signals<00:02:59.260> forms<00:02:59.650> part<00:02:59.889> of<00:03:00.159> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
gonna use that signals forms part of the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.420 
gonna use that signals forms part of the
MS<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.689> the<00:03:01.900> mirror<00:03:02.109> signal<00:03:02.379> maneuver<00:03:03.069> great

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
MS and the mirror signal maneuver great

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.099 
MS and the mirror signal maneuver great
so<00:03:03.669> before<00:03:03.939> we<00:03:04.030> use<00:03:04.180> any<00:03:04.359> signal<00:03:04.719> then<00:03:04.840> we<00:03:04.870> must

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
so before we use any signal then we must

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.330 
so before we use any signal then we must
make<00:03:05.230> sure<00:03:05.290> with<00:03:05.500> check<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.889> mirrors<00:03:06.129> first

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
make sure with check and mirrors first

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.860 
make sure with check and mirrors first
of<00:03:06.549> all<00:03:06.639> what<00:03:07.090> we're<00:03:07.180> gonna<00:03:07.269> do<00:03:07.449> now<00:03:07.599> is<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:07.780> want

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
of all what we're gonna do now is I want

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.569 
of all what we're gonna do now is I want
you<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.019> wind<00:03:08.260> down<00:03:08.319> your<00:03:08.530> window<00:03:08.799> for<00:03:09.010> me<00:03:09.189> okay

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
you to wind down your window for me okay

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.339 
you to wind down your window for me okay
and<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.819> want<00:03:09.969> you<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.060> demonstrate<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.810> me<00:03:10.930> what

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
and I want you to demonstrate to me what

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.569 
and I want you to demonstrate to me what
you've<00:03:11.469> remembered<00:03:11.650> about<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:12.040> arm<00:03:12.189> signal

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
you've remembered about the arm signal

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.509 
you've remembered about the arm signal
so<00:03:12.760> what<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.389> do<00:03:13.510> first<00:03:13.719> of<00:03:13.930> all<00:03:14.049> is<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.709> show<00:03:15.370> me

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
so what to do first of all is to show me

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.219 
so what to do first of all is to show me
the<00:03:15.639> signal<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.419> you<00:03:16.599> would<00:03:16.750> use<00:03:17.019> if<00:03:17.199> you

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
the signal that you would use if you

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.689 
the signal that you would use if you
wanted<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.769> say<00:03:17.979> I'm<00:03:18.069> slowing<00:03:18.400> down<00:03:18.519> a

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
wanted to say I'm slowing down a

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:24.240 
wanted to say I'm slowing down a
reducing<00:03:19.299> speed<00:03:21.479> yeah<00:03:22.479> that's<00:03:22.750> fine<00:03:22.989> just<00:03:23.259> one

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
reducing speed yeah that's fine just one

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.580 
reducing speed yeah that's fine just one
thing<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.519> want<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.729> to<00:03:24.759> remember<00:03:24.939> though

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
thing I want you to remember though

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.979 
thing I want you to remember though
before<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.949> put<00:03:27.129> your<00:03:27.220> arm<00:03:27.370> out<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.579> window

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
