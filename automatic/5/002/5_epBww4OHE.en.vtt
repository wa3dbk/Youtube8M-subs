blurry<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.640> well<00:01:50.909> color<00:01:51.479> reproduction<00:01:52.079> still

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
blurry as well color reproduction still

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.280 
blurry as well color reproduction still
remains<00:01:52.860> excellent<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.049> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
remains excellent I can see right here a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.249 
remains excellent I can see right here a
sharp<00:01:55.740> image<00:01:56.119> good<00:01:57.119> color<00:01:57.360> reproduction<00:01:57.810> here

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.620 

again<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:02.310> image<00:02:02.610> does<00:02:02.850> appear<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.270> little

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
again the image does appear a little

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.800 
again the image does appear a little
fuzzy<00:02:04.579> there's<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> bit<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> over<00:02:06.240> processing

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
fuzzy there's a bit of over processing

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.770 
fuzzy there's a bit of over processing
here<00:02:07.099> now<00:02:08.099> as<00:02:08.310> I've<00:02:08.550> said<00:02:08.759> auto<00:02:09.030> focus<00:02:09.450> does

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
here now as I've said auto focus does

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.020 
here now as I've said auto focus does
take<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.229> little<00:02:10.410> bit<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> time<00:02:10.950> tap<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.849> focus

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
take a little bit of time tap to focus

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.260 
take a little bit of time tap to focus
is<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.720> better

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
is your better

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.810 
is your better
and<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.200> see<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.920> fuzziness<00:02:15.280> in

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
and you can see a bit of fuzziness in

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.180 
and you can see a bit of fuzziness in
the<00:02:16.120> final<00:02:16.450> result<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:17.830> not

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
the final result as well so this is not

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.440 
the final result as well so this is not
the<00:02:18.340> sharpest<00:02:18.820> camera

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the sharpest camera

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.270 
the sharpest camera
moreover<00:02:20.110> low-light<00:02:20.620> performance<00:02:20.650> is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
moreover low-light performance is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.580 
moreover low-light performance is
actually<00:02:21.400> not<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.120> great<00:02:22.360> there's<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.230> lot<00:02:23.470> of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
actually not that great there's a lot of

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.050 
actually not that great there's a lot of

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
even with the flash the images do turn

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.090 
even with the flash the images do turn
out<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.820> little<00:02:28.240> blurry<00:02:28.680> I'll<00:02:29.680> just<00:02:29.920> show

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
out to be a little blurry I'll just show

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.540 
out to be a little blurry I'll just show
you<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.310> video<00:02:31.110> I'm<00:02:32.110> trying<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.740> focus<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.370> on

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
you a video I'm trying to focus in on

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.180 
you a video I'm trying to focus in on
this<00:02:33.970> flop<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:35.110> once<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.560> focus<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.130> image

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
this flop so once in focus the image

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.510 
this flop so once in focus the image
actually<00:02:36.550> becomes<00:02:37.120> sharper<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:39.160> audio

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
actually becomes sharper the audio

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.340 
actually becomes sharper the audio
quality<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.360> phone<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.720> pretty<00:02:40.870> great<00:02:41.170> as

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.350 
quality on this phone is pretty great as
well<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.280> front-facing<00:02:42.640> camera<00:02:43.330> is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
well and the front-facing camera is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.960 
well and the front-facing camera is
surprisingly<00:02:44.050> very<00:02:44.350> robust<00:02:44.770> -<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.820> can

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
surprisingly very robust - as you can

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.550 
surprisingly very robust - as you can
see<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.210> does<00:02:49.450> take<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> little<00:02:49.930> bit<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.170> time<00:02:50.380> to

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
see it does take a little bit of time to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.500 
see it does take a little bit of time to
focus<00:02:50.740> in<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.860> overall<00:02:57.280> good<00:02:57.670> video<00:02:57.970> capture
