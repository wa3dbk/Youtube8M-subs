get<00:04:08.680> 50<00:04:09.420> actually<00:04:10.420> if<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.510> fail<00:04:10.780> more<00:04:11.049> than

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
get 50 actually if you fail more than

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.550 
get 50 actually if you fail more than
four<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.340> think<00:04:12.879> because<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.329> fail<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.319> I<00:04:14.409> got

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
four I think because I fail to and I got

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.740 
four I think because I fail to and I got
52<00:04:15.099> so<00:04:15.489> if<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:17.169> fail<00:04:17.470> more<00:04:17.829> than<00:04:18.150> four<00:04:19.150> times<00:04:19.180> I

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
52 so if you fail more than four times I

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.689 
52 so if you fail more than four times I
said<00:04:20.019> just<00:04:20.229> start<00:04:20.470> over<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:22.919> if<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.130> ward<00:04:24.370> is

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
said just start over and if the ward is

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.610 
said just start over and if the ward is
giving<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.270> trouble<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.870> it<00:04:26.020> says<00:04:26.259> failed

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
giving you trouble like it says failed

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.029 
giving you trouble like it says failed
if<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.370> fail<00:04:27.699> to<00:04:27.729> do<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.240> twice<00:04:28.620> then<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.800> just

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
if you fail to do it twice then I just

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.570 
if you fail to do it twice then I just
say<00:04:30.389> play<00:04:31.389> it<00:04:31.419> safe<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.080> try<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.590> unlock<00:04:33.520> it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
say play it safe and try to unlock it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.930 
say play it safe and try to unlock it
yourself<00:04:34.060> because<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.599> might<00:04:34.800> end<00:04:35.800> anyway<00:04:36.729> I'm

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
yourself because it might end anyway I'm

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.850 
yourself because it might end anyway I'm

because I had 27 Ward's dispelled before
I'd<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:17.949> started<00:05:18.370> this<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.820> there<00:05:18.940> you<00:05:19.060> go

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
yeah it's pretty easy I found this very

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.620 
yeah it's pretty easy I found this very
useful<00:05:35.890> so<00:05:36.730> I<00:05:36.760> figured<00:05:36.790> I'd<00:05:37.180> share<00:05:37.420> with

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630

useful so I figured I'd share with
everybody<00:05:39.240> case<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.390> didn't<00:05:40.540> find<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.930> yes

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
everybody case you didn't find it yes

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
you're gonna do it or you know you

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.650 
you're gonna do it or you know you
really<00:06:02.890> don't<00:06:03.160> need<00:06:03.280> to<00:06:03.340> do<00:06:03.520> this<00:06:03.670> but<00:06:04.420> this

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
really don't need to do this but this

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.450 
really don't need to do this but this
tactic<00:06:05.350> or<00:06:05.500> you<00:06:05.590> could<00:06:05.710> just<00:06:05.740> go<00:06:06.010> around<00:06:06.130> and

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
tactic or you could just go around and

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.980 
tactic or you could just go around and
dispel<00:06:06.790> things<00:06:07.060> but<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.330> might<00:06:07.510> take<00:06:07.540> a<00:06:07.780> little

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
dispel things but it might take a little

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.840 
dispel things but it might take a little
while<00:06:08.110> if<00:06:09.040> you<00:06:09.160> want<00:06:09.310> to<00:06:09.370> just<00:06:09.460> get<00:06:09.580> out<00:06:09.730> of<00:06:09.790> the

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
while if you want to just get out of the

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.370 
while if you want to just get out of the
way<00:06:10.030> just<00:06:10.060> do<00:06:10.420> this<00:06:10.630> I<00:06:13.110> don't<00:06:14.110> know<00:06:14.170> if<00:06:14.260> this

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
way just do this I don't know if this

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.230 
way just do this I don't know if this
quest<00:06:14.710> shows<00:06:14.980> up<00:06:15.130> at<00:06:15.370> a<00:06:15.400> certain<00:06:15.700> time<00:06:15.940> or<00:06:16.000> not
