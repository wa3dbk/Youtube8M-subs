00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.439
 m 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.580
 limay you a little 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 it created a system that could 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.740
 alert when a green plant is missing 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.170
 of water so I explain 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.059
 it is very simple in fact with just 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 the aid is connected in series with a power supply 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.610
 in 5 volts 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.829
 and then if I have two little sons have 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.089
 that we could say probes and the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.400
 principle is that when there is contact 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.230
 not necessarily asserts the circuit and 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.160
 the led lights up so now I 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.379
 offers you to do a little 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 experience with a small container 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.659
 filled with water as everyone knows the water and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.059
 conducting water but in 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.879
 do not do that much so we see that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.739
 when I may 30 two are in the water the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.090
 led light up but very little 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 less than when both sons get 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.190
 touch had to put back that one and there one 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.399
 sees that actually when it's in 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.780
 out of the water and the hues and when 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.119
 I find it in the water she salutes or 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.930
 very slightly 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.390
 so what's fun also to get 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.179
 to realize is that here I even 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.210
 small container but filled with very water 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.210
 salted 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.360
 so according to the same principle 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.119
 it will be wet and well there will be contact 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.860
 because the earth is going to be conductive 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.909
 actually to the wok the led lights up and 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.330
 then when the earth will be dry and well 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.100
 the earth will not be conductive is 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.200
 so the current will not be able to pass 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.530
 so for me what I want is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.210
 the opposite of this montage does not have that 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.250
 I want is when the earth is 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 dry male help lights 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.140
 unlike now where she is 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.780
 extinguished 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.130
 and when the earth will be wet and well I 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.560
 want it to be turned off unlike 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.120
 to now that she salutes so I'm going 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.940
 show you the little diagram that goes 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.350
 allow to do that on circuit then 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.930
 here is the outline of my circuit 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.480
 I'm feeding it in 5 volts 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.950
 continuous here to my two little ones are that 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.330
 I'm going to plant in the earth more or 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.569
 less deeply depending on the type of 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.000
 plant that we maintain 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.519
 I added in series with this strap 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.170
 to a green led that the goal is not 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.959
 that she even salutes and will serve to settle 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.269
 the sensitivity of the montage because 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.940
 according to the degree of humidity of the earth 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.560
 will more or less switch so I have 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.690
 a letter that allows me to adjust to little 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.400
 near sensitivity 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.470
 so when the earth is going to be saying will 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.290
 conductive because wet the current 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.579
 will be able to pass so I will polarize the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.870
 base of my transistor trying a 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.110
 little tension is there will be the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.209
 voltage with a current that will allow a 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.190
 current to pass between collectors and 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.459
 emitters of this transistor this dropped from 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.510
 547 but seeing that having current that goes 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.000
 to get there that means I see a 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.799
 voltage that will occur at the input of 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:19.760
 the door not because I use a 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:23.840
 chip ttl 74.04 uses a chip ttl 74 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.140
 04 could be so from a door a 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.650
 jug at port holding and so when 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.269
 here it will be wet it will be conductive 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.799
 saw that I had a tension there the current 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.780
 can go to the transistor level 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.820
 between collector transmitters I will have a 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.650
 voltage in front door as if we 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.910
 carries a jug I should have 0 vote I 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.860
 do not pay attention to the exit doors 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.519
 so I could not go to him 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.550
 comfortable here 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.790
 so when it gets wet 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.620
 there she is tired not and tote and when 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.450
 it will be that here the current does not 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.620
 will no longer be able to pass I will not have 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.989
 voltages at the base of your 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.909
 transistors the current will therefore be unable 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.569
 not pass here I would not pay attention to 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.580
 front door 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.500
 so we know the importance neither timely 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.909
 jug exit to the door 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.620
 exit I will have a little near the case of 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.640
 vote and with my flight case 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.110
 I could have turned on my help and so where 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.360
 it can be a buzzer so we can at the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.830
 place of me I put a led and a 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.229
 resistance ans and rex that as I have to 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.060
 about the volts frame and that I use 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.289
 a red led that works which is 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.479
 planned to work roughly in 2 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.240
 volts and 30 me loses it needs that 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.880
 I add in series a resistance 2 with 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.130
 the formula a gallery I know here 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.990
 that I have here I caddy volts here I 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.190
 about 2 volts exchanged it wants 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.690
 that here I must have voting 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.510
 so the two flights tonnage of the rebels 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.560
 to I seek my resistance and as I 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.890
 know that they have to incur in 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.320
 30 million father the one that goes into 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.430
 this segment there my resistance I want 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.740
 that it also be crossed by a 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.560
 current May 30 at the pm I position no 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.539
 0.03 we lose so that with the 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.380
 used formula gallery my dad was tied 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:00.169
 to the 2/02 03 equal to 66 as to little 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:05.479
 it means that I have a 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:07.220
 resistance about 66 o otherwise we 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.750
 can put in the place of the led and 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.520
 the resistance we can put a buzzer 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.199
 35 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.629
 or else we can put help in 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.599
 syria and no resistance no it was 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.979
 very important is to add to 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.159
 level of the door entrance to the door 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.729
 1 jug a resistance that is connected 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.960
 at least of the circuit so as to have a 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.970
 clean signal at the door 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.289
 of entry because otherwise the toggle at 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.819
 level of a door a worm is not done 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.949
 as it should be because when there is no 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.270
 current there and no current the neva 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.710
 normally do not have too much where we go 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.080
 see 0 volts there we do not have calves 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.729
 wolton to 1.6 so putting a 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.460
 resistance that is connected at least that 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.770
 allows us to lower the tension here from 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.680
 so that the inversion is done 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.030
 properly at the level of the exit 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.750
 and then the track was she of course 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.319
 must feed it 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.139
 here at most of the circuit is here at least 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:58.120
 of the circuit the editing done that does it 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.680
 on the box terminals here I have my two 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.819
 little seconds and so the principle 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.419
 is that when they are not in 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.979
 contact 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.770
 the current does not pass between the two 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.680
 probes the led lights up and cases 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.509
 contacts she is 7 1 and so what 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.509
 will take the contact or neo of the earth 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.500
 deposition of flowers or green plants 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.870
 is that the earth will be more or less 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.400
 wet and the earth is in low limit a 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.479
 leads therefore to serve to make contact or 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.550
 so now look concretely 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.060
 what it represents in a pot of 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.979
 green plants 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.610
 here are the two probes that are planted 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:34.060
 in the earth when the earth is wet 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.009
 the current flows when interest dries 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.409
 the current is no longer circulating and that 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.020
 is to open the circuit is the least 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:42.190
 activate a buzzer one can imagine otherwise 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.639
 we can also put LEDs that 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:49.690
 light up the same editing in version 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:51.840
 help when interest dries that's 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.840
 clear 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.699
 so then it's up to everyone to find the 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.380
 good setting because the probes 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.240
 we can more or less push them into 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.610
 the earth one can choose to put them 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.199
 just on the surface or so to return them 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.099
 more deeply if the plant needs 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:08.139
 to be moist rather in the bottom of skin or 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:10.330
 rather above the pot there in 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.279
 the occurrence the mount is not very 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.569
 aesthetic but we can imagine doing 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:16.270
 something much smaller 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.560
 Sudanese Council and by squeezing it into a 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.650
 small box that takes up no space and 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.509
 which is much more discreet 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.690
 and rather than just doing 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.919
 alumina help or whistle a buzzer on 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.289
 can imagine that it activates a 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.639
 automatic watering device so 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:30.169
 it's a bit more complicated to 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:32.330
 elaborate but we can very well 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:33.530
 consider if I ever have the time and 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.070
 I can do five days 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.070
 will present
