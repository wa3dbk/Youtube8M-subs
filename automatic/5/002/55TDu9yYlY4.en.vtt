00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.849
 I'll show you now no one on critics flabby 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.970
 I do not need anything to laugh about that in the beginning 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.239
 but only a piece to award 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.689
 Captain Crochet Hook 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.689
 under the title not to a march to the title 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.269
 that lasts so long 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.509
 how to approach the required stitches 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.509
 which I need 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.270
 that's done with it 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 Nemec have more contested 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
 retracted 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.010
 through the chain 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 my slush record me 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.410
 it-manager in Thimphu not 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 but then just a little trick 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.299
 actually very good if you put a lot of stitches on the motto mouth 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.360
 because here you can see that I do not twist that 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.050
 if Hungary has to pick up clear chains 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.580
 Dirk Diekmann that looks like looks like the Kreuth a blow 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.200
 3 in the lead 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 on the left soon 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.990
 and on the right side 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.110
 the right mix with Robin Dutt 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.410
 Vladimir unsecured every case 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.800
 alone 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.490
 for meters of webs in all points the programmers seem to work 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 have them approved Trier 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.670
 Even the Chairman and Day screws can be practical 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.690
 then I write then my legs have kinect or l 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 yes and then the knitting needle Connor and knitting needles 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.730
 say 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.730
 Suddenly I heard the last march on de Grenoble 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.880
 and how can you relax completely through and against the stitches 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.739
 Halftime is much easier and much faster 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.349
 through the night and what customer data 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.589
 Half-ridge knitting needles 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.219
 around 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 if I'm not at the CAS then finally the needle just 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.419
 forward through 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.809
 much faster when you look 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.109
 I went in 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.679
 forward through 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.689
 got done with a knitting needle break 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.479
 Of course, there are also times before the stitches and I'm done 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.929
 that was Dr on the idea of ​​the stop
