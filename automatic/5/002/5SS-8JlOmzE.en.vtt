00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
now let's get on and do this video shall

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
now let's get on and do this video shall
we<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.200> quick<00:01:34.500> little<00:01:34.829> test<00:01:35.369> here

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
we it's gonna be quick little test here

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
we it's gonna be quick little test here
of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> speed<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.110> two<00:01:37.409> quad-core

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
of the speed of these two quad-core

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.330 
of the speed of these two quad-core
machines<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.840> we're<00:01:40.560> gonna<00:01:40.650> first<00:01:40.950> power

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
machines and we're gonna first power

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.880 
machines and we're gonna first power
them<00:01:41.579> off<00:01:43.430> ok<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:45.890> power

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
them off ok there we go that's power

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.359 
them off ok there we go that's power
mouth

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.940 

so<00:01:54.939> it<00:01:55.030> seems<00:01:55.179> like<00:01:55.359> the<00:01:55.509> spurs<00:01:55.750> e<00:01:56.079> powers<00:01:56.770> off

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
so it seems like the spurs e powers off

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.830 
so it seems like the spurs e powers off
quicker<00:01:57.399> there<00:01:57.759> okay

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
quicker there okay

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:32.170 
quicker there okay
now<00:01:59.679> let's<00:02:00.460> fire<00:02:01.390> them<00:02:01.539> on<00:02:03.359> ready<00:02:04.380> set<00:02:05.380> go

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.710 

okay<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.510> go

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
okay there we go

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.830 
okay there we go
it's<00:02:34.050> definitely<00:02:34.530> seem<00:02:34.769> there<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.970> LG

stuff<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:08.160> was<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.610> my<00:03:08.760> quick<00:03:09.060> little

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
stuff this was just my quick little

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.199 
stuff this was just my quick little
which<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.380> foster<00:03:10.799> video<00:03:11.040> pretty<00:03:11.790> interesting

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
which is foster video pretty interesting

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.080 
which is foster video pretty interesting
though<00:03:12.420> pretty<00:03:13.230> weird<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.670> actually<00:03:14.849> is

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
though pretty weird that it actually is

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
though pretty weird that it actually is
faster<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.510> think<00:03:15.870> because<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.769> can<00:03:16.890> get<00:03:17.040> it

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
faster I think because you can get it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.339 
faster I think because you can get it
for<00:03:17.340> almost<00:03:17.489> half<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.329> price<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.170> that's

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
for almost half the price so that's

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.229 
for almost half the price so that's
something<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.160> should<00:03:20.310> look<00:03:20.340> more<00:03:20.790> into

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
something that you should look more into

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.850 
something that you should look more into
