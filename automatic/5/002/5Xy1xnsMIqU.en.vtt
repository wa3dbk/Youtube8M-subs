that way I can spend more time engaging
with<00:05:10.760> my<00:05:10.880> subject<00:05:11.330> huge<00:05:12.020> part<00:05:12.350> of<00:05:12.410> what<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.560> do

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
with my subject huge part of what I do

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.290 
with my subject huge part of what I do
is<00:05:12.860> taking<00:05:13.130> pictures<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.490> people<00:05:13.820> or<00:05:14.000> taking

courses at people is spending time with
people<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.940> I<00:05:17.000> think<00:05:17.030> that's<00:05:17.330> a<00:05:17.450> huge<00:05:17.900> part<00:05:18.350> of

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
people and I think that's a huge part of

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.710 
people and I think that's a huge part of
the<00:05:18.680> whole<00:05:18.860> photography<00:05:19.070> process<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.150> seeing

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
the whole photography process and seeing

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.570 
the whole photography process and seeing
where<00:05:20.990> this<00:05:21.110> doors<00:05:21.410> can<00:05:21.710> open<00:05:21.800> you<00:05:22.190> can<00:05:22.310> open

where this doors can open you can open
up<00:05:22.640> so<00:05:22.940> many<00:05:22.970> different<00:05:23.510> doors<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:24.050> mean<00:05:24.290> it's
