and<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.859> starfish<00:00:08.630> em7<00:00:10.309> j00<00:00:11.309> PB<00:00:11.790> now

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
and this is the starfish em7 j00 PB now

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.230 
and this is the starfish em7 j00 PB now
this<00:00:12.799> particular<00:00:13.799> variation<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
this particular variation is it with a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.490 
this particular variation is it with a
black<00:00:15.599> face<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.379> well<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.630> Arabic<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.380> have

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
black face as well as the Arabic we have

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.560 
black face as well as the Arabic we have
one<00:00:19.680> other<00:00:19.920> variation<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:21.119> believe<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
one other variation I believe that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.880 
one other variation I believe that
doesn't<00:00:21.720> use<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.350> Arabic<00:00:22.859> 12<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.609> 6<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:25.710> is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
doesn't use the Arabic 12 and 6 this is

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
doesn't use the Arabic 12 and 6 this is
a<00:00:25.920> 15<00:00:26.340> minute<00:00:26.580> case<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.840> always<00:00:28.199> up

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
a 15 minute case so you can always up

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.950 
a 15 minute case so you can always up
okay<00:00:29.039> L<00:00:29.220> will<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.640> workable<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.510> about<00:00:30.689> any

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
okay L will be workable just about any

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
okay L will be workable just about any
sort<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> daily<00:00:31.590> activity<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.369> may<00:00:32.610> have

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
sort of daily activity that you may have

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.139 
sort of daily activity that you may have
a<00:00:33.440> one<00:00:34.440> very<00:00:34.739> nice<00:00:35.010> thing<00:00:35.340> about<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.850> watch

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
a one very nice thing about this watch

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.660 
a one very nice thing about this watch
is<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.780> fully<00:00:37.230> mechanical<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:38.430> I'm

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
is that it's fully mechanical now I'm

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.540 
is that it's fully mechanical now I'm
going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> explain<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:40.010> much<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.430> in

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
going to explain that much more in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
going to explain that much more in
detail<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.270> bit<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> want<00:00:43.920> you

watch where you actually have to walk
where<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> wind<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.699> it's<00:00:53.699> got

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
where you have to wind it so it's got

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.930 
where you have to wind it so it's got
what<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.660> nice<00:00:54.870> retro<00:00:55.820> technology<00:00:56.820> and

the dial you'll notice the hands as well
as<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> our<00:01:02.280> indices<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.329> luminous<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
as the our indices are luminous and the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
as the our indices are luminous and the
function<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.820> movement<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.390> day<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
function of this movement is day and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
function of this movement is day and
date<00:01:07.850> own<00:01:08.850> okay<00:01:09.180> let's<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> look<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
date own okay let's take a look at the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
date own okay let's take a look at the
leather<00:01:10.140> band<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.680> you'll<00:01:10.830> notice<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.159> uses

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
leather band and you'll notice that uses

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.140 
leather band and you'll notice that uses
this<00:01:11.729> nice<00:01:12.890> leather<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.490> black<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.030> got

this nice leather it's black it's got
this<00:01:15.240> nice<00:01:15.450> black<00:01:15.720> stitch<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> side<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this nice black stitch on the side so it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.679 
this nice black stitch on the side so it
looks<00:01:18.180> very<00:01:18.320> reasonable<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.689> spoi

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
looks very reasonable with the very spoi

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
looks very reasonable with the very spoi
design<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.890> dial

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
design of the of the dial

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
design of the of the dial
alright<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.350> mentioned<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
alright as I mentioned this is a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
alright as I mentioned this is a
mechanical<00:01:26.100> watch<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> take<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> look

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
mechanical watch and if you take a look

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
mechanical watch and if you take a look
at<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> back<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.920> cut<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.700> watch

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
at the back of your cut of your watch

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.179 
at the back of your cut of your watch
you'll<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.780> exhibition<00:01:31.170> case<00:01:31.650> bag<00:01:31.950> which

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you'll see an exhibition case bag which

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.310 
you'll see an exhibition case bag which
means<00:01:32.460> there's<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> piece<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> glass<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
means there's a piece of glass that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.010 
means there's a piece of glass that
exposes<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.250> mechanism<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:36.600> let's<00:01:36.780> take<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
exposes your mechanism now let's take a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350 
exposes your mechanism now let's take a
little<00:01:37.229> closer<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.400> mechanism<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
little closer look at that mechanism and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.210 
little closer look at that mechanism and
you'll<00:01:39.450> notice<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.979> absolutely

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you'll notice that there are absolutely

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.149 
you'll notice that there are absolutely
no<00:01:41.939> batteries<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:44.670> design<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:46.159> from

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
no batteries this is this design is from

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.370 
no batteries this is this design is from

are still around folks okay so just so
you<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> adjust<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you know this is how you adjust the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
you know this is how you adjust the
watch<00:01:54.600> use<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> crown<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:55.770> pulseless

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
watch use the crown that's pulseless

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.539 
watch use the crown that's pulseless
first<00:01:56.430> position<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.869> adjust<00:01:58.549> date

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
first position and we can adjust date

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.460 
first position and we can adjust date
and<00:01:59.850> day<00:02:00.000> okay

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
and day okay
