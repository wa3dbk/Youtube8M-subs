00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 but actually he has is very fast 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 equally so we will not have 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.090
 the excuse now plays pawn lady like 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.090
 You see has a very varied repertoire 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.970
 so play fast at the opening 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.460
 very important 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.150
 this we already played the other day 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.020
 in a blitz 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.020
 and I do not know if 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.650
 so I'm not sure how the theory was going 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.230
 here we have to move on from these cases 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.660
 I'm going to eat this pawn to see what happens to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.239
 let that put into play f-8 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.680
 eat the piece you can but I 'm not 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.630
 sure how will the theory of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.080
 mache 5 radiation 8 bishop by efe 4 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.730
 peron per lady f 5 and it gets complicated 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.730
 quite the truth then I do not know 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 4 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.330
 I was thinking in reality I would think 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.570
 that he had lost the connection or something 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.070
 but 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.070
 I was really thinking 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.590
 it's so dangerous the position I have to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.369
 concentrate a bit because this is very 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.369
 small his 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.190
 6 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.200
 He passed 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.090
 and I think I can eat with sticking in the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.590
 market so as not to open the column of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.310
 where then you can also enter 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.310
 h5 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.970
 efe 8 now try to play 17 4 I have to 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.250
 5 and good I have exposure a few good 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.260
 reasonable 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.910
 bit of more than always help 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.770
 but the position is certainly very 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780
 dangerous with the king opened as 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.730
 we have then can play head 3 the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.360
 rock embargo is very easy to play with 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.190
 white in this position 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.720
 but good is the position we have not 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.720
 there is no more history 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.159
 we try to eat we give them maybe with 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.159
 lady of 8 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.320
 of everything 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.430
 If we change the give good changes 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.230
 but we do not have a couple of bishops 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.900
 recover the pawn 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.240
 but well I do not know if to recover but 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.480
 we have 4 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.720
 then I would like to focus but now 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.400
 it is not possible unfortunately 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.830
 good is going to try to take out the pieces that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.380
 sometimes 6 king of 7 play fast too 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.930
 because this is starting to 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.930
 it's starting to get complicated already 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.010
 I'm going to make the squares fast 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.860
 well give the finite 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 to recover the pawn finally 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.299
 after a lot of effort but I have a 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.299
 very good position with black 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.010
 because I do not know very well how are we going to 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.069
 progress 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.650
 maybe with this move g4 I would like 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.140
 but I hope you have seen 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.880
 the idea 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.310
 mg 485 maybe in a moment it does not let me 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.160
 neither go 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.910
 we are doing it very fierce we are not 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.910
 playing truth 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:53.310
 job 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.310
 we have made 10 bad moves in a row 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.400
 so if we do some good one day 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.370
 we have 20 seconds of advantage 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.320
 So that 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.760
 can serve us a little 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.800
 but go to the position is not 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.800
 precisely enviable 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.840
 I played to make the truth 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.670
 a lot of plan we do not have but we're 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.670
 relatively solid is true 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.260
 tables well reasonable tables with quality 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.580
 of less also true that we had 10 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.760
 seconds ahead maybe that's why 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.760
