00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:27.550 

I<00:01:13.760> tried<00:01:14.360> away<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.600> stone<00:01:14.930> flat<00:01:15.500> on<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.550> bevel

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.130 

I<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.440> down

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
I just go down

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.610 
I just go down
I<00:01:57.229> blade<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.960> could<00:01:59.960> feel<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.380> our

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
I blade I could feel one of our

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.250 
I blade I could feel one of our
encounter<00:02:01.220> imperfections<00:02:02.150> in<00:02:02.750> my<00:02:02.900> bevel

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
encounter imperfections in my bevel

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.030 
encounter imperfections in my bevel
right<00:02:03.729> here<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.930> feel<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.229> little<00:02:06.380> bit<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.890> a

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
right here can feel a little bit of a

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.330 
right here can feel a little bit of a
rough<00:02:07.280> spot<00:02:07.550> where<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.530> side<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:10.100> my

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
rough spot where the the side of my

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.670 
rough spot where the the side of my
stone<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:12.730> brushing<00:02:13.730> up<00:02:13.850> against<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.360> nick<00:02:14.680> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
stone is brushing up against a nick you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.670 
stone is brushing up against a nick you
know<00:02:16.150> where<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.270> bleed<00:02:17.510> isn't<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.380> little

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
know where the bleed isn't as a little

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.580 
know where the bleed isn't as a little
wave<00:02:18.860> ant<00:02:19.240> where<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.300> got<00:02:20.420> pushed<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.870> one<00:02:20.900> side

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.470 

so<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.160> stone<00:02:28.430> really<00:02:28.760> allows<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.270> to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.330 

perfect<00:02:32.480> your<00:02:32.660> bevel

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340
