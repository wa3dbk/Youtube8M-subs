00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.830
 hi hello girls we start again with 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.670
 the halloween videos and I extract a 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.650
 video of a clown let's start 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.660
 applying glue sticks on the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.880
 eyebrows to fix them and then 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.880
 we apply right on top of them 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.100
 and we repeat the action 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.620
 now let's take white base and the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.159
 let's spread with our sponge 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.539
 all over the face until you have a base 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.539
 white uniform 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.560
 then we are going to apply bar 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.680
 of glue again on the eyebrows and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.680
 white paint to cover them even more 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.900
 with black pencil let's draw us 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.010
 very pronounced eyebrows 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.010
 to give them shape 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.350
 ah 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.350
 we will apply black shadow on both 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.580
 eyes on both the mobile eyelid and 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.580
 the tabs below 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.700
 do not forget to blur everything 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.000
 with a little black shadow and a brush 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.430
 fine let's draw it in the wrinkles of 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.359
 the forehead blur and apply base 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.359
 white above 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.720
 now we are going to have the directions of the 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.720
 eyes with the black pencil and fill them 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.400
 when we already have them drawn we are going to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.000
 blur some parts of the edges 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.000
 with the finger 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.580
 the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.150
 now we will apply a little shadow 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.840
 blue imitating the colors of the eyes 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.840
 Clown 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.449
 with red lipstick we are going to 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.449
 paint us the nose of a clown 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.590
 and with black pencil we are going to draw the 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.590
 outline of that nose 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.860
 with black shadow we are going to mark our 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.320
 nostrils and we're going to 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.490
 blur the line with which we have 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.490
 contoured the nose 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.500
 with black pencil let's dedicate ourselves the 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.500
 mouth 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.030
 when it comes to leaving your teeth remember 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.700
 that you have to make them by pieces never 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.700
 together and you have to slow down between them 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
 i 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.370
 Y 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.879
 with red pencil, let's fill it in 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.310
 once configured and then we're going to 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.479
 apply red lipstick so that 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.479
 be more intense 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.840
 at the time of drawing us the wounds 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.640
 let's make a base with black shadow 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.640
 and blur the very well 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.350
 we will apply in the sponge blood 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.690
 artificial and we will extend it on 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.690
 black shadow giving a little touch 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.289
 very carefully with the 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.550
 artificial blood tube we are going to 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:59.020
 drop us a drop and let it fall 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.020
 about our garment 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.560
 with a finer brush we will give the 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.460
 last touches to our wounds with 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.460
 artificial blood 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.930
 with the brush to blur and the shadow 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:33.260
 black we're going to stain our neck 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:35.180
 making a kind of bruises 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.400
 and finally we are going to give the last 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.470
 touches to our wounds and finally 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.690
 we will have finished our makeup 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:45.220
 clown for halloween I hope you have 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.220
