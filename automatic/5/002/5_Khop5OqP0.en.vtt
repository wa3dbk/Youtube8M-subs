00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.259 

so<00:00:09.440> now<00:00:09.589> I<00:00:09.620> have<00:00:09.860> been<00:00:10.039> through<00:00:10.369> prototyping

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
so now I have been through prototyping

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.279 
so now I have been through prototyping
using<00:00:12.079> a<00:00:12.200> six<00:00:12.589> millimeter<00:00:12.950> MDF<00:00:13.940> board<00:00:14.389> to<00:00:15.139> make

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
using a six millimeter MDF board to make

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.700 
using a six millimeter MDF board to make
all<00:00:15.499> the<00:00:15.679> parts<00:00:16.039> for<00:00:16.219> the<00:00:16.309> orcs<00:00:17.380> and<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:18.560> have

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
all the parts for the orcs and I have

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.529 
all the parts for the orcs and I have
found<00:00:18.949> where<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:19.189> wanted<00:00:19.580> extra<00:00:19.730> holes<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:20.359> so

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
found where I wanted extra holes and so

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.609 
found where I wanted extra holes and so
on<00:00:20.689> then<00:00:21.410> as<00:00:21.589> I<00:00:21.949> mentioned<00:00:22.369> I<00:00:22.550> went<00:00:22.730> on<00:00:23.619> having

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
on then as I mentioned I went on having

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.239 
on then as I mentioned I went on having
all<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.009> parts<00:00:25.400> cut<00:00:25.669> in<00:00:26.019> aluminum<00:00:27.019> yes<00:00:27.980> some

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
all the parts cut in aluminum yes some

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.779 
all the parts cut in aluminum yes some
of<00:00:28.279> them

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
of them

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.760 
of them
the<00:00:29.269> rest<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:29.689> right<00:00:30.589> now<00:00:30.800> mounted<00:00:32.200> but<00:00:33.200> there

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
the rest is right now mounted but there

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.000 
the rest is right now mounted but there
were<00:00:33.890> some<00:00:34.250> glitches<00:00:34.850> in<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.570> coating<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.800> the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
were some glitches in the coating so the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.640 
were some glitches in the coating so the
guy<00:00:37.190> that<00:00:37.490> caught<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.510> he<00:00:38.660> offered<00:00:38.810> me<00:00:39.170> two

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
guy that caught it he offered me two

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.520 
guy that caught it he offered me two
also<00:00:39.950> caught<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.490> whole<00:00:40.790> thing<00:00:41.090> in<00:00:41.870> stainless

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
also caught the whole thing in stainless

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.310 
also caught the whole thing in stainless
steel<00:00:42.710> which<00:00:43.550> due<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.270> low<00:00:44.870> heat

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
steel which due to the low heat

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.790 
steel which due to the low heat
conductivity<00:00:46.220> is<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.300> parameter<00:00:47.900> to<00:00:48.140> do<00:00:48.590> lace

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
conductivity is a parameter to do lace

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.740 
conductivity is a parameter to do lace
according<00:00:49.340> him<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:51.370> just<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.520> say<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.360> then<00:00:53.630> I

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
according him so just to say and then I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.340 
according him so just to say and then I
can<00:00:54.020> show<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.650> pile<00:00:54.860> here<00:00:55.870> laid<00:00:56.870> out<00:00:57.050> in<00:00:57.260> a

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
can show you the pile here laid out in a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.480 
can show you the pile here laid out in a
second

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
second

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.970 
second
so<00:00:59.060> here<00:00:59.240> all<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.690> parts<00:01:00.050> caught<00:01:00.680> in

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
so here all the parts caught in

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.730 
so here all the parts caught in
stainless<00:01:01.580> steel<00:01:02.950> it's<00:01:03.950> a<00:01:04.239> four<00:01:05.239> millimeter

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
stainless steel it's a four millimeter

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.920 
stainless steel it's a four millimeter
stainless<00:01:06.740> steel<00:01:07.870> so<00:01:08.980> looks<00:01:10.300> very<00:01:11.300> nice<00:01:11.480> and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
stainless steel so looks very nice and

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.960 
stainless steel so looks very nice and
sorry<00:01:14.930> for<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.290> understated<00:01:16.130> picture<00:01:16.610> here

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
sorry for the understated picture here

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.560 
sorry for the understated picture here
let's<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:17.870> see<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:18.710> look<00:01:19.610> at<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.120> scale

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
let's just see if we look at the scale

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.530 
let's just see if we look at the scale
here<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.880> we<00:01:22.880> take<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:23.680> identical<00:01:24.680> parts<00:01:25.540> so

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
here so we take this identical parts so

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.520 
here so we take this identical parts so
then<00:01:26.780> this<00:01:27.020> part<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.470> 102<00:01:28.190> grams<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.870> six

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
then this part is 102 grams in six

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.270 
then this part is 102 grams in six
millimeter<00:01:30.979> aluminum<00:01:32.440> this<00:01:33.440> one<00:01:33.970> is<00:01:36.280> 201

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
millimeter aluminum this one is 201

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.240 
millimeter aluminum this one is 201
grams<00:01:38.210> for<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.600> same<00:01:39.070> part

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
grams for the same part

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.730 
grams for the same part
so<00:01:40.729> they're<00:01:40.880> somewhat<00:01:41.570> more<00:01:41.990> heavy<00:01:42.350> I<00:01:42.530> think

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
so they're somewhat more heavy I think

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.300 
so they're somewhat more heavy I think
that<00:01:43.340> three<00:01:43.940> millimeter

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
that three millimeter

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.460 
that three millimeter
stainless<00:01:46.310> would<00:01:47.299> be<00:01:48.159> sufficient<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:50.470> these

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
stainless would be sufficient and these

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.910 
stainless would be sufficient and these
are<00:01:51.650> extremely<00:01:52.159> stiff<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:54.260> think<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.680> cannot

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
are extremely stiff so I think I cannot

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.240 
are extremely stiff so I think I cannot
get<00:01:55.220> pretty<00:01:55.940> good<00:01:56.030> results<00:01:56.409> using<00:01:57.409> these<00:01:57.950> I'll

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
get pretty good results using these I'll

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.770 
get pretty good results using these I'll
just<00:01:58.460> put<00:01:58.700> them<00:01:58.820> up<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.210> can<00:01:59.360> see<00:01:59.540> all<00:01:59.690> of

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
just put them up so you can see all of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.950 
just put them up so you can see all of
them<00:02:00.159> okay<00:02:01.159> from<00:02:01.430> some<00:02:01.729> distance<00:02:02.210> yeah<00:02:02.630> all

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
them okay from some distance yeah all

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.500 
them okay from some distance yeah all
the<00:02:03.110> parts

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
the parts

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.260 
the parts
in<00:02:04.900> stainless<00:02:05.320> steel<00:02:07.260> record<00:02:08.260> enclosure

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
in stainless steel record enclosure

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.000 
in stainless steel record enclosure
while<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.330> have<00:02:10.570> done<00:02:10.750> here<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.980> have

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
while I have done here is I have

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.880 
while I have done here is I have
enlarged<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:13.150> one<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.720> fits<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.080> bigger

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
enlarged this one so it fits the bigger

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.790 
enlarged this one so it fits the bigger
name<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.340> motor<00:02:15.660> added<00:02:16.660> some<00:02:16.870> holes<00:02:17.110> put<00:02:17.620> in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
name of motor added some holes put in

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.270 
name of motor added some holes put in
the<00:02:17.920> loop<00:02:18.130> for<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.490> proximity<00:02:19.210> switch<00:02:20.280> added

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
the loop for the proximity switch added

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.820 
the loop for the proximity switch added
a<00:02:21.370> hole<00:02:21.580> here<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.570> pull<00:02:23.020> some<00:02:23.230> wires<00:02:23.410> through

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
a hole here to pull some wires through

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.300 
a hole here to pull some wires through
and<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:30.250> have<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:31.330> inner<00:02:31.540> plates<00:02:32.310> added

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
and you will have the inner plates added

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.970 
and you will have the inner plates added
two<00:02:33.460> holes<00:02:33.700> here<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:34.750> order<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.320> be<00:02:35.560> able<00:02:35.680> to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
two holes here in order to be able to

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.890 
two holes here in order to be able to
mount<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.920> tighten<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.100> motor<00:02:39.900> because

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
mount and tighten the motor because

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.870 
mount and tighten the motor because
otherwise<00:02:41.590> it's<00:02:41.920> pretty<00:02:42.040> difficult<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.730> get

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
otherwise it's pretty difficult to get

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.660 
otherwise it's pretty difficult to get
to<00:02:43.630> it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
to it

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.720 
to it
and<00:02:45.940> then<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.240> have<00:02:46.630> made<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:48.040> corner<00:02:48.340> brackets

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
and then I have made the corner brackets

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.550 
and then I have made the corner brackets
here<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.210> it<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.870> said<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:50.290> made<00:02:50.710> to

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
here and it is said I just made to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.030 
here and it is said I just made to
ordinary<00:02:53.560> once<00:02:54.300> again<00:02:55.300> slightly<00:02:55.780> changed<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
ordinary once again slightly changed the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.260 
ordinary once again slightly changed the
design<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.460> them<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.000> then<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.080> loop<00:03:00.040> on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
design of them and then to the loop on

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.080 
design of them and then to the loop on
in<00:03:01.270> order<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.690> mount<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.140> proximity<00:03:02.650> switch<00:03:03.190> in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
in order to mount a proximity switch in

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.220 
in order to mount a proximity switch in
the<00:03:04.660> y-direction<00:03:04.810> at<00:03:05.680> each<00:03:06.010> end<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.990> is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the y-direction at each end so this is

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.130 
the y-direction at each end so this is
basically<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.890> whole<00:03:08.920> set<00:03:09.340> here<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:10.570> maybe<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
basically the whole set here and maybe I

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.740 
basically the whole set here and maybe I
just<00:03:11.350> need<00:03:11.650> not<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.310> mention<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:12.760> one<00:03:12.970> this

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
just need not to mention this one this

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.380 
just need not to mention this one this
is<00:03:14.020> essentially<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.910> stacked<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.240> make

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
is essentially just stacked you can make

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.170 
is essentially just stacked you can make
put<00:03:17.200> in<00:03:17.320> some<00:03:17.530> threads<00:03:17.860> here<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.490> screws<00:03:18.850> and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
put in some threads here and screws and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.070 
put in some threads here and screws and
then<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.370> center<00:03:21.370> finding<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
then you have a center finding and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.860 
then you have a center finding and
corner<00:03:23.590> finding<00:03:24.010> -<00:03:24.570> out<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.630> stainless<00:03:26.170> also
