00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
hey guys this is a preview today we'll

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.610 
hey guys this is a preview today we'll
be<00:00:12.179> taking<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.690> look<00:00:12.809> at<00:00:12.929> another<00:00:13.080> case<00:00:13.410> from

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
be taking a look at another case from

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.369 
be taking a look at another case from
ballistic<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> SG<00:00:15.389> case<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.960> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
ballistic this is the SG case and this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.859 
ballistic this is the SG case and this
is<00:00:16.529> basically<00:00:16.949> ballistics<00:00:17.550> take<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
is basically ballistics take on the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.200 
is basically ballistics take on the
otterbox<00:00:19.410> commuter<00:00:19.619> case<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.880> guys<00:00:21.180> know

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
otterbox commuter case as you guys know

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.200 
otterbox commuter case as you guys know
this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.020> ballistic<00:00:22.740> hardcore<00:00:23.340> HC<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this is the ballistic hardcore HC and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
this is the ballistic hardcore HC and
this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.689> resembling<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> defender<00:00:26.220> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
this is resembling of the defender so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.269 
this is resembling of the defender so
they<00:00:27.090> decided<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.689> make<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
they decided to make a little bit of a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.070 
they decided to make a little bit of a
lighter<00:00:29.519> style<00:00:29.880> case<00:00:30.090> which<00:00:30.359> still<00:00:30.660> offers

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
lighter style case which still offers

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.229 
lighter style case which still offers
great<00:00:31.320> protection<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.640> basically<00:00:33.090> this

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
great protection and so basically this

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.290 
great protection and so basically this
is<00:00:33.480> their<00:00:33.690> commuters<00:00:34.200> tile<00:00:34.410> case<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is their commuters tile case so as you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
is their commuters tile case so as you
can<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.930> has<00:00:37.170> three<00:00:37.680> layers<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
can see this has three layers of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440 
can see this has three layers of
advanced<00:00:38.460> drop<00:00:38.700> protection<00:00:38.879> that's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
advanced drop protection that's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.389 
advanced drop protection that's
reinforced<00:00:39.690> corners<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:41.100> provides

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
reinforced corners and it provides

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.729 
reinforced corners and it provides

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
also comes in black and black so this is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.979 
also comes in black and black so this is
a<00:01:01.500> two-piece<00:01:02.070> case<00:01:02.420> which<00:01:03.420> offers<00:01:03.780> three

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
a two-piece case which offers three

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.600 
a two-piece case which offers three
layers<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> protection<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.979> we'll<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
layers of protection and we'll take a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.600 
layers of protection and we'll take a
look<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:05.880> those<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.369> first<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.549> all

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
look at those right now so first of all

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.570 
look at those right now so first of all
you<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:10.080> back<00:01:10.470> polycarbonate<00:01:11.340> plate

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you have the back polycarbonate plate

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.530 
you have the back polycarbonate plate
which<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.200> TPU<00:01:13.790> TPU<00:01:14.790> material<00:01:14.820> molded

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
which has the TPU TPU material molded

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.210 
which has the TPU TPU material molded
right<00:01:15.750> onto<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.320> these<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> two

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
right onto it so these are the two

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
right onto it so these are the two
layers<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> TPU<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> back

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
layers but you have the TPU on the back

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.920 
layers but you have the TPU on the back
and<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.130> hard<00:01:20.340> plastic<00:01:20.930> all

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and then you have the hard plastic all

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
and then you have the hard plastic all
around<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> sides<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.090> reinforce

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
around the sides and then to reinforce

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.460 
around the sides and then to reinforce
the<00:01:24.810> TPU<00:01:25.140> itself<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.330> TPU<00:01:27.780> material<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the TPU itself so the TPU material is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.240 
the TPU itself so the TPU material is
very<00:01:28.619> soft<00:01:29.509> it<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.720> little<00:01:31.110> bit<00:01:31.259> rubbery<00:01:31.829> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
very soft it is a little bit rubbery so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
very soft it is a little bit rubbery so
it<00:01:32.310> does<00:01:32.460> provide<00:01:32.759> some<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.060> scrip<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> as

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
it does provide some I scrip on it as

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
it does provide some I scrip on it as
you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.770> dimples

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you can see with these little dimples

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
you can see with these little dimples
and<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> ballistic<00:01:36.750> logo<00:01:37.110> right

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and you do have the ballistic logo right

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.330 
and you do have the ballistic logo right
down<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.970> camera<00:01:39.390> flash<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.990> soft<00:01:40.680> sort

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
down there the camera flash is soft sort

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
down there the camera flash is soft sort
of<00:01:41.460> velvety<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.689> actually<00:01:42.899> push<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
of velvety you can actually push this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.289 
of velvety you can actually push this
down<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.860> bit<00:01:43.950> foamy<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:45.149> what's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
down it's a little bit foamy and what's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.670 
down it's a little bit foamy and what's
good<00:01:45.420> about<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.500> actually

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
good about that is that this actually

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.460 
good about that is that this actually
rests<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> iphone<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.170> covers

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
rests on top of the iphone and it covers

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.399 
rests on top of the iphone and it covers
both<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.399> camera<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> flash<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.420> because

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
both the camera in the flash and because

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.980 
both the camera in the flash and because
of<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.530> separation<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
of that separation right down there it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
of that separation right down there it
provides<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.229> nice<00:01:55.470> clean<00:01:55.860> photograph<00:01:56.340> without

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
provides a nice clean photograph without

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.179 
provides a nice clean photograph without
washing<00:01:56.969> out<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.600> third<00:01:58.469> layer<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.920> have

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
washing out the third layer that we have

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.789 
washing out the third layer that we have
is<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.759> silicone<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> what's<00:02:01.530> most

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
is the silicone there and what's most

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.280 
is the silicone there and what's most
notable<00:02:02.700> about<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.450> these<00:02:03.659> reinforced

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
notable about this are these reinforced

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109 
notable about this are these reinforced
corners<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.850> actually

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
corners as you can see they actually

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.859 
corners as you can see they actually
stick<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.869> embossed

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
stick out and they have a be embossed

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.559 
stick out and they have a be embossed
right<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.289> them<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.770> ballistic<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
right on them for ballistic and this is

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.700 
right on them for ballistic and this is
just<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.900> soft

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
just so you soft

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.590 
just so you soft
layer<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> then<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.790> actually<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
layer and then you actually have a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.510 
layer and then you actually have a
little<00:02:15.990> frame<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.620> allows<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.920> pop

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
little frame here that allows you to pop

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.220 
little frame here that allows you to pop
this<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.850> top<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.390> we'll<00:02:18.630> do<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.900> just<00:02:19.260> now

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
this on top and we'll do that just now

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.310 
this on top and we'll do that just now
so<00:02:22.550> basically<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.240> very<00:02:24.720> soft<00:02:24.990> silicon

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
so basically it's a very soft silicon

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.020 
so basically it's a very soft silicon
layer<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.560> pop<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.770> right<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.190> top<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.910> have

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
layer you pop that right on top you have

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.150 
layer you pop that right on top you have
access<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.930> your<00:02:27.960> buttons<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.770> everything

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
access to your buttons and everything

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550 
access to your buttons and everything
and<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.240> just<00:02:30.420> take<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.410> is

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and then you just take this and this is

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.860 
and then you just take this and this is
similar<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.160> case<00:02:32.850> may<00:02:33.120> hybrid<00:02:33.690> tough

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
similar to the case may hybrid tough

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.110 
similar to the case may hybrid tough
case<00:02:34.110> where<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.100> would<00:02:35.250> slide<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.880> one

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
case where you would slide it on one

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.930 
case where you would slide it on one
side<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:37.200> got<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.470> match<00:02:38.070> up<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.310> buttons<00:02:38.730> as

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
side you got to match up the buttons as

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.480 
side you got to match up the buttons as
you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.330> right<00:02:39.360> here<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.340> just

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
you can see right here and then you just

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.040 
you can see right here and then you just
snap<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.820> into<00:02:42.090> place<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.650> you're<00:02:43.650> good<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.860> go

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
snap it into place and you're good to go

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.020 
snap it into place and you're good to go
so<00:02:46.050> if<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.980> take<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> look<00:02:47.310> at<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> whole<00:02:47.670> case

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so if you take a look at the whole case

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.300 
so if you take a look at the whole case
itself<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.900> does<00:02:49.170> offer<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.770> great<00:02:50.010> amount<00:02:50.190> of

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
itself it does offer a great amount of

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.890 
itself it does offer a great amount of
protection<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:51.000> first<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.420> all<00:02:51.540> let's<00:02:51.720> take<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
protection but first of all let's take a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.410 
protection but first of all let's take a
look<00:02:52.140> at<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.680> ports<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.130> cutouts<00:02:53.460> at<00:02:54.210> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
look at the ports and cutouts at the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.570 
look at the ports and cutouts at the
bottom<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.050> have<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.530> large<00:02:55.830> cutout<00:02:56.160> for

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
bottom you do have one large cutout for

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.550 
bottom you do have one large cutout for
the<00:02:56.640> 30-pin<00:02:57.120> dock<00:02:57.180> connector<00:02:57.360> I've<00:02:58.260> had<00:02:58.410> no

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the 30-pin dock connector I've had no

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.250 
the 30-pin dock connector I've had no
trouble<00:02:58.980> fitting<00:02:59.460> all<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.940> 30<00:03:00.630> party<00:03:00.900> cables

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
trouble fitting all my 30 party cables

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
trouble fitting all my 30 party cables
in<00:03:01.350> there<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.340> separate<00:03:02.700> cutouts<00:03:03.000> for

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
in there and just separate cutouts for

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.510 
in there and just separate cutouts for
your<00:03:03.570> microphone<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.290> speaker<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.830> really

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
your microphone and speaker I really

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.990 
your microphone and speaker I really
like<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.640> they<00:03:06.140> they<00:03:07.140> made<00:03:07.350> these<00:03:07.560> little

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
like that they they made these little

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.130 
like that they they made these little
silicone<00:03:09.000> inserts<00:03:09.360> right<00:03:09.570> here<00:03:09.780> because<00:03:10.020> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
silicone inserts right here because it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.870 
silicone inserts right here because it
makes<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.530> little<00:03:10.830> flap<00:03:11.010> up<00:03:11.220> here<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.700> as

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
makes this little flap up here not as

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.300 
makes this little flap up here not as
loose<00:03:12.120> as<00:03:12.390> some<00:03:12.630> other<00:03:12.780> cases<00:03:13.050> if<00:03:13.410> they<00:03:14.100> don't

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
loose as some other cases if they don't

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.830 
loose as some other cases if they don't
add<00:03:14.460> this<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.120> obviously<00:03:15.210> it's<00:03:15.570> going<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.750> be

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
add this and obviously it's going to be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.800 
add this and obviously it's going to be
very<00:03:16.080> loose<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.700> prime<00:03:17.910> example<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
very loose and the prime example is the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.980 
very loose and the prime example is the
case<00:03:19.620> made<00:03:19.860> hybrid<00:03:20.250> tough<00:03:20.430> case<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.720> bloody

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
case made hybrid tough case so bloody

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.960 
case made hybrid tough case so bloody
chose<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.460> left-hand<00:03:23.850> side

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
chose to do that on the left-hand side

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.150 
chose to do that on the left-hand side
you<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.600> access<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.410> your<00:03:25.440> volume<00:03:25.920> up<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
you have access to your volume up and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.220 
you have access to your volume up and
down<00:03:26.220> that's<00:03:26.550> fine<00:03:26.880> very<00:03:27.360> responsive<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
down that's fine very responsive the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.470 
down that's fine very responsive the
silicone<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.740> very<00:03:28.920> thin<00:03:29.190> there<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:30.330> not

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
silicone is very thin there so it's not

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.030 
silicone is very thin there so it's not
hard<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.720> press<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.080> all<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.740> then<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.920> do

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
hard to press it all and then you do

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.340 
hard to press it all and then you do
have<00:03:32.160> space<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:32.880> vibrate<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:34.170> enough

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
have space for your vibrate it's enough

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.330 
have space for your vibrate it's enough
space<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.650> get<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.160> with<00:03:35.280> your<00:03:35.430> finger

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
space to get in there with your finger

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.800 
space to get in there with your finger
you<00:03:38.340> also<00:03:38.550> have<00:03:38.790> those<00:03:38.940> reinforced<00:03:39.540> corners

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
you also have those reinforced corners

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.220 
you also have those reinforced corners
like<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.290> said<00:03:40.680> all<00:03:40.890> around<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.960> as<00:03:42.960> you<00:03:43.110> can

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
like I said all around and as you can

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.900 
like I said all around and as you can
see<00:03:43.260> they<00:03:43.440> actually<00:03:43.710> protrude<00:03:44.550> out<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.820> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
see they actually protrude out of the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.160 
see they actually protrude out of the
case<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> little<00:03:45.480> bit<00:03:45.570> which<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.720> always<00:03:45.960> great

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
case a little bit which is always great

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140 
case a little bit which is always great
because<00:03:46.410> if<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.830> do<00:03:47.010> drop<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.520> it'll<00:03:47.910> hit

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
because if you do drop this it'll hit

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.300 
because if you do drop this it'll hit
those<00:03:48.360> corners<00:03:48.390> first<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.440> these<00:03:49.890> are<00:03:49.950> pretty

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
those corners first and these are pretty

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.760 
those corners first and these are pretty
thick<00:03:50.580> silicone<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.210> here<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:52.350> at<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.590> top

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
thick silicone right here so at the top

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.480 
thick silicone right here so at the top
you<00:03:53.040> do<00:03:53.160> have<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.700> large<00:03:54.600> cutout<00:03:54.930> for<00:03:55.410> the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
you do have a large cutout for the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.340 
you do have a large cutout for the
headphone<00:03:56.490> jack<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.970> for<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:57.990> secondary

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
headphone jack and for your secondary

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.130 
headphone jack and for your secondary
microphone<00:03:58.700> I've<00:03:59.700> had<00:03:59.910> no<00:04:00.030> trouble<00:04:00.480> using<00:04:00.810> any

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
microphone I've had no trouble using any

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.410 
microphone I've had no trouble using any
microphone<00:04:01.650> sorry<00:04:02.490> any<00:04:02.670> headphones<00:04:02.910> and

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
microphone sorry any headphones and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.840 
microphone sorry any headphones and
there<00:04:03.540> except<00:04:03.810> some<00:04:03.990> DJ<00:04:04.320> style<00:04:04.650> ones<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.730> then

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
there except some DJ style ones and then

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.130 
there except some DJ style ones and then
you<00:04:05.910> do<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.180> your<00:04:06.210> power<00:04:06.540> button<00:04:06.630> right<00:04:07.110> here

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
you do have your power button right here

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.410 
you do have your power button right here
which<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.100> very<00:04:08.310> responsive<00:04:08.520> as<00:04:08.970> well<00:04:09.120> because

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
which is very responsive as well because

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.620 
which is very responsive as well because
it<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.630> thin<00:04:10.080> silicone<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.490> protection<00:04:12.420> why<00:04:12.570> is

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
it is thin silicone so protection why is

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.720 
it is thin silicone so protection why is
this<00:04:12.870> case<00:04:13.170> will<00:04:13.500> offer<00:04:13.710> about<00:04:14.490> semi

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
this case will offer about semi

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.180 
this case will offer about semi
protection<00:04:15.330> as<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> commuter<00:04:16.080> case<00:04:16.320> basically

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
protection as a commuter case basically

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.560 
protection as a commuter case basically
what<00:04:17.400> they've<00:04:17.489> done<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.940> they've<00:04:18.210> scale

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
what they've done is it they've scale

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.860 
what they've done is it they've scale
down<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:19.049> case<00:04:19.350> into<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> more<00:04:20.700> usable<00:04:21.000> daily

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
down this case into a more usable daily

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.980 
down this case into a more usable daily
package<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:23.190> instead<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.640> having<00:04:23.760> these<00:04:24.690> four

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
package so instead of having these four

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.270 
package so instead of having these four
layers<00:04:25.260> of<00:04:25.500> protection<00:04:25.800> they've<00:04:26.100> actually

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
layers of protection they've actually

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.200 
layers of protection they've actually
made

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
made

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.090 
made
a bit<00:04:27.389> smaller<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.199> still<00:04:28.860> get<00:04:28.949> great

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
a bit smaller so you still get great

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.420 
a bit smaller so you still get great
protection<00:04:29.520> without<00:04:29.759> having<00:04:30.270> all<00:04:30.449> that<00:04:31.050> bulk

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
protection without having all that bulk

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.830 
protection without having all that bulk
so<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.580> case<00:04:32.729> does<00:04:32.940> manage<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.270> keep<00:04:33.539> a

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
so this case does manage to keep a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.450 
so this case does manage to keep a
little<00:04:34.289> bit<00:04:34.440> of<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.650> iphone<00:04:34.979> slim<00:04:35.190> form

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
little bit of the iphone slim form

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.920 
little bit of the iphone slim form
factor<00:04:35.789> it's<00:04:35.880> not<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.090> slimmest<00:04:36.419> case<00:04:36.630> but

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
factor it's not the slimmest case but

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.670 
factor it's not the slimmest case but
it's<00:04:37.050> definitely<00:04:37.590> not<00:04:37.919> as<00:04:38.069> thick<00:04:38.370> as<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:38.699> HC

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
it's definitely not as thick as this HC

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.830 
it's definitely not as thick as this HC
so<00:04:40.680> I'm<00:04:40.979> really<00:04:41.280> got<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.699> they<00:04:41.789> went<00:04:42.330> with<00:04:42.690> that

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
so I'm really got it they went with that

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.629 
so I'm really got it they went with that
direction<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.830> trying<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.190> make<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.310> slimmer

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
direction of trying to make a slimmer

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.120 
direction of trying to make a slimmer
case<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.349> obviously<00:04:46.349> an<00:04:46.470> option<00:04:46.860> for<00:04:46.889> people

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
case and obviously an option for people

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.129 
case and obviously an option for people
that<00:04:47.340> don't<00:04:47.370> need<00:04:47.699> this<00:04:47.910> much<00:04:48.150> protection<00:04:48.569> but

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
that don't need this much protection but

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.839 
that don't need this much protection but
still<00:04:49.410> want<00:04:49.620> good<00:04:49.889> protection<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.550> their

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
still want good protection on their

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.150 
still want good protection on their
phone<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.020> do<00:04:52.349> get<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.500> nice<00:04:52.710> lay<00:04:52.949> on<00:04:53.069> the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
phone so you do get a nice lay on the

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.650 
phone so you do get a nice lay on the
table<00:04:53.190> design<00:04:53.729> as<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:53.970> can<00:04:54.120> see<00:04:54.300> all<00:04:54.330> around

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
table design as you can see all around

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.809 
table design as you can see all around
it's<00:04:55.169> not<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.470> largest<00:04:55.680> one<00:04:56.069> but<00:04:56.639> there<00:04:56.789> is

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
it's not the largest one but there is

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.270 
it's not the largest one but there is
still<00:04:57.060> some<00:04:57.419> so<00:04:57.900> when<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.199> place<00:04:58.710> your<00:04:58.919> iPhone

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
still some so when you place your iPhone

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.010 
still some so when you place your iPhone
down<00:04:59.490> it's<00:04:59.759> not<00:04:59.910> rubbing<00:05:00.479> up<00:05:00.599> against<00:05:00.840> the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
down it's not rubbing up against the

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.980 
down it's not rubbing up against the
table<00:05:01.380> now<00:05:02.370> like<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.639> said<00:05:02.669> that<00:05:03.300> TPU<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:03.900> the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
table now like I said that TPU on the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.950 
table now like I said that TPU on the
back<00:05:04.139> offers<00:05:04.740> great<00:05:05.009> grip<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.599> then<00:05:06.599> that<00:05:06.810> in

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
back offers great grip and then that in

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.689 
back offers great grip and then that in
combination<00:05:07.199> with<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.949> silicone<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.639> the

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
combination with the silicone and the

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.400 
combination with the silicone and the
plastic<00:05:08.940> offers<00:05:09.570> absolutely<00:05:10.259> great

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
plastic offers absolutely great

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.370 
plastic offers absolutely great
protection<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.849> with<00:05:12.000> 3499<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:13.110> think<00:05:13.289> the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
protection so with 3499 I think the

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.900 
protection so with 3499 I think the
price<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.770> little<00:05:13.860> bit<00:05:14.190> high<00:05:14.310> for<00:05:14.340> this<00:05:14.639> case

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
price is a little bit high for this case

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.700 
price is a little bit high for this case
I<00:05:15.120> think<00:05:15.509> they<00:05:15.840> should<00:05:15.990> drop<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.349> down<00:05:16.470> by

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
I think they should drop it down by

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.230 
I think they should drop it down by
about<00:05:16.830> five<00:05:17.190> dollars<00:05:17.400> because<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.970> doesn't

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
about five dollars because it doesn't

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.330 
about five dollars because it doesn't
come<00:05:18.360> with<00:05:18.509> any<00:05:18.599> included<00:05:19.229> extras<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:20.159> can

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
come with any included extras you can
