 for each and every one of you in this 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.250
 summer day in my case today 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.559

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.849

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.310

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.920
 the long I am January birthday 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.840
 I was birthday on January 20 and 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.600
 I did not celebrate or anything because I had 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.070
 the family theme died in modem and 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.769
 my grandpa father's birthday 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.489
 I was sick several months ago 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:36.160
 a very complicated cancer but good what 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.100
 We said goodbye with a lot of affection, I have been 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.520
 very good while still very calm 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.860
 so well it 's also that you know 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.520
 that I have my special beliefs 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.890
 personal 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.060
 for me the subject of death is not a 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 so common theme 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.880
 what causes me the last one I say 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.180
 explanation beyond the subject d 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.600
 to miss someone 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.340
 I do not take it as something quite natural but 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 probably at the time already there and 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.050
 therefore I have not seen much of my 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.690
 friends either did not have time like 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.790

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.670
 know but those who know them 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.590
 I found so obnoxious with these tender 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.770

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.700
 unhappiness that he gave me also in the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.230
 moment when he gave it to me he had a 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.910
