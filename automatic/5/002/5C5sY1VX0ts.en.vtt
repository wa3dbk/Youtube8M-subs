00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
how I'm going to be fishing it today so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.250 
how I'm going to be fishing it today so
let's<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> quick<00:01:12.990> look

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
let's just have a quick look

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.359 
let's just have a quick look
every<00:01:13.590> Wiggs<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:13.950> using<00:01:15.799> right<00:01:16.799> down<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
every Wiggs I'm using right down the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
every Wiggs I'm using right down the
edge<00:01:17.520> fish<00:01:18.150> tend<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.930> bit<00:01:19.140> bigger

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
edge fish tend to be a little bit bigger

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.030 
edge fish tend to be a little bit bigger
so<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:20.009> using<00:01:20.220> 15<00:01:20.790> hollow<00:01:21.060> today<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
so I'm using 15 hollow today this is a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
I've caught a lot of big fish in it I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.460 
I've caught a lot of big fish in it I
don't<00:01:28.500> ever<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:29.520> heavier<00:01:29.880> than<00:01:30.150> 15<00:01:30.479> hollow<00:01:30.720> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
don't ever go heavier than 15 hollow so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.319 
don't ever go heavier than 15 hollow so
I<00:01:31.500> saying<00:01:31.890> something<00:01:31.979> about<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.060> size

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
I saying something about this the size

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.039 
I saying something about this the size
of<00:01:33.540> some<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> fish<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.470> Lake<00:01:36.049> I'm

of some of the fish in this Lake I'm
using<00:01:37.470> an<00:01:37.979> O<00:01:38.960> 17<00:01:39.960> mainline<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
using an O 17 mainline and this is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.359 
using an O 17 mainline and this is
powerline<00:01:41.869> really<00:01:42.869> strong<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.530> low<00:01:43.680> diameter

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.179 
powerline really strong but low diameter
Oh<00:01:44.579> 17<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> heaviest<00:01:46.409> ugh<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> pole

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
Oh 17 is a heaviest ugh on the pole

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.039 
Oh 17 is a heaviest ugh on the pole
again<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.549> very<00:01:50.759> unlikely<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.869> um

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
bristle

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.960 
bristle
so<00:02:11.020> if<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.290> can<00:02:11.440> pin<00:02:11.650> pull<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.920> down<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.459> the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
so if you can pin pull it down and the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.559 
so if you can pin pull it down and the
bait<00:02:13.209> doesn't<00:02:14.640> drag<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.030> drag<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.360> float

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
bait doesn't drag on and drag the float

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.440 
bait doesn't drag on and drag the float
underwater<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.970> get<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> perfect

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450
