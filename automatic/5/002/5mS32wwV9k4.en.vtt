everything not too sure what her real
ideas<00:04:07.380> but<00:04:07.710> I<00:04:07.770> think<00:04:08.040> if<00:04:08.190> this<00:04:09.030> if<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:09.600> art

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
ideas but I think if this if this art

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.440 
ideas but I think if this if this art
doesn't<00:04:10.170> go<00:04:10.320> on<00:04:10.470> longer<00:04:10.920> then<00:04:11.460> I<00:04:11.640> think<00:04:12.330> it

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
doesn't go on longer then I think it

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.490 
doesn't go on longer then I think it
should<00:04:12.600> then<00:04:13.200> honestly<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.790> don't<00:04:15.060> know

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
should then honestly I don't know

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.960 
should then honestly I don't know
there's<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.650> probably<00:04:17.010> not<00:04:17.100> anything<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:17.790> i

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
there's that probably not anything but i

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.670 
there's that probably not anything but i
think<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.480> that<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.870> shark<00:04:19.109> should<00:04:19.410> show<00:04:19.650> a

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
think is that the shark should show a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.590 
think is that the shark should show a
little<00:04:19.890> more<00:04:20.100> stuff<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.000> does<00:04:21.180> honestly

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
little more stuff to it does honestly

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.409 
little more stuff to it does honestly
feel<00:04:21.930> as<00:04:22.190> awesome<00:04:23.190> as<00:04:23.370> i<00:04:23.520> thought<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:23.970> would<00:04:24.150> be

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
feel as awesome as i thought it would be

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.490 
feel as awesome as i thought it would be
but

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
but

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500 
but
it's<00:04:25.590> okay<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.040> mean<00:04:26.280> it's<00:04:26.430> free<00:04:26.670> decent<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.330> I

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
it's okay I mean it's free decent but I

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.720 
it's okay I mean it's free decent but I
think<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.140> should<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.380> better<00:04:28.620> still<00:04:29.010> but<00:04:29.640> I'm

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
think it should be better still but I'm

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.310 
think it should be better still but I'm
told<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.090> guys<00:04:30.210> think<00:04:30.450> about<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.230> guys

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320
