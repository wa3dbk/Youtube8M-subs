00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
one of the main benefits of the system

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.589 
one of the main benefits of the system
is<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.550> brand<00:00:26.789> new<00:00:26.910> gun<00:00:27.090> performance

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
is you get brand new gun performance

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.009 
is you get brand new gun performance
each<00:00:27.960> time<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.650> optimizing<00:00:29.010> head<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.340> changed

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
each time the optimizing head is changed

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.569 
each time the optimizing head is changed
if<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> head<00:00:31.320> becomes<00:00:31.470> dirty<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:32.160> too<00:00:32.340> clogged

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
if the head becomes dirty or too clogged

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.680 
if the head becomes dirty or too clogged
with<00:00:32.669> primer<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.540> simply<00:00:33.899> unclip<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
with primer you can simply unclip it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
with primer you can simply unclip it
taking<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.129> clip<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> front<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
taking you on clip it on to the front of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.299 
taking you on clip it on to the front of
the<00:00:38.910> gun<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> gun<00:00:40.079> also<00:00:40.320> atomizes<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> paint

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the gun the gun also atomizes the paint

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.400 
the gun the gun also atomizes the paint
really<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.420> uses<00:00:42.690> less<00:00:42.809> primer<00:00:43.140> than<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
really well it uses less primer than a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
really well it uses less primer than a
traditional<00:00:43.559> spray<00:00:44.070> gun<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.910> should<00:00:45.059> see

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
traditional spray gun so you should see

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.029 
traditional spray gun so you should see
cost<00:00:45.450> savings<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> paint<00:00:46.200> side<00:00:46.469> you'll

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
cost savings on the paint side you'll

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
cost savings on the paint side you'll
also<00:00:47.190> notice<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> Accu<00:00:48.660> spray

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
also notice when you use the Accu spray

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
also notice when you use the Accu spray
that<00:00:49.200> overspray<00:00:49.739> levels<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.160> far<00:00:50.340> less<00:00:50.550> than

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that overspray levels are far less than

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
that overspray levels are far less than
when<00:00:50.969> using<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.300> standard<00:00:51.360> primer<00:00:51.899> gun<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.800> less

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
when using a standard primer gun so less

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.139 
when using a standard primer gun so less
standing<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> needed<00:00:53.699> around<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> repair

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
standing is needed around the repair

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
standing is needed around the repair
area<00:00:54.559> with<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.649> Q<00:00:55.829> spray<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> really

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
area with a Q spray you get a really

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
area with a Q spray you get a really
nice<00:00:56.820> smooth<00:00:57.180> primer<00:00:57.480> lay<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.440> less<00:00:58.620> time

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
nice smooth primer lay down so less time

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
nice smooth primer lay down so less time
is<00:00:59.010> needed<00:00:59.160> blocking<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.730> pair<00:00:59.969> area<00:01:00.270> before

another<00:01:11.670> great<00:01:11.909> benefit<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> 3m<00:01:13.020> actor

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
another great benefit of the 3m actor

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.810 
another great benefit of the 3m actor
spray<00:01:13.439> system<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> color<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
spray system is the color of the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
spray system is the color of the
atomizing<00:01:15.299> head<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.530> means<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.070> tell

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
atomizing head this means you can tell

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070 
atomizing head this means you can tell
straight<00:01:17.400> away<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> gun<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.270> clean<00:01:18.540> so

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
straight away when the gun is clean so

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.719 
straight away when the gun is clean so
you<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.380> far<00:01:19.619> less<00:01:19.650> gun<00:01:20.009> wash<00:01:20.189> fluid<00:01:20.549> than

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you use far less gun wash fluid than

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.219 
you use far less gun wash fluid than
when<00:01:20.850> cleaning<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> normal<00:01:21.450> primer<00:01:21.689> gun<00:01:21.930> and
