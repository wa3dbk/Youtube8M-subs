00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 is the next guest created together 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.480
 with his sister, the owner of the German 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.580
 features handmade single pieces 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.590
 and one from each committee has a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.590
 theme and let's play against braga 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.949
 Welcome, is this person who was to 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.510
 scream a lot and Maria is because she not only 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.539
 I wanted to do this interview because your 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.490
 clothes is how shinawatra got 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.330
 institute tour 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.890
 this reaction has been this the reaction is not 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 I must go there because that aacute 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 this brand existed March since 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 March but sometimes you have sold the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.550
 first collection in 25 minutes in the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.559
 Facebook in the face of 9 minutes and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 pieces vary it was crazy I do not have 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.570
 Andes brothers, however, it was already 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.969
 We released 20 pieces and no longer saw 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.309
 parts parties were always brothers 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.410
 Arriving every hour, this is very good. 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.120
 and ready and was named the feedback of what 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.010
 This will not continue at first. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.870
 always in part we are doing 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 principle exclusive pieces you can not 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 take a young deputy want no more 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.119
 same clothes and we really are 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.530
 energy it is that people seek 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.610
 because you are different and tried 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 to walk away from programs that already exist 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.619
 all brands that are made in series 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 who produce 30 and 31 identical games must 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.080
 be all can see discussed what there is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.689
 in the shops is all talk and never saw 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.299
 out of the ordinary a fondness goes against the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.390
 area against any store that can 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.790
 exist in japan 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.890
 we try to create something that 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.439
 really no people have 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.229
 I really feel a need for tv. 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.659
 this piece that really takes pride in me and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.189
 that reveals that what I am to stay 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.720
 with the actress became unique also several 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.090
 people like this concept of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.280
 customization we seek 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 exactly the same it is time people 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.520
 to identify the way in which she 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.110
 clothes that are proud of what is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 wearing exactly because it's one thing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.799
 that identifies how you saw how it is 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 who came to this concept with the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.640
 sculpture keeps studies as a matter of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.360
 social is the fashion design and fashion design 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.310
 so we think we can 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.820
 both with what we both ribs 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.200
 and that the two of us will see no one in life 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.940
 to find a way to show all the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.740
 things that we find all the ways 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.810
 we find all types and may 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.060
 finding on tomato on shoulders support 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.310
 my theatrical conception of success I 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.560
 learn how to go marcela learn from me 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.750
 ahead with Alex Trave even did 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.730
 everything at hand and she learns food 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.700
 communicate the brand and see how it can 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.770
 transform that more urban traffic 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.030
 communication port has already demanded this 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.100
 Why did you always want to work? 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.050
 Together I happened to think I was little 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.459
 that I'm younger than she ever goes 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.380
 I won anything with it 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.930
 and why I think when you know a 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.940
 ethernet person stays with her is very 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.820
 better with one thing they have with 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.230
 lep speak the same language just think more 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.170
 in the media in a way things can 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.760
 result my advantage was started with 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.180
 these pieces can find the cruise 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.950
 type 13 that you use our students 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.570
 exactly let's get everything 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.100
 income study that is 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.350
 different we send some video 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.540
 things out to shop is really nothing for 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.320
 stay in portugal 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.750
 then basically it's joining do not want 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.090
 everything by different color from things that we 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.489
 we learned that im not going to turn out im 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.519
 we got together suddenly they stay like this 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.739
 even I have immense pride because 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.840
 bbb of the ladder is exactly reflect 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.239
 same thing you want to try to escape 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.250
 beyond what already exists and by trying this 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.900
 we create something that may be silent about 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.239
 sometimes, it is obvious that the 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.100
 people may not be well then 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.040
 in the area of change and make it 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.810
 really a lot of children who 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.120
 can be really different because 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.360
 I think joke has to use the problems. 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.610
 Did you guys think of a good one? 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.890
 a good gap in the market that exists 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.840
 what is missing from this date only in this club 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.670
 may have a side may be a risk is not 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.950
 because people can also think 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.720
 sorry he could not have it 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.120
 there will be the same but you can also 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.180
 another side to create a 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.190
 a rush and entice people to wait 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.959
 for the next collection because as I said 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.819
 are issues 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.959
 or is it so Portuguese not exactly 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.880
 there are always only 25 pieces 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.710
 angolans a chi-x time we go 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.990
 announcing on the facebook page the copper 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.690
 that people feel interested in 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.060
 see when the next play is going 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.680
 height when it really only comes 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.110
 it means seeing them all at the same time 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.699
 fast and effective when really that 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.699
 Critics I think this is not going to be 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.330
 so good to get sure that the 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.830
 money 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.180
 I think you 've only been out to 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.270
 buy that I think the point and so 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:50.510
 the company bought the vote is very much you 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.130
 they already do this through the chief 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.229
 but proposes to do promises to download 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.639
 I personally do not go out, I think it's going to stay. 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.500
 reaches all the women who in this 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.000
 moment our maybe want the thing 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.620
 so let's put an end to the abuses that 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.539
 can grow we have ideas because 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.280
 I think what is not lacking are ideas. 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.100
 How much do you want to try to do something? 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.870
 different as results during the 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.950
 nerds and went to talk to the 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.690
 coconuts 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.400
 now women get the phrase is e 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.610
 you wonder when the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.139
 people have followed with 70 bring and pro 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.630
 and fortunately for you it is a breakthrough in 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.760
 proposed for example the mixed design 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.160
 with this pattern with this inspiration and 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.260
 do more or less news I think it's just 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.970
 are waiting to see what we 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.990
 Let's get what the new question will be. 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:42.150
 Are we going to insert a book? 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.860
 to suggest I think you do not expect to see 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.880
 but now we are going to show that the 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.410
 only certainty is that we will present 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.139
 because it will always be something that 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.020
 really still have not found it is also 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.820
 that we own what you already have 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.949
 an opinion we have to win a 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.990
 collection with the theme here in this company 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.970
 still will not roll it can only be hot 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.530
 what is right will not have one day I 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.360
 I hope you do not help me and when he 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.740
 has date in principle attracts me 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.500
 You're almost done to enter the page. 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.020
 facebook theme is val even worth me 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.350
 I liked this part, I think it 's 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.360
 probably a great big big 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.250
 sign that the people who form the 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.200
 how people know if you have 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.700
 these photos on the facebook page of 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.400
 people who are wearing the clothes today. 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.780
 taking pictures of the parliamentarians themselves 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.970
 I think you do not know how to receive this 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.250
 feedback has been great and also because 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.930
 easy to assert to feel that really 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.360
 it's worth not only people buy and 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.890
 gladly bought the account 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.910
 proud that what they feel and what 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.050
 that credit 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.660
 I think this is also unlikely 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.640
 really can not be a place can not 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.960
 be more grandiose and that if I am 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.890
 very glad that I like my 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.910
 invested and vain a crime that b 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.560
 thank you very much, thank you 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.230
 I still have too much down 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.990
 You went on facebook page theme 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.920
