few different drafts in a war $25 and

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.149 
few different drafts in a war $25 and
like<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.820> prize<00:01:13.030> support<00:01:13.270> was<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.930> half<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.950> pack

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
like the prize support was a half a pack

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.270 
like the prize support was a half a pack
a<00:01:15.369> prize<00:01:15.670> support<00:01:15.880> which<00:01:16.719> in<00:01:17.020> hindsight<00:01:17.619> what

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
a prize support which in hindsight what

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.859 
a prize support which in hindsight what
syntactic<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.820> bad<00:01:19.030> but<00:01:19.329> it<00:01:19.539> was<00:01:19.630> kind<00:01:19.840> of

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
syntactic that bad but it was kind of

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.940 
syntactic that bad but it was kind of
bad<00:01:20.049> because<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:21.130> MSRP<00:01:21.579> was<00:01:21.909> like<00:01:22.030> 699<00:01:22.719> and<00:01:23.320> if

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
bad because the MSRP was like 699 and if

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.219 
bad because the MSRP was like 699 and if
you<00:01:24.070> just<00:01:24.250> calculate<00:01:24.520> from<00:01:24.820> MSRP<00:01:25.390> that's<00:01:26.020> like

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
you just calculate from MSRP that's like

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.920 
you just calculate from MSRP that's like
seven<00:01:26.649> times<00:01:26.890> that's<00:01:27.219> like<00:01:27.340> 21<00:01:27.820> plus<00:01:28.299> three

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
seven times that's like 21 plus three

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.179 
seven times that's like 21 plus three
and<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.079> half<00:01:29.109> I<00:01:29.409> guess<00:01:29.590> that's<00:01:29.740> very

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
and a half I guess that's very

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.410 
and a half I guess that's very
reasonable<00:01:30.399> that's<00:01:30.759> why<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:30.939> was<00:01:31.060> half<00:01:31.240> because

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
reasonable that's why I was half because

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.330 
reasonable that's why I was half because
it<00:01:31.689> equal<00:01:32.530> 25<00:01:33.070> bucks<00:01:33.359> but<00:01:34.359> nowadays<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.710> MSRP

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
it equal 25 bucks but nowadays the MSRP

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.999 
it equal 25 bucks but nowadays the MSRP
being<00:01:36.850> ten<00:01:37.270> dollars<00:01:37.689> does<00:01:38.020> chains<00:01:38.590> house

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
being ten dollars does chains house

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.270 
being ten dollars does chains house
tours<00:01:39.520> are<00:01:39.729> going<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.030> drop<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.770> bad<00:01:42.039> way

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
and when I mean a bad way I mean this is

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.740 
and when I mean a bad way I mean this is
kind<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.219> insane<00:01:45.399> that<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.939> draft<00:01:46.329> is<00:01:46.479> going<00:01:46.689> to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
kind of insane that a draft is going to
