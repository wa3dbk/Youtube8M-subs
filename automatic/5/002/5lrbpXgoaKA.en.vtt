than<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.860> ever<00:01:11.010> been<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> big<00:01:11.820> part<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
than we have ever been and a big part of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
than we have ever been and a big part of
the<00:01:12.180> reason<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.049> schools<00:01:13.590> sometimes

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
they are forced to they are feeding junk

they are forced to they are feeding junk
to<00:01:17.280> kids<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.240> simple<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to kids it's as simple as that

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
to kids it's as simple as that
and<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> sugar<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and it's not just the sugar that's in in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
and it's not just the sugar that's in in
the<00:01:21.509> milk<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> milk<00:01:22.380> itself<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.400> main

and we're actually expanding the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.250 
and we're actually expanding the
conversation<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:12.210> where<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.750> milk<00:04:13.050> in

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
general dr. Neil here's my thought and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.040 
general dr. Neil here's my thought and
somebody<00:04:18.060> told<00:04:18.300> me<00:04:18.450> this<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.780> didn't<00:04:18.959> think

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
somebody told me this I didn't think

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.700 
somebody told me this I didn't think
this<00:04:19.260> up<00:04:19.410> myself<00:04:19.590> uh<00:04:20.340> cow's<00:04:21.090> milk<00:04:21.660> was<00:04:22.140> meant

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
this up myself uh cow's milk was meant

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.910 
this up myself uh cow's milk was meant
for<00:04:22.800> cows<00:04:23.400> we're<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.420> only<00:04:24.570> species<00:04:25.080> we<00:04:25.590> human

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
for cows we're the only species we human

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.700 
for cows we're the only species we human
beings<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.550> steal<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.720> mother's<00:04:28.080> milk<00:04:28.350> from

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
beings that steal the mother's milk from

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.500 
beings that steal the mother's milk from
another<00:04:28.980> species<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.700> drink<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.300> for

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
another species and drink it for

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.860 
another species and drink it for
ourselves<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.200> what<00:04:32.070> does<00:04:32.340> cow's<00:04:32.760> milk<00:04:33.120> do<00:04:33.510> in

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
ourselves so what does cow's milk do in

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.820 
ourselves so what does cow's milk do in
terms<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.950> how<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.670> works<00:04:35.880> on<00:04:36.060> calves<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:37.050> how

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
terms of how it works on calves and how

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.680 
terms of how it works on calves and how
does<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.160> relate<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.550> human<00:04:38.940> beings<00:04:39.240> yeah

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
does that relate to human beings yeah

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.180 
does that relate to human beings yeah
well<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:39.990> think<00:04:40.140> that's<00:04:40.350> so<00:04:40.530> important<00:04:40.920> the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
well I think that's so important the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.800 
well I think that's so important the
purpose<00:04:41.640> of<00:04:41.790> milk<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.270> can<00:04:42.420> put<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.750> way

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
purpose of milk if I can put it that way

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.840 
purpose of milk if I can put it that way
is<00:04:43.080> not<00:04:43.350> for<00:04:43.590> dunking<00:04:43.890> cookies<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:44.520> the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
is not for dunking cookies in it the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.670 
is not for dunking cookies in it the
purpose<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.300> milk<00:04:45.480> is<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.720> make<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:45.900> calf<00:04:46.230> grow

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
purpose of milk is to make a calf grow

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.860 
purpose of milk is to make a calf grow
and<00:04:46.980> so<00:04:47.160> it<00:04:47.280> contains<00:04:47.640> not<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.300> calcium<00:04:48.750> and

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
and so it contains not just calcium and

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.530 
and so it contains not just calcium and
protein<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.320> fat<00:04:49.440> but<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.710> contains<00:04:50.330> hormones

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
protein and fat but it contains hormones

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.390 
protein and fat but it contains hormones
it<00:04:51.840> contains<00:04:52.200> growth<00:04:52.500> factors<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:53.160> it

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
it contains growth factors and it

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.250 
it contains growth factors and it
stimulates<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.120> production<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.720> more

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
stimulates the production of more

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.380 
stimulates the production of more
hormones<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.010> more<00:04:56.160> growth<00:04:56.640> factors<00:04:57.090> in<00:04:57.240> your

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
hormones and more growth factors in your

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.870 
hormones and more growth factors in your
body<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:59.280> don't<00:04:59.310> need<00:04:59.670> that

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
body and you don't need that

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.780 
body and you don't need that
particularly<00:05:00.540> in<00:05:00.960> adulthood<00:05:01.710> there's<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.580> lot

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
particularly in adulthood there's a lot

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.100 
particularly in adulthood there's a lot
of<00:05:02.940> evidence<00:05:03.150> that<00:05:03.360> men<00:05:03.660> who<00:05:03.810> are<00:05:03.900> drinking

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
of evidence that men who are drinking

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.080 
of evidence that men who are drinking
milk<00:05:04.470> two<00:05:04.680> or<00:05:04.770> three<00:05:04.890> times<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.190> day<00:05:05.220> have<00:05:05.760> more

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
milk two or three times a day have more

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.030 
milk two or three times a day have more
risk<00:05:06.330> of<00:05:06.480> prostate<00:05:06.990> cancer<00:05:07.200> that's<00:05:07.680> because

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
risk of prostate cancer that's because

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.490 
risk of prostate cancer that's because
the<00:05:08.190> growth<00:05:08.490> in<00:05:08.760> their<00:05:08.940> body<00:05:09.180> is<00:05:09.540> of<00:05:10.140> cancer

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
the growth in their body is of cancer

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.900 
the growth in their body is of cancer
cells<00:05:10.710> now<00:05:10.830> that's<00:05:11.010> pretty<00:05:11.130> frightening<00:05:11.460> but

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
cells now that's pretty frightening but

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.730 
cells now that's pretty frightening but
if<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.120> look<00:05:12.270> at<00:05:12.390> kids<00:05:12.660> kids<00:05:13.200> are<00:05:13.380> drinking

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
if you look at kids kids are drinking

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.710 
if you look at kids kids are drinking
though<00:05:13.890> they<00:05:14.460> get<00:05:14.670> no<00:05:14.940> advantage<00:05:15.420> for<00:05:15.450> their
