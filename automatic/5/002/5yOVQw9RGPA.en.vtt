00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
just keep those still it might be

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
just keep those still it might be
holding<00:01:58.259> onto<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.649> obstacle<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.700> just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
holding onto an obstacle and just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.109 
holding onto an obstacle and just
practicing<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.740> keeping<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.799> eyes<00:02:02.189> looking

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
practicing or keeping your eyes looking

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.450 
practicing or keeping your eyes looking
at<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> certain<00:02:03.659> position<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> board<00:02:04.590> so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
at a certain position of the board so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.340 
at a certain position of the board so
seems<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:06.000> though<00:02:06.630> you're<00:02:06.869> almost<00:02:07.020> like

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
seems as though you're almost like

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
seems as though you're almost like
looking<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.039> front<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.579> and<00:02:08.850> it's

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
looking out in front of you and it's

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
looking out in front of you and it's
causing<00:02:09.539> your<00:02:09.750> head<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:10.769> shoulders<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
causing your head and your shoulders to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640 
causing your head and your shoulders to
kind<00:02:11.549> of<00:02:11.640> turn<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.269> side<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.620> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
kind of turn to the side so you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
kind of turn to the side so you
definitely<00:02:14.100> don't<00:02:14.400> want<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.329> just

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
definitely don't want to do that so just

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.690 
definitely don't want to do that so just
practice<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.110> motion<00:02:16.590> right<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:17.340> whole

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
practice this motion right here a whole

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.030 
practice this motion right here a whole
bunch<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.660> actually<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.739> motion

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
bunch and you actually have this motion

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.430 
bunch and you actually have this motion

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
being it straight cool so the other

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.880 
being it straight cool so the other
thing<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.750> would<00:02:54.930> suggest<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.740> is

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
thing that I would suggest for you is

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.370 
thing that I would suggest for you is
start<00:02:56.430> doing<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.850> with<00:02:57.060> some<00:02:57.090> speed<00:02:57.750> that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
start doing this with some speed that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.860 
start doing this with some speed that
might<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.830> handle<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.490> for<00:02:59.850> ya<00:03:00.090> because<00:03:00.750> if

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
might just handle it for ya because if

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.510 
might just handle it for ya because if
you<00:03:00.960> land<00:03:01.200> 90<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:02.010> some<00:03:02.220> speed

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
you land 90 and you have some speed

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.030 
you land 90 and you have some speed
you're<00:03:02.820> gonna<00:03:03.000> fall<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.780> your<00:03:03.870> face<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:05.010> you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
you're gonna fall on your face so you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040 
you're gonna fall on your face so you
don't<00:03:05.340> want<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.420> might<00:03:06.600> just

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
don't want to do that and you might just

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.450 
don't want to do that and you might just
correct<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.800> thing<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.310> you're<00:03:08.430> doing

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
correct the thing that you're doing

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.330 
correct the thing that you're doing
wrong<00:03:08.940> by<00:03:09.300> just<00:03:09.540> starting<00:03:10.110> out<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.650> little

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
wrong by just starting out on little

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.130 
wrong by just starting out on little
gradients<00:03:12.090> with<00:03:12.330> just<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.630> little<00:03:12.780> bit<00:03:13.020> of

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
gradients with just a little bit of

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.690 
gradients with just a little bit of
speed<00:03:13.350> then<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> little<00:03:13.890> more<00:03:14.130> speed<00:03:14.430> than<00:03:14.640> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
speed then a little more speed than a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.480 
speed then a little more speed than a
little<00:03:14.970> more<00:03:15.120> speed<00:03:15.530> cool<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:16.770> yeah<00:03:17.070> just<00:03:17.370> like

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
little more speed cool so yeah just like

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.300 
little more speed cool so yeah just like
