00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
a few simple fresh ingredients we're

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.800 
a few simple fresh ingredients we're
going<00:00:19.400> to<00:00:19.460> start<00:00:19.790> with<00:00:20.710> 2<00:00:21.710> teaspoons<00:00:22.369> of<00:00:22.640> sugar

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
going to start with 2 teaspoons of sugar

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.470 
going to start with 2 teaspoons of sugar
and<00:00:25.210> about<00:00:26.210> a<00:00:26.239> half<00:00:26.660> of<00:00:26.989> a<00:00:27.710> lime<00:00:28.279> chopped<00:00:29.239> up

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
and about a half of a lime chopped up

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.679 
and about a half of a lime chopped up
now<00:00:30.110> this<00:00:30.919> is<00:00:31.070> more<00:00:31.399> lime<00:00:31.700> than<00:00:31.970> you<00:00:32.119> normally

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
now this is more lime than you normally

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.020 
now this is more lime than you normally
use<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:33.200> regular<00:00:33.560> mojito<00:00:34.160> but<00:00:34.730> that's<00:00:34.850> because

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
use a regular mojito but that's because

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.370 
use a regular mojito but that's because
you<00:00:35.210> don't<00:00:35.360> have<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.570> alcohol<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:36.230> want

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
you don't have the alcohol so you want

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.410 
you don't have the alcohol so you want
to<00:00:36.440> bump<00:00:36.710> up<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.010> flavor<00:00:37.160> by<00:00:37.820> using<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.239> little

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
to bump up the flavor by using a little

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.560 
to bump up the flavor by using a little
extra<00:00:38.930> lime<00:00:39.190> then<00:00:40.190> you're<00:00:40.850> going<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.420> add

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
extra lime then you're going to add

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.529

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
right in there with the mixture and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.779 
right in there with the mixture and
you're<00:00:47.359> going<00:00:47.570> to<00:00:47.629> want<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:48.019> muddle<00:00:48.920> which<00:00:49.579> is

basically<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.480> fancy<00:00:51.469> term<00:00:51.679> for<00:00:51.739> just<00:00:52.460> pushing

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
basically a fancy term for just pushing

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.029

off<00:00:53.449> everything<00:00:53.870> together<00:00:54.199> in<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> bottom<00:00:54.920> of

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
the glass and what you're doing here

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.739 
the glass and what you're doing here
really<00:00:57.499> is<00:00:57.890> releasing<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.789> essential<00:00:59.359> oils

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
really is releasing the essential oils

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.069 
really is releasing the essential oils
of<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.050> mint<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:01.269> you<00:01:02.269> are<00:01:02.449> mixing<00:01:02.839> them<00:01:03.050> with

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
of the mint and you are mixing them with

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.010 
of the mint and you are mixing them with
the<00:01:03.620> citrus<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:05.000> get<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.180> really<00:01:05.480> nice<00:01:05.659> balance

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
the citrus to get a really nice balance

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.220 
the citrus to get a really nice balance
of<00:01:06.409> flavor<00:01:07.240> now<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.300> only<00:01:08.659> need<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.930> do<00:01:09.050> that

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
of flavor now you only need to do that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.020 
of flavor now you only need to do that
about<00:01:09.380> 10<00:01:09.500> seconds<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:10.430> do<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.700> too<00:01:10.850> much

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
about 10 seconds if you do it too much

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.820 
about 10 seconds if you do it too much
the<00:01:11.330> mint<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.750> get<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.930> little<00:01:12.080> bitter<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.740> you

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
the mint can get a little bitter so you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.340 
the mint can get a little bitter so you
really<00:01:13.070> don't<00:01:13.160> want<00:01:13.400> that<00:01:13.750> now<00:01:14.750> after<00:01:15.110> you've
