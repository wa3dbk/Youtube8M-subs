just the pressure of the bungee cord

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.960 
just the pressure of the bungee cord
press<00:01:20.330> them<00:01:20.570> up<00:01:20.979> towards<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.220> towards<00:01:22.789> the

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
pieces of cattail and I cut them all

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:07.719 
pieces of cattail and I cut them all
into<00:02:00.170> even<00:02:00.590> lengths<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.659> got<00:02:02.659> 14<00:02:03.200> pieces<00:02:06.729> let's

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
into even lengths I got 14 pieces let's

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.120 
into even lengths I got 14 pieces let's
see<00:02:08.049> one<00:02:09.049> thing<00:02:09.229> you're<00:02:09.350> going<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.500> notice<00:02:09.739> and

see one thing you're going to notice and
this<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.369> probably<00:02:10.610> true<00:02:10.789> with<00:02:11.150> everything

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
this is probably true with everything

that<00:02:12.799> you<00:02:13.040> use<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.239> cattails<00:02:14.750> are

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
that you use but the cattails are

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.770 
that you use but the cattails are
rounded<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:15.530> one<00:02:15.769> side<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.370> they're<00:02:17.060> concave

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
rounded on one side and they're concave

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.520 
rounded on one side and they're concave
on<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.109> other<00:02:18.260> side<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:22.400> rounded<00:02:22.820> side<00:02:23.530> is

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
on the other side the rounded side is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
on the other side the rounded side is
the<00:02:24.769> side<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.130> want<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.340> bend<00:02:25.609> because<00:02:26.359> if<00:02:26.660> you

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
the side you want to bend because if you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.330 
the side you want to bend because if you
bend<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.049> concave<00:02:27.530> side<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:28.160> going<00:02:28.280> to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
bend the concave side it's going to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:38.940 
bend the concave side it's going to
crack

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.060

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.270 
and take one of our other pieces with
the<00:03:27.030> curve<00:03:27.300> side<00:03:27.600> down<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:31.070> we're<00:03:32.070> going<00:03:32.220> to

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
the curve side down and we're going to

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:47.220 
the curve side down and we're going to
leave<00:03:32.460> it<00:03:32.580> in<00:03:35.930> we'll<00:03:36.930> start<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.010> center

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.680 

I<00:03:47.319> believe<00:03:48.099> that<00:03:48.310> Center<00:03:48.849> but<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.300> square

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
I believe that Center but we can square

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.309 
I believe that Center but we can square
it<00:03:49.720> up<00:03:49.870> later<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.540> next<00:03:52.870> one<00:03:53.019> will<00:03:53.200> go

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
it up later and the next one will go

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.390 
it up later and the next one will go
opposite<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:54.069> that<00:03:57.510> that's<00:03:58.510> pretty<00:03:58.810> basic

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
opposite of that that's pretty basic

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.970 
opposite of that that's pretty basic
basket<00:04:00.400> leaving<00:04:01.019> nothing<00:04:02.019> fancy

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
basket leaving nothing fancy

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.180 
basket leaving nothing fancy
just<00:04:03.220> going<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.459> make<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:03.640> square<00:04:04.209> basket

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.390 

that'll<00:04:09.190> be<00:04:09.280> good<00:04:09.430> for<00:04:10.650> an<00:04:11.650> all<00:04:11.920> gathering

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
that'll be good for an all gathering

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.759 
that'll be good for an all gathering
mushrooms<00:04:13.030> or<00:04:13.420> wild<00:04:13.780> edibles<00:04:14.200> or<00:04:14.379> something

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
mushrooms or wild edibles or something

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.750 
mushrooms or wild edibles or something
along<00:04:14.980> those<00:04:15.129> lines<00:04:18.359> even<00:04:19.359> these<00:04:19.690> up<00:04:19.959> just

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
along those lines even these up just

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.100 
along those lines even these up just
keep<00:04:21.760> weaving<00:04:21.940> back<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.240> forth<00:04:22.630> until<00:04:22.930> you

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
keep weaving back and forth until you

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.159 
keep weaving back and forth until you
got<00:04:23.350> all<00:04:23.560> seven<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:24.190> these<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.300> there<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.780> make

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
got all seven of these in there and make

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:39.220 
got all seven of these in there and make
sure<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:27.460> keep<00:04:27.699> that<00:04:27.760> curved<00:04:28.300> side<00:04:28.720> down

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.740 

so<00:04:40.230> there's<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
so there's the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
so there's the
bottom<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.140> basket<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:44.440> think<00:04:44.620> what

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
bottom of the basket and I think what

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.050 
bottom of the basket and I think what
I'm<00:04:44.860> going<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:45.010> do<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.400> I'm<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.760> actually

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
I'm going to do is I'm going to actually

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.700 
I'm going to do is I'm going to actually
bring<00:04:46.570> these<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:46.930> tighter<00:04:48.750> because<00:04:49.750> if<00:04:50.560> I

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
bring these in tighter because if I

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.880 
bring these in tighter because if I
don't<00:04:51.990> I'm<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.230> going<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.470> have<00:04:53.650> enough

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
don't I'm not going to have enough

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:02.770 
don't I'm not going to have enough
material<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.550> build<00:04:54.910> my<00:04:55.090> sides

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.450 

so<00:05:03.470> we'll<00:05:03.620> just<00:05:03.770> bring<00:05:03.920> them<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.250> little

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
so we'll just bring them in a little

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:16.010 
so we'll just bring them in a little
tighter<00:05:04.820> like<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:08.800> stream<00:05:09.800> them<00:05:10.010> up

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:24.590 

good

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.420 

once<00:05:25.230> you<00:05:25.350> get<00:05:25.440> them<00:05:25.620> all<00:05:25.710> in<00:05:25.950> there<00:05:26.100> then<00:05:26.310> you

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
once you get them all in there then you

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:36.800 
once you get them all in there then you
can<00:05:26.580> bring<00:05:26.790> them<00:05:26.910> in<00:05:27.030> as<00:05:27.180> tight<00:05:27.390> as<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:27.600> want

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.870 

you
