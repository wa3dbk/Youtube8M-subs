it so far and yeah I would consider that

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
it so far and yeah I would consider that
pretty<00:00:33.629> well<00:00:33.809> broken<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.289> especially<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
pretty well broken in especially for a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.740 
pretty well broken in especially for a

Glock you know

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
Glock you know
realistically<00:00:37.500> they're<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.370> right

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
realistically they're good to go right

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.450 
realistically they're good to go right

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
the Tula did and I'm quite sure now that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.009 
the Tula did and I'm quite sure now that
it's<00:02:46.260> due<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.799> slicker<00:02:47.900> coating<00:02:48.900> that

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
it's due to the slicker coating that

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.960 
it's due to the slicker coating that
they<00:02:49.170> put<00:02:49.379> on<00:02:49.410> their<00:02:49.830> cases<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:52.459> no<00:02:53.459> problems

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
I forgot to mention the first thing is I

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.880 
I forgot to mention the first thing is I
did<00:04:49.710> notice<00:04:50.570> quite<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.600> bit<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:52.050> difference<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
did notice quite a bit of difference and

00:04:52.890 --> 00:05:00.110 
did notice quite a bit of difference and
not<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:54.710> muzzle<00:04:55.710> blast<00:04:56.930> but<00:04:58.070> recoil<00:04:59.120> it's

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
not just muzzle blast but recoil it's

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.560 
not just muzzle blast but recoil it's
just<00:05:00.360> that<00:05:00.540> this<00:05:00.750> brown<00:05:01.620> bear<00:05:02.480> compared<00:05:03.480> to

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
just that this brown bear compared to

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.750 
just that this brown bear compared to
the<00:05:04.050> lawman<00:05:04.470> when<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.220> compare<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.610> to

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
the lawman when you compare it to

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.760 
the lawman when you compare it to
shooting<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.300> brown<00:05:06.540> bear<00:05:06.780> this<00:05:07.620> is<00:05:07.740> a

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
shooting the brown bear this is a

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.820 
shooting the brown bear this is a
standard<00:05:08.420> pressure<00:05:09.420> ammunition<00:05:10.170> but<00:05:10.740> it

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
standard pressure ammunition but it

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.350 
standard pressure ammunition but it
feels<00:05:10.980> like<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.190> plus<00:05:11.490> P<00:05:11.730> when<00:05:11.970> you're<00:05:12.090> shooting

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
feels like a plus P when you're shooting

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.710 
feels like a plus P when you're shooting
it<00:05:12.450> compared<00:05:12.780> to<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:14.910> know<00:05:15.030> if<00:05:15.330> there

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
it compared to this you know if there

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.600 
it compared to this you know if there
was<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.870> minus<00:05:16.350> P<00:05:16.560> for<00:05:16.770> ammunition<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.430> would

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
was a minus P for ammunition this would

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.710 
was a minus P for ammunition this would
be<00:05:17.730> it

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
be it

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.920 
be it
I'm<00:05:19.080> not<00:05:19.230> saying<00:05:19.470> it's<00:05:19.650> weak<00:05:19.920> but<00:05:20.810> compared<00:05:21.810> to

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
I'm not saying it's weak but compared to

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.810 
I'm not saying it's weak but compared to
your<00:05:22.800> standard<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:23.700> know<00:05:23.820> CCI<00:05:24.780> or<00:05:25.820> Winchester

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
your standard you know CCI or Winchester

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.220

federal whatever American ammo that
brown<00:05:31.500> bear<00:05:31.710> felt<00:05:31.980> pretty<00:05:32.280> pretty<00:05:33.090> light<00:05:33.500> this

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
brown bear felt pretty pretty light this

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.240 
brown bear felt pretty pretty light this
one<00:05:34.650> had<00:05:34.860> noticeably<00:05:35.580> more<00:05:35.910> muzzle<00:05:36.690> blast<00:05:37.250> it

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
one had noticeably more muzzle blast it

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.490 
one had noticeably more muzzle blast it
was<00:05:38.400> snappier<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.180> it's<00:05:39.570> just<00:05:39.780> plain

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
was snappier and it's just plain

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.170 
was snappier and it's just plain
nine-millimeter<00:05:41.280> target<00:05:41.730> ammo

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
nine-millimeter target ammo

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.320 
nine-millimeter target ammo
so<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:43.320> guess<00:05:44.070> for<00:05:44.220> practice<00:05:44.669> that's<00:05:44.880> not<00:05:45.090> bad

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
so I guess for practice that's not bad

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.510 
so I guess for practice that's not bad
you<00:05:45.630> know<00:05:45.840> especially<00:05:46.110> if<00:05:46.470> you<00:05:46.590> have<00:05:46.800> a

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
you know especially if you have a

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.380 
you know especially if you have a
younger<00:05:48.180> shooter<00:05:48.630> or<00:05:49.340> an<00:05:50.340> elderly<00:05:50.820> shooter<00:05:51.210> or

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
a recoil sensitive shooter somebody that

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.730 
a recoil sensitive shooter somebody that
you<00:05:53.280> want<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.580> get<00:05:54.240> into<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.720> larger<00:05:55.260> calibers

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
you want to get into the larger calibers

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.020 
you want to get into the larger calibers
but<00:05:55.979> you<00:05:56.040> don't<00:05:56.160> want<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.340> overpower<00:05:56.760> them

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
but you don't want to overpower them

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.380 
but you don't want to overpower them
with<00:05:57.300> something<00:05:57.960> that's<00:05:58.940> snappy<00:05:59.940> in<00:06:00.060> it<00:06:00.180> and

with something that's snappy in it and

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.900 
with something that's snappy in it and
is<00:06:00.540> going<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.720> be<00:06:00.840> discouraging<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:02.700> brown

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
is going to be discouraging that brown

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.130 
is going to be discouraging that brown
bear<00:06:03.090> might<00:06:03.270> actually<00:06:03.419> work<00:06:03.690> pretty<00:06:03.870> well<00:06:03.990> for

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
bear might actually work pretty well for

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.680 
bear might actually work pretty well for
you<00:06:06.620> but<00:06:07.620> yet<00:06:08.100> it<00:06:08.280> was<00:06:08.460> definitely<00:06:09.180> noticeable

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
a noticeable difference in recoil and
