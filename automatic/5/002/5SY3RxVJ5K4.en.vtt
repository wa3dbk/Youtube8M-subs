00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello how are we with another video 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.009
 tutorial this time we're going to change what 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.460
 it is oil pressure powder what 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.460
 we have 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.320
 the reason why it was replaced is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.960
 because we have in idle witness 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.210
 oil pressure ignition 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.990
 obviously some values ​​the pressure is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.970
 well then for consequential then we're going 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.530
 to change the bulb you would know should 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.380
 pay the oil witness to stop 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.020
 change this bulb we have to remove what 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.690
 which is in the alternator and the sleeve of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.590
 ccoo address we can see this super 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.780
 chosen we do not have here on this side 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.720
 obviously that turn on which your 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.780
 degrees to this and then we're going to withdraw the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.890
 bulb are against nut nuts the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.080
 another pressure and nothing like that 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.080
 not too tight then it 's very 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.030
 easy to remove after modified something is 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.010
 Remove the alternator bar 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.339
 address here we have the new 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.339
 address 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.580
 we have removed 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.850
 carries three Dominican screws 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.440
 novak and the other can not be removed because 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.770
 the pulley is not avoided and the third of 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.770
 this side 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 oil 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.370
 to deal with the color of the 15 's 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.160
 oil 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.030
 track and on the alternator but we have 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.030
 destined radar 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 well then where we have 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.280
 the used now good not but 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.070
 apparently that is falling rather 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.290
 really this fails you have not bought a 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.030
 new look craft understands the heart its 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.030
 price is 80 pesos 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.769
 As I repeated, it is not so difficult 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.470
 we also need it to what is difficult is 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.140
 change or remove forgiveness remove the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.480
 alternator in the direction 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.290
 later on he will show us the wild 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.290
 West 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.000
 already started the engine that has been 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.000
 off 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.609
 and in seconds
