material and you dropped it it would

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.929 
material and you dropped it it would
stay<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> ground<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.280> doesn't<00:01:11.310> bounce<00:01:11.700> so

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
stay on the ground it doesn't bounce so

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.270 
stay on the ground it doesn't bounce so
it's<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.180> stable<00:01:12.540> still<00:01:13.350> shock<00:01:13.710> absorbing

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's very stable still shock absorbing

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
it's very stable still shock absorbing
but<00:01:14.430> doesn't<00:01:14.790> move<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:14.939> around<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
but doesn't move you around on the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
but doesn't move you around on the
forefoot<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.439> adiprene<00:01:16.950> would<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.580> be

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
forefoot that adiprene would actually be

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
forefoot that adiprene would actually be
a<00:01:17.729> bouncy<00:01:18.180> ball<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.470> return

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
a bouncy ball and so you get some return

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
a bouncy ball and so you get some return
from<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.150> feels<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> little<00:01:21.600> spring

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
nine half
I<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.720> snug<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.619> didn't

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
I got it a little snug because I didn't

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.469 
I got it a little snug because I didn't
want<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.509> me<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> ten<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
want to see you that for me a ten is

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
want to see you that for me a ten is
liberal<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> side<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.040> being

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
liberal on the on the side of being

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.580 
liberal on the on the side of being
quite<00:01:36.060> roomy<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.990> wanted<00:01:37.259> something<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
quite roomy and I wanted something a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.160 
quite roomy and I wanted something a
little<00:01:37.619> snugger<00:01:38.180> in<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
little snugger in this because this

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
little snugger in this because this
isn't<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> lightest<00:01:40.950> shoe<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
isn't the lightest shoe out there this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.990 
isn't the lightest shoe out there this
is<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> high<00:01:42.509> mileage<00:01:43.070> stability<00:01:44.070> chain<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
is a high mileage stability chain that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.219 
is a high mileage stability chain that
has<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:46.790> they<00:01:47.790> call<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> pro<00:01:48.689> moderator

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
has there they call it a pro moderator

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.800 
has there they call it a pro moderator
through<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.130> essentially<00:01:50.579> that's

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
through here but essentially that's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.389 
through here but essentially that's
increasing<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> stability<00:01:52.500> structure<00:01:53.280> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
increasing the stability structure of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.980 
increasing the stability structure of
the<00:01:53.520> interior<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.180> shoes<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:54.840> your

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the interior of the shoes so that's your

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.530 
the interior of the shoes so that's your
support<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.530> an<00:01:55.619> over<00:01:55.829> pronator<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.549> with

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
support for an over pronator and with

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.060 
support for an over pronator and with
that<00:01:57.810> because<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.229> sandwich<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.829> again

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that because they sandwich it again

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
that because they sandwich it again
between<00:01:59.250> two<00:01:59.729> pieces<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.210> their<00:02:00.630> adiprene

between two pieces of their adiprene

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.380 
between two pieces of their adiprene
plus<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.219> get<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> nice<00:02:02.820> soft<00:02:03.090> ride

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
plus what you get is a nice soft ride

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
plus what you get is a nice soft ride
even<00:02:03.750> though<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.140> stability<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.950> you're

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
even though it's a stability so you're

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
even though it's a stability so you're
not<00:02:05.219> filling<00:02:05.490> yourself<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:07.259> we

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
not filling yourself up on that what we

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
not filling yourself up on that what we
tell<00:02:07.680> people<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> really

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
tell people is this this is a really

good shoe at $120 when a lot of the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.850 
good shoe at $120 when a lot of the
shoes<00:02:12.510> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
shoes that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.230 
shoes that
have<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.130> much<00:02:13.370> support<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.030> much

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
have this much support and this much

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.970 
have this much support and this much
cushion<00:02:14.480> are<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.380> hundred<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.680> fifty

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
cushion are in the hundred and fifty

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.340 
cushion are in the hundred and fifty
dollar<00:02:16.190> range<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.630> really

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
dollar range and so this is a really

good option for someone that's looking

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.240 
good option for someone that's looking
into<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.720> high-end<00:02:20.990> stability<00:02:21.830> they<00:02:22.010> like

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
into that high-end stability they like

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.450 
into that high-end stability they like
the<00:02:22.460> cush<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.570> shoe<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.620> has<00:02:24.680> all<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.220> in

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
the cush of a shoe that has all that in

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.930 
the cush of a shoe that has all that in
there<00:02:25.640> but<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:27.020> price<00:02:27.230> tags<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.650> little<00:02:27.830> bit<00:02:27.950> I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
there but the price tags a little bit I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.960 
there but the price tags a little bit I
probably<00:02:29.660> got<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.900> 100<00:02:30.350> 120<00:02:30.980> miles<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.490> them<00:02:31.640> and

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
probably got a 100 120 miles on them and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.760 
probably got a 100 120 miles on them and
it<00:02:32.210> feels<00:02:32.480> very<00:02:32.780> similar<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.590> other

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
it feels very similar to the other

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.290 
it feels very similar to the other
sequence<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.520> I've<00:02:34.640> tested<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.270> past

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
sequence that I've tested in the past

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.230 
sequence that I've tested in the past
what<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> would<00:02:36.470> tell<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.340> does<00:02:37.610> fit<00:02:38.210> a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
what I would tell you is it does fit a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.490 
what I would tell you is it does fit a
little<00:02:38.510> snugger<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.110> feels<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.410> little

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
little snugger so it feels a little

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.960 
little snugger so it feels a little
smoother<00:02:40.010> on<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.280> road<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.670> me

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
smoother on the road to me

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.750 
smoother on the road to me
a<00:02:41.000> little<00:02:41.570> quicker<00:02:42.530> feeling<00:02:43.040> but<00:02:43.400> it's<00:02:43.550> still

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
a little quicker feeling but it's still

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.330 
a little quicker feeling but it's still
a<00:02:43.820> high<00:02:44.180> mileage<00:02:44.590> very<00:02:45.590> Christian<00:02:46.070> trainer
