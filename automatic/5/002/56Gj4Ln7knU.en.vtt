00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
surgery so it hurt pretty bad but I knew

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
surgery so it hurt pretty bad but I knew
it<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.200> worth<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> just

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it was going to be worth it so I just

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.639 
it was going to be worth it so I just
spared<00:00:41.579> through<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> pain<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.469> once<00:00:43.469> they

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
spared through the pain and once they

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.260 
spared through the pain and once they
finally<00:00:43.890> took<00:00:44.399> him<00:00:44.550> off<00:00:44.640> i<00:00:44.820> looked<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.180> the
