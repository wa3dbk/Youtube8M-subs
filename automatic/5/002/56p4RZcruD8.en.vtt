here and a little lever and the idea
with<00:05:36.700> this<00:05:36.910> is<00:05:40.440> you<00:05:41.440> can<00:05:41.500> make<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.800> pinching

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
with this is you can make a pinching

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.390 
with this is you can make a pinching
attack<00:05:42.640> of<00:05:42.820> his<00:05:42.910> hand<00:05:43.380> I'm<00:05:44.380> surprised<00:05:44.980> that

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
attack of his hand I'm surprised that

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.570 
attack of his hand I'm surprised that
with<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.300> 10th<00:05:46.840> anniversary<00:05:47.550> Megatron

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
with the 10th anniversary Megatron

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.690 
with the 10th anniversary Megatron
didn't<00:05:49.240> actually<00:05:49.419> have<00:05:49.750> this<00:05:49.960> removable

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
didn't actually have this removable

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.190 
didn't actually have this removable
there<00:05:51.700> is<00:05:51.850> a<00:05:51.880> smaller<00:05:52.300> Megatron<00:05:52.900> that<00:05:53.080> was

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
there is a smaller Megatron that was

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.730 
there is a smaller Megatron that was
reissued<00:05:54.120> same<00:05:55.120> idea<00:05:55.479> is<00:05:55.540> this<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:56.080> lot<00:05:56.380> smaller

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
reissued same idea is this a lot smaller

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.210 
reissued same idea is this a lot smaller
though<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:58.200> he<00:05:59.200> actually<00:05:59.500> had<00:05:59.620> his<00:05:59.650> own<00:05:59.860> hand

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
though and he actually had his own hand

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.060 
though and he actually had his own hand
and<00:06:00.460> then<00:06:01.090> this<00:06:01.270> part<00:06:01.600> could<00:06:01.720> come<00:06:01.900> off<00:06:02.080> kind

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
and then this part could come off kind

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.590 
and then this part could come off kind
of<00:06:03.130> wish<00:06:03.250> they<00:06:03.430> had<00:06:03.520> done<00:06:03.729> that<00:06:03.910> in<00:06:04.090> this<00:06:04.270> in

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
of wish they had done that in this in

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.830 
of wish they had done that in this in
this<00:06:04.960> figure<00:06:05.590> but<00:06:06.400> it's<00:06:07.150> not<00:06:07.300> too<00:06:07.479> big<00:06:07.660> of<00:06:07.690> a

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
this figure but it's not too big of a

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:16.010 
this figure but it's not too big of a
deal<00:06:11.160> he<00:06:12.160> also<00:06:12.310> has<00:06:12.760> his<00:06:13.350> dinosaur<00:06:14.350> hand

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
deal he also has his dinosaur hand

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.270 
deal he also has his dinosaur hand
squirting<00:06:17.020> feature<00:06:17.230> can<00:06:17.560> still<00:06:17.830> be<00:06:17.950> done<00:06:18.100> in

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
squirting feature can still be done in

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.960 
squirting feature can still be done in
this<00:06:18.370> mode<00:06:20.070> and<00:06:21.840> his<00:06:22.840> either<00:06:23.080> gimmick<00:06:23.500> is

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
this mode and his either gimmick is

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.910 
this mode and his either gimmick is
there's<00:06:24.970> two<00:06:25.420> little<00:06:25.980> disks<00:06:26.980> here<00:06:28.770> you<00:06:29.770> can

actually move these out and then when

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.790 
actually move these out and then when
they're<00:06:33.940> in<00:06:33.970> that<00:06:34.090> position<00:06:34.740> there's<00:06:35.740> a

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
they're in that position there's a

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.560 
they're in that position there's a
