mmm<00:03:43.880> upload<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:45.490> mean<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:47.030> shouldn't<00:03:47.270> take<00:03:47.390> that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
mmm upload I mean it shouldn't take that

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.360 
mmm upload I mean it shouldn't take that
long<00:03:47.720> depending<00:03:48.320> on<00:03:48.380> how<00:03:48.470> long<00:03:48.620> how<00:03:48.920> big<00:03:49.160> of<00:03:49.250> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
long depending on how long how big of a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.980 
long depending on how long how big of a
file<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.210> I<00:03:50.270> think<00:03:50.480> this<00:03:50.540> one's<00:03:50.750> for

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
file it is but I think this one's for

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.620 
file it is but I think this one's for
minutes<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:51.650> I'll<00:03:51.860> think<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.790> will<00:03:53.000> take<00:03:53.600> a

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
minutes so I'll think it will take a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.860 
minutes so I'll think it will take a
little<00:03:53.840> bit<00:03:53.990> of<00:03:54.080> time<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.710> does<00:03:54.890> work<00:03:55.870> if

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
little bit of time but it does work if

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.160 
little bit of time but it does work if
you<00:03:57.080> need<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:59.030> link<00:03:59.300> again<00:03:59.630> i<00:03:59.870> will<00:04:00.020> post
