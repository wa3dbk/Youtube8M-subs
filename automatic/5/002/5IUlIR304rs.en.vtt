00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.789 
I'm looking at it and it looked a little
off<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:11.100> was<00:02:11.160> kind<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.730> pierce

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
off like it was kind of pierce

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.069 
off like it was kind of pierce
diagonally<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:15.299> let<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.510> sit<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
diagonally and I let it sit there for a

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.800 
diagonally and I let it sit there for a
couple<00:02:16.350> hours<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:17.130> put<00:02:17.549> ice<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
couple hours I put ice on it so the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.210 
couple hours I put ice on it so the
swelling<00:02:18.930> would<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.380> down<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.829> bit<00:02:20.010> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
swelling would go down a little bit I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.770 
swelling would go down a little bit I
thought<00:02:20.880> maybe<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.269> was<00:02:21.329> a<00:02:21.389> little<00:02:21.630> off

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
thought maybe it was a little off

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.539 
thought maybe it was a little off
because<00:02:22.109> of<00:02:22.139> the<00:02:22.350> swelling<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.370> went

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
because of the swelling and I went

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.660 
because of the swelling and I went
through<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:23.910> full<00:02:24.180> day

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
through one full day

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.010 
through one full day
and<00:02:25.440> I've<00:02:26.440> had<00:02:26.650> piercings<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:28.000> was<00:02:28.870> just

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
and I've had piercings so I was just

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.740 
and I've had piercings so I was just
like<00:02:29.200> no<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:31.000> too<00:02:31.150> crooked<00:02:31.330> for<00:02:31.599> me<00:02:31.660> to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
like no it's too crooked for me to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.380 
like no it's too crooked for me to
handle<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:33.040> took<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.489> out<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:33.819> waited<00:02:34.120> about<00:02:34.270> a

super duper surprised because I thought
that<00:03:15.549> getting<00:03:15.670> my<00:03:15.850> septum<00:03:16.239> pierced<00:03:16.450> would<00:03:16.540> be

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
that getting my septum pierced would be

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.520 
that getting my septum pierced would be
like<00:03:16.870> or<00:03:17.470> agonizing<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.610> wasn't<00:03:19.060> my<00:03:20.049> eyes<00:03:20.230> to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
piercing hurt as much as my septum did

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.920 
piercing hurt as much as my septum did
the<00:03:37.000> second<00:03:37.510> time<00:03:37.810> around<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.540> asked<00:03:40.870> my

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the second time around and I asked my

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.870 
the second time around and I asked my
piercer<00:03:41.260> about<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.590> afterwards<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.609> he<00:03:42.640> said

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
piercer about it afterwards and he said

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.099 
piercer about it afterwards and he said
that<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.810> was<00:03:43.989> probably<00:03:44.980> because<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.870> scar

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
that it was probably because of the scar

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.020 
that it was probably because of the scar
tissue<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.739> because<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.430> had<00:03:48.519> waited<00:03:48.640> like

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
tissue and because it I had waited like

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.610 
tissue and because it I had waited like
almost<00:03:49.660> three<00:03:49.780> months<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.320> was<00:03:50.410> still

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
almost three months so it was still

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.979 
almost three months so it was still
healing<00:03:51.549> still<00:03:52.120> healing<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.660> was<00:03:52.780> I

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
healing still healing so it was I

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.020 
healing still healing so it was I
couldn't<00:03:53.500> feel<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.430> was<00:03:54.519> sore<00:03:54.760> anymore

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
couldn't feel that it was sore anymore

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.970 
couldn't feel that it was sore anymore
but<00:03:55.420> he<00:03:55.780> said<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.170> it<00:03:56.260> was<00:03:56.350> probably<00:03:56.650> still

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
but he said that it was probably still

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.569 
but he said that it was probably still
healing<00:03:57.609> internally<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.470> was<00:03:59.709> why<00:04:00.549> it

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
healing internally and that was why it

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.110

thing<00:05:27.470> ever<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:28.729> thing<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:29.030> hurt<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.240> most

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
thing ever the thing that hurt the most

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.659 
thing ever the thing that hurt the most
other<00:05:29.780> than<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.349> piercing<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:31.070> suppose<00:05:31.460> would

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
other than the piercing I suppose would

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.890 
other than the piercing I suppose would
be<00:05:31.820> him<00:05:32.180> putting<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.449> jewelry<00:05:32.870> in<00:05:32.990> that<00:05:33.229> hurt

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
be him putting the jewelry in that hurt

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.850 
be him putting the jewelry in that hurt
probably<00:05:35.900> more<00:05:36.020> than<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.229> piercing<00:05:36.590> but<00:05:36.740> the

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
probably more than the piercing but the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.070 
probably more than the piercing but the
piercing<00:05:37.190> was<00:05:37.370> definitely<00:05:38.000> really<00:05:38.270> not<00:05:38.690> that

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
piercing was definitely really not that

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.270
