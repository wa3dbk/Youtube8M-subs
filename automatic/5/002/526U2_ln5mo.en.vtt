 my channel and today we will bake 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.490
 potatoes with vegetables in the oven will 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.330
 bake in milk 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.190
 cheese and so we need potatoes 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.400
 better to take medium sized potatoes 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.760
 approximately so that the potatoes were 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.060
 the carrot will go the same next 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.269
 zucchini onion 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 spinach cheese which we riot at the end 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.710
 sprinkle milk or cream that you 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.780
 Naturally salt spices I have here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.000
 the coriander herb has a nut tree so for 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.360
 start we need to prepare our vegetables 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.350
 For baking, you need to start 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.739
 take potatoes from me same potatoes 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.600
 washed and we make cuts in potatoes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.369
 not completely like that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.250
 I won't do too thin 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.650
 this way you can stuff 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 potatoes anything that we have here 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.829
 then take the zucchini and cut into 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.829
