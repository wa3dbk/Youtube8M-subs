00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.030
 a battery compartment made of plastic prevents 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.970
 a rattling of small batteries in the

 the flashlight is operated 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:03.830

 but with 223 lithium batteries 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.940
 in total, the oled m20 maria is 15 8 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.130
 cm long 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.470

 Gold plated contacts and one 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.220
 electronic regulation for one 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.660
 as constant as possible lighting ensures 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.420
 The housing of the lamp is made of hard 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.610
 analyzed aluminum made the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.519
 lens is made of glass and was both sides 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.790
 The m20 maria is anti-reflective 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.110
 waterproof to mpx eight standard 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.349
 In addition, it meets the flashlight 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.950
 the mil std 810f standard of the us 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.950
 military 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.940
 we come to the lighting in the m20 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.970
 yes it is a war party five led 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.400
 installed in the brightest mode it brings the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.610
 lamp with it to 3 120 lumens luminosity 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.890
 In this mode, the lamp holds around four 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.690
 hours through 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.720
 the elf offers about eleven hours of lightning duration 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.060
 oled in middle mode here owns the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.450
 lamp then at least 100 15 lumens 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.140
 light in energy saving mode has the in 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470
 20 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.239
 since only five lumen luminosity for 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.420
 but the flashlight shines in this 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.980
 mode full 600 hours 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.040
 Last but not least there is one more 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.260
 tactical flashing light of the role-playing game 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.450
 reflector of the lamp offers a good 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.010
 illumination and a clean transition 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.010
 between sport and play 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.370
 Let's go to the conclusion on the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.040
 equipment a 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.050
 At the back the lamp has a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.010
 switch on and off 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.830
 is being used 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.320
 He is before Flecki and can be so too 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.460
 to Morse be used 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.830
 on the side is above it 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.740
 addition, a simple switch with the 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.650
 through the modes low normal bright and 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.990
 lightning is changed the unit 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.030
 has a memory function so that the 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.489
 lamp after all last selected mode 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.720
 is turned on 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.700
 the side button is pressed 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.430
 while the lamp is off 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.910
 thus directly the tactical flash light 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.250
 activated at the rear end is a barely 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.070
 the one enters a rolling away of the lamp 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.430
 uneven surfaces prevented there is 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.740
 also attached an eyelet for the country 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.780
 who prefers a more civilized look 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.240
 Can the combit ring against a smooth 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.740
 swap rings 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.250
 right after the bring owns the lamp 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.890
 a removable hold clip as well 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.720
 The allround is completely detachable 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.720
 located on the front of the flashlight 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.730
 we come to the conclusion that the olite m20 was 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.040
 yes we liked it very much 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.530
 this is partly due to the robustness 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.900
 the lamp so it is not just water 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.120
 and dustproof she who stands tall too 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.100
 pressure shocks and extremes 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.360
 temperatures 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.240
 In addition, it offers a great 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.280
 Lighting the lowest level supplies 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.590
 just enough light around cards 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.340
 to read without even attention 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.950
 excite 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.200
 the middle is used indoors 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.830
 complete rooms and the brightest supplies 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.540
 Range and illumination for the terrain 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.550
 In addition, the olite convinced 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.790
 the quick access to the flash and 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.310
 a very homogeneous illumination the 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.740
 rich equipment the modularity 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.070
 and flexibility complete the positive 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.190
 Overall picture from and also priced is the 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.420
 lamp interesting the olite m20 was yes 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.730
 it is already 75 euros to have 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:06.170
 Lithium ion battery and charger cost 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.170
 in sympathy just under 30 euros
