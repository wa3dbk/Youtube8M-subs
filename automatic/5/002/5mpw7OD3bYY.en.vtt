00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the question and multiplicative inverse

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.070 
the question and multiplicative inverse
is<00:00:17.039> represented<00:00:17.640> by<00:00:17.670> Zed<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.449> where<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.810> mean

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
is represented by Zed in where I mean

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.990 
is represented by Zed in where I mean
what<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> complexion<00:00:20.160> were<00:00:20.340> inverse<00:00:20.789> we

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
what if the complexion were inverse we

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.609 
what if the complexion were inverse we
do<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.779> means<00:00:21.960> simply<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.410> what

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
do and that means simply you know what

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.779 
do and that means simply you know what
this<00:00:23.130> means<00:00:23.369> simply<00:00:23.760> 1<00:00:24.000> over<00:00:24.210> Z<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.250> it<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.460> 1

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this means simply 1 over Z and it is 1

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.859 
this means simply 1 over Z and it is 1
over<00:00:27.390> 2<00:00:27.720> minus<00:00:28.170> 3i<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.689> next

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
over 2 minus 3i all right and the next

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.069 
over 2 minus 3i all right and the next
time<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.679> I'm<00:00:31.800> doing<00:00:32.040> I'm<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.079> divide

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
time what I'm doing I'm going to divide

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.200 
time what I'm doing I'm going to divide
and<00:00:34.380> multiply<00:00:34.800> by<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.250> opposite<00:00:35.760> by<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and multiply by the opposite by the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.729 
and multiply by the opposite by the
conjugate<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.960> journey<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.380> right

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
conjugate of this journey all right

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.010 
conjugate of this journey all right
so<00:00:38.100> 1<00:00:38.610> over<00:00:38.850> 2<00:00:39.420> minus<00:00:39.809> 3i<00:00:40.350> times<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.660> positive

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so 1 over 2 minus 3i times the positive

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
so 1 over 2 minus 3i times the positive
side<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:43.620> conjugate<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.280> always

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
side of this because conjugate is always

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
side of this because conjugate is always
negative<00:00:44.940> opposite<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> sign<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
negative opposite of the sign that you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
negative opposite of the sign that you
get<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> complex<00:00:47.610> number<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.660> minus<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
get in the complex number it's minus so

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.630 
get in the complex number it's minus so
plus<00:00:49.230> 2<00:00:49.710> plus<00:00:50.280> bi<00:00:51.020> now<00:00:52.020> further<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.680> 2<00:00:53.190> plus

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
plus 2 plus bi now further it is 2 plus

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
plus 2 plus bi now further it is 2 plus
VI<00:00:54.620> divided<00:00:55.620> by<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.129> minus<00:00:56.940> B<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.360> plus<00:00:58.020> B<00:00:58.230> so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
VI divided by now a minus B a plus B so

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
VI divided by now a minus B a plus B so
this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> formula<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.520> square<00:01:00.149> minus<00:01:00.390> B

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
this is the formula of a square minus B

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.930 
this is the formula of a square minus B
Square<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:01.109> square<00:01:01.680> minus<00:01:02.100> B<00:01:02.340> square<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.760> equal

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

Q<00:01:09.780> square<00:01:10.110> minus<00:01:10.220> VI<00:01:11.360> whole<00:01:12.360> square<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.409> 2

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
Q square minus VI whole square so it's 2

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
Q square minus VI whole square so it's 2
plus<00:01:14.189> VI<00:01:15.770> divided<00:01:16.770> by<00:01:17.360> 2<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.450> square<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.900> 4

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
plus VI divided by 2 is square that is 4

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.609 
plus VI divided by 2 is square that is 4
+<00:01:19.350> 3<00:01:19.380> square<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> 9<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.900> squared<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
+ 3 square that is 9 and I squared that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
+ 3 square that is 9 and I squared that
is<00:01:22.799> minus<00:01:23.310> 1<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.610> minus<00:01:23.640> 1<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.420> plus<00:01:24.750> 1

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
is minus 1 so minus 1 it will be plus 1

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.770 
is minus 1 so minus 1 it will be plus 1
and<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.040> 2<00:01:26.430> over<00:01:26.729> 4<00:01:27.210> plus<00:01:27.420> 9<00:01:27.600> 13<00:01:28.470> over<00:01:29.369> 13

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
and now it is 2 over 4 plus 9 13 over 13

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.789 
and now it is 2 over 4 plus 9 13 over 13
plus<00:01:30.979> 3<00:01:31.979> over<00:01:32.329> 13<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.470> more<00:01:34.650> method

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
plus 3 over 13 I we have one more method

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.380 
plus 3 over 13 I we have one more method
to<00:01:35.070> find<00:01:35.220> out<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> multiplicative<00:01:35.909> inverse

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to find out the multiplicative inverse

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
to find out the multiplicative inverse
of<00:01:36.540> any<00:01:36.720> complex<00:01:37.020> number<00:01:37.460> let<00:01:38.460> me<00:01:38.549> show<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
of any complex number let me show you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
of any complex number let me show you
here<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.060> must<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.780> been<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.110> me<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> method

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
here I must have been for me that method

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.639 
here I must have been for me that method
also<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.430> any<00:01:42.299> complex<00:01:42.689> number<00:01:42.780> inverse<00:01:43.409> but

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
also so any complex number inverse but

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
also so any complex number inverse but
the<00:01:43.740> converse<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.430> simply<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.509> conjugate<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the converse is simply the conjugate of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.819 
the converse is simply the conjugate of
that<00:01:46.259> divided<00:01:47.009> by<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:48.530> square<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that divided by the square of the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.359 
that divided by the square of the
absolute<00:01:49.890> value<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:52.950> we

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
absolute value of that right so here we

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
absolute value of that right so here we
have<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> conjugate<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.450> conjugate

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
have the conjugate of that so conjugate

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.889 
have the conjugate of that so conjugate
of<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.500> 2<00:01:55.950> minus<00:01:56.399> 3i<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.509> had<00:01:57.719> initially

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
of that is 2 minus 3i we had initially

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.170 
of that is 2 minus 3i we had initially
so<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> sign<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.920> changed<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.549> plus

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
so the sign will get changed as a plus

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.670 
so the sign will get changed as a plus
now<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.880> absolute<00:02:03.719> value<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
now and the the absolute value of the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
now and the the absolute value of the
complex<00:02:04.799> number<00:02:05.219> Z<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.640> simply<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.119> square

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
complex number Z is simply the square

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.770 
complex number Z is simply the square
under<00:02:07.380> root<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.860> let<00:02:08.640> me<00:02:08.759> write<00:02:08.940> here

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
under root you know let me write here

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
under root you know let me write here
absolute<00:02:10.259> value<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.190> simply<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
absolute value so that is simply the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.230 
absolute value so that is simply the
square<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.090> real<00:02:12.209> part<00:02:12.540> plus

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
square of the real part plus

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.310 
square of the real part plus
square<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.720> imaginary<00:02:14.680> part<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.310> is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
square of the imaginary part and that is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.520 
square of the imaginary part and that is
four<00:02:17.320> plus<00:02:17.680> nine<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:18.760> under<00:02:19.360> root<00:02:19.540> 13<00:02:20.290> and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
four plus nine that's under root 13 and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.860 
four plus nine that's under root 13 and
it's<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.070> square<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:22.150> will<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.510> simply

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
it's a square of that it will be simply

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.570 
it's a square of that it will be simply
13<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.440> now<00:02:23.560> if<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:23.830> break<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.040> probably<00:02:24.520> it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
13 and now if you break it probably it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.640 
13 and now if you break it probably it
will<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.730> 2<00:02:25.330> over<00:02:25.360> 13<00:02:26.200> plus<00:02:26.560> V<00:02:27.400> over<00:02:27.730> 13<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.840> write

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
will be 2 over 13 plus V over 13 I write

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.680 
will be 2 over 13 plus V over 13 I write
and<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> molecular<00:02:30.850> inverse<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
and this is the molecular inverse of the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.870 
and this is the molecular inverse of the
complex<00:02:32.050> number<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.320> different<00:02:32.680> 2<00:02:32.860> minus<00:02:33.310> 3i<00:02:33.520> I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
complex number of different 2 minus 3i I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.220 
complex number of different 2 minus 3i I
hope<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.300> understand<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.900> if<00:02:34.990> there<00:02:35.170> is

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
hope you understand it and if there is

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.720 
hope you understand it and if there is
it<00:02:35.320> more<00:02:35.500> confusing<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.980> us<00:02:36.160> for<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:36.490> please
