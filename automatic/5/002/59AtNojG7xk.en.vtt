00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.449 
them and the one has the widest
distribution<00:03:54.810> its<00:03:55.810> former<00:03:56.770> range<00:03:57.040> may<00:03:57.340> have

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
distribution its former range may have

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.600 
distribution its former range may have
extended<00:03:57.700> from<00:03:58.120> Macau<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.510> Hainan<00:03:59.070> now<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.100> can

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
extended from Macau to Hainan now I can

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.610 
extended from Macau to Hainan now I can
show<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:01.209> on<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.510> map<00:04:01.780> if<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.080> remember<00:04:02.500> to

and we can go back and see what I

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
and we can go back and see what I
created

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
created

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.430 
created
what<00:04:42.370> enclosures<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.150> created<00:04:43.570> here<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.290> can

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
what enclosures I created here you can

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.469 
what enclosures I created here you can
see<00:04:44.620> it's<00:04:44.860> it's<00:04:45.100> one<00:04:45.550> big<00:04:45.729> enclosure<00:04:46.120> really

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
see it's it's one big enclosure really

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.680 
see it's it's one big enclosure really
but<00:04:46.720> they're<00:04:47.130> separated<00:04:48.130> by<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.310> rocks<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.970> I

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
but they're separated by the rocks and I

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.570 
but they're separated by the rocks and I
quite<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:50.320> area<00:04:50.620> it's<00:04:51.010> it's<00:04:51.400> like<00:04:51.550> a

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
quite like this area it's it's like a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.280 
quite like this area it's it's like a
dead<00:04:51.850> end<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:52.360> once<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.690> go<00:04:52.840> there<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.169> have

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
dead end so once you go there you have

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.740 
dead end so once you go there you have
to<00:04:53.440> turn<00:04:53.620> back<00:04:53.680> back<00:04:54.250> processor<00:04:54.880> zebras<00:04:55.419> but

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
to turn back back processor zebras but

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.600 
to turn back back processor zebras but
and<00:04:56.200> it<00:04:56.350> down<00:04:56.500> purpose<00:04:56.979> so<00:04:57.190> that<00:04:57.370> we<00:04:57.490> have

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
and it down purpose so that we have

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.310 
and it down purpose so that we have
space<00:04:57.910> for<00:04:58.090> other<00:04:58.419> things<00:04:58.720> on<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:58.960> other<00:04:59.020> side

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
space for other things on the other side

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.280 
space for other things on the other side
and<00:04:59.590> not<00:05:00.040> too<00:05:00.250> many<00:05:00.400> widely<00:05:01.390> distributed

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
and not too many widely distributed

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.570 
and not too many widely distributed
areas<00:05:02.860> we<00:05:03.669> did

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
areas we did

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.210 
areas we did
lots<00:05:05.419> of<00:05:05.509> different<00:05:05.659> paths<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.409> go<00:05:06.650> in<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:07.129> go

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
lots of different paths you go in you go

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.460 
lots of different paths you go in you go
back<00:05:07.370> out<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:08.120> go<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.720> next<00:05:08.990> part<00:05:09.229> of<00:05:09.319> the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
back out you go to the next part of the

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.379 
back out you go to the next part of the
zoo<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:10.159> way<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.370> can<00:05:10.580> see<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:10.909> most<00:05:11.090> things

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
zoo that way you can see the most things

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.089 
zoo that way you can see the most things
rather<00:05:11.689> than<00:05:11.810> get<00:05:12.229> lost<00:05:12.439> and<00:05:12.680> then<00:05:12.770> need<00:05:13.069> to

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
rather than get lost and then need to

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.089 
rather than get lost and then need to
find<00:05:13.219> different<00:05:13.969> ways<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.419> get<00:05:14.569> on<00:05:14.659> at<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.840> zoo

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
find different ways to get on at the zoo

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.890 
find different ways to get on at the zoo
so<00:05:16.099> yeah<00:05:16.310> you<00:05:16.370> can<00:05:16.610> see<00:05:16.669> I<00:05:16.879> made<00:05:17.569> the<00:05:17.719> big

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
so yeah you can see I made the big

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.959 
so yeah you can see I made the big
wooden<00:05:18.500> wall<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:19.039> sort<00:05:19.280> of<00:05:19.310> separate<00:05:19.789> that

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
wooden wall to sort of separate that

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.779 
wooden wall to sort of separate that
area<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.479> you<00:05:20.569> can<00:05:21.199> see<00:05:21.469> exactly<00:05:22.400> where

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
area and you can see exactly where

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.179 
area and you can see exactly where
what's<00:05:23.629> gonna<00:05:23.780> be<00:05:23.960> behind<00:05:24.110> that<00:05:24.289> next<00:05:24.710> episode

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189
