00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.770
 the next parcel need to buy these 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.510
 many name scalpel if i woke to shower 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.260
 all is now an interesting moment 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.119
 here I find oh points cheated a 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:35.170
 here itâ€™s also empty here 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.940
 emptiness is fine and I won't be okay 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.980
 wean again came to us 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:45.280
 can trimmed come in lcs 912 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.460
 I had from remember 913 weighty 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.890
 so yes nothing, nothing here with us 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.829
 reshetochka I had 913 and 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.280
 accordingly , I have a device 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:03.520
 marching and products come here from 911 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.740
 and 913 either dump toyz v939 its 929 it 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.689
 quadcopter 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:11.290
 It means that the navy version we have includes 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.200
 Vertik battery somewhere there should 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.880
 be here to hike pavel easier 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 the battery is removed and all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.610
 so I absolutely cannot fall 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 parts I do not have it at all, then we 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.670
 open it or not open ditches and 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.580
 I can't spare too now 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.580
 normally hide that is impossible to break 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.900
 the backlight itself did not break 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.830
 here we are included as he is completely 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.200
 The battery is probably removed at 850 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.939
 milliamps really don't remember me 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.479
 it seems 750 which we put on 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.270
 all your 9 262 actually all here 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.259
 stick collector motors here at 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.960
 us installed and 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.869
 what's the front what's the back we 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.250
 the gear is passed as she is nine hundred 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.920
 thirteenth 2 servas 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.870
 fly barr well actually all now 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 try to build it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.040
 here they pasted this interesting with 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.610
 we will start it with a scanner later 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.060
 we will fly well, everyone understands that this 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.320
 helicopter 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.150
 certainly not perfect for the street 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.400
 because all the same fixed step 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.140
 blades with him and with the wind to him 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.500
 you have to fight for a fee until the end 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.220
 closes though it needs to be closed with light 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 have to fight and therefore it is better to fly 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.720
 in calm weather that is if you 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.020
 want to rate this 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.110
 helicopter 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:09.050
 here is the equipment that we turn it on from 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:11.790
 From 913 turn on the power and the button of 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.110
 so now probably equipment before 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.290
 shut down because it's so low on 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:24.010
 birds and actually does not connect 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:27.909
 we cut down we turn on all wadded disks 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.610
 all go away try years 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.560
 contact is so do not know now 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.290
 Let's try here to hang something but hardly 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.040
 hardly ever now give though no no 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:47.019
 I will risk 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:49.540
 somewhere brought him well, like everything 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.049
 there is not enough space here 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.299
 I will fly 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.819
 and then such a chop here all 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.940
 actually we will all see flying 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.579
 which one is faster and which one is generally better 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.889
 in flight this or 913 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.889
 Thank you all for your attention all the while
