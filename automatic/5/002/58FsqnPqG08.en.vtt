00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 I am sure that many photographers are amateurs 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.690
 ever asked yourself the question of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.599
 like all their photo equipment 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.960
 approximately of this format and size 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.570
 put here this one about frit or those 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.390
 more here is such a photo of the bag of course 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.390
 it is impossible but the way out was 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:48.780
 The first is not Russian for digital 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:52.769
 cameras open from behind 270 at 425 and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 150 that is 15 cm inside done 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:02.100
 quite qualitatively very seriously 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 reinforced so far up but actually like how 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.500
 Suitcase's still some special 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.210
 formats 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.539
 inserts to protect 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.420
 photographic equipment back case 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.090
 represents 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 pretty massive 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:29.670
 really massive classroom in it to mashke 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.399
 There is under every small things including 3 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.110
 which itself 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:39.570
 yes somebody your this evening what wants 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:45.870
 the back is ready to close normal 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.200
 double and very seriously strengthened both myself 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.399
 back is not detrimental 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.880
 I'm serious about the thickness of the shift and mounting 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:02.659
 Fasteks sea to a coward and sat down 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.010
 a few on the back a few on the shoulders a 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.980
 how much back 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:12.020
 Fedorov but besides this the most the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.990
 buckle playing the role of the backpack holder from 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.630
 horizontally your condition that is 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.810
 such a form 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.090
 this backpack can be opened and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.430
 use as a hanging table 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.730
 which will then decompose all the photos 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.310
 lenses and accessories and you can have them 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.430
 change right on you do not need to invest 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.870
 photographic equipment 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.950
 somewhere in near on the floor with us 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.000
 pocket 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.430
 moreover if the upper part of the pocket 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.830
 remind the garden of the grid and is what 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.849
 mesh then bottom pockets 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.819
 made by 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.609
 night to her that is, if something shove 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.560
 you can not be afraid that you but pockets 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.670
 breaks a cone 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.980
 the other side is for the most 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.050
 and one more special handles 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.840
 possibility to go there too 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.260
 fix some monopod 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.709
 the upper part without fear of passing but 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.209
 pocket or drop out somehow 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.930
 top handle usually to the bottom left 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:30.610
 This backpack has an icon 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:33.250
 tripod it contains a good one 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.550
 lengths still some such pockets where there is 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.260
 here is such a sticking out 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.549
 special holders where inserted 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.720
 tripod and lemon claude i.e. a tripod and 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.860
 fastened here and so on the top 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:52.680
 parts this closes all taxes 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.840
 besides all this , there is also a front 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.260
 extra pocket 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.240
 where you can also feed and tablet and more 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.000
 any gadget 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.430
 this material is quite dense 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.520
 the only thing would be more interesting this 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.599
 piece which by the way is removed to mount 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.970
 somewhere above 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.690
 maybe I should owe her here and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.239
 wish you 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:25.389
 on one side of the back also piles 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.919
 are he keeps on the skin here on 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.600
 braid 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.930
 protecting from were places and rain pretty 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.940
 not bad 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.350
 quickly hiding you why exactly 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.470
 this backpack 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.330
 quite skeptical different 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:51.300
 kind of minus outputs this unrealized 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.259
 ability to use a cutter in order 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.500
 to quickly replace quickly 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.840
 camera lens or camera this 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.240
 the most common case is when 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.430
 very quickly you need to change the lens to 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.400
 camera with a backpack is impossible and necessary 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.130
 it was going to take off somewhere and 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.729
 open invest again change 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.490
 we fasten on us 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:23.419
 the best way in my opinion it was 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:29.220
 realized you coffer was buttoned on 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:33.090
 the belt was always saving 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.050
 the photographer opened up and lay here 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.349
 always them 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:41.000
 its necessary and accessory filters 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.500
 option and then it was very comfortable 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.870
 did not need to go anywhere 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.770
 stop putting it all somewhere 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.250
 out all happened right on the go 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.250
 very fast 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.110
 in this language it became possible and 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.840
 q2 is implemented precisely because of this i 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.510
 and bought it when work 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:14.670
 I have a situation 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:14.670
 yes don't leave us a printer of this we and 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.770
 just hands 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.820
 already our movement together is put on 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.030
 original on the same to be yours 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.330
 is 199 dollars and the price is Chinese 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.040
 fakes just 49 dollars but what 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.530
 different from the original fake 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.540
 I did not understand the link to the store will be 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.580
 as usual in the description under the video all 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.580
 good luck and bye
