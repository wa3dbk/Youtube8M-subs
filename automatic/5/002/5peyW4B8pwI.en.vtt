first<00:00:12.990> thing<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> Thermaltake<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:13.980> CES

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
first thing in the Thermaltake for CES

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.950 
first thing in the Thermaltake for CES
2015<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.179> most<00:00:15.269> important<00:00:15.719> thing<00:00:15.809> we're

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
2015 the most important thing we're

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.750 
2015 the most important thing we're
showing<00:00:16.170> right<00:00:16.289> now<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.800> our<00:00:17.160> new<00:00:17.340> core

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
showing right now is our new core

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.330 
showing right now is our new core
x-series<00:00:18.359> last<00:00:19.140> year<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.470> CES<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:20.039> showed<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
x-series last year at CES we showed you

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.650 
x-series last year at CES we showed you
the<00:00:20.460> core<00:00:20.670> v71

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the core v71

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
the core v71
and<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.080> started<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.529> basically<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> whole

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and we started a basically a whole

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
and we started a basically a whole
revolution<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.820> our<00:00:23.939> cases<00:00:24.119> starting<00:00:24.900> with

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
revolution with our cases starting with

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
revolution with our cases starting with
the<00:00:25.109> V<00:00:25.289> Series<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> X<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.180> see

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the V Series now with the X you can see

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.269 
the V Series now with the X you can see
it's<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> cubicle<00:00:28.050> chassis<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.830> therefore<00:00:29.160> it's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it's a cubicle chassis so therefore it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.060 
it's a cubicle chassis so therefore it's
very<00:00:29.609> large<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.539> has<00:00:30.720> tons<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.619> space<00:00:31.679> for

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
very large it has tons of space for

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.340 
very large it has tons of space for
fitment<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> core<00:00:33.210> x9<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.110> full

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
fitment this is the core x9 it's a full

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.889 
fitment this is the core x9 it's a full
ATX<00:00:34.739> chassis<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.790> allows<00:00:36.090> four-way<00:00:36.780> SLI

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
ATX chassis so this allows four-way SLI

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
ATX chassis so this allows four-way SLI
video<00:00:37.290> cards<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:38.129> whatever<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> want<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> do

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
video cards or whatever you want to do

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.030 
video cards or whatever you want to do
for<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> crossfire<00:00:39.899> or<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.320> single<00:00:40.590> card<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
for a crossfire or just single card you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.619 
for a crossfire or just single card you
can<00:00:41.190> build<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.460> however<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.000> massive

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
can build it however you want it massive

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
can build it however you want it massive
liquid<00:00:42.899> cooling<00:00:43.200> air<00:00:43.350> cooling<00:00:43.590> you've<00:00:44.100> got

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
liquid cooling air cooling you've got

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680 
liquid cooling air cooling you've got
tons<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.700> options<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.180> fan<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.660> radiator

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
tons of options for fan and radiator

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.200 
tons of options for fan and radiator
mounting<00:00:46.289> then<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> look<00:00:47.039> over<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.700> you

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
mounting then you look over here as you

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.490 
mounting then you look over here as you
can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.870> cool<00:00:48.989> feature<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.379> these

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
can see one really cool feature is these

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.350 
can see one really cool feature is these
can<00:00:49.649> stack<00:00:49.980> they<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.059> screwed

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
can stack they can actually be screwed

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
can stack they can actually be screwed
together<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.440> become<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.980> solid

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
together so that they become a solid

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.639 
together so that they become a solid
single<00:00:53.730> unit<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.530> actually

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
single unit and then you can actually

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
single unit and then you can actually
build<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.789> ahead<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
build like if you're go ahead and take a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.200 
build like if you're go ahead and take a
look<00:00:57.660> around<00:00:57.780> over<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.309> totally

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
look around over here we have a totally

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
look around over here we have a totally
separate<00:01:00.690> liquid<00:01:00.899> cooling<00:01:01.320> loop<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.800> for

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
separate liquid cooling loop just for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.700 
separate liquid cooling loop just for
the<00:01:01.980> GPUs<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.520> top<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> CPU<00:01:04.019> liquid

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the GPUs up top and then the CPU liquid

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.200 
the GPUs up top and then the CPU liquid
cooling<00:01:04.890> loop<00:01:05.010> down<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> bottom<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
cooling loop down at the bottom so the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.429 
cooling loop down at the bottom so the
blue<00:01:06.360> ones<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.659> CPU<00:01:06.960> loop<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
blue ones your CPU loop down at the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.800 
blue ones your CPU loop down at the
bottom<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.130> red<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> GPU<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
bottom the red one is a GPU one so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.420 
bottom the red one is a GPU one so
basically<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.380> build<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.040> massive

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
basically you can build this massive

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.969 
basically you can build this massive
scalable<00:01:12.360> cooling<00:01:12.600> solution<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.830> can

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
scalable cooling solution or you can

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.649 
scalable cooling solution or you can
build<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.310> bunch<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.640> hard<00:01:14.820> drives<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.330> or

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
build a bunch of hard drives up here or

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.999 
build a bunch of hard drives up here or
even<00:01:15.810> two<00:01:16.049> systems<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.530> top<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.770> each<00:01:16.830> other

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
even two systems on top of each other

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.070 
even two systems on top of each other
the<00:01:17.640> limit<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.420> imagination

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the limit really is your imagination

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
the limit really is your imagination
with<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> new<00:01:19.439> core<00:01:19.650> x-series<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.790> let's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
with the new core x-series and now let's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.910 
with the new core x-series and now let's
take<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> look<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> next<00:01:21.750> size<00:01:21.900> down<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
take a look at the next size down the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460 
take a look at the next size down the
next<00:01:23.130> size<00:01:23.280> down<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.689> core<00:01:24.960> x2

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
next size down would be your core x2

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
next size down would be your core x2
this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> micro<00:01:26.400> ATX<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.479> talking<00:01:27.630> two

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this is micro ATX so you're talking two

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.870 
this is micro ATX so you're talking two
graphics<00:01:28.290> cards<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.460> smaller<00:01:29.759> on

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
graphics cards a little bit smaller on

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
graphics cards a little bit smaller on
the<00:01:30.150> radiator<00:01:30.509> fitment<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.350> overall<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the radiator fitment but overall you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.819 
the radiator fitment but overall you
still<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.970> some<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.450> cool

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
still have some really cool

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.380 
still have some really cool
compatibility<00:01:34.829> lots<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.640> dry<00:01:35.880> fitment<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
compatibility lots of dry fitment and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
compatibility lots of dry fitment and
different<00:01:36.900> liquid<00:01:37.770> cooling<00:01:38.070> options

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
different liquid cooling options

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
different liquid cooling options
available<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.140> thing

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
available and then you have one thing

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.660 
available and then you have one thing
will<00:01:40.470> sneak<00:01:40.770> peek<00:01:40.950> e<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.490> see

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
will sneak peek e here as you can see

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.340

gonna be showing you here shortly but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.109 
gonna be showing you here shortly but
that's<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.250> direction<00:01:47.759> we're<00:01:47.909> heading

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that's a little direction we're heading

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.370 
that's a little direction we're heading
from<00:01:48.180> Thermaltake<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.780> some<00:01:48.930> things<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.290> be

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
from Thermaltake so some things will be

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
from Thermaltake so some things will be
shown<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:50.009> kind<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:50.820> future

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
shown you here are kind of some future

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
shown you here are kind of some future
direction<00:01:51.540> we've<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.310> once<00:01:53.310> again

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
direction we've got going and once again

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.270 
direction we've got going and once again
with<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> core<00:01:54.060> x2<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:55.500> one's<00:01:55.710> stackable<00:01:56.159> as

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
with the core x2 this one's stackable as

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.459 
with the core x2 this one's stackable as
well<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.149> stack<00:01:57.329> two<00:01:57.540> three<00:01:57.990> whatever

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
well so you can stack two three whatever

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.539 
well so you can stack two three whatever
you<00:01:58.680> need<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.890> top<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.130> each<00:01:59.189> other<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.460> make

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you need on top of each other to make

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
you need on top of each other to make
the<00:01:59.670> system<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.329> want<00:02:00.540> obviously<00:02:01.049> one

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the system what you want obviously one

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
the system what you want obviously one
will<00:02:01.979> fully<00:02:02.310> support<00:02:02.399> most<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.420> anyone

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
will fully support most what anyone

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.300 
will fully support most what anyone
would<00:02:03.930> need<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.189> go

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
would need but if you want to just go

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.700 
would need but if you want to just go
nuts<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.240> far<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> want<00:02:06.710> now

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
nuts you can go as far as you want now

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.139 
nuts you can go as far as you want now
we<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.220> even<00:02:08.340> smaller<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.030> your

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
we do have one even smaller for your

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
we do have one even smaller for your
Mini<00:02:09.270> ITX<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.410> let's<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.679> take<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> look<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.160> Core

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
Mini ITX so let's go take a look at Core

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.059 
Mini ITX so let's go take a look at Core
x1

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
x1

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.789 
x1
and<00:02:13.849> as<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.569> see<00:02:14.629> core<00:02:14.959> x1<00:02:15.290> stocks<00:02:15.620> as

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
and as you can see core x1 stocks as

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.819 
and as you can see core x1 stocks as
well<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.939> core<00:02:17.150> x1<00:02:17.480> once<00:02:17.719> again<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.680> know<00:02:18.769> you

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
well but core x1 once again you know you

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:19.959 
well but core x1 once again you know you
give<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> little<00:02:19.250> because<00:02:19.549> it's<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.730> smaller

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
give a little because it's a smaller

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.970 
give a little because it's a smaller
case<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:20.719> what<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.469> have<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.650> fit<00:02:21.829> for

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
case so what you have to fit for

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.559 
case so what you have to fit for
radiators<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.939> let's<00:02:23.120> say<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.299> want<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.450> run

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
radiators like let's say you want to run

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.479 
radiators like let's say you want to run
