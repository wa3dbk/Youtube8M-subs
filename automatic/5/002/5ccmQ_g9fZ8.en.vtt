00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.790
 I'll show you right away how to stitch 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.160
 module and then we will make origami 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.890
 heart means we take the module yellow and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.669
 here in this bosom we insert this corner 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.439
 this sinus remains with us freely then 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:28.919
 take the next and also to this extreme 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.720
 insert and it will remain free 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.000
 look feel what we did 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.100
 these corners are not involved here 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 only inserted in the extreme 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.200
 now we take the pink module 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:50.040
 insert 2 yellow lalka it 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:54.060
 12 we fix again take the yellow module 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.270
 in this bosom we insert a corner 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.989
 and this side remains free with us 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.049
 This side will do the same 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.610
 this corner is free then find here 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.740
 free two corners we string again 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.690
 pink module and from this side also 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.420
 here they impose yellow modules again and 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.030
 thus until the end and it turns out that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 our heart begins to expand but 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.200
 Now we will collect further 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 forces to make origami heart 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 need thirty two yellow and 37 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.920
 pink modules let's get started 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.260
 yellow module is we will have a bezel 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.260
 the heart is the heart the heart will be pink 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.940
 we collect the module in this way 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.110
 insert the yellow module last 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.660
 pocket 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:18.510
 from this side and from this here now 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:20.790
 string light brown modules see 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:41.780
 it turns out okanovochka and middle 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:44.720
 pink now pink rows 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.950
 increases in the number of modules 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.950
 so our heart turns out 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.140
 volumetric as it should be heart with 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:06.170
 each time it gets wider and 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.170
 wider when adding each tank module 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.519
 so 6 row 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.050
 this is silk 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.050
 now yellow 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:58.190
 here is another rose 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:05:03.980
 weeks work and accordingly with this is the way 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.980
 Well, here is something worse emerges 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:22.590
 the palace I think will be enough so 3 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:25.040
 module section 1 2 3 4 yellow and again three 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.040
 pink 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:39.830
 3 at the edges again I insert the yellow modules 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.720
 what we do next 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:06:02.150
 we insert the yellow module on one corner 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:06:14.840
 once on and on one yellow like this further 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:21.760
 send pink 12 here again yellow with 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.760
 pink yellow 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:48.409
 now we only have yellow modules and 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.409
 completion 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:07:03.810
 this side does the same 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:03.810
 pink pink 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.210
 you 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.610
 and 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:50.380
 you have one more pink stayed at all 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:54.850
 now only yellow one more 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:58.570
 final module well here we have 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:03.060
 it was such an origami heart I think 

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.060
 it was easy thanks wednesday
