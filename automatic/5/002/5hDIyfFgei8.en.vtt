rotary engine just there a big ol holds
and<00:01:16.240> as<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.930> rotor<00:01:17.170> goes<00:01:17.500> around<00:01:17.800> it<00:01:18.009> covers

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
and as the rotor goes around it covers

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.760 
and as the rotor goes around it covers
and<00:01:18.670> uncovers<00:01:19.240> them<00:01:19.450> basically<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.500> what

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
and uncovers them basically and what

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.770 
and uncovers them basically and what
they've<00:01:20.979> done<00:01:21.190> here<00:01:21.369> is<00:01:21.430> re-engineered<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.300> so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
they've done here is re-engineered it so

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.200 
they've done here is re-engineered it so
that<00:01:22.990> at<00:01:23.170> no<00:01:23.590> point<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.369> exhaust<00:01:24.790> port

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
that at no point is the exhaust port

now<00:01:29.470> other<00:01:29.740> tweaks<00:01:30.100> on<00:01:30.400> our<00:01:30.550> rx-8<00:01:31.270> are<00:01:31.540> three

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
now other tweaks on our rx-8 are three

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.050 
now other tweaks on our rx-8 are three
which<00:01:32.260> is<00:01:32.380> kind<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.040> hotrod<00:01:33.280> Club<00:01:33.880> Racer

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060
