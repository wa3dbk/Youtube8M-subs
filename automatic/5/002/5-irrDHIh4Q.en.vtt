00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
stick so we have rolled up ajar into a

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.050 
stick so we have rolled up ajar into a
scroll

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
scroll

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.060 
scroll
now<00:03:42.660> what<00:03:42.990> we<00:03:43.110> are<00:03:43.170> going<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.650> take<00:03:44.040> a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
now what we are going to do is take a

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.020 
now what we are going to do is take a
knife<00:03:45.500> Treach<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.800> with<00:03:47.250> some<00:03:47.490> refined<00:03:47.970> flour

and then first cut the edges because you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.760 
and then first cut the edges because you
won't<00:03:52.560> find<00:03:52.710> any<00:03:53.160> filling<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.210> so<00:03:54.930> we
