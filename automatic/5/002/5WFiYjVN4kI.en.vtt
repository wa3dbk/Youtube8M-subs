obviously so far we've had point of

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.039 
obviously so far we've had point of
contact<00:02:33.950> with<00:02:34.250> at<00:02:34.430> nightfall<00:02:34.760> we've<00:02:35.480> had<00:02:35.690> made

a and now this is going to be awakened

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.699 
a and now this is going to be awakened
app<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.750> cannot<00:02:39.049> wait<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.379> play<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.590> for

app so you cannot wait to play it for
you<00:02:39.860> guys<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.280> think<00:02:40.760> each<00:02:40.940> extinction<00:02:41.599> episode

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
you guys I think each extinction episode

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.479 
you guys I think each extinction episode
gets<00:02:42.260> better<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.769> better<00:02:42.799> they're<00:02:43.159> really

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
gets better and better they're really

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.400 
gets better and better they're really
innovating<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.180> very<00:02:44.390> well<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.599> do<00:02:44.780> genuinely

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
innovating it very well I do genuinely

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.440 
innovating it very well I do genuinely
enjoy<00:02:46.190> these<00:02:46.370> extinction<00:02:46.910> episodes<00:02:47.209> not<00:02:47.360> as

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
enjoy these extinction episodes not as

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.030 
enjoy these extinction episodes not as
much<00:02:47.599> as<00:02:47.660> zombies<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.620> they're<00:02:48.799> still<00:02:48.920> there

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
much as zombies but they're still there
