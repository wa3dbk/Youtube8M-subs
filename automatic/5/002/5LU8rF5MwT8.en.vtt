00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.980
 Hello everyone, I am Han Shunquan. 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.640
 This teaching is Lazy vault 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 I take the left side as an example. 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 Place your left hand on the obstacle 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.680
 Right foot jump 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.420
 The left foot is raised after the right foot starts to jump 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.020
 Point to the obstacle 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.980
 Then repeat this action 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.360
 Practice the height of your left foot 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.520
 When you point obstacles 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.300
 Do not use the heel 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.340
 Just finish the first step first. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.380
 First support the jump after going up 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.080
 Put your right foot close and go outside 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.280
 Then put your right hand behind your body 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.260
 Then the body is launched 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.420
 Do it again 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.560
 Going up, the first step is good. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.380
 Then raise your right foot and go outside 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.560
 Push your right hand 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 Lazy vault is just like 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.560
 When you go up 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.080
 Originally you, then hurry up. 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 Push away 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 Do another one 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.260
 Go up to the foot and push it away 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.540
 After doing this, 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.680
 You don't have to point anymore. 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.060
 Will go straight 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 Will go straight 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.720
 Lazy goes directly 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 First landing on both feet 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.640
 Ah, if you get used to it later 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 You can split your feet down 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.680
 Split down 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.340
 Or you can change your feet. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.040
 Can 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.340
 See which foot you want 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.020
 Can 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.000
 Thief is a change of Lazy 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.500
 In fact, the change is actually very simple. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.140
 Just the one that puts it up 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560
 Change from the inside to the outside 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 Then the jump foot is the inner foot 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.400
 Do this to pull up and convert 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.140
 Very simple 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.380
 How do you do this at the beginning? 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.500
 Same as Lazy 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140
 Put your feet up first 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.220
 Put your foot up in step vault 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.320
 Then pull the foot out from behind 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.380
 The conversion is coming out 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.840
 Probably try to make it faster. 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360
 Click on the past 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.980
 Point past 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.200
 You will already do it after a long time. 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.920
 Put the outside foot into the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.760
 The outside ankle comes in 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.640
 The above is the teaching of Lazy vault 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.300
 I hope that you can all learn very happy.
