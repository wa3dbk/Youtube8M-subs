00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
he had me beat then just after the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
he had me beat then just after the
second<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:12.810> kicked<00:01:12.990> off<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.740> very

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
second I've kicked off got very very

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890

close to scored with that free kick and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.330 
close to scored with that free kick and
if<00:01:15.960> I'd<00:01:16.080> been<00:01:16.229> quicker<00:01:16.470> reacting<00:01:16.950> off<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
if I'd been quicker reacting off the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
if I'd been quicker reacting off the
rebound<00:01:17.520> perhaps<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.330> could<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.600> made<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.840> one

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
rebound perhaps I could have made it one

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
the one frustrating the amount of

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.510 
the one frustrating the amount of
domination<00:06:16.680> I'd<00:06:16.800> had<00:06:16.949> in<00:06:17.069> that<00:06:17.159> first<00:06:17.399> half

domination I'd had in that first half
and<00:06:17.849> not<00:06:17.969> been<00:06:18.120> able<00:06:18.240> to<00:06:18.419> capitalize<00:06:18.870> on<00:06:18.899> it<00:06:19.139> as

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
and not been able to capitalize on it as

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.019 
and not been able to capitalize on it as
in<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:19.860> second<00:06:20.219> half<00:06:20.339> it<00:06:20.490> didn't<00:06:20.789> work<00:06:20.879> out

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
in the second half it didn't work out

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.550 
in the second half it didn't work out
quite<00:06:21.089> so<00:06:21.330> well<00:06:21.629> we<00:06:21.810> did<00:06:22.020> manage<00:06:22.259> to<00:06:22.349> take<00:06:22.529> a

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
quite so well we did manage to take a

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.709 
quite so well we did manage to take a
2-1<00:06:23.039> lead<00:06:23.099> here<00:06:23.699> with<00:06:23.819> Podolski<00:06:24.360> absolutely

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
2-1 lead here with Podolski absolutely

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.389 
2-1 lead here with Podolski absolutely
well<00:06:24.930> Ian<00:06:25.110> it<00:06:25.229> past<00:06:25.439> the<00:06:25.620> goalie<00:06:25.800> into<00:06:26.099> the<00:06:26.189> top

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:26.399 
well Ian it past the goalie into the top

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:28.969 
well Ian it past the goalie into the top
right-hand<00:06:26.789> corner<00:06:27.180> but<00:06:28.050> that<00:06:28.379> 2-1<00:06:28.800> lead

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
right-hand corner but that 2-1 lead

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.070 
right-hand corner but that 2-1 lead
obviously<00:06:29.520> was<00:06:29.699> not<00:06:29.879> solid<00:06:30.270> enough<00:06:30.360> for<00:06:30.689> us<00:06:30.839> as

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
obviously was not solid enough for us as

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.990 
obviously was not solid enough for us as
he<00:06:31.169> played<00:06:31.409> it<00:06:31.439> out<00:06:31.710> wide<00:06:32.159> to<00:06:32.189> Palacio<00:06:32.759> here

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
he played it out wide to Palacio here

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.209 
he played it out wide to Palacio here
and<00:06:33.779> I<00:06:33.870> think<00:06:34.050> he<00:06:34.139> really<00:06:34.409> started<00:06:34.740> to<00:06:34.860> turn<00:06:35.069> it

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219

their<00:06:57.720> Podolski<00:06:58.199> had<00:06:58.380> that<00:06:58.530> gun<00:06:58.710> in<00:06:58.830> this<00:06:58.949> game

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
their Podolski had that gun in this game

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.080 
their Podolski had that gun in this game
would<00:06:59.190> have<00:06:59.310> been<00:06:59.400> a<00:06:59.430> completely<00:06:59.490> different

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
would have been a completely different

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.580 
would have been a completely different
outcome<00:07:00.449> but<00:07:00.810> he<00:07:00.870> got<00:07:01.020> a<00:07:01.050> really<00:07:01.259> lucky

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
outcome but he got a really lucky

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.260 
outcome but he got a really lucky
penalty<00:07:01.949> there<00:07:02.130> I<00:07:02.310> was<00:07:02.490> on<00:07:02.580> ultra<00:07:02.850> attacking

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
penalty there I was on ultra attacking

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.029 
penalty there I was on ultra attacking
just<00:07:03.690> think<00:07:03.900> if<00:07:04.020> I<00:07:04.139> pulled<00:07:04.440> it<00:07:04.500> back<00:07:04.560> two<00:07:04.800> Friel

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
just think if I pulled it back two Friel

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:05.960 
just think if I pulled it back two Friel
there<00:07:05.280> that<00:07:05.490> would<00:07:05.580> have<00:07:05.669> been<00:07:05.729> how<00:07:05.880> it

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
there that would have been how it

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:06.950 
there that would have been how it
would've<00:07:06.120> ended<00:07:06.240> because<00:07:06.509> I<00:07:06.660> would<00:07:06.780> have<00:07:06.870> gone

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
would've ended because I would have gone

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.260 
would've ended because I would have gone
back<00:07:07.169> to<00:07:07.320> balanced<00:07:07.740> or<00:07:07.860> defensive<00:07:08.400> held<00:07:09.060> will

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
back to balanced or defensive held will

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.120 
back to balanced or defensive held will
win<00:07:09.449> out<00:07:09.600> but<00:07:09.900> it<00:07:10.169> said<00:07:10.350> we<00:07:10.500> had<00:07:10.650> to<00:07:10.800> seal<00:07:10.979> know

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
win out but it said we had to seal know

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.200 
win out but it said we had to seal know
which<00:07:11.250> are<00:07:11.340> attacking<00:07:11.580> then<00:07:11.820> completely

which are attacking then completely

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.330 
which are attacking then completely
