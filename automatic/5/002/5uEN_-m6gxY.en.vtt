00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.330
 [Music] 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.730
 in a sole we are here I join 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.590
 see a motor to rest itself today or 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.900
 to teach how to make a lamppost 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.000
 day and night is worth saying right now it's 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.300
 day as we can observe but which 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.640
 when I do it at night automatically 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.800
 it is illuminated illuminates the area is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.150
 very cool since with the sensors of 10 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.150
 meters and puts do many things between 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 these among them this and I like 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.300
 enough to delete zones for example 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.550
 there I could put one lit by the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.570
 night is also much better to put 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 close tom that is permanently 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.340
 lit is very simple to do and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 as we can see is basically a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.789
 low piston a block of this in 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.379
 no zone and at night when it's 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.450
 piston day 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.370
 well the sensor emits the rest neither the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 Low sensor is OK but when it's done 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 night and does not emit remains or rise and no 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.120
 it has much more mystery worth 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 it's very simple and finally we're going to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.620
 build what to conserve is very 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 simple, the only medicine may be 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.420
 the piston and the sensor and at night by the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.190
 fourth but it has no mystery 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 first we do what would be the tower 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.229
 we put we put from height it is worth here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 we would put the reston block here 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 let's put a block same other 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.070
 block and another block and here we are going to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.250
 put a piston 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.190
 piston al is perfect but like that 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 retire and now we are going to put this like this 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.560
 A) Yes 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.850
 u and so it looks like this up and here 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.580
 we will put then the lamp is worth 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.440
 we'll cover this a little bit for 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.650
 that is better 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.510
 and we would put here it is midnight and is 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.390
 already made the good lamp would be missing here 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.220
 but that would already be done as 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.450
 we went to see is very simple to do is 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.640
 very cool so it would look good as well 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.900
 with stairs but well this already 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.370
 it depends on you I teach the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.840
 mechanism of you that of corais as 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.830
 you want 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.020
 you can also change the colors 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 we can use for example quartz we can 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.090
 use for example wood in any 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.860
 thing but basically it's the mechanism 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.929
 who dresses all today's tutorial 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.320
 but that you liked it and until another 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.320
 goodbye
