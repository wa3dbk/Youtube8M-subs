because<00:00:07.100> this<00:00:07.220> one<00:00:07.430> has<00:00:07.459> a<00:00:07.609> naturally

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
because this one has a naturally

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.750 
because this one has a naturally
downward<00:00:08.809> angle<00:00:09.230> that<00:00:09.769> creates<00:00:10.250> a<00:00:10.519> much

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
downward angle that creates a much

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.609 
downward angle that creates a much
easier<00:00:10.820> user<00:00:11.510> experience<00:00:12.170> and<00:00:12.320> it<00:00:12.440> also

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:12.619 
easier user experience and it also

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.859 
easier user experience and it also
maintains<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.700> airflow<00:00:14.119> it's<00:00:14.480> spring-loaded

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
maintains the airflow it's spring-loaded

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.009 
maintains the airflow it's spring-loaded
so<00:00:15.619> this<00:00:16.070> will<00:00:16.279> help<00:00:16.490> reduce<00:00:16.670> vibrations<00:00:17.510> hey

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.019 
so this will help reduce vibrations hey

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.790 
so this will help reduce vibrations hey

that right so how is this different from
other<00:01:19.580> backpack<00:01:20.060> blowers<00:01:20.360> they<00:01:20.450> might<00:01:20.600> be

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
other backpack blowers they might be

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.800 
right there okay and the other numbers
I'm<00:01:40.400> looking<00:01:40.610> at<00:01:40.700> here<00:01:40.820> on<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.000> back<00:01:41.120> 185

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
I'm looking at here on the back 185

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.240 
I'm looking at here on the back 185
miles<00:01:42.020> per<00:01:42.230> hour<00:01:42.380> because<00:01:42.620> people<00:01:43.010> are<00:01:43.100> always

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
miles per hour because people are always

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.540 
miles per hour because people are always
comparing<00:01:43.700> apples<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.300> apples<00:01:44.390> here<00:01:44.980> 510<00:01:45.980> CFM

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
comparing apples to apples here 510 CFM

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.730 
comparing apples to apples here 510 CFM
so<00:01:46.910> a<00:01:47.090> good<00:01:47.630> amount<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:47.900> speed<00:01:48.170> coming<00:01:48.410> out<00:01:48.620> the

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
so a good amount of speed coming out the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.870 
so a good amount of speed coming out the
nozzle<00:01:49.070> right<00:01:49.100> that's<00:01:49.370> right<00:01:49.520> that's<00:01:49.760> exactly

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
nozzle right that's right that's exactly

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.380 
nozzle right that's right that's exactly
right

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
right

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.240 
right
and<00:01:50.570> we've<00:01:50.930> also<00:01:51.140> optimized<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.040> speed

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
and we've also optimized the speed

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.200 
and we've also optimized the speed
that's<00:01:52.400> going<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.610> be<00:01:52.700> coming<00:01:52.940> out<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.150> the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
that's going to be coming out of the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.060 
that's going to be coming out of the
nozzle<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.020> reason<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:54.500> happens<00:01:54.890> is

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
nozzle the reason this happens is

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.399 
nozzle the reason this happens is
because<00:01:55.130> our<00:01:55.640> engine<00:01:56.120> orientation<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:57.020> very

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
because our engine orientation is very

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.370 
because our engine orientation is very
unique<00:01:57.740> we've<00:01:58.310> laid<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.270> its<00:01:59.480> side<00:01:59.720> sort<00:02:00.260> of

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
unique we've laid it on its side sort of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.800 
unique we've laid it on its side sort of
as<00:02:00.620> opposed<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.250> all<00:02:01.640> other<00:02:02.000> backpack<00:02:02.420> blowers

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
as opposed to all other backpack blowers

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.719 
as opposed to all other backpack blowers
have<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.440> orientation<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.190> nozzles<00:02:04.580> on

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
have the orientation of the nozzles on

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.070 
have the orientation of the nozzles on
the<00:02:04.760> back<00:02:05.060> against<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.570> back<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.720> these<00:02:05.870> right

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
the back against the back of these right

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.840 
the back against the back of these right
it<00:02:06.229> just<00:02:06.380> kind<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.590> comes<00:02:06.710> up<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.190> over<00:02:07.460> and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
it just kind of comes up and over and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.339 
it just kind of comes up and over and
then<00:02:07.970> around<00:02:08.269> but<00:02:08.599> I<00:02:08.659> mean<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.259> really

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
then around but I mean can you really

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.290 
then around but I mean can you really
say<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.159> makes<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:10.670> any<00:02:10.819> different

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
say that this makes it any different

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.030 
say that this makes it any different
because<00:02:11.599> it's<00:02:11.900> air<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.470> being<00:02:12.680> pushed<00:02:12.860> along

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
because it's air just being pushed along

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.099 
because it's air just being pushed along
right<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.670> really<00:02:13.819> is<00:02:14.030> but<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.689> got<00:02:14.719> to<00:02:14.959> think

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.109 
right it really is but you got to think

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.539 
right it really is but you got to think
about<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.409> this<00:02:15.530> way<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.829> it<00:02:15.950> easier<00:02:16.249> to<00:02:16.430> go

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
about it this way is it easier to go

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.790 
about it this way is it easier to go
over<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> hill

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
over a hill

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.980 
over a hill
around<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.070> corner<00:02:18.280> yeah<00:02:18.790> well<00:02:19.510> again<00:02:19.840> it's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
around the corner yeah well again it's

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.900 
around the corner yeah well again it's
air<00:02:20.200> right<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:20.830> just<00:02:21.370> trying<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.820> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
air right so just trying to get to the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.640 
air right so just trying to get to the
bottom<00:02:22.540> line<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:23.020> have<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.260> done<00:02:23.470> any

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
bottom line here have you done any

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.410 
bottom line here have you done any
testing<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.370> says<00:02:24.610> there<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> bigger

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
testing that says there is a bigger

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.270 
testing that says there is a bigger
difference<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:26.140> putting<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:26.920> way<00:02:27.130> than

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
difference in putting it this way than

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.950 
difference in putting it this way than
over<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:27.550> way<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:28.570> thing<00:02:28.780> has

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
over this way we have this thing has

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.140 
over this way we have this thing has
been<00:02:29.080> through<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.590> wringer<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.130> tests<00:02:30.580> we

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
been through the wringer with tests we

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.580 
been through the wringer with tests we
have<00:02:31.300> an<00:02:31.420> engineering<00:02:31.870> department<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
have an engineering department that is

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.380 
have an engineering department that is
completely<00:02:33.010> devoted<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.700> making<00:02:33.850> sure<00:02:34.030> this

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
completely devoted to making sure this

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.880 
completely devoted to making sure this
is<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.720> perform<00:02:35.080> better<00:02:35.260> than<00:02:35.680> any

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
is going to perform better than any

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.770 
is going to perform better than any
other<00:02:35.980> unit<00:02:36.460> on<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> market<00:02:36.820> at<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.540> price

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
other unit on the market at that price

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.540 
other unit on the market at that price
point<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:39.010> has<00:02:39.130> been<00:02:39.280> through<00:02:39.460> the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
point so this has been through the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.950 
point so this has been through the
wringer<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.000> stands<00:02:40.390> up<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.540> even<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
wringer it stands up to even the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.630 
wringer it stands up to even the
professional<00:02:41.500> units<00:02:41.860> which<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.190> run<00:02:42.400> up<00:02:42.610> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
professional units which can run up to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400 
professional units which can run up to
seven<00:02:43.030> eight<00:02:43.150> hundred<00:02:43.420> dollars<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.290> is

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
seven eight hundred dollars and this is

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.790 
seven eight hundred dollars and this is
again<00:02:44.650> 199<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.790> 199<00:02:46.480> okay<00:02:47.080> all<00:02:47.530> right<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
again 199 this is 199 okay all right and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.530 
again 199 this is 199 okay all right and
so<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.700> what<00:02:48.850> I'd<00:02:48.940> like<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.270> probably

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
so you know what I'd like to do probably

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.150 
so you know what I'd like to do probably
is<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> strap<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.680> know<00:02:50.740> just<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.040> kind

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
is a strap it on you know just to kind

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.540 
is a strap it on you know just to kind
of<00:02:51.250> see<00:02:51.490> how<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.970> fits<00:02:52.810> because<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:54.070> know<00:02:54.190> it's

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
of see how it fits because you know it's

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.090 
of see how it fits because you know it's
an<00:02:55.090> interesting<00:02:55.570> design<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:56.950> is

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
an interesting design it is this is

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.410 
an interesting design it is this is
another<00:02:57.370> place<00:02:57.670> where<00:02:57.880> we<00:02:57.910> start<00:02:58.240> winning

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
another place where we start winning

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.260 
another place where we start winning
with<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.750> airflow<00:02:59.230> yeah<00:02:59.680> most<00:03:00.640> units<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
with the airflow yeah most units the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.810 
with the airflow yeah most units the
engine<00:03:01.600> mounting<00:03:01.960> is<00:03:02.080> kind<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.410> flat<00:03:02.770> so<00:03:03.460> that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
engine mounting is kind of flat so that

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.120 
engine mounting is kind of flat so that
creates<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.600> kind<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.320> straight-out

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
creates a kind of straight-out

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.100 
creates a kind of straight-out
flow<00:03:06.790> for<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.090> nozzles<00:03:07.420> here<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> user

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
flow for the nozzles here so the user

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.870 
flow for the nozzles here so the user
has<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.560> bend<00:03:08.860> their<00:03:09.100> wrist<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.490> get<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.760> down

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
has to bend their wrist to get it down

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.000 
has to bend their wrist to get it down
crimping<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.570> hose<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.080> crimps<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.770> hose

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
crimping the hose and it crimps the hose

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.560 
crimping the hose and it crimps the hose
and<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.400> actually<00:03:12.880> causes<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.300> lose<00:03:13.390> a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
and that actually causes you to lose a

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.140 
and that actually causes you to lose a
bit<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.170> speed<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:15.040> because<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:15.820> one<00:03:15.970> has<00:03:16.120> a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
bit of speed so because this one has a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.050 
bit of speed so because this one has a
naturally<00:03:16.810> downward<00:03:17.350> angle<00:03:17.770> that<00:03:18.340> creates<00:03:18.820> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
naturally downward angle that creates a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.180 
naturally downward angle that creates a
much<00:03:19.330> easier<00:03:19.390> user<00:03:20.080> experience<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:20.980> also

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
much easier user experience and it also

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.880 
much easier user experience and it also
maintains<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.180> airflow<00:03:22.660> yeah<00:03:23.080> okay<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.530> you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
maintains the airflow yeah okay and you

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.380 
maintains the airflow yeah okay and you
know<00:03:23.950> what<00:03:24.070> I'm<00:03:24.130> noticing<00:03:24.250> here<00:03:24.760> I'm<00:03:25.209> always

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
know what I'm noticing here I'm always

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.420 
know what I'm noticing here I'm always
looking<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:25.840> stickers<00:03:26.200> right<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:27.010> one<00:03:27.190> says

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
looking at stickers right this one says

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.130 
looking at stickers right this one says
you<00:03:27.640> know<00:03:27.700> if<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:27.940> long<00:03:28.150> hair<00:03:28.180> watch<00:03:28.840> out

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
you know if you have long hair watch out

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.380 
you know if you have long hair watch out
so<00:03:29.950> let's<00:03:30.160> talk<00:03:30.340> about<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.970> we<00:03:31.060> can<00:03:31.180> pull<00:03:31.300> this

going cordless these days because it's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.330 
going cordless these days because it's
just<00:03:54.760> like<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:55.330> comes<00:03:55.480> on<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.290> like<00:03:56.440> so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
how hard or easy is it to start it's

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.840 
how hard or easy is it to start it's
extremely<00:03:59.830> easy<00:03:59.860> to<00:04:00.190> start<00:04:00.430> we've<00:04:00.700> got

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
extremely easy to start we've got

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.400 
extremely easy to start we've got
instructions<00:04:01.239> here<00:04:01.810> on<00:04:01.930> one<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.230> panels

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
instructions here on one of the panels

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.410 
instructions here on one of the panels
if<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.860> follow<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.340> instructions<00:04:03.670> you'll

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
if you follow the instructions you'll

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.060 
if you follow the instructions you'll
probably<00:04:04.690> get<00:04:05.050> it<00:04:05.110> started<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.620> one<00:04:05.830> or<00:04:05.950> two

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
probably get it started in one or two

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.650 
probably get it started in one or two
poles<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.580> very<00:04:06.820> easy<00:04:07.030> then<00:04:07.330> look<00:04:07.510> like<00:04:07.630> a

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
poles it's very easy then look like a

doing all right and one other thing I
wanted<00:04:12.550> to<00:04:12.640> comment<00:04:12.850> on<00:04:13.090> when<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.420> was<00:04:13.570> putting

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
wanted to comment on when I was putting

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.820 
wanted to comment on when I was putting
it<00:04:13.840> on<00:04:13.930> your<00:04:13.989> back<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.230> noticed<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.650> there's

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
it on your back I noticed that there's

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.780 
it on your back I noticed that there's
like<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.040> bit<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.630> squishy<00:04:17.109> yes<00:04:17.790> it's

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
like a bit of a it is squishy yes it's

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.970 
like a bit of a it is squishy yes it's
spring-loaded<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:20.380> will<00:04:20.590> help<00:04:20.830> reduce

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
spring-loaded this will help reduce

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.050 
spring-loaded this will help reduce
vibrations

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
vibrations

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.670 
vibrations
so<00:04:22.390> that's<00:04:22.630> just<00:04:22.750> another<00:04:22.930> element<00:04:23.530> that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
so that's just another element that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.470 
so that's just another element that
makes<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:24.010> very<00:04:24.340> comfortable<00:04:24.880> unit<00:04:25.390> to

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
makes it a very comfortable unit to

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.020 
makes it a very comfortable unit to
operate<00:04:25.540> so<00:04:26.229> you've<00:04:26.950> used<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.340> have<00:04:27.850> you

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
operate so you've used it have you

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.700 
operate so you've used it have you
alright<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:28.570> when<00:04:28.780> it's<00:04:28.900> on<00:04:28.990> your<00:04:29.169> back<00:04:29.289> I<00:04:29.560> mean

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
alright so when it's on your back I mean

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.930 
alright so when it's on your back I mean
most<00:04:30.100> you<00:04:30.370> know<00:04:30.460> engine

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
most you know engine

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.180 
most you know engine
vibrate<00:04:31.240> do<00:04:31.960> these<00:04:32.110> actually<00:04:32.530> take<00:04:32.710> vibration

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
vibrate do these actually take vibration

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.340 
vibrate do these actually take vibration
this<00:04:33.430> reduces<00:04:34.000> vibration<00:04:34.350> significantly

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
this reduces vibration significantly
