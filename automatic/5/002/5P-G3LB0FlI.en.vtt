00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.540 

okay<00:00:01.140> I'm<00:00:01.319> gonna<00:00:01.500> be<00:00:01.650> making<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.040> short<00:00:02.250> how-to

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
okay I'm gonna be making a short how-to

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.440 
okay I'm gonna be making a short how-to
and<00:00:03.210> an<00:00:03.389> update<00:00:04.850> I've<00:00:05.850> wired<00:00:06.180> all<00:00:06.359> the

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
and an update I've wired all the

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.190 
and an update I've wired all the
switches<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:08.480> one<00:00:09.480> thing<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.719> one<00:00:09.990> make

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
switches and one thing that one make

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.810 
switches and one thing that one make
sure<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.559> because<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.160> lot<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.370> people<00:00:11.550> wire

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
sure it because a lot of people wire

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.600 
sure it because a lot of people wire
them<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.179> track<00:00:12.450> power<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.580> vary

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
them to track power and that can vary

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.279 
them to track power and that can vary
depending<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:15.719> speed<00:00:16.529> control<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
depending on what speed control is so I

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.189 
depending on what speed control is so I
put<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.590> them<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.039> axillary<00:00:20.520> power<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
put all of them on axillary power so you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.419 
put all of them on axillary power so you
have<00:00:22.529> auxiliary<00:00:23.519> power<00:00:25.519> ground<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:28.310> want<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
have auxiliary power ground I want to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.020 
have auxiliary power ground I want to
say<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:32.180> deviating<00:00:33.230> track<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
say that's the deviating track and the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.530 
say that's the deviating track and the
main<00:00:36.840> line<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.550> total<00:00:38.700> there's<00:00:39.059> four<00:00:39.329> wires

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
main line so in total there's four wires

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.430 
main line so in total there's four wires
instead<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> three<00:00:40.710> three<00:00:41.460> good<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
instead of the three three good here and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.319 
instead of the three three good here and
the<00:00:43.440> rest<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> them

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
the rest of them

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.950 
the rest of them
I'll<00:00:45.329> need<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.410> here

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
I'll need up right here

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.770 
I'll need up right here
those<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.770> one

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
those just one

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.950 
those just one
you<00:00:51.780> only<00:00:51.899> need<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.140> wire<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.149> runs<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you only need one wire and that runs to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.150 
you only need one wire and that runs to
a<00:00:55.100> 14<00:00:56.100> volt<00:00:57.859> accessory<00:00:58.859> output<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:01.410> black

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
a 14 volt accessory output this black

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.890 
a 14 volt accessory output this black
wire<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:03.420> need<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.900> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
wire there I don't need it and it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
wire there I don't need it and it
doesn't<00:01:07.350> matter<00:01:07.850> what<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> track<00:01:11.490> power

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
doesn't matter what the track power

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.890 
doesn't matter what the track power
control<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:13.770> could<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.820> there

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
control is you could have it to there

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.770 
control is you could have it to there
you<00:01:17.740> could<00:01:17.890> have<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.400> oh<00:01:18.610> yeah<00:01:19.270> there's<00:01:19.510> still

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
you could have it oh yeah there's still

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.850 
you could have it oh yeah there's still
there<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:21.010> can<00:01:21.160> turn<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.790> off<00:01:22.680> lights<00:01:23.680> are

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
there you can turn it off lights are

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.240 
there you can turn it off lights are
there

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
there

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.730 
there
trains<00:01:25.060> are<00:01:25.240> off<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:26.140> it's<00:01:26.320> always<00:01:26.500> have<00:01:26.710> a

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
trains are off so it's always have a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:46.940 
trains are off so it's always have a
Content<00:01:27.250> voltage<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:30.220> all<00:01:30.310> work<00:01:44.580> so

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
Content voltage and they all work so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.910 
Content voltage and they all work so
yeah<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.430> they're<00:01:48.610> all<00:01:48.700> wired<00:01:49.680> I've<00:01:50.680> got<00:01:50.890> a

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
yeah so they're all wired I've got a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.680 
yeah so they're all wired I've got a
fifth<00:01:51.310> one<00:01:51.430> right<00:01:51.580> here<00:01:51.970> but<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.450> work

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
fifth one right here but I have to work

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.740 
fifth one right here but I have to work
on<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:54.930> motor<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:56.460> need<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.610> put<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.390> replacement

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
on the motor I need to put a replacement

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.970 
on the motor I need to put a replacement
man<00:01:59.020> out<00:01:59.230> there<00:01:59.440> and<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.990> another<00:02:01.990> light<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.860> was

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
man out there and a another light it was

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.390 
man out there and a another light it was
blown<00:02:03.250> out<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:05.200> I'll<00:02:05.770> be<00:02:05.890> wiring<00:02:06.100> that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
blown out so then I'll be wiring that

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.200 
blown out so then I'll be wiring that
one<00:02:06.660> which<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:07.930> have<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.320> switch<00:02:08.649> for<00:02:09.210> right

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
one which I have the switch for right

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:21.000 
one which I have the switch for right
here<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:12.570> yeah<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:16.470> that's<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:17.830> now<00:02:20.010> leave

questions you have regarding wiring and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.410 
questions you have regarding wiring and
if<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.700> have<00:02:28.120> MTH<00:02:29.070> which<00:02:30.070> obviously<00:02:31.030> real

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
if you have MTH which obviously real

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.240 
if you have MTH which obviously real
tracks<00:02:31.720> you'd<00:02:31.900> probably<00:02:32.230> have<00:02:32.650> transformer

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
tracks you'd probably have transformer

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.060 
tracks you'd probably have transformer
from<00:02:33.489> them<00:02:36.150> z1000<00:02:37.150> model<00:02:37.420> has<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> 14<00:02:38.260> accessory

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
from them z1000 model has a 14 accessory

from them z1000 model has a 14 accessory
output<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:40.450> happen<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.170> have<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.530> these

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
output I happen to have one of these

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.940 
output I happen to have one of these
laying<00:02:41.950> around<00:02:42.040> which<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.090> was<00:02:43.239> using<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.950> 750

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
laying around which I was using a 750

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.710 
laying around which I was using a 750
before<00:02:45.510> I've<00:02:46.510> got<00:02:46.690> two<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.989> those<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:49.150> do

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
before I've got two of those and I do

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.400 
before I've got two of those and I do
remember<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.470> one<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.739> these<00:02:50.830> had<00:02:51.070> them<00:02:51.340> and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
remember that one of these had them and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.610 
remember that one of these had them and
it's<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:54.160> z1000<00:02:55.120> model<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.630> up<00:02:56.340> will<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:58.620> an

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
it's the z1000 model and up will have an

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.640 
it's the z1000 model and up will have an
accessory<00:03:00.100> output<00:03:00.489> on<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
accessory output on it

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.100 
accessory output on it
so<00:03:03.360> yeah

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
so yeah

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.070
