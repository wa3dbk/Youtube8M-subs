this retains the water resistance of the
galaxy<00:00:56.430> s5<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.789> sure<00:00:57.090> enough<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.840> have

that's<00:04:16.190> one<00:04:16.370> minor<00:04:16.609> difference<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:17.209> action

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
that's one minor difference the action

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.449 
that's one minor difference the action
memo<00:04:17.900> obviously<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.590> galaxy<00:04:18.950> note<00:04:19.070> 3<00:04:19.100> does

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
memo obviously the galaxy note 3 does

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.810 
memo obviously the galaxy note 3 does
come<00:04:19.700> with<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:19.970> s-pen<00:04:20.510> included<00:04:21.079> so<00:04:21.820> action

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
come with the s-pen included so action

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.020 
come with the s-pen included so action
memo<00:04:23.090> makes<00:04:23.300> sense<00:04:23.600> there<00:04:23.870> with<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.410> s5<00:04:25.030> just

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
memo makes sense there with the s5 just

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.790 
memo makes sense there with the s5 just
for<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.540> finger<00:04:26.780> writing<00:04:27.080> with<00:04:27.169> a<00:04:27.200> finger<00:04:27.560> on

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
for the finger writing with a finger on

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.379 
for the finger writing with a finger on
the<00:04:27.889> memo<00:04:28.070> might<00:04:28.370> not<00:04:28.639> have<00:04:28.790> made<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.180> much

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
the memo might not have made that much

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.210 
the memo might not have made that much
sense<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:30.169> I<00:04:30.500> can<00:04:30.620> kind<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.830> see<00:04:31.010> where

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
sense and I can kind of see where

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.879 
sense and I can kind of see where
Samsung's<00:04:31.669> coming<00:04:31.970> from<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:32.600> these<00:04:33.260> are<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
Samsung's coming from so these are the

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.290 
Samsung's coming from so these are the
two<00:04:34.190> major<00:04:34.460> changes<00:04:34.790> that<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.180> actually

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
two major changes that I actually

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.570 
two major changes that I actually
noticed<00:04:35.690> between<00:04:36.050> these<00:04:36.620> two<00:04:36.800> OS<00:04:37.070> Vieux<00:04:37.310> Carre

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
noticed between these two OS Vieux Carre

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.629 
noticed between these two OS Vieux Carre
was<00:04:37.789> so<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.930> animation<00:04:39.620> here<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:39.950> also<00:04:40.280> pretty

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
was so the animation here is also pretty

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.120 
was so the animation here is also pretty
good<00:04:40.910> as<00:04:41.240> when<00:04:41.389> you<00:04:41.479> open<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:41.900> up<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.560> you<00:04:43.010> can

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
good as when you open it up and you can

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.370 
good as when you open it up and you can
see<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.639> way<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.240> washing<00:04:44.479> over<00:04:44.900> rather<00:04:45.110> than

effect<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.720> looks<00:04:53.930> pretty<00:04:54.410> good<00:04:54.560> on<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:55.300> s5<00:04:56.350> so

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
effect it looks pretty good on the s5 so

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.219 
effect it looks pretty good on the s5 so
let's<00:04:57.680> go<00:04:57.830> into<00:04:58.010> settings<00:04:58.810> ok<00:04:59.810> accessories

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
let's go into settings ok accessories

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.930 
let's go into settings ok accessories
and<00:05:03.229> there<00:05:03.919> is<00:05:04.039> no<00:05:04.190> other<00:05:04.310> option<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.789> know

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
and there is no other option you know

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.580 
and there is no other option you know
these<00:05:05.180> are<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.450> only<00:05:05.570> options<00:05:05.990> available<00:05:06.110> for

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
these are the only options available for

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.480 
these are the only options available for
the<00:05:07.660> S<00:05:08.660> view<00:05:08.930> cover<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:10.160> let's<00:05:10.870> see<00:05:12.280> what<00:05:13.280> kind

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
the S view cover so let's see what kind

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.339 
the S view cover so let's see what kind
of<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.789> difference<00:05:14.000> be<00:05:14.360> are<00:05:14.870> we<00:05:14.930> talking<00:05:15.260> about

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
of a difference be are we talking about

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.270 
of a difference be are we talking about
yeah<00:05:15.849> so<00:05:16.849> the<00:05:17.810> galaxy<00:05:18.169> s5<00:05:18.470> itself<00:05:18.830> weighs<00:05:19.099> in

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
yeah so the galaxy s5 itself weighs in

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.330 
yeah so the galaxy s5 itself weighs in
at<00:05:19.370> 145<00:05:20.240> grams<00:05:20.599> so<00:05:20.870> this<00:05:21.139> adds<00:05:22.070> about<00:05:23.440> 37<00:05:24.440> 40<00:05:24.770> 42

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
at 145 grams so this adds about 37 40 42

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.850 
at 145 grams so this adds about 37 40 42
grams<00:05:25.700> extra<00:05:25.970> about<00:05:26.870> 50<00:05:27.200> grams<00:05:27.470> but<00:05:27.710> then

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
grams extra about 50 grams but then

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.360 
grams extra about 50 grams but then
again<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:28.220> replaces<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.970> stock<00:05:29.240> so<00:05:30.370> you're

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
again it replaces the stock so you're

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.879 
again it replaces the stock so you're
looking<00:05:31.490> at<00:05:31.789> about<00:05:31.849> a<00:05:32.090> 40<00:05:32.840> 42<00:05:33.169> gram<00:05:33.500> increase

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
looking at about a 40 42 gram increase

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.730 
looking at about a 40 42 gram increase
in<00:05:34.070> weight<00:05:34.250> so<00:05:34.760> that's<00:05:35.720> okay<00:05:36.080> that's<00:05:36.289> not<00:05:36.470> all

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
in weight so that's okay that's not all

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.790 
in weight so that's okay that's not all
that<00:05:37.250> great<00:05:37.520> but<00:05:37.580> then<00:05:37.880> again<00:05:37.970> it's<00:05:38.660> okay<00:05:38.960> at

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
that great but then again it's okay at

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.250 
that great but then again it's okay at
least<00:05:39.979> uh<00:05:40.280> though<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:41.360> water<00:05:41.599> resistance<00:05:41.780> is

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
least uh though the water resistance is

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.810 
least uh though the water resistance is
preserved<00:05:42.650> so<00:05:42.710> that's<00:05:42.979> something<00:05:43.250> worth

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
preserved so that's something worth

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.790 
preserved so that's something worth
noting<00:05:45.970> so<00:05:46.970> here<00:05:47.599> we<00:05:47.750> have<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.169> we<00:05:48.680> have

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
noting so here we have in we have

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.940 
noting so here we have in we have
markings<00:05:49.310> for<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:49.760> volume<00:05:50.120> keys<00:05:50.419> and<00:05:50.950> you've

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
markings for the volume keys and you've

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.700 
markings for the volume keys and you've
got<00:05:52.160> your<00:05:52.310> power<00:05:52.400> button<00:05:52.669> yeah<00:05:52.970> so<00:05:53.810> business

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
got your power button yeah so business

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.130 
got your power button yeah so business
as<00:05:54.830> usual<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:56.300> I<00:05:56.330> guess<00:05:56.479> that's<00:05:56.630> pretty<00:05:56.780> much

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
as usual so I guess that's pretty much

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.320 
as usual so I guess that's pretty much
it<00:05:57.409> for<00:05:57.620> this<00:05:57.740> quick<00:05:58.370> little
