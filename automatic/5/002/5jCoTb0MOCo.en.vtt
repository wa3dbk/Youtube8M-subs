window<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.950> big

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
window so what we have here is a big

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.770 
window so what we have here is a big
empty<00:00:35.969> room

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
empty room

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.549 
empty room
we<00:00:37.500> decide<00:00:37.860> we've<00:00:38.100> got<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.899> thing<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
we decide we've got this thing and the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.330 
we decide we've got this thing and the
button<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> other<00:00:41.430> side<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.790> similar

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
button and the other side of similar

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
button and the other side of similar
thing<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> wall<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.059> easy<00:00:45.660> things<00:00:45.989> but

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
thing on the wall and easy things but

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.160 
thing on the wall and easy things but
without<00:00:46.260> buttons<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:47.789> amazed<00:00:48.239> consists<00:00:49.020> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
without buttons so amazed consists of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
without buttons so amazed consists of
two<00:00:49.500> things<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> walls<00:00:52.530> -<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.719> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
two things a the walls - you know the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
two things a the walls - you know the
maze<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:56.719> area<00:00:57.739> not<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> area<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> route

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
maze and the area not the area the route

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
maze and the area not the area the route
to<00:00:59.730> get<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.270> goal<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.410> from<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> entrance

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
to get to the goal so from the entrance

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.930 
to get to the goal so from the entrance
to<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> exit

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
to the exit

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.690 
to the exit
so<00:01:03.210> obviously<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.750> has<00:01:04.019> neither<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> those

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
so obviously this has neither of those

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.050 
so obviously this has neither of those
and<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.820> uses<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:07.520> concept<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.729> very

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and this uses the concept for my very

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
and this uses the concept for my very
first<00:01:09.119> video<00:01:09.510> which<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.200> experience

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
first video which was an experience

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.780 
first video which was an experience
outdoor<00:01:11.810> I've<00:01:12.810> turned<00:01:13.020> into<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.320> maze<00:01:14.780> but<00:01:16.790> even

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
outdoor I've turned into a maze but even

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.670 
outdoor I've turned into a maze but even
if<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:19.110> don't<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.380> how<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
if you know that you don't know how to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.609 
if you know that you don't know how to
solve<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.150> solve<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.659> well<00:01:22.409> if

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
solve it so how do you solve it well if

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.219 
solve it so how do you solve it well if
we<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.400> it'll<00:01:23.610> speed<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.030> up

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
we go up here and it'll speed this up

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.490 
we go up here and it'll speed this up
and<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000 

all<00:01:31.500> downfall<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.370> let's<00:01:32.580> wait<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.910> little<00:01:34.010> few

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
all downfall and let's wait a little few

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:50.200 
all downfall and let's wait a little few
moments

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.359 

after<00:01:51.210> sometime<00:01:51.390> you're<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.080> be

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
after sometime you're going to be

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.600 
after sometime you're going to be
presented<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.759> room<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.610> so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
presented with a room like this so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060 
presented with a room like this so
clearly<00:01:56.880> there's<00:01:57.270> our<00:01:57.630> route<00:01:58.290> trash<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.830> us

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
clearly there's our route trash get us

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.530 
clearly there's our route trash get us
if<00:01:59.220> we<00:01:59.310> click<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.580> button

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.249 

slowly<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.159> little<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.520> fiddly<00:02:06.259> so

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
slowly it's a little bit fiddly so

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.279 
slowly it's a little bit fiddly so
basically<00:02:07.910> he<00:02:08.910> experienced<00:02:09.660> orbs<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.170> going

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
basically he experienced orbs are going

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.860 
basically he experienced orbs are going
to<00:02:10.350> follow<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> magnet

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
to follow you like a magnet

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.410 
to follow you like a magnet
so<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.989> just<00:02:13.170> guide<00:02:13.620> them<00:02:14.069> underneath<00:02:14.790> he

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so you just guide them underneath he

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.440 
so you just guide them underneath he
path<00:02:17.450> up<00:02:18.450> until<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> end<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.150> as<00:02:21.150> he<00:02:21.330> did

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
path up until the end and as he did

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.729 
path up until the end and as he did
there's<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:21.989> two<00:02:22.170> parts<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.620> this

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
there's actually two parts to this

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.440 
there's actually two parts to this
there's<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:23.670> one<00:02:24.000> which<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.150> slightly

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
there's this one which is slightly

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.050 
there's this one which is slightly
easier<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.430> there's<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.000> other

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
easier and there's the one on the other

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449 
easier and there's the one on the other
side<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> room<00:02:28.040> there's<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> little<00:02:29.370> bit

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
side of the room there's a little bit

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.680 
side of the room there's a little bit
more<00:02:29.489> challenging<00:02:30.180> because<00:02:30.330> there's<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> lot

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
more challenging because there's a lot

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.210 
more challenging because there's a lot
more<00:02:30.720> turns<00:02:33.500> hoping<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:34.830> right

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
more turns hoping I get this right

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.600 
more turns hoping I get this right
because<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:37.260> snags<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> corner<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.220> kind

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
because it snags on the corner you kind

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.780 
because it snags on the corner you kind
of<00:02:38.840> don't<00:02:39.840> know<00:02:40.260> if<00:02:40.500> you've<00:02:40.739> got<00:02:41.580> there

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
of don't know if you've got there

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
of don't know if you've got there

unlocked Manglish you might have done
right<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.459> far<00:02:45.590> should<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.739> following<00:02:47.130> me

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
right so far should be following me

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.930 
right so far should be following me
nearly<00:02:48.209> there

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.790 

hi-yah<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.120> little<00:02:55.300> click<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.720> means<00:02:55.930> that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
hi-yah that little click that means that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.190 
hi-yah that little click that means that
was<00:02:56.890> right<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.280> then<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.490> obviously<00:02:58.200> over

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
was right and then you obviously over

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.740 
was right and then you obviously over
here<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.560> do<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.800> other<00:03:00.070> one<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.330> saw<00:03:01.600> did

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
here and do the other one but I saw did

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.450 
here and do the other one but I saw did
that<00:03:01.870> morph<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.200> people<00:03:02.440> who<00:03:02.530> wanted<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.920> try

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
that morph the people who wanted to try

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.370 
that morph the people who wanted to try
this<00:03:03.520> out<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:04.690> shouldn't<00:03:04.960> still<00:03:05.140> be<00:03:05.200> watching

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
this out you shouldn't still be watching

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.010 
this out you shouldn't still be watching
by<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.680> way<00:03:06.180> I'm<00:03:07.180> sure<00:03:07.240> many<00:03:07.600> people<00:03:07.930> have

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
by the way I'm sure many people have

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.940 
by the way I'm sure many people have
already<00:03:08.170> figured<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:08.950> out<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.890> you

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
already figured it out but it's that you

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.260 
already figured it out but it's that you
didn't<00:03:13.920> explain<00:03:14.920> how<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.460> very<00:03:15.880> simple

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
didn't explain how this very simple

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.510 
didn't explain how this very simple
mechanism<00:03:16.420> works<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.770> what<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:17.980> have<00:03:18.130> is

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
mechanism works so what you have is

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.640 
mechanism works so what you have is
melted<00:03:19.390> down<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.630> slab<00:03:19.960> and<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.710> regular<00:03:21.640> block<00:03:21.880> a

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
melted down a slab and a regular block a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.740 
melted down a slab and a regular block a
regular<00:03:23.650> block<00:03:23.860> snow<00:03:24.640> can<00:03:24.820> settle<00:03:24.850> however

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
regular block snow can settle however

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.980 
regular block snow can settle however
come<00:03:26.290> on<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.410> lobster<00:03:26.530> dance<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:27.370> half<00:03:27.670> slab<00:03:27.990> snow

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
come on a lobster dance a half slab snow

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.140 
come on a lobster dance a half slab snow
will<00:03:29.170> not<00:03:29.260> settle<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.950> because<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.400> you

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
will not settle so because of that you

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.380 
will not settle so because of that you
can<00:03:31.390> create<00:03:31.630> easily<00:03:32.110> or<00:03:33.750> hidden<00:03:36.030> patterns<00:03:37.030> in

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
can create easily or hidden patterns in

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.570 
can create easily or hidden patterns in
the<00:03:37.810> snow<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.990> used<00:03:40.990> it<00:03:41.140> for<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.410> main<00:03:42.190> speed

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
the snow so I used it for a main speed

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.180 
the snow so I used it for a main speed
use<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.030> for<00:03:43.300> hidden<00:03:44.260> messages<00:03:44.680> or<00:03:44.800> code<00:03:44.980> to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
use it for hidden messages or code to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.760 
use it for hidden messages or code to
something<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.760> wanted<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.600> yes<00:03:47.290> pretty

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
something you wanted to and yes pretty

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.000 
something you wanted to and yes pretty
much<00:03:47.860> how<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.250> works<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.590> enjoyed<00:03:50.830> this
