00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.750
 hi to all his candles today 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.150
 how am I 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:14.040
 I was reached ds2 from the playstation 2 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.190
 on its xbox 360 or playstation 3 so 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.630
 it's excluded it's unheard of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:28.980
 youtube so that's why you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:37.469
 have you already shown then that I have 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:39.890
 salindres and ensure this box here is my 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.890
 TV 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 right here 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.700
 here you see that it's the 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.130
 xbox 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.559
 So I know I have you do not drink 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.559
 to connect then I showed you 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 so that's the xbox 360 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.530
 so you see, rockstar did not 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.530
 gta iv saw well 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.120
 so for you to prove to yourself that 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.430
 that's sure it changed the ex-girlfriend on 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.430
 pacs from the xbox i'm going to break 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.700
 here I have you that it was 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.700
 controllers of the bbox 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:58.630
 so this is to do this from your xbox has 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.100
 been again like this so the TV 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.220
 so it's very important it's more 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.700
 important of the rate it is necessary that they 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.210
 kill in Nanjing stand aside that's otherwise 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.210
 it does not work 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.400
 this is excuse me here I have it 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.810
 I'm interested so ps2 you see well and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.250
 stephane to show you that's at 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.250
 the inside that it's good playstation 2 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:36.329
 means without the blue drs yes 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:38.569
 so you have to close the 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.569
 box 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.719
 the former boxer who was a painter must be 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.909
 extinguished 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.950
 they need to skype skype to better 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.299
 shows us so that the connection is 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.200
 well managed by microsoft servers 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:59.040
 after you take your game box 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.280
 and you put it on your console so 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.709
 what the xbox or the ps3 and you you 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:11.129
 have jpa ps2 on the xbox so 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.079
 here missile organized earlier so 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.810
 it's pretty good to have a 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.829
 room at 9.1 on the xbox me I tell you 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.829
