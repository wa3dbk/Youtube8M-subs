can do whatever you want but I like

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.830 
can do whatever you want but I like
seeing<00:02:06.399> one<00:02:06.789> side<00:02:07.030> kind<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.390> completely

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
seeing one side kind of completely

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.419 
seeing one side kind of completely
disconnected<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.009> other<00:02:09.160> side

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
disconnected and then the other side

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.030 
disconnected and then the other side
where<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:09.880> blended<00:02:10.299> in<00:02:10.450> just<00:02:11.410> slightly<00:02:11.709> and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
where it's blended in just slightly and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.500 
where it's blended in just slightly and
it<00:02:12.459> seems<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.910> lot<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.150> people<00:02:13.450> are

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
it seems like a lot of people are

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.820 
it seems like a lot of people are
leaving<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.840> front<00:02:14.049> longer<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.709> through

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
leaving the front longer and through

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.520 
leaving the front longer and through
here<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.880> it's<00:02:16.180> giving<00:02:16.480> them<00:02:16.599> enough<00:02:17.319> length

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
here and it's giving them enough length

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.380 
here and it's giving them enough length
to<00:02:17.620> kind<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.860> comb<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.160> over<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:18.549> this<00:02:18.760> so

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
to kind of comb it over like this so

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.870 
to kind of comb it over like this so
this<00:02:19.840> seems<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.410> be<00:02:20.440> coming<00:02:20.680> popular<00:02:21.549> trends

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
this seems to be coming popular trends

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.970 
this seems to be coming popular trends
so<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.090> always<00:02:22.209> like<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.450> blend<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:23.049> and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
so I always like to blend this in and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.740 
so I always like to blend this in and
we're<00:02:24.340> pretty<00:02:24.519> much<00:02:24.730> almost<00:02:25.120> done<00:02:25.480> now<00:02:25.510> I'm

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
we're pretty much almost done now I'm

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.500 
we're pretty much almost done now I'm
just<00:02:25.870> gonna<00:02:26.340> blend<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.489> into<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.970> back<00:02:28.150> here

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
just gonna blend this into the back here

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.440 
just gonna blend this into the back here
right<00:02:28.959> into<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.350> back<00:02:29.500> area<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.130> I'd<00:02:30.790> say<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
right into the back area and I'd say the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.770 
right into the back area and I'd say the
top<00:02:31.780> here<00:02:32.109> is<00:02:32.140> probably<00:02:32.620> about<00:02:33.209> an<00:02:34.209> inch<00:02:34.510> or<00:02:34.750> so

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
top here is probably about an inch or so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.349 
top here is probably about an inch or so
in<00:02:35.260> length<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.859> then<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.579> works<00:02:36.790> into<00:02:37.000> about

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
in length and then it works into about

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.660 
in length and then it works into about
an<00:02:37.540> inch<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.959> half<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.620> two<00:02:39.250> inches<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
an inch and a half to two inches the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.759 
an inch and a half to two inches the
most<00:02:39.940> right<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.510> through<00:02:40.660> here<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.079> look<00:02:41.140> it's

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
most right in through here and look it's

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:42.930 
most right in through here and look it's
okay<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.549> longer

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
okay if you want to have this longer

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.580 
okay if you want to have this longer
into<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> front<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.840> totally<00:02:44.230> up<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.380> you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
into the front it's totally up to you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
how long it can be the longer it is the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.940 
how long it can be the longer it is the
more<00:02:49.269> you'll<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.959> over<00:02:50.109> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
you'll have to kind of blend this in a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.340 
you'll have to kind of blend this in a
little<00:02:52.090> more<00:02:52.269> but<00:02:52.420> always<00:02:52.660> leave<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.019> part

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
right in through bright below the part

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.789 
right in through bright below the part
here<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:55.540> don't<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:55.959> afraid<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.319> go<00:03:56.410> up<00:03:56.620> into

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
here so don't be afraid to go up into

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.620 
here so don't be afraid to go up into
the<00:03:56.950> hairline<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.310> then<00:03:57.489> this<00:03:57.610> side<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:58.090> did

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
the hairline and then this side I did

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.180 
the hairline and then this side I did
blend<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:58.959> in<00:03:59.170> because<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.500> just<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.799> feel<00:04:00.069> this

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
blend this in because I just I feel this

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.250 
blend this in because I just I feel this
looks<00:04:00.459> better<00:04:00.730> blending<00:04:01.330> in<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.690> then<00:04:02.170> you

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
looks better blending in and then you

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.720 
looks better blending in and then you
can<00:04:02.380> work<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.709> kind<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:02.950> over<00:04:03.250> if<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.459> want

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
can work this kind of over if you want

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.789 
can work this kind of over if you want
to<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.569> think<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.989> looks<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.170> lot<00:04:05.290> neater<00:04:05.500> and

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
to so I think it looks a lot neater and

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.530 
to so I think it looks a lot neater and
a<00:04:06.310> little<00:04:06.519> classier<00:04:06.910> if<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.269> kind<00:04:07.390> of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
a little classier if it is kind of

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.360 
a little classier if it is kind of
tapered<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:07.989> through<00:04:08.140> here<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:09.069> I<00:04:09.099> think<00:04:09.190> it

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
tapered and through here so I think it

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.680 
tapered and through here so I think it
came<00:04:09.519> out<00:04:09.670> great<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.030> then<00:04:10.150> at<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.299> top<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.660> put

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
came out great and then at the top I put

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.449 
came out great and then at the top I put
some<00:04:10.959> wax<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.950> really<00:04:12.130> just<00:04:12.160> kind<00:04:12.400> of

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
some wax in it and I really just kind of

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.400 
some wax in it and I really just kind of
work<00:04:12.640> this<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:13.030> but<00:04:13.780> I'm<00:04:13.870> super<00:04:14.140> super
