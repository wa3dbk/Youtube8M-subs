00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
I was nervous you know I actually

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.140 
I was nervous you know I actually
probably<00:03:08.230> not<00:03:08.860> more<00:03:09.280> than<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.489> month<00:03:09.610> ago<00:03:09.790> was

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
probably not more than a month ago was

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.390 
probably not more than a month ago was
in<00:03:10.299> Orlando<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.650> went<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.890> universal

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
in Orlando and we went to universal

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.800 
in Orlando and we went to universal
studios<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.120> actually<00:03:13.360> didn't<00:03:13.570> have<00:03:13.690> any

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
studios and actually didn't have any

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.080 
studios and actually didn't have any
problems<00:03:13.989> there<00:03:14.650> universal<00:03:15.280> studios<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
problems there universal studios and

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.690 
problems there universal studios and
islands<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.480> adventure<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.980> roller<00:03:18.190> coasters

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
islands of adventure the roller coasters

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.880 
islands of adventure the roller coasters
were<00:03:19.030> pretty<00:03:19.390> forgiving<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.530> course<00:03:20.769> we

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
were pretty forgiving of course we

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.890 
were pretty forgiving of course we
didn't<00:03:21.040> go<00:03:21.130> any<00:03:21.340> go<00:03:21.850> on<00:03:22.030> any<00:03:22.209> roller<00:03:22.450> coasters

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
didn't go any go on any roller coasters

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.240 
didn't go any go on any roller coasters
that<00:03:22.989> our<00:03:23.140> seven<00:03:23.500> year<00:03:23.680> old<00:03:23.829> couldn't<00:03:24.130> go<00:03:24.220> on

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
that our seven year old couldn't go on

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.090 
that our seven year old couldn't go on
so<00:03:24.670> that's<00:03:24.850> probably<00:03:25.150> part<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> issue<00:03:26.100> but

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
so that's probably part of the issue but

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.100 
so that's probably part of the issue but
anyway<00:03:27.430> getting<00:03:27.610> back<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.820> six<00:03:28.180> flags<00:03:28.450> we<00:03:28.900> got

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
anyway getting back to six flags we got

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.560 
anyway getting back to six flags we got
there<00:03:29.500> we<00:03:29.739> bought<00:03:30.519> our<00:03:30.640> tickets<00:03:30.880> we<00:03:31.360> bought

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
there we bought our tickets we bought

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.660 
there we bought our tickets we bought
her<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> little<00:03:31.959> fast<00:03:32.200> past<00:03:32.560> passes<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.549> we

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
her a little fast past passes so we

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.100 
her a little fast past passes so we
could<00:03:33.820> get<00:03:34.000> through<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.570> write<00:03:34.750> everything

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
could get through and write everything

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.180 
could get through and write everything
in<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.440> park<00:03:35.709> early<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.320> first<00:03:38.560> coaster<00:03:39.130> i

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
in the park early so the first coaster i

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.520 
in the park early so the first coaster i
think<00:03:39.430> was<00:03:39.519> called<00:03:39.760> either<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.150> mind

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
think was called either the mind

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.690 
think was called either the mind
Mindbender<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.560> reminder<00:03:41.920> race<00:03:42.220> or<00:03:42.430> something

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
Mindbender a reminder race or something

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.990

like that and you know my fears were

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.970 
like that and you know my fears were

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
realized because as I sat down and I

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.940 
realized because as I sat down and I
tried<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.430> pull<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.700> lap<00:03:49.600> bar<00:03:49.900> or<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.380> the
