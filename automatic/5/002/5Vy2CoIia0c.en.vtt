00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.820 

you<00:00:22.259> know<00:00:22.380> using<00:00:22.920> blood<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> medium<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.830> you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
you know using blood as a medium was you

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.970 
you know using blood as a medium was you
know<00:00:25.950> it<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.400> there<00:00:26.610> that<00:00:26.790> I<00:00:26.849> connected<00:00:27.360> with

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
know it was there that I connected with

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.790 
know it was there that I connected with
what<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.009> was<00:00:29.310> doing<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.880> terms<00:00:30.059> of<00:00:30.300> art<00:00:30.800> there's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
what I was doing in terms of art there's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.100 
what I was doing in terms of art there's
something<00:00:32.130> about<00:00:32.220> blood<00:00:33.149> there's<00:00:33.840> something

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
something about blood there's something

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
something about blood there's something
about<00:00:34.350> blood<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.300> screams

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.830 

the<00:00:55.130> blood<00:00:55.370> does<00:00:55.640> react<00:00:56.240> differently<00:00:56.630> on

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
the blood does react differently on

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.170 
the blood does react differently on
different<00:00:56.870> surfaces<00:00:57.640> I've<00:00:58.640> found<00:00:59.090> that<00:00:59.300> I<00:00:59.450> use

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
different surfaces I've found that I use

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.320 
different surfaces I've found that I use
cold<00:01:02.180> press<00:01:02.510> watercolor<00:01:03.550> paper<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:05.120> you

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
cold press watercolor paper it you

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.120 
cold press watercolor paper it you
really<00:01:05.540> need<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.840> watercolor<00:01:06.470> because<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.040> a

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
really need a watercolor because it's a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.219 
really need a watercolor because it's a
water<00:01:07.400> based<00:01:07.700> substance<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:09.670> initially<00:01:10.670> began

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
water based substance I initially began

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.310 
water based substance I initially began
collecting<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.560> myself<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.250> that<00:01:13.610> was

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
collecting it myself and that was

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.990 
collecting it myself and that was
complicated<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.650> not<00:01:15.740> always<00:01:16.160> very

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
complicated and not always very

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.140 
complicated and not always very
efficient<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.050> I<00:01:18.610> started<00:01:19.610> getting<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.970> help

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
efficient so I started getting the help

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.690 
efficient so I started getting the help
of<00:01:20.330> some<00:01:20.840> friends<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.290> would<00:01:22.010> do<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.220> for<00:01:22.550> me

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
of some friends that would do it for me

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.400 
of some friends that would do it for me
and<00:01:22.850> that's<00:01:22.970> what<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:23.240> do<00:01:23.360> through<00:01:24.110> today<00:01:24.380> I

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
and that's what I do through today I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.950 
and that's what I do through today I
have<00:01:24.710> someone<00:01:25.100> come<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.490> they<00:01:25.790> collect<00:01:26.780> it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
have someone come in and they collect it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.050 
have someone come in and they collect it
for<00:01:27.200> me<00:01:27.410> so<00:01:28.100> it's<00:01:28.310> like<00:01:28.399> pretty<00:01:28.820> much

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
for me so it's like pretty much

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.660 
for me so it's like pretty much
eighty-five<00:01:29.930> percent<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.590> would<00:01:30.800> say<00:01:31.009> my<00:01:31.369> blood

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
eighty-five percent I would say my blood

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.510 
eighty-five percent I would say my blood
the<00:01:32.090> collection<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:33.020> works<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.800> there's<00:01:34.430> a

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
the collection of works and there's a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.790 
the collection of works and there's a
there's<00:01:35.119> some<00:01:35.360> other<00:01:35.479> human<00:01:36.290> blood<00:01:36.500> involved

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
there's some other human blood involved

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:48.430 
there's some other human blood involved
I<00:01:45.550> can<00:01:46.550> get<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.820> full<00:01:47.060> range<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.570> values<00:01:47.960> from

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
I can get the full range of values from

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.090 
I can get the full range of values from
the<00:01:48.590> lightest<00:01:50.170> lightest<00:01:51.170> light<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
the lightest lightest light to the to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.990 
the lightest lightest light to the to
the<00:01:52.130> most<00:01:52.490> opaque<00:01:53.119> tone<00:01:54.220> just<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.610> know<00:01:55.729> using

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
the most opaque tone just you know using

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.240 
the most opaque tone just you know using
different<00:01:56.479> consistencies<00:01:57.200> mix<00:01:57.860> with<00:01:58.039> water

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
different consistencies mix with water

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.550 
different consistencies mix with water
and<00:01:58.580> then<00:01:58.789> straight<00:01:59.479> concentrated<00:02:00.319> blood

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
and then straight concentrated blood

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.430 
and then straight concentrated blood
that's<00:02:01.240> got<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> lot<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.539> time<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.929> decompose

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
that's got a lot of time to decompose

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.830 
that's got a lot of time to decompose
because<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.920> more<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.280> decomposes<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.270> more

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
because the more it decomposes the more

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.960 
because the more it decomposes the more
oxidated<00:02:06.709> it<00:02:06.830> becomes<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:07.789> it

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
oxidated it becomes and it's just it

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.140 
oxidated it becomes and it's just it
becomes<00:02:08.360> opaque<00:02:08.899> I'm<00:02:09.319> using<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.860> same<00:02:10.150> same

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
becomes opaque I'm using the same same

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.780 
becomes opaque I'm using the same same
tools<00:02:11.510> same<00:02:11.780> brushes<00:02:12.290> as<00:02:12.500> any<00:02:13.190> other<00:02:13.280> painter

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
tools same brushes as any other painter

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.790 
tools same brushes as any other painter
would<00:02:13.970> use<00:02:14.209> minus<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.200> blood<00:02:15.410> collection

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
would use minus the blood collection

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:25.510 
would use minus the blood collection
supplies<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.819> know

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.060 

you<00:02:26.520> know<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.820> believe<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.560> images<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
you know I believe that the images that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.820 
you know I believe that the images that
I<00:02:29.160> paint<00:02:29.460> although<00:02:30.090> they<00:02:30.300> obviously<00:02:31.170> lean

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
I paint although they obviously lean

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.730 
I paint although they obviously lean
toward<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> darker<00:02:32.700> side<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:33.350> humanity<00:02:34.350> and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
toward the darker side of humanity and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.570 
toward the darker side of humanity and
the<00:02:34.800> darker<00:02:35.160> side<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.400> life<00:02:37.310> they<00:02:38.310> are

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the darker side of life they are

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.570 
the darker side of life they are
universal<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.960> know<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.590> they're<00:02:41.340> all

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
universal you know in that they're all

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.730 
universal you know in that they're all
stations<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.330> human<00:02:42.630> experience<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
stations of human experience that I

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.610 
stations of human experience that I
think<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.520> common<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.270> us<00:02:45.600> all<00:02:45.990> on<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.380> level

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
think are common to us all on one level

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.070 
think are common to us all on one level
at<00:02:46.950> some<00:02:47.580> point<00:02:47.910> or<00:02:48.120> another<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.930> know

at some point or another you know

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.260 
at some point or another you know
there's<00:02:49.410> death<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.280> disintegration<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
there's death and disintegration and

there's death and disintegration and
there's<00:02:51.840> sex<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:53.040> know<00:02:53.190> there's<00:02:54.200> you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
there's sex and you know there's you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.430 
there's sex and you know there's you
know<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.470> spectrum<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.480> human<00:02:57.480> emotions<00:02:58.080> and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
know the spectrum of human emotions and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.590 
know the spectrum of human emotions and
experience<00:02:59.040> again<00:02:59.700> leaning<00:03:00.240> toward<00:03:00.450> the
