you<00:00:00.299> know<00:00:00.420> so<00:00:01.380> what<00:00:01.469> do<00:00:01.530> you<00:00:01.589> got<00:00:01.709> here<00:00:01.829> what

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
you know so what do you got here what

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.919 
you know so what do you got here what
are<00:00:02.040> we<00:00:02.100> looking<00:00:02.340> at<00:00:02.460> we<00:00:02.639> have<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.120> repurposed

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
are we looking at we have a repurposed

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.099 
are we looking at we have a repurposed
refrigerator<00:00:04.740> or<00:00:05.009> freezer<00:00:05.390> turned<00:00:06.390> into<00:00:06.629> a

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
refrigerator or freezer turned into a

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.509 
refrigerator or freezer turned into a
solar<00:00:07.830> food<00:00:08.220> dehydrator<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
solar food dehydrator so this is the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.549 
solar food dehydrator so this is the
conventional<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.630> got<00:00:12.780> all<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> racks<00:00:13.259> in

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
conventional you got all the racks in

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.160 
conventional you got all the racks in
your<00:00:13.710> storage<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.599> different<00:00:16.020> heat

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
your storage and you have different heat

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.640 
your storage and you have different heat
levels<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.770> stuff<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.279> put<00:00:17.550> things<00:00:17.789> in

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
levels and stuff you can put things in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.109 
levels and stuff you can put things in
this<00:00:19.650> has<00:00:19.949> got<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.670> top

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
this has got at the top

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.500 
this has got at the top
it'll<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.900> 130<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.580> right<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.269> here

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
it'll get to like 130 and right in here

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.540 
it'll get to like 130 and right in here
it's<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.810> 120<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.710> stuff<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it's like 120 and stuff on it on a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.589 
it's like 120 and stuff on it on a
decent<00:00:27.000> sunny<00:00:27.210> day<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:30.210> know<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.359> can

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
decent sunny day and you know you can

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.030 
decent sunny day and you know you can
move<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> shelves<00:00:31.230> around<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.679> stuff<00:00:31.890> so

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
move the shelves around and stuff so

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
move the shelves around and stuff so
that's<00:00:32.160> nice<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.759> hot<00:00:33.149> air<00:00:33.329> comes<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.780> at

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that's nice so like hot air comes in at

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.440 
that's nice so like hot air comes in at
the<00:00:34.050> top<00:00:34.230> gives<00:00:35.160> off<00:00:35.399> its<00:00:35.550> heat<00:00:35.760> cools<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the top gives off its heat cools and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.530 
the top gives off its heat cools and
falls<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.110> exits<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> bottom<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> then

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
falls and exits out the bottom and then

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.869 
falls and exits out the bottom and then
if<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.989> look<00:00:40.170> around<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.770> other<00:00:40.980> side

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.950 

you<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:46.399> collector<00:00:47.399> panel<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.809> air

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you have the collector panel the air

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.500 
you have the collector panel the air
enters<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:50.039> through<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> bottom<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.239> which

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
enters in through the bottom here which

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.200 
enters in through the bottom here which
is<00:00:51.660> screened<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.260> keep<00:00:52.410> bugs<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
is screened to keep bugs out and then I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
is screened to keep bugs out and then I
put<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> couple<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> window<00:00:55.289> screens<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.800> there

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
put a couple of window screens in there

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.900 
put a couple of window screens in there
to<00:00:56.160> increase<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.680> conductive<00:00:58.680> area<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to increase the conductive area of the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.599 
to increase the conductive area of the
air<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.719> its<00:01:00.899> passing<00:01:01.140> through<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> has

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
air as its passing through so it has

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.660 
air as its passing through so it has
more<00:01:02.879> contact<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.660> something<00:01:03.870> hot<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:05.489> goes

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
more contact with something hot it goes

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.870 
more contact with something hot it goes
into<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.119> chamber<00:01:07.040> drops<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.549> gives<00:01:08.670> off

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
into the chamber drops as it gives off

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.870 
into the chamber drops as it gives off
its<00:01:09.060> heat<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> comes<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:11.549> stove

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
its heat and then it comes out the stove

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.450 
its heat and then it comes out the stove
pipe<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.170> painted<00:01:13.500> black<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.979> again

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pipe that is painted black that again

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
pipe that is painted black that again
heats<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.450> helps<00:01:15.720> rise<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.470> really

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
heats and it helps rise it so it really

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.249 
heats and it helps rise it so it really
has<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.270> convective<00:01:18.270> flow<00:01:18.570> just

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
has a good convective flow just

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.510 
has a good convective flow just
naturally<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> I've<00:01:23.220> thought

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
naturally in there and I've thought

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.230 
naturally in there and I've thought
about<00:01:25.040> hooking<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.460> rocket<00:01:26.759> stove<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
about hooking a little rocket stove to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
about hooking a little rocket stove to
it<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:28.310> alternate<00:01:29.310> heat<00:01:29.610> source<00:01:29.909> because

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
it as a alternate heat source because

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.899 
it as a alternate heat source because
there's<00:01:30.420> times<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.020> couple<00:01:31.829> times<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.369> sunny<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
there's times a couple times it sunny it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
there's times a couple times it sunny it
was<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.600> had<00:01:33.720> dried<00:01:34.380> tomatoes<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.979> there

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
was good we had dried tomatoes in there

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.850 
was good we had dried tomatoes in there
they're<00:01:35.729> almost<00:01:35.939> done<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.710> was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
they're almost done and then it was

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.190 
they're almost done and then it was
cloudy<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.659> sat<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.049> there

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
cloudy and you know they sat in there

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990 
cloudy and you know they sat in there
sat<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.490> they'd<00:01:41.700> start<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
sat in there and then they'd start to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
sat in there and then they'd start to
mold<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.290> good<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
mold so it's good to have like a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
mold so it's good to have like a
secondary<00:01:44.939> heat<00:01:45.180> source<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.990> case

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
secondary heat source so in that case

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.990 
secondary heat source so in that case
you<00:01:46.439> they're<00:01:46.740> almost<00:01:46.920> done<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.670> fire<00:01:47.820> up

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you they're almost done you just fire up

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.310 
you they're almost done you just fire up
the<00:01:48.119> rocket<00:01:48.390> stove<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> little<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the rocket stove for a little bit and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.679 
the rocket stove for a little bit and
crank<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.280> through<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> finish<00:01:51.570> them

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
crank that through it and finish them

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.069 
crank that through it and finish them
off<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.490> probably<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> next<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
off so that's probably the next one of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.640 
off so that's probably the next one of
the<00:01:55.140> next<00:01:55.320> steps<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.189> really<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.700> glass

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
the next steps so really it's just glass

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.010 
the next steps so really it's just glass
screams<00:01:58.040> everything<00:01:58.370> that<00:01:58.940> it's<00:01:59.330> in<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.930> I

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
screams everything that it's in that I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.770 
screams everything that it's in that I
use<00:02:00.230> not<00:02:00.500> add<00:02:00.680> solar<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.370> this<00:02:01.550> -<00:02:01.760> no<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.420> then

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
use not add solar on this - no and then

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.410 
use not add solar on this - no and then
on<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.290> back<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:04.070> is<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.550> framework<00:02:04.970> this<00:02:05.270> is

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
on the back it is the framework this is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.780 
on the back it is the framework this is
a<00:02:05.450> refrigerator<00:02:06.110> door<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:07.100> back<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.610> it

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
a refrigerator door on the back so it

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.240 
a refrigerator door on the back so it
has<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:09.020> framework<00:02:09.440> already<00:02:09.680> and<00:02:10.009> then<00:02:10.100> it's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
has the framework already and then it's

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.740 
has the framework already and then it's
insulated<00:02:10.670> okay<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:14.210> sides<00:02:14.480> aren't

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
insulated okay and so the sides aren't

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.340 
insulated okay and so the sides aren't
insulated<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.650> back<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:15.860> insulated<00:02:16.640> and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
insulated but the back is insulated and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.960 
insulated but the back is insulated and
then<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.800> all<00:02:18.980> glazed<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.820> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
then this is all glazed in and the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.210 
then this is all glazed in and the
screens<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:20.690> kind<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> stapled<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.680> in

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
screens are just kind of stapled in in

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.140 
screens are just kind of stapled in in
there<00:02:22.580> -<00:02:24.460> what<00:02:25.460> does<00:02:25.580> it'll<00:02:25.790> stay<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.030> place

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
there - what does it'll stay in place

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.970 
there - what does it'll stay in place
with<00:02:26.870> black<00:02:27.380> paint<00:02:28.690> yep<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.140> yeah<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.800> works

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
with black paint yep so yeah it works

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.000 
with black paint yep so yeah it works
pretty<00:02:31.160> good<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.550> them<00:02:31.670> thinking<00:02:32.890> getting<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
pretty good in them thinking getting the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
pretty good in them thinking getting the
tracking<00:02:34.280> system<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.910> mean<00:02:35.030> we<00:02:35.180> have<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.510> here

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
tracking system I mean we have it here

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.720 
tracking system I mean we have it here
on<00:02:35.930> our<00:02:35.959> zone<00:02:36.410> one<00:02:36.620> path<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.520> kind<00:02:37.670> of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
on our zone one path so we just kind of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.970 
on our zone one path so we just kind of
move<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.090> through<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.390> day<00:02:38.600> two<00:02:39.500> or<00:02:39.530> three<00:02:39.830> or

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
move it through the day two or three or

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.160 
move it through the day two or three or
four<00:02:40.010> times<00:02:40.370> depending<00:02:41.000> upon<00:02:41.060> what<00:02:41.900> we<00:02:42.020> have

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
four times depending upon what we have

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.190 
four times depending upon what we have
going<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.300> think<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:44.570> it's<00:02:44.690> an<00:02:44.780> organic

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
going but I think so it's an organic

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.920 
going but I think so it's an organic
tracking<00:02:45.860> system<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.430> yeah

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
tracking system it yeah

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.660 
tracking system it yeah
biological<00:02:47.930> tracking<00:02:48.350> system<00:02:48.709> tracking<00:02:49.280> yeah

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
biological tracking system tracking yeah

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.570 
biological tracking system tracking yeah
that's<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:50.800> but<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:51.860> was<00:02:52.040> thinking<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.520> you

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
that's it so but I was thinking like you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.030 
that's it so but I was thinking like you
put<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:52.970> on<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> lazy<00:02:53.390> susan<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.290> hook<00:02:54.920> it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
put it on a lazy susan and you hook it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.550 
put it on a lazy susan and you hook it
up<00:02:55.160> with<00:02:55.310> like<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.490> bungee<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.990> bucket<00:02:57.500> of

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
up with like a bungee and a bucket of

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.380 
up with like a bungee and a bucket of
water<00:02:57.740> that<00:02:58.070> drips<00:02:58.310> out<00:02:58.550> at<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> certain<00:02:59.060> rate

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
water that drips out at a certain rate

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.870 
water that drips out at a certain rate
and<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.870> as<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.260> water<00:03:00.650> loses<00:03:01.100> weight<00:03:01.520> then<00:03:01.850> it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
and so as the water loses weight then it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.690 
and so as the water loses weight then it
like<00:03:02.180> pulls<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.600> back<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.019> like<00:03:03.230> suck<00:03:06.700> if

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
like pulls it back so you like suck if

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.580 
like pulls it back so you like suck if
you<00:03:07.760> like<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:08.150> sort<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.480> thing<00:03:08.540> come<00:03:09.290> on<00:03:09.410> out

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
you like this sort of thing come on out

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.470 
you like this sort of thing come on out
