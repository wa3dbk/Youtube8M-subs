00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you for coming this the video comes out

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
you for coming this the video comes out
sideways<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.550> apologize<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
sideways I do apologize it's just the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
sideways I do apologize it's just the
way<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.140> having<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> film<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:48.600> you'll

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
way I'm having to film it but you'll

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.979 
way I'm having to film it but you'll
still<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.489> gist<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.030> sort<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.809> thing

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
still get the gist of it sort of thing

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
still get the gist of it sort of thing
so<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:55.469> strings<00:00:55.770> you'll<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.100> using<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.579> d<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
so the strings you'll be using is d a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.160 
so the strings you'll be using is d a
and<00:00:58.140> E<00:00:59.420> D<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:01.100> isaw<00:01:02.100> won't<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.300> used<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and E D the isaw won't actually used to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
and E D the isaw won't actually used to
like<00:01:04.710> last<00:01:05.400> night<00:01:08.060> but<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.360> start<00:01:09.630> off

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
like last night but we will start off

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.850 
like last night but we will start off
using<00:01:10.020> an<00:01:11.010> open<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.619> till<00:01:13.619> fret<00:01:14.010> D

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
using an open a till fret D

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.270 
using an open a till fret D
until<00:01:16.860> simply<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> we'll<00:01:19.770> solve<00:01:19.980> with<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> A<00:01:22.280> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
until simply so we'll solve with so A to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.300 
until simply so we'll solve with so A to
D<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.600> start<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.960> seven<00:01:31.310> we've

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
D so so will you start on seven we've

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.719 
D so so will you start on seven we've
got<00:01:32.460> two<00:01:32.580> free<00:01:32.940> or<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:34.020> free

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.450 

told<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.509> myself<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:39.070> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.460 

that's<00:01:42.180> free<00:01:44.120> open<00:01:45.120> D

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:59.030 

in<00:01:48.470> box<00:01:48.740> 7

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.590 

so<00:02:00.040> you<00:02:00.100> repeat<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.820> over<00:02:01.390> three<00:02:02.110> times<00:02:03.600> I'll

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
so you repeat that over three times I'll

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:30.590 
so you repeat that over three times I'll
just<00:02:04.780> play<00:02:04.990> through<00:02:05.460> once<00:02:06.460> in<00:02:06.909> its<00:02:07.709> full<00:02:08.709> speed

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.940 

all<00:02:31.600> right<00:02:31.780> after<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.470> we're<00:02:32.620> going<00:02:32.740> into

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
all right after that we're going into

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.120 
all right after that we're going into
the<00:02:33.070> second<00:02:33.490> part<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> intro<00:02:34.920> which<00:02:35.920> is

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the second part of the intro which is
