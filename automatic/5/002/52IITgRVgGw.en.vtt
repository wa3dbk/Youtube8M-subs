know some shots can have up to like 30
layers<00:01:09.110> unfortunately<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.800> got<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.009> think<00:01:11.160> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
layers unfortunately you got to think of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.469 
layers unfortunately you got to think of
it<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.369> terms<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.000> parts<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> want

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to move and then kind of draw

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.609 
to move and then kind of draw
accordingly<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.320> we're<00:01:16.320> gonna<00:01:16.440> show
