too many problems but with it's not
perfect<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.510> variables<00:01:29.050> will<00:01:29.320> sometimes

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
perfect the variables will sometimes

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.320 
perfect the variables will sometimes
forget<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.330> updates<00:01:32.790> makes<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:34.000> kind<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.270> hard
