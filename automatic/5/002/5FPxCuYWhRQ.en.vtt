00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Learning philosophy in primary school

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.040
World Philosophy Day at UNESCO headquarters, Paris
14th-15th November 2012

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.300
We're here for the philosophical workshop at Unesco

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.060
What can people do against violence?

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:13.779
The debate is open

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.339
and Nina will preside.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.820
There are several methods

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.020
to get children to think,
to teach them how to philosophize

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.460
With some colleagues, we have developed

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.140
a method where the teacher
does not comment on the content

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.180
but only steps in with regard to the philosophical requirements.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.200
Its originality is twofold -

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.220
it has a democratic aim,
inspired by institutional pedagogy

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.700
which will give the students a number of roles

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.720
to structure the debate

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.200
There is a president, who decides whose turn it is to speak

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.910
and there are philosophers

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.880
Those who think, who discuss things

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.160
and observers

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.620
and a secretary, too, who writes down what philosophers say.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
...And it also has a philosophical aim
which consists in

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.710
implementing a number
of thought processes

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.140
all of which are intellectual requirements -
learning how to ask questions,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.540
learning how to define concepts,
how to do conceptual dissections

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.840
and justifying what you say.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.440
And then, when the other one will exact revenge,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.240
it will create a chain reaction of conflicts,
and it will go on, and on, and on

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.080
That's the idea Iris expressed earlier -
in a way, violence leads to violence

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.340
A method which has proven to be effective with children

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.230
We have decided to use the Tozzi method
because Michel Tozzi organized a training course in our school

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.800
and we found it interesting
with regard to our school's practices

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.760
where some students are designated lesson chairmen, secretaries...

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.420
It is not too early to introduce children to philosophy

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.780
I have done it with children in "Cours Préparatoire"
(equivalent: US Grade 1, UK Year 2)

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.380
It is one of our school's goals

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.560
to involve children, to make them think,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.440
to show them that there are no right answers
and no wrong answers

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.990
that there is no best or worst student in philosophy

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.790
and that they all have the right to participate in this kind of activity.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.740
There are no prerequisites to start thinking

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.929
A child can start thinking
when he starts talking

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.049
because talking is a way of shaping the world

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.879
and so we can start,
as soon as the child begins to talk,

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.279
to get him to think

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.120
while gradually organizing a course

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.740
within which this reflection expressed through language
will be more and more structured.

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.440
Preschool, especially the last year of kindergarten

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
seems like the right time to start

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.960
Children seen as individuals

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.420
The assessment you do with children -

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.299
their feedback after philosophy courses -

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.719
is that they feel, at those times,

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.500
that we speak to them as individuals

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.270
as persons

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.840
I will not paraphrase Françoise Dolto
(French psychoanalyst and pediatrician)

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.959
who said that even babies should be considered as individuals

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.729
but there are few moments
when children have the impression

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:05.189
to be considered as persons.
They felt they were listened to,

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.039
that their words carried weight

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.370
We are working on

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.670
self confidence, a positive image of themselves...

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.400
Philosophy is a time when we share ideas

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.760
It's a good moment, it's a time when we debate issues

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.880
My favorite topic was freedom

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.340
In my opinion, being free
is a bit like being detached from life

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.000
being lost in my thoughts, etc.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.800
What strikes me
is how pleased the children are

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.500
when they brainstorm as a group

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.879
It's a common belief that thinking,
is actually effort, and hard work

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.899
"It racks your brain" as some people say, etc.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.240
Well, it's somewhat true

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.800
but as soon as a group of people collectively works

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.669
on a significant problem,

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.209
on an issue that affects them all,

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.009
what becomes the most important is the topic in itself

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.949
so they will involve themselves

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.469
and as a consequence, they will develop

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.529
a capacity for reasoning which is sometimes surprising
to us grown-ups.

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.200
Developping self-esteem

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.700
With regard to exceptional students,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.691
philosophically oriented discussion is very important
because it will reinstate

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.600
some self-esteem.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.900
Those are students who have lost confidence in their language,

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.209
who have lost trust in their relationship with others

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:28.419
who have eventually lost confidence in themselves

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.859
and to feel authorized to speak

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.420
and say things that are considered important

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.660
on the human condition's main issues

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.040
helps them back on their feet and brings their dignity back.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.520
I loved it, it was very good

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.369
It was very, very interesting

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:44.740
we've learned a lot about violence

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.500
and we've been able to tell what we think

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.060
