 It is pe line to be released this time Sefia 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.930
 It becomes g 5. It is written largely with 5 g, so what is the number 5? 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.620
 But this is a typographical marking from Gohon 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.040
 And was to be in Gohon so tell the truth to the four p head of state 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.970
 It incorporates a high specific gravity of sailors in the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.780
 We are told pull out well because conventional roughly p line Mise by that to this 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.160
 I think I have been in 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.920
 It was a princess line about 0.9 how many times but this time 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.070
 Because the specific gravity is very high, the water familiarity is good. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.910
 It is submerged as early as since the beginning of the once but it looks like that contains water 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:15.820
 Furthermore it is another one of g fire , for example by 3 colors 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:17.090
 Once in the 20m here is short I Now if 10 races 10 races 30cm After a little less than 30m 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.100
 You're example was whether Naoki 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.950
 When I want to see, I also mark the color every 1m, so it is very important. 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 I think it is easy to use even at a certain day 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.750
 For example , when using a beer without such a counter 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.150
 I have to make money on the line 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:42.460
 I 'm working with this highly visible color when it comes to that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:46.870
 It is about 30 meters and 40 meters in front of this fishing when we wound line first 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.570
 Where there is bran bottom of the turn I'd better often come Nanda' was Well the place called about 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.770
 To have as easy to see color comes most to 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.750
 Naturally I cut it high 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:00.549
 The height of it is and is easy look but will change if you during this day 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.549
 This is the biggest point 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.450
 Well Ne drew even in the Fall 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.450
 Oops user 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.930
 Yellow yellow 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.940
 I came 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.740
 The meaning of spirit is good 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.590
 It 0.550.65 though is the line-up 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:30.470
 It has become 0.85 15 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:34.970
 It's very thin, so if you are using 0.5 part, for example , use a slightly thinner one 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.560
 Reference of the side something also air selection are for example 0.55 when something like a I mean 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.560
 I think if you can choose 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.870
