00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 energy and fist raised what we come 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.900
 working since the Pleistocene 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.810
 Previous everything healthy we are going to put 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 some specific dates we follow 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.740
 having fun together and we laugh together 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 which is important also and from time to time 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.869
 when we speak some hosts 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.869
 therapeutic 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710
 and I say it with my heart for the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
 artists that we have the privilege of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.570
 participate here we are better than in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 arms are already years of travel we have 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 traveled all over the world themselves 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.890
 festivals in France and Germany- and yes 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.190
 he wants us to offer him live 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.190
 of Europe it's nice that here in the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.320
 homeland you can see 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.859
 a little bit an infrastructure made with 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.859
 criterion 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 in which everything is so complicated 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.280
 I think we are absolute 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.720
 privileged we have had work 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.899
 we take out the furniture with 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.490
 enough dignity we enjoy what 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.060
 we do subscribe basically I prepare a 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.070
 little the framework of the idea and then we go 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.140
 to the local we destroy the original idea 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.390
 we launch the therapeutic hosts and 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.430
 finally 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.430
 there is white smoke 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 when we started already is that this is 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.220
 Pleistocene before we start again 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 a European journey throwing there is a little 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 the war we started that the one in 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.550
 germany at a time this one in which the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.680
 beings of silence ' also there of 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.020
 suddenly detected that in that slipstream 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.119
 we started working by seeing 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.200
 rooms and they were opening laps is 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.159
 that we have been playing in festivals 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.540
 of two hundred thousand people with artists 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.119
 World Recall 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.760
 it seems to me unusual that you have arrived 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.830
 up to the air and especially because no 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.800
 you are in the embrace and warmth of the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.980
 personal fight for your idea fight for your 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.980
 idea 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.540
 While 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.400
 here the family do you are short 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:33.170
 third year 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.170
 sometimes more health
