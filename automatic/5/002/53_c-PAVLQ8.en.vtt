00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.690 
the series and hopefully I have a few
more<00:00:22.270> videos<00:00:23.140> coming<00:00:23.290> up<00:00:23.500> so<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.460> first<00:00:24.670> thing

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
more videos coming up so the first thing

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.190 
more videos coming up so the first thing
we'll<00:00:24.880> do<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.029> create<00:00:25.300> your<00:00:25.450> new<00:00:25.600> composition

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
we'll do is create your new composition

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.280 
we'll do is create your new composition
and<00:00:28.200> 1280<00:00:29.200> by<00:00:29.320> 720<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:30.779> drive<00:00:31.779> then<00:00:32.050> drive

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
and 1280 by 720 and drive then drive

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.290 
and 1280 by 720 and drive then drive
down<00:00:32.470> your<00:00:32.500> clip<00:00:32.800> so<00:00:33.610> first<00:00:33.880> thing<00:00:34.000> one<00:00:34.090> do<00:00:34.210> is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
down your clip so first thing one do is

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.050 
down your clip so first thing one do is
going<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.600> effect<00:00:34.960> a<00:00:35.610> color<00:00:36.610> correction<00:00:37.030> and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
going to effect a color correction and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.810 
going to effect a color correction and
cards<00:00:38.610> now<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:41.130> already<00:00:42.130> have<00:00:42.340> my<00:00:42.370> car

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
cards now and I already have my car

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.460 
cards now and I already have my car
saved<00:00:43.270> so<00:00:43.630> you<00:00:43.690> just<00:00:43.899> want<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.230> get<00:00:44.320> that

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
saved so you just want to get that

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.560 
saved so you just want to get that
simple<00:00:44.890> kind<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.579> zig<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:45.970> F<00:00:47.070> kinda<00:00:48.070> off<00:00:48.570> they

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
simple kind of zig and F kinda off they

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.650 
simple kind of zig and F kinda off they
are<00:00:49.720> kind<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.320> style<00:00:51.010> on<00:00:51.250> s<00:00:51.970> I<00:00:52.270> know<00:00:52.330> what

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
are kind of style on s I know what

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.160 
are kind of style on s I know what
health<00:00:52.900> disabled<00:00:53.530> yeah<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.340> when<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.120> don't<00:00:55.510> go

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
health disabled yeah and when I don't go

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.030 
health disabled yeah and when I don't go
to<00:00:56.230> effect<00:00:56.760> color<00:00:57.760> correction<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.680> use<00:00:59.680> after

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
to effect color correction and use after

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.030 
to effect color correction and use after
saturation<00:01:01.110> now<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.320> wanna<00:01:02.710> come<00:01:02.830> down

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
saturation now you just wanna come down

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.020 
saturation now you just wanna come down
here<00:01:03.310> to<00:01:04.740> just<00:01:05.740> leave<00:01:05.979> everyone<00:01:06.310> there<00:01:06.549> and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
here to just leave everyone there and

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.510 
here to just leave everyone there and
then<00:01:07.180> go<00:01:07.210> down<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.509> master<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.290> I'm<00:01:09.250> just

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
then go down to master you I'm just

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.660 
then go down to master you I'm just
around<00:01:09.820> here<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.509> want<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.720> change<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.200> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
around here you want to change that to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.370 
around here you want to change that to
minus<00:01:12.670> 25<00:01:14.850> yeah<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.180> that's<00:01:16.360> ground<00:01:16.900> and<00:01:17.200> then

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
minus 25 yeah so that's ground and then

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.200 
minus 25 yeah so that's ground and then
another<00:01:18.070> effect<00:01:18.900> color<00:01:19.900> correction<00:01:21.210> gamma

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
another effect color correction gamma

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.920 
another effect color correction gamma
gamma<00:01:22.900> /<00:01:23.260> special<00:01:23.500> /<00:01:23.740> game<00:01:24.510> now<00:01:25.510> this<00:01:25.659> where

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
gamma / special / game now this where

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.480 
gamma / special / game now this where
you're<00:01:26.080> gonna<00:01:26.170> have<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.530> take<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.740> lot<00:01:27.070> numbers

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
you're gonna have to take a lot numbers

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.480 
you're gonna have to take a lot numbers
and<00:01:27.790> it<00:01:27.909> can<00:01:28.060> be<00:01:28.090> kind<00:01:28.480> of<00:01:28.600> tricky<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.800> yeah<00:01:30.220> I'm

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
and it can be kind of tricky so yeah I'm

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.180 
and it can be kind of tricky so yeah I'm
the<00:01:31.360> fourth<00:01:31.600> power<00:01:31.810> black<00:01:32.229> stretch<00:01:32.650> you<00:01:33.040> want

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
the fourth power black stretch you want

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.760 
the fourth power black stretch you want
to<00:01:33.310> change<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.760> to<00:01:34.650> 1.5<00:01:36.420> red<00:01:37.420> gamma<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
to change that to 1.5 red gamma and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.990 
to change that to 1.5 red gamma and
leave<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.370> one<00:01:39.580> point<00:01:39.790> 0<00:01:40.030> r<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:41.110> pedestal

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
leave it on one point 0 r a pedestal

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.930 
leave it on one point 0 r a pedestal
minus<00:01:43.229> 0.1<00:01:44.229> make<00:01:44.860> sure<00:01:45.010> you<00:01:45.130> don't<00:01:45.430> make<00:01:45.850> sure

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
minus 0.1 make sure you don't make sure

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.219 
minus 0.1 make sure you don't make sure
you<00:01:46.030> don't<00:01:46.210> mess<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.479> one<00:01:46.659> up<00:01:46.690> cause<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> lot

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
you don't mess that one up cause a lot

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.310 
you don't mess that one up cause a lot
of<00:01:47.260> people<00:01:47.350> do<00:01:47.710> with<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.400> minus<00:01:48.760> at<00:01:49.479> red<00:01:50.080> gain

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the clip book a lot better and kind of

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.910 
the clip book a lot better and kind of
gives<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.670> vividly<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> unique<00:02:25.870> look
