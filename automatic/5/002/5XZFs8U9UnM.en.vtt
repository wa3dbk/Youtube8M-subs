00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.920
 hello everyone welcome to the talks 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.440
 of nutrition and health danone my name is 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.869
 georgina and in this video titled claves 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.539
 for a healthy diet 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.430
 we will explain the guidelines to achieve it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.860
 for this this talk is structured 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.590
 in different sections first we will see 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.840
 What is a diet or diet? 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.850
 healthy then we will also talk about 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.370
 why it is important and convenient 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.739
 carry out this feeding and for 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.469
 last we will see how to plan this 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.480
 healthy diet you want to know how it 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.880
 makes a healthy diet we are going to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.370
 see him 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.200
 to begin with let's reflect on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.260
 two words that sometimes we do not use 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.630
 in the most correct way to feed and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.630
 nourish yourself you think the same 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.160
 possibly now that you have thought 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.380
 you have realized that they are not 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.390
 exactly the same 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.879
 feeding is a voluntary act and you 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.460
 can educate is the act of eating 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.620
 food therefore is to catch them and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.950
 take them to your mouth and we can decide 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.470
 when in what way how to feed 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.650
 instead, nourishment is an act 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.390
 involuntary and you can not educate 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.369
 our body will absorb the nutrients 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.610
 of these foods and will take advantage of them 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.800
 but we can not decide how I'm going to 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.530
 take advantage of these nutrients when 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.380
 I'm going to take advantage of how we can 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.630
 conclude that the foods are the boxes 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.240
 that contain the nutrients and so 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.050
 so much to be well nourished I have to 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.570
 know how to choose these foods well 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.480
 There are two types of nutrients the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.280
 energetic and non-energetic both 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.340
 they are equally important because inside 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.960
 of them in the case of energy 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.410
 we will find carbohydrates like 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.510
 can be sugar fiber starches or 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.810
 we can also find fats 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.910
 also called lipids and proteins 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.580
 within the group of nutrients not 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.190
 energetics we find water very 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.860
 important mineral salts and 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.720
 vitamins so we already know that if 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.010
 we choose food well 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 we will get all the nutrients 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.560
 necessary but let's go beyond 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.870
 because someone could think well then 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.240
 for breakfast as only fruit for 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.220
 eat take a plate of pasta and so I 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.280
 benefited from its nutrients for 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.590
 a dairy and snack options as 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.810
 only meat and so I already have all the 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.520
 nutrients all day this is not 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.500
 correct because for a 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.200
 healthy food must meet 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.390
 with concepts that will ensure us the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.840
 contribution of these nutrients throughout 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.840
 all day
