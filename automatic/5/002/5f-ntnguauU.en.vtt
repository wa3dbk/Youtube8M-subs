00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.210
 to 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:23.739
 I'm going to talk a little old today about 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.730
 hose that happens the week and had 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:30.910
 a certain discussion in the groups of 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.239
 blogs and some people came to talk 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.120
 some nonsense even send away who 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.320
 You know, like, and cursing, saying something. 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.899
 It's not true, but let's 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.479
 On the other hand, I ask you to stop 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.269
 freshness is this discussion that this will 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:52.059
 there in no crap 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.589
 I also want to say that each one 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.309
 what do you like 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.759
 each one is left with that condition and has 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.960
 The one you say is better, the worse it is. 

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:05.590
 just think it goes from your condition of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.110
 financial 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.950
 it is opinion also account for you 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.229
 Old sometimes gets you thinking there 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.670
 very cooperative bag myself 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.229
 I suffered this and asked to stop but it 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.580
 boring but let's go 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:29.580
 I'm here today with my brazuca 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 Prazuck 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 actually my girlfriend but there is not 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.610
 bit a piece of my tania on the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.560
 accident 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.580
 Come on, let's get it here for you. 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.430
 I want to talk 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.100
 it's a matter of stuff, guys, another one 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.960
 in my opinion that as a collaborator 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 here on Uncle Bob's blog 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.050
 I want to give my opinion on the two 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.580
 hoses 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.690
 making a comparison with the two 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.100
 hoses and why I think the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.530
 hose that I will choose need 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.490
 to know that it is better than 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.619
 the other 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.180
 I'll make it clear that my opinion 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:26.640
 beauty 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:32.420
 the sack of the blue that fills it there 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.420
 past stiletto here o work has already opened 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:47.510
 Nor does the serenity just ready. 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.510
 show you how she 's inside 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.420
 This is what I was commenting on. 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:59.170
 during the discussion even this is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.310
 The point I do not like brazucah is that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.340
 he does 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.670
 will prefer thunder light my opinion 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.550
 once again in opera and rugosa for 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:16.540
 inside you can see that until you stay who 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:19.480
 is that was already black here is that O 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:31.660
 normal and natural but that's the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:39.610
 I think her stuff as I go O 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:42.610
 I also got light and how I talked to 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.970
 accident on passing on it there is a 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.320
 only the middle part so I cut to 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.610
 try to give a smoke home on time 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.610
 do the same scheme 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.470
 asking the hell out here, March 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.079
 when was the mass 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.150
 What happens is that I do not know if I will 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.239
 to give you to see but the 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.760
 white spots on her so that she 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.459
 It looks like it's broken even it's a 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.130
 much more rigid material to pass through a 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.289
 stylus on it to try to show the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.030
 stuff inside 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.030
 how is a material inside sorry 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:41.210
 It's very difficult, it 's very difficult. 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.210
 the tablet is complicated 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.390
 good, I 'm going I know I do not 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.430
 It will be a little tricky to see more 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:05:01.140
 so O are seeing is well smoother 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.270
 she has apparently looks c rough 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:11.700
 but if you run your finger even for 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:13.610
 in here it is smooth ó those marks that 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:20.190
 I commented that she turned white as if 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:22.740
 had broken once more i will leave 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.110
 very clear, that's my opinion, I 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.560
 including asking the guys to 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.530
 of camané inbox try to stay eating 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.830
 increase the crowd is talking 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.830
 I do not know what these things are 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.400
 Are you a reader of the bea? 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.460
 how about ours from bob's blog 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:51.500
 so I wanted to ask you one more time 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:55.050
 It's annoying and talking my take one thing 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.600
 if you have your opinion of the old but do not 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.410
 Let's keep weighing 100 percent in 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.790
 What do you think about this 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.920
 opinion is what you think of your opinion 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.410
 and ready to discuss 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.210
 Just so let's get old. 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.180
 a boring discussion both with the side 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:19.230
 how much for the other one understood that 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:23.370

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:27.260
