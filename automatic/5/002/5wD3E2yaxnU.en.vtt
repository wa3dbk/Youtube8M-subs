00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.430 
marijuana yeah I think that they should
think<00:01:48.650> about<00:01:48.770> why<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:50.300> they<00:01:50.780> oppose<00:01:51.140> it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
think about why that they oppose it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.360 
think about why that they oppose it
because<00:01:51.940> it's<00:01:52.940> not<00:01:53.530> something<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.560> needs

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
because it's not something that needs

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.370 
because it's not something that needs
opposition<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.479> at<00:01:56.570> all<00:01:56.690> it's<00:01:56.960> been<00:01:57.110> around

of the ventilation that you have set up
here<00:02:31.439> kind<00:02:32.439> of<00:02:32.560> my<00:02:32.680> own<00:02:32.859> invention<00:02:33.189> as<00:02:34.000> far<00:02:34.299> as

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
here kind of my own invention as far as

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.160 
here kind of my own invention as far as
the<00:02:35.849> plastic<00:02:36.849> pipe<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.299> drilled<00:02:37.569> holes<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.049> it

the plastic pipe I drilled holes in it
so<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:39.579> could<00:02:40.540> run<00:02:40.840> air<00:02:41.109> through<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
so that I could run air through the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.099 
so that I could run air through the
plants<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.219> make<00:02:42.250> them<00:02:42.549> move<00:02:42.790> more<00:02:43.599> they<00:02:43.900> grow

plants to make them move more they grow

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.770 
plants to make them move more they grow
better<00:02:44.349> they're<00:02:44.709> happier<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.419> my<00:02:46.419> co<00:02:46.659> 2

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
better they're happier and my co 2
