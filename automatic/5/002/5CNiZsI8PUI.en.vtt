00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
of course we look at the code for hold

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.380 
of course we look at the code for hold
it<00:02:02.830> like<00:02:02.920> that's<00:02:03.190> gonna<00:02:03.369> see<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.700> code<00:02:04.000> for<00:02:04.300> it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
all right so we got a point nobody got a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.789 
all right so we got a point nobody got a
point

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
point

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
so it's 10k attackers of the Legion 10k

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.780 
so it's 10k attackers of the Legion 10k
attacker<00:03:02.940> Legion<00:03:03.940> locations<00:03:04.390> up

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
need for the 12 K attacker depletion

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.660 
need for the 12 K attacker depletion
