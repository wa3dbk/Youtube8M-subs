from<00:03:41.550> turning<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.510> now<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.650> that

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
from turning it like this now to that

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.979 
from turning it like this now to that
lock<00:03:44.040> there<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.270> dynamic<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> way

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
lock there and it's just dynamic the way

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.170 
lock there and it's just dynamic the way
it<00:03:46.110> doesn't<00:03:46.290> absolutely<00:03:46.739> superb<00:03:47.370> because

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
it doesn't absolutely superb because

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.580 
it doesn't absolutely superb because
we've<00:03:48.360> got<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.569> quick<00:03:48.810> shift<00:03:49.019> gearbox<00:03:49.260> on

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
we've got this quick shift gearbox on

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.220 
we've got this quick shift gearbox on
this<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.459> allows<00:03:50.730> us<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.090> really<00:03:51.300> up<00:03:51.959> shift

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
this so it allows us to really up shift

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.199 
this so it allows us to really up shift
quickly<00:03:52.410> somewhat<00:03:53.370> quicker<00:03:53.610> than<00:03:53.790> before<00:03:53.940> and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
quickly somewhat quicker than before and
