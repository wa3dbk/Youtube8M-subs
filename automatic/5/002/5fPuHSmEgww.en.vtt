kind of trace this hose along and it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.549 
kind of trace this hose along and it
runs<00:00:51.989> behind<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> back<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.660> back

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
runs behind the back and then right back

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
runs behind the back and then right back
here<00:00:57.440> it's<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.399> down<00:00:59.910> in

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
here it's going to be right down in

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.880 
here it's going to be right down in
there

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
there

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
there
and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> best<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> figured<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.149> how<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> do

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and the best way I figured out how to do

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.230 
and the best way I figured out how to do
it<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:05.040> there's<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.640> short<00:01:06.090> tube<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:09.060> it's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it is there's a short tube here and it's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.770 
it is there's a short tube here and it's
got<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.689> little<00:01:10.580> 90<00:01:11.580> degree<00:01:11.850> elbow<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
got this little 90 degree elbow and that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
got this little 90 degree elbow and that
goes<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.070> valve<00:01:14.280> cover<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
goes that's down on the valve cover so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.550 
goes that's down on the valve cover so
it's<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.720> sitting<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.350> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it's going to be sitting in there like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.420 
it's going to be sitting in there like
that<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.869> lift<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> I've<00:01:19.680> pushed<00:01:20.040> back

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that I lift it up and I've pushed back

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
that I lift it up and I've pushed back
like<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:21.030> against<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> firewall<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.200> it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
like that against the firewall and it

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.920 
like that against the firewall and it
popped<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.630> still

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

this<00:02:29.080> little<00:02:29.290> plug<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.250> put<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.760> there

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910

this little plug and I put it in there
and<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:32.130> or<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.160> other<00:02:33.490> option<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.270> if<00:02:34.300> you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and just or the other option is if you

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.460

could go to Ford and order the the right

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.420 
could go to Ford and order the the right
one<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.800> guess<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:39.900> um<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.890> know<00:02:41.920> you'll

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
one I guess but um you know you'll

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.520 
one I guess but um you know you'll
probably<00:02:42.670> pay<00:02:42.970> more<00:02:43.000> for<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.690> don't<00:02:43.900> know<00:02:44.050> so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
probably pay more for it I don't know so

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.530 
probably pay more for it I don't know so
anyway<00:02:44.920> I'm<00:02:45.160> going<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.370> put<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:45.970> back

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
anyway I'm going to put this one on back

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.100 
anyway I'm going to put this one on back
on<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.460> tighten<00:02:48.460> it<00:02:48.520> up

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
on here and tighten it up

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.200 
on here and tighten it up
facing<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.290> way<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:51.610> know<00:02:51.730> same<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.150> you

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
facing that way you know same way you

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.730 
facing that way you know same way you
took<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.450> off<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.960> then<00:02:53.320> I'm<00:02:53.440> going<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.590> go

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
took it off and then I'm going to go

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.320 
took it off and then I'm going to go
back<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.250> reverse<00:02:54.490> order<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.910> pop<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.210> down

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
back and reverse order and pop it down

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.670 
back and reverse order and pop it down
so<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.660> hope<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.900> helps<00:02:56.290> them<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:56.530> at<00:02:56.650> least

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
so I hope that helps them but at least

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.660 
so I hope that helps them but at least
you<00:02:56.920> know<00:02:56.980> where<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.520> okay<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:59.650> done<00:03:00.040> that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
you know where it is okay I'm done that

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.550 
you know where it is okay I'm done that
was<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> little<00:03:01.390> bit<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.780> pain<00:03:01.990> in<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.110> ass<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
was a little bit of a pain in the ass is

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.900 
was a little bit of a pain in the ass is
probably<00:03:02.890> more<00:03:03.040> intimidating<00:03:03.610> than<00:03:03.670> anything

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
probably more intimidating than anything

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.400 
probably more intimidating than anything
because<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.300> don't<00:03:04.360> think<00:03:04.480> I'd<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.230> but

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
because I don't think I'd get to it but

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.310 
because I don't think I'd get to it but
next<00:03:06.370> time<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.970> know<00:03:10.120> it'll<00:03:10.360> be<00:03:10.450> easier<00:03:10.870> if<00:03:11.170> I

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
next time you know it'll be easier if I

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.979 
next time you know it'll be easier if I
do<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.620> again<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.450> anyway<00:03:13.450> we're<00:03:13.959> back
