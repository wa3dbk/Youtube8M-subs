00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
for like two dollars a long time ago I

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.240 
for like two dollars a long time ago I
think<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.930> price<00:05:51.200> is<00:05:51.229> still<00:05:51.620> on<00:05:51.770> it<00:05:51.950> somewhere

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
think the price is still on it somewhere

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.100 
think the price is still on it somewhere
if<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.520> really<00:05:52.940> wanted<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.240> show<00:05:53.479> you<00:05:53.540> but<00:05:53.870> I'm

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.690 
if I really wanted to show you but I'm
pretty<00:05:54.350> sure<00:05:54.440> it<00:05:54.650> was<00:05:54.740> two<00:05:54.919> dollars<00:05:55.310> but<00:05:55.550> it's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700
