alright<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.170> Kazak<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> pretty<00:00:32.070> similar<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
alright so Kazak is pretty similar to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.910

without<00:00:42.329> close<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> 20

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
without close as they can get to 20

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.910 
without close as they can get to 20
without<00:00:44.579> getting<00:00:44.850> over<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.780> they'll<00:00:46.079> take

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
without getting over so they'll take

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040 
without getting over so they'll take
turns<00:00:47.250> flipping<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.030> central<00:00:48.480> sack<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
turns flipping from a central sack and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.350 
turns flipping from a central sack and
as<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> hear<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.969> cards<00:00:51.270> in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
as you can see you hear all the cards in

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.189 
as you can see you hear all the cards in
the<00:00:51.420> central<00:00:51.750> stack<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:53.090> above<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.750> value<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the central stack are above the value of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.029 
the central stack are above the value of
6<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.100> that's<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:57.000> we'd<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.719> um<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
6 so that's how we'd have to do it um so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
6 so that's how we'd have to do it um so
it<00:00:59.190> goes<00:00:59.340> from<00:00:59.550> 6<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> way<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> 10<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it goes from 6 all the way to 10 and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
it goes from 6 all the way to 10 and
then<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> Joker<00:01:02.129> card<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.780> value

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
then we use the Joker card for the value

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.250 
then we use the Joker card for the value
of<00:01:04.229> 11<00:01:04.680> which<00:01:05.129> played<00:01:05.880> pisaq<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> old

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
of 11 which played pisaq on like the old

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
of 11 which played pisaq on like the old
republic<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> card<00:01:09.000> values

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
republic you know that the card values

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.380 
republic you know that the card values
go<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:09.689> 1<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.080> 11<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> cards

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
go from 1 to 11 and then all the cards

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.679 
go from 1 to 11 and then all the cards
of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.110> value<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:16.380> value<00:01:16.500> 5<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.670> below<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
of the value the value 5 or below and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.230 
of the value the value 5 or below and
put<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.799> kind<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> extra<00:01:20.729> deck<00:01:20.939> which

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
put in this kind of extra deck which

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.499 
put in this kind of extra deck which
becomes<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.470> player's<00:01:23.220> hands<00:01:23.850> during<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
becomes the player's hands during the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.429 
becomes the player's hands during the
game<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.439> we'll<00:01:25.950> explain<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.580> about<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
game but we'll explain more about that

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.109 
game but we'll explain more about that
later

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
later

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.969 
later
basically<00:01:30.119> you'll<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.740> take<00:01:31.740> turns

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
basically you'll just take turns

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.260 
basically you'll just take turns
flipping<00:01:32.520> from<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.939> central<00:01:33.360> staff<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.270> try

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
flipping from this central staff and try

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.069 
flipping from this central staff and try
to<00:01:36.329> get<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.840> close<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> 20<00:01:38.659> before<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> other

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to get as close to 20 before the other

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.399 
to get as close to 20 before the other
person<00:01:40.170> does<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.939> don't<00:01:45.299> need<00:01:45.540> any<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.229> those

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
person does you don't need any of those

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.429 
person does you don't need any of those
royal<00:01:46.740> cards<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.430> we're<00:01:47.579> set<00:01:47.820> over<00:01:48.060> there

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
royal cards that we're set over there

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.749 
royal cards that we're set over there
you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.619> use<00:01:49.799> them<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.009> something<00:01:50.460> else<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you can use them for something else that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.399 
you can use them for something else that
will<00:01:50.850> mention<00:01:51.030> leave<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.960> they're<00:01:52.259> not

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
will mention leave but they're not

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.780 
will mention leave but they're not
necessary<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> regular<00:01:54.180> game<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.479> all

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
necessary for the regular game at all

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
necessary for the regular game at all
so<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.630> second<00:01:58.020> stack<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.680> said<00:01:58.860> about

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
so the second stack which I said about

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.350 
so the second stack which I said about
was<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> hand<00:02:00.680> usually<00:02:01.680> you'll<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.460> give

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
was the hand usually you'll just give

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
was the hand usually you'll just give
out<00:02:03.509> 5<00:02:03.719> cards<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> actual<00:02:04.950> game<00:02:05.280> you

won't<00:02:05.579> show<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> other<00:02:06.149> person<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
won't show the other person but for the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
them all face-up

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
them all face-up
you<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.099> see<00:02:11.370> what's<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.849> on<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
you can see what's going on and you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.720 
you can see what's going on and you
don't<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.650> use<00:02:13.799> any<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> rest<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
don't really use any of the rest of the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.420 
don't really use any of the rest of the
cards<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> game<00:02:15.659> is<00:02:15.840> divided<00:02:16.290> into

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
cards because the game is divided into

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.920 
cards because the game is divided into
kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.459> three<00:02:17.549> increments<00:02:18.299> but<00:02:18.510> you'll<00:02:18.720> use

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
kind of three increments but you'll use

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.479 
kind of three increments but you'll use
the<00:02:19.110> same<00:02:19.319> hand<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.739> whole<00:02:19.890> time<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
the same hand the whole time and you

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.320 
the same hand the whole time and you
won't<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:20.790> any<00:02:20.849> new<00:02:21.150> ones<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:23.209> Colin's<00:02:24.209> going

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
won't get any new ones so Colin's going

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.970 
won't get any new ones so Colin's going
to<00:02:24.420> go<00:02:24.540> into<00:02:24.720> more<00:02:24.810> depth<00:02:25.080> about<00:02:25.230> what<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
to go into more depth about what the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.280 
to go into more depth about what the
colors<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.849> numbers<00:02:27.209> mean<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.049> hand

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
colors and the numbers mean in the hand

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.699 
colors and the numbers mean in the hand
okay<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> hand<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.349> two

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
okay so in the hand if you have a two

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.250 
okay so in the hand if you have a two
that<00:02:32.549> would<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.909> be<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.239> value<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.720> plus<00:02:33.989> two

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that would just be a value of plus two

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.979 
that would just be a value of plus two
and<00:02:34.560> with<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> four<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.180> use<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.599> or<00:02:36.810> a

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
and with a four you can use that or a

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.930 
and with a four you can use that or a
red<00:02:37.920> color<00:02:38.250> would<00:02:39.120> be<00:02:39.299> used<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:40.730> subtract<00:02:41.730> from

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
red color would be used to subtract from

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.809 
red color would be used to subtract from
your<00:02:42.090> total<00:02:42.269> values<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.989> had<00:02:43.220> 24<00:02:44.220> you

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
your total values so if you had 24 you

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.339 
your total values so if you had 24 you
could<00:02:45.000> subtract<00:02:45.480> using<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> four<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.560> 20

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
could subtract using the four and get 20

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.390 
could subtract using the four and get 20
usually<00:02:49.349> when<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.650> play<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> card<00:02:50.129> from<00:02:50.370> your

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
usually when you play a card from your

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.140 
usually when you play a card from your
hand<00:02:50.519> if<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.359> have<00:02:51.650> say<00:02:52.650> an<00:02:52.890> 8<00:02:53.190> like<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:53.819> and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
hand if you have say an 8 like this and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.520 
hand if you have say an 8 like this and
you<00:02:54.299> wanted<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.569> play<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> 4<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.829> would<00:02:55.980> play

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
you wanted to play a 4 you would play

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.809 
you wanted to play a 4 you would play
you<00:02:58.530> would<00:02:58.620> play<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.890> upside<00:02:59.280> down<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.790> that

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
you would play it upside down so that

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.330 
you would play it upside down so that
the<00:02:59.970> other<00:03:00.150> person<00:03:00.239> wouldn't<00:03:00.810> know<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.379> you

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the other person wouldn't know and you

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.890 
the other person wouldn't know and you
would<00:03:02.459> get<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.819> bit<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.090> an<00:03:03.180> advantage<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.810> you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
would get a bit of an advantage and you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.440 
would get a bit of an advantage and you
can<00:03:04.049> see<00:03:04.260> how<00:03:04.379> that<00:03:04.440> would<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:05.450> tactical

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
can see how that would be a tactical

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.780 
can see how that would be a tactical
advantage<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.140> game<00:03:08.420> aces<00:03:09.980> are<00:03:10.980> used<00:03:11.340> as<00:03:11.640> a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
advantage in the game aces are used as a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.479 
advantage in the game aces are used as a
plus<00:03:12.120> or<00:03:12.329> minus<00:03:12.450> 1<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.859> game<00:03:14.040> no<00:03:14.310> matter

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
plus or minus 1 in the game no matter

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.120 
plus or minus 1 in the game no matter
what<00:03:14.700> color<00:03:14.940> they<00:03:15.180> are

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
what color they are

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.650 
what color they are
yeah<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.849> they<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:18.450> useful

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
yeah so they can be really useful

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.870 
yeah so they can be really useful
because<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.109> can<00:03:19.230> use<00:03:19.470> them<00:03:19.680> go<00:03:20.310> up<00:03:20.459> up<00:03:20.669> up

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
because you can use them go up up up

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.500 
because you can use them go up up up
from<00:03:21.450> 19<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.900> 20<00:03:22.290> or<00:03:22.410> gone<00:03:22.620> from<00:03:22.829> 21<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.370> 19<00:03:23.549> or

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
from 19 to 20 or gone from 21 to 19 or

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.180 
from 19 to 20 or gone from 21 to 19 or
even<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.109> get<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.410> closer<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.040> that

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
even just to get you closer to that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.000 
even just to get you closer to that
number<00:03:26.480> because<00:03:27.480> sometimes<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.379> ends<00:03:28.590> up<00:03:28.829> just

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
number because sometimes it ends up just

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.860 
number because sometimes it ends up just
being<00:03:29.129> a<00:03:29.370> person<00:03:29.700> who's<00:03:29.819> closest<00:03:30.239> when<00:03:30.720> it's

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
being a person who's closest when it's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.559 
being a person who's closest when it's
not<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.560> person<00:03:31.889> who<00:03:31.950> gets<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.250> 20<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.269> for<00:03:33.510> an

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
not the person who gets to 20 so for an

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.539 
not the person who gets to 20 so for an
example<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.049> plays<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.950> player<00:03:35.190> flipped

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
example of plays so that player flipped

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.319 
example of plays so that player flipped
an<00:03:35.700> 8

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
an 8

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.479 
an 8
this<00:03:37.019> player<00:03:37.290> flips<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.299> negative<00:03:40.129> 6<00:03:41.129> you<00:03:41.400> can

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
this player flips a negative 6 you can

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.390 
this player flips a negative 6 you can
remember<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> 1<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.349> subtract<00:03:43.769> 5

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
remember this is a 1 so you subtract 5

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.430 
remember this is a 1 so you subtract 5
from<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.819> face<00:03:45.030> value<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.780> red<00:03:45.930> cards<00:03:46.319> in

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
from the face value for the red cards in

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.770 
from the face value for the red cards in
the<00:03:46.530> sexual<00:03:46.889> deck<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.299> would<00:03:48.449> be<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> 3

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
the sexual deck so this would be a 3

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.289 
the sexual deck so this would be a 3
this<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> 1<00:03:50.720> they<00:03:51.720> return<00:03:52.049> it's<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.709> 5<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:54.090> they

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
this is a 1 they return it's a 5 so they

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.710 
this is a 1 they return it's a 5 so they
get<00:03:54.449> an<00:03:54.599> 8<00:03:54.780> total<00:03:55.430> 6<00:03:56.430> plus<00:03:57.150> 1<00:03:57.629> is<00:03:57.930> 7<00:03:59.359> then<00:04:00.359> we<00:04:00.569> got

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
get an 8 total 6 plus 1 is 7 then we got

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.559 
get an 8 total 6 plus 1 is 7 then we got
9<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.260> there<00:04:01.669> so<00:04:02.669> that's<00:04:02.879> a<00:04:03.709> 17<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.269> then<00:04:06.269> at

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
9 in there so that's a 17 and then at

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.379 
9 in there so that's a 17 and then at
that<00:04:06.780> point<00:04:06.840> he<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.680> play<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.430> card<00:04:09.060> from<00:04:09.299> his

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
that point he can play a card from his

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.750 
that point he can play a card from his
hand<00:04:09.449> you<00:04:10.319> can<00:04:10.470> play<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:11.190> can<00:04:11.220> play<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.549> card

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.390 
hand you can play you can play the card
before<00:04:11.879> you<00:04:12.209> flip<00:04:12.419> if<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.690> want<00:04:12.870> or<00:04:13.560> after<00:04:14.310> you

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
before you flip if you want or after you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.969 
before you flip if you want or after you
flip<00:04:14.669> so<00:04:15.389> he<00:04:15.599> just<00:04:15.780> plays<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> 3<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.829> since

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
flip so he just plays a 3 and since

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.789 
flip so he just plays a 3 and since
that's<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.280> plus<00:04:17.489> 3<00:04:17.789> his<00:04:18.209> total<00:04:18.479> is<00:04:18.659> 20<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.200> now

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
that's a plus 3 his total is 20 and now

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.380 
that's a plus 3 his total is 20 and now
that<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.099> my<00:04:20.219> turn<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.640> have<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.909> either<00:04:21.030> match

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
that it's my turn I have to either match

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.500 
that it's my turn I have to either match
that<00:04:21.780> or

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
that or

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.160 
that or
I<00:04:23.540> lose<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.840> round<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.640> flip<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.240> get<00:04:26.570> a<00:04:26.750> joker

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
I lose the round so I flip I get a joker

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.520 
I lose the round so I flip I get a joker
and<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.940> every<00:04:29.270> thought<00:04:29.420> we<00:04:29.510> got<00:04:29.660> one<00:04:29.900> six

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
and so every thought we got one six

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.320 
and so every thought we got one six
seven<00:04:31.300> plus<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.480> Joker<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.080> 18<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.300> since<00:04:37.330> 18

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
seven plus the Joker is 18 and since 18

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.320 
seven plus the Joker is 18 and since 18
I<00:04:38.600> can<00:04:39.110> use<00:04:39.490> columns<00:04:40.490> black<00:04:40.700> -<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.060> can't

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
I can use columns black - you can't

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.940 
I can use columns black - you can't
actually<00:04:41.450> do<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:41.930> but<00:04:44.200> say<00:04:45.200> I<00:04:45.230> had<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.500> black<00:04:45.740> -

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
actually do this but say I had a black -

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.220 
actually do this but say I had a black -
bus<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.120> go<00:04:47.480> up<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.690> 20<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.580> then<00:04:49.930> if<00:04:50.930> both

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
bus to go up to 20 and then if both

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.250 
bus to go up to 20 and then if both
players<00:04:51.440> get<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.310> 20<00:04:52.640> then<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.690> game<00:04:53.900> goes<00:04:54.140> on

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
players get to 20 then the game goes on

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.740 
players get to 20 then the game goes on
to<00:04:54.530> 30<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.700> doesn't<00:04:56.120> go<00:04:56.210> past<00:04:56.450> that

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
to 30 and it doesn't go past that

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.660 
to 30 and it doesn't go past that
because<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.530> special<00:04:57.650> tiebreaker<00:04:58.340> rules

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
because of the special tiebreaker rules

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.840 
because of the special tiebreaker rules
it<00:04:59.540> would<00:04:59.690> be<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.990> first<00:05:00.230> person<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.770> get<00:05:01.070> 30

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
it would be the first person to get 30

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.790 
it would be the first person to get 30
would<00:05:02.180> win<00:05:02.390> instantly<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.230> next<00:05:03.500> person

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
would win instantly the next person

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.860 
would win instantly the next person
doesn't<00:05:04.100> get<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.220> chance<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.670> match<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.360> if

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
doesn't get a chance to match it and if

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.130 
doesn't get a chance to match it and if
someone<00:05:06.170> goes<00:05:06.260> over<00:05:06.740> 30<00:05:07.040> by<00:05:07.280> flipping<00:05:11.140> then

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
someone goes over 30 by flipping then

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.040 
someone goes over 30 by flipping then
they<00:05:12.920> lose<00:05:13.370> automatically<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.900> other

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
they lose automatically and the other

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.910 
they lose automatically and the other
player<00:05:15.320> gets<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.680> point

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
player gets the point

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.290 
player gets the point

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
beginning to be a jack I would play a

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.750 
beginning to be a jack I would play a
jack<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:11.800> other<00:06:11.980> person<00:06:12.190> would<00:06:12.550> play<00:06:12.730> a

change<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:16.810> bet

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
change the bet

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.830 
change the bet
during<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.620> game<00:06:17.830> so<00:06:18.669> it<00:06:19.419> really<00:06:19.660> doesn't

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
during the game so it really doesn't

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.860 
during the game so it really doesn't
play<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.580> part<00:06:21.580> in<00:06:21.700> the<00:06:21.850> game<00:06:22.030> until<00:06:22.480> the<00:06:22.690> end

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
play a part in the game until the end
