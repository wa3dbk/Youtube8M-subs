00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
 today everything is left, I am pessimistic 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.520
 a new video and good today I come to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 talk to them about a pretty enough topic 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.639
 serious and that makes me a little sad and it's 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.490
 about games and their hacks before 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.430
 nothing will leave in the description the link of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.220
 the page where the hack is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.840
 pretty scoundrels that up 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 they made a rash page in hack 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.300
 for people to download it and not 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.270
 I know if it's people who hate the truth this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.309
 game and want to ruin it and I do not know but 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.920
 Well the truth is that the worst is 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.190
 true there are many videos or pages where 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.579
 they tell you they are hacks but the truth is not 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.339
 no they are not hack they are virus or i do not know but i 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.350
 I was playing today for the first time what 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.559
 I played it I played it quite excited and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.420
 I wanted like a little boy I have not 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.609
 mentioned enough times that I am a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.269
 fan I'm driving that I was following 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:01:00.839
 this title for too long and good 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.089
 it turns out that I'm playing normal I 'm going to 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.829
 enter a door and kill me tell me 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.619
 well he found me from I found 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.320
 front with him I kill myself but I do not see the one 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.899
 camps the enemy is running towards a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.549
 side of nowhere automatically turns 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.570
 and start shooting where I'm going to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.450
 come in and I stayed like that I forgave and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.789
 he was playing like two hours and so 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.170
 it was all all the games not 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:30.149
 hacker was missing as I said I 'm 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.270
 I just love playing soccer and there it is 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.700
 where you could see all this more in domain and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.189
 all that was pretty weird but in the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 games was where it appeared if you died 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.840
 very appreciated days besides that the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.140
 wisp or not right now are a disgust has been 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.920
 that was the typical countryman who 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.409
 I put in a little box and you're so close 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.119
 to his house or where he was hiding and already 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.950
 start to shoot automatically and you 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.200
 killed even kills you through the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.640
 walls is something that is loading 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.640
 too much the game the truth 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.330
 Well, this kind of complaint or not 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.650
 I had to relieve myself by telling them this 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.050
 how about you who have played this that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.420
 Has happened to them if they are kind to 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.100
 commenting on the truth is something that puts 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.080
 quite sad since I expected this 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.620
 I play too much and I was going to buy it in 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.040
 the xbox world that are 8 thousand 500 pesos 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.040
 the most 1000 game console and now 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.080
 I am like that I entered the doubt of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.090
 If I buy less, I'm not so 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.760
 sure why why it's good they 're at 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.410
 this is and I'm going through all this during 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.560
 a whole year until the next one 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.590
 hit and then you will not spend 9 thousand 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.250
 500 pesos for nothing else to get angry not what 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.080
 he 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.000
 so good leave in the comments 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.330
 you give me what you think, they know how to check in 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.180
 description is the hack link and no 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.440
 I know what gameplay I will leave you in the background 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.750
 better one 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.000
 that has to do with the hacker a 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.180
 gameplay of a leaf hacker that I 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.070
 I found this is the funnel this is for 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.650
 those who do not know that he is imputed is the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.560
 tour nothing else squeezes the trigger of 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.920
 shoot and he and you came through that yes what 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.470
 could automatic to where it comes 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.700
 take your enemy you do not move anything alone 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.410
 tighten the shooting and 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.780
 automatically moves in mexico not 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.420
 it has to be nothing else but well 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.090
 You will have seen it in the video if you 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.200
 leave and I hope you liked it you know 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.200
 see you in the next video bye bye 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.400
 and good guys something that I forgot and 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.260
 well, it's something that I forgot 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.090
 tell them is that good here I left them 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.450
 another gameplay two other gameplays but 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.340
 they see them complete this video state in 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.080
 juger comments wichi all those 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.840
 that talk about hackers and a lot 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.340
 people say that thing talking about the in 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.130
 white and a lot of people say it's the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.200
 wood and good there are quite a few types of in 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.010
 wood and the funnel has so to speak 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.280
 several many roots so to speak 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.870
 can since which dolls shoot 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.730
 automatically to be an enemy until you 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.940
 mark through the walls where it is 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.970
 you are invincible and all that so good 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.519
 here I leave you in the videos first to 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.769
 what they will be seeing is a funnel 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.470
 quite abrupt are those that were used 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.690
 before in the modern warfare 2 to me to me 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.560
 yes I had to use these or play with these 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.930
 in boots because there were good times where 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.669
 was hacked into the entire server and 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.160
 everyone had the hack not 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.230
 only one person but good these 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.990
 they are the last votes 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.330
 and well then they will see in a piece of 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.490
 modern warfare 3 like another on a bus where 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.830
 you bookmark the enemies and there and 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.570
 nothing else has to shoot or is not 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.250
 you doubt is not for automatically for you 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.010
 it marks you where the enemies are 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.540
 only and so there are quite a few types of 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.280
 woods but to give you an idea 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.520
 these are the six votes and now it is 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.660
 colors have been followed 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.660
 the video example and the 27 video goodbye
