00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 No. That's right. That's the basics. That's the experience. 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.519
 Now that we've got the first game, we're ready to go. 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.630
 Why do not you please 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.800
 He confessed to a letter he urged here . 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.880
 I do not think I'll stay calm That year I try now Leo 1p Lipstick Smoke 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.880
 Let's find out. 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.880
 we 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.540
 Ah 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.540
 Also 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.260
 It started at 5:00 pm, and it was set at 5 o'clock. 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.100
 I frowned. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.890
 The advantage of baseball is that this is basically an aggressive play 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.580
 I have a tendency and I make good variables. 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.900
 General This player does not choose others well 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:01:00.070
 It's a fast multi-pack , but it's basically the same 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:04.270
 Tupac and I go inside the house. Yes . 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.100
 Before I made it to perfume, it was like that now that other players 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.850
 Is not it a bit tricky? 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.420
 Oh I also personally think that if you have other sources like yes or no 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.440
 If Yoon Chan Lee is a player , he / 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.340
 I wondered how to do it this way now, 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.900
 These players play hard to play Anna eotneunde are in fact made liquor 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.010
 Come out again. 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:31.430
 It's a little bit of a player in the stuff that you really prepared in Jahan. 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:36.470
 It's called the Four Japanese . 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.010
 If it wins only the fact that only configuration would be something neurological Case akbari control standpoint 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.050
 4 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:46.340
 Why can not I paint something like this? 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:49.610
 Personally, this second money of a player is a strategy that 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.180
 I do not know, but I do not think it 's bad. 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.710
 Uh, why'm mucus but this can be a double-edged sword himself once more 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:02.300
 Thanks for doing this is one of the entrance gates no more do this language is broad Deokjeokdo 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:06.530
 Is not it a day ubiquitous that the name itself is chicken under the vowel star 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.080
 I compared this situation inde can just dip below that psychological warfare Fashion &amp; 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.010
 Obviously different 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.790
 1 set of economic Had jireugi of whether some form of overlooking it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.769
 I feel nine. Oh, I'm just a drill . 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.209
 I think so. 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:27.840
 Now though composed of 4 teams should be gradually out of a jam quickly as possible radio 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.629
 It's a situation. From the standpoint of the organization , 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.360
 I did not go there, I had a lot of entries, 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:40.200
 Guseonghun players Ah ahyat chair chairs entertain'm saying I think of John 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.459
 Dwaeseo a day early for any loss 7 So then the first lot of these imprinted 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.170
 Flew 20 But of course , as you said in the cow, 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.700
 Once the right to be itjyo 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:55.680
 So for example, if you know when to stand a real heaven's standpoint, ah really unfair 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.409
 Things will come out to the players who are preparing for today 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.459
 Any theme for these things 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:05.819
 Some seem to put its mind to the four players you lead a day 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:11.730
 For brooch form said flash 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:13.049
 The variable is now blocked to the extent that the tank comes out of the factory, 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.109
 There is no future. 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:22.530
 4 I am looking at this now 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:24.150
 The colors on the bottom are yes. Joker me . Well , it's different. 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.780
 Hoping for a normal entrance 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:32.459
 The bunkers keep the factory up in the cultural world and there is room for the Bible to stop . 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.139
 Produced to demanding rockThere..it to this object to break the cup got to finish my language 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:41.609
 Front Nexus and what ppaeneungeo baseball Bar is now standing more first peek peek 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:46.319
 Now I have a fire and then I go down now. 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:50.609
 If you go to the center and see the gate now , that 's it. 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.970
 Going over the side of the building, while another penny how this pressure now eoteuni yet taken b 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.829
 Chu gateways do not push the door and break through the entrance and go to g teech 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.120
 I will secure it. 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:05.280
 Then you need to see your clothes for the next six weeks . 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.480
 This isnt example rotiseu not even raise the group to what is now the shuttle 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.889
 I think I'm going to take the form of playing soccer with it. I feel it. 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.650
 Then the factory is the only downside of the New Guard is 4 2 9 on the page anyway 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.949
 SimCity has no use in front of dragons. 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.889
 Oh, do not let Jade own multi susceptible to the entrance to Palazzo addition punk outside 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:26.909
 Oh, it's like a construction haenotgo goes ahead 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:31.289
 Sauna I have decided to play this kind of thing now towards the dose 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:35.789
 When you look at the department, what a player is, Tech or defense. 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:40.229
 I choose to build the place came about that one pulled by three jet launcher 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:44.010
 To the other party after you have opened it and then you go through the tabs. 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.909
 With this gonna end that just got off one shot like energy Huh Gak How 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:52.620
 It's a problem. It's a problem . 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:53.550
 When it comes to business, it takes some time to get the job done, but my problem is 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.020
 tell 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:02.400
 How seureowoseo simply that some troops have borne the player then does something 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.389
 Noryeoya been doing it a lot in mind the type of treatment that may also enjoy dark suits 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.860
 I do not know. 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.699
 This is a 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.330
 I do not have any debtors, but I think I'm expecting you to break through the jig entrance. 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:19.979
 I saw me getting turned to two of the sites that'll work through why O 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:23.759
 Business dragon that just breaks very easily I think this is my head right now 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:27.210
 If you anticipate the drop, you can turn the siege mode quickly and make it into a tank. 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:32.130
 Just give it to me. 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:35.729

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:53.580
 Drago four to five now so backed up knocking the bunker in state 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.810
 Obviously, it should be a distance . 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:03.599
 I do not think he should do that. 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:07.680
 That cycle came out and I listened to 20 songs. 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:11.759
 I 've seen it smell good. 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:15.810

 Two things. No, it's not. It's just Brown. 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:41.000

 8 to get a name ah, not just a dad but not necessarily easy to do 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.880
 That's it. 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:03.950
 It's the next door tone. 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:08.930
 I think it would have been a terrible tower . Now it's annoying. 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:12.500
 Oh, it looks like the troops and is the first full series of the theme itself is kind of different 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.410
 But the third menu is a forward series, 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:20.620
 I do not know the Korean language. 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.620
 So why do not you bury it now ?
