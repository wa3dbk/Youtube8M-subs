rather<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:45.050> really<00:00:45.350> cannot<00:00:45.590> pronounce<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:46.310> I

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
rather I really cannot pronounce it so I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.960 
rather I really cannot pronounce it so I
won't<00:00:46.930> bastardize<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.140> for<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:48.640> but<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.850> idea

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
is that these little chalk edgers come

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.640 
is that these little chalk edgers come
with<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.580> molded<00:00:52.970> plastic<00:00:53.480> handle<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.440> you

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
with a molded plastic handle so that you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.299 
with a molded plastic handle so that you
can<00:00:54.800> easily<00:00:55.129> grasp<00:00:55.850> them<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.660> use<00:00:57.559> direct<00:00:58.160> to

can easily grasp them and use direct to
stamps<00:00:58.820> direct<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.270> paper<00:00:59.570> they<00:01:00.290> also<00:01:00.500> have<00:01:00.739> a

stamps direct to paper they also have a
very<00:01:01.100> interesting<00:01:01.580> shape<00:01:02.059> it's<00:01:02.360> almost<00:01:02.600> like

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
very interesting shape it's almost like

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.890 
very interesting shape it's almost like
a<00:01:02.780> little<00:01:02.989> miniature<00:01:03.710> iron<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:05.089> do<00:01:05.449> get<00:01:05.690> a

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
a little miniature iron so you do get a

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.200 
a little miniature iron so you do get a
kind<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:06.350> point<00:01:06.620> here<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.550> right<00:01:07.760> angle

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
kind of a point here and a right angle

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.899 
kind of a point here and a right angle
at<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.420> bottom<00:01:08.780> some<00:01:09.530> flat<00:01:09.830> edges<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.640> then

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
at the bottom some flat edges and then

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.820 
at the bottom some flat edges and then
some<00:01:11.210> curved<00:01:11.510> edges<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.380> unique

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
some curved edges and this is a unique

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.710 
some curved edges and this is a unique
shape<00:01:13.100> I've<00:01:13.340> seen<00:01:13.550> teardrop<00:01:14.060> shapes<00:01:14.390> and

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
shape I've seen teardrop shapes and

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.050 
shape I've seen teardrop shapes and
cat's<00:01:14.990> eye<00:01:15.140> shapes<00:01:15.440> but<00:01:16.280> never<00:01:16.640> one<00:01:16.909> that

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
cat's eye shapes but never one that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.630 
cat's eye shapes but never one that
looks<00:01:17.270> like<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.450> little<00:01:17.720> mini<00:01:17.930> iron<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:19.250> also

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
looks like a little mini iron I also

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.430 
looks like a little mini iron I also
think<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:20.420> an<00:01:20.630> ingenious<00:01:21.050> design

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
think that this is an ingenious design

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.860 
think that this is an ingenious design
because<00:01:22.400> not<00:01:22.580> only<00:01:22.909> is<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.090> built<00:01:23.450> up<00:01:23.630> and

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
because not only is it built up and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.860 
because not only is it built up and
easier<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.440> grasp<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.340> your<00:01:25.520> hand<00:01:25.880> love<00:01:26.630> that

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
easier to grasp in your hand love that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.800 
easier to grasp in your hand love that
but<00:01:27.710> also<00:01:27.979> when<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.430> put<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.790> cap<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.600> you

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
but also when you put the cap on and you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.410 
but also when you put the cap on and you
store<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.110> upside<00:01:30.440> down<00:01:30.580> all<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.120> juice

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
store it upside down all of the juice

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.680 
store it upside down all of the juice
goes<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.229> top<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.220> stamp<00:01:34.520> pad<00:01:34.820> instead

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
goes to the top of the stamp pad instead

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.960 
goes to the top of the stamp pad instead
of<00:01:35.960> having<00:01:36.230> it<00:01:36.500> be<00:01:36.530> right-side<00:01:37.310> up<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.670> all<00:01:37.940> of

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
of having it be right-side up and all of

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.960 
of having it be right-side up and all of
the<00:01:38.210> juice<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.170> ink<00:01:39.890> pulling<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.610> bottom

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the juice and ink pulling to the bottom

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.880 
the juice and ink pulling to the bottom
it's<00:01:41.390> actually<00:01:41.750> pulling<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.410> top<00:01:42.650> which

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
it's actually pulling to the top which

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.950 
it's actually pulling to the top which
will<00:01:42.920> make<00:01:43.160> these<00:01:43.340> really<00:01:43.790> easy<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.300> use<00:01:44.570> on<00:01:44.810> to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
will make these really easy to use on to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.420 
will make these really easy to use on to
me<00:01:45.080> you'll<00:01:45.230> also<00:01:45.350> have<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.620> added<00:01:45.800> benefit<00:01:46.370> of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
me you'll also have the added benefit of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.430 
me you'll also have the added benefit of
having<00:01:46.880> all<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.510> colors<00:01:47.810> right<00:01:47.840> here<00:01:48.230> on<00:01:48.320> the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
having all the colors right here on the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.800 
having all the colors right here on the
top<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:48.980> can<00:01:49.010> see<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:50.210> color<00:01:50.480> that<00:01:50.720> you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
top so you can see the color that you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.450 
top so you can see the color that you
want<00:01:50.990> without<00:01:51.110> having<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.680> lift<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.190> up<00:01:52.280> and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
want without having to lift it up and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.490 
want without having to lift it up and
turn<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.700> over<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.720> we're<00:01:53.990> going<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.140> take<00:01:54.320> one

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
turn it over so we're going to take one

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.030 
turn it over so we're going to take one
minute<00:01:56.290> there<00:01:57.290> we<00:01:57.380> go<00:01:57.530> we'll<00:01:57.710> look<00:01:57.800> at<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
minute there we go we'll look at the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.100 
minute there we go we'll look at the
surface<00:01:58.400> of<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.550> stamp<00:01:58.790> pad<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.360> you'll<00:01:59.900> see

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
surface of the stamp pad and you'll see

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.760 
surface of the stamp pad and you'll see
that<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.650> really<00:02:01.040> juicy<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.410> it's<00:02:03.410> kind<00:02:03.710> of

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
that it is really juicy and it's kind of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.120 
that it is really juicy and it's kind of
a<00:02:03.890> cross<00:02:04.130> between<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:05.290> foam<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.770> linen

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
a cross between a foam and a linen

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.249 
a cross between a foam and a linen
texture<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.209> it's<00:02:08.330> not<00:02:08.479> really<00:02:08.690> funny<00:02:09.080> and

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
texture so it's not really funny and

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.449 
texture so it's not really funny and
it's<00:02:09.379> not<00:02:09.440> really<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.860> Linden<00:02:10.160> II<00:02:10.250> it's

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
it's not really a Linden II it's

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.380 
it's not really a Linden II it's
something<00:02:10.729> kind<00:02:10.879> of<00:02:11.030> new<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:13.209> hybrid<00:02:14.209> of

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
something kind of new and a hybrid of

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.759 
something kind of new and a hybrid of
the<00:02:14.480> two<00:02:14.629> but<00:02:15.050> as<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.410> see<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.680> very

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
the two but as you can see it's very

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.089 
the two but as you can see it's very
juicy<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.879> actually<00:02:17.720> really<00:02:18.319> rather<00:02:18.530> opaque

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
juicy and actually really rather opaque

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.190 
juicy and actually really rather opaque
so<00:02:19.790> let's<00:02:19.940> take<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> minute<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.599> we'll<00:02:20.900> look<00:02:21.050> at

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
so let's take a minute and we'll look at

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.839 
so let's take a minute and we'll look at
some<00:02:21.349> swatches<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:25.099> let's<00:02:25.250> take<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> look<00:02:25.610> these

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
some swatches so let's take a look these

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.000 
some swatches so let's take a look these
here<00:02:26.090> swatches<00:02:26.629> I<00:02:26.840> use<00:02:27.140> mostly<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.769> plain

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
here swatches I use mostly just plain

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.119 
here swatches I use mostly just plain
cardstock<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.940> see<00:02:29.650> but<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.769> is<00:02:30.830> a

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
cardstock so you can see but this is a

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.509 
cardstock so you can see but this is a
pigment<00:02:31.849> based<00:02:32.209> ink<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.680> means<00:02:34.010> that

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
pigment based ink so that means that

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.580 
pigment based ink so that means that
it's<00:02:34.730> going<00:02:34.909> to<00:02:34.970> need<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.540> soak<00:02:35.900> into<00:02:36.290> a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it's going to need to soak into a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.290 
it's going to need to soak into a
surface<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.280> these<00:02:37.519> are<00:02:37.640> not<00:02:37.819> appropriate<00:02:38.269> for

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
surface so these are not appropriate for

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.450 
surface so these are not appropriate for
glossy<00:02:38.900> surfaces<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:39.470> they're<00:02:39.650> really<00:02:40.010> great

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
glossy surfaces but they're really great

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.550 
glossy surfaces but they're really great
for<00:02:40.520> your<00:02:41.420> regular<00:02:41.600> papers<00:02:42.260> cardstock<00:02:42.950> cork

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
for your regular papers cardstock cork

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.710 
for your regular papers cardstock cork
even<00:02:44.739> wood<00:02:44.980> chips<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:46.540> it's

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
even wood chips so it because it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.479 
even wood chips so it because it's
pigment<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.380> will<00:02:47.560> show<00:02:47.800> up<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.099> darker

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
pigment it will show up on a darker

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.120 
pigment it will show up on a darker
surface<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.930> actually<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> pale<00:02:50.620> pink<00:02:50.920> it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
surface this is actually a pale pink it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.220 
surface this is actually a pale pink it
looks<00:02:51.310> more<00:02:51.489> white<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> camera<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:53.080> as

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
looks more white on the camera but as

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.630 
looks more white on the camera but as
you<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.500> see<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.709> shows<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:53.980> beautifully

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
you can see it shows up beautifully

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.530 
you can see it shows up beautifully
because<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.900> chalk<00:02:56.290> type<00:02:56.709> finish<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:58.330> is

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
because it's a chalk type finish it is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.410 
because it's a chalk type finish it is
very<00:02:58.840> matte<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.709> dry<00:03:00.340> he's<00:03:00.520> actually<00:03:00.700> pretty

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
very matte and dry he's actually pretty

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.509 
very matte and dry he's actually pretty
quickly<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:02.019> was<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.530> was<00:03:02.650> fairly<00:03:02.920> happy<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.400> way

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
quickly I was I was fairly happy the way

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.080 
quickly I was I was fairly happy the way
it<00:03:03.550> soaked<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.630> dried<00:03:04.930> up<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.910> not<00:03:07.060> a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
it soaked in and dried up this is not a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.059 
it soaked in and dried up this is not a
great<00:03:07.360> example<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.230> actually<00:03:08.440> used<00:03:08.890> a

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
great example but I actually used a

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.280 
great example but I actually used a
yellow<00:03:09.760> stamp<00:03:10.239> pad<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.780> then<00:03:10.870> some<00:03:11.050> clear

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
yellow stamp pad and then some clear

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.710 
yellow stamp pad and then some clear
embossing<00:03:11.500> ink<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.760> does<00:03:12.970> stay<00:03:13.269> wet<00:03:13.480> long

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
embossing ink and it does stay wet long

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.990 
embossing ink and it does stay wet long
enough<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.260> grab<00:03:14.590> embossing<00:03:15.160> powder<00:03:15.610> if<00:03:15.910> you

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
enough to grab embossing powder if you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.250 
enough to grab embossing powder if you
want<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.510> use<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.810> for<00:03:16.840> wet<00:03:17.610> embossing<00:03:19.260> here's

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
want to use it for wet embossing here's

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080 
want to use it for wet embossing here's
that<00:03:20.470> swatch<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.430> white<00:03:21.580> paper<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.000> you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
that swatch on the white paper and you

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.190 
that swatch on the white paper and you
can<00:03:22.209> see<00:03:22.360> here<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.630> really<00:03:22.810> does<00:03:23.019> look<00:03:23.140> like

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
can see here it really does look like

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.520 
can see here it really does look like
pink<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:25.420> even<00:03:25.810> did<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:25.989> on<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.230> black

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
pink and I even did it on the black

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.250 
pink and I even did it on the black
cardstock<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.940> pink<00:03:28.239> looks<00:03:28.510> more<00:03:28.750> like<00:03:28.959> white

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
cardstock the pink looks more like white

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.820 
cardstock the pink looks more like white
but<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.549> will<00:03:30.730> even<00:03:30.940> show<00:03:31.269> up<00:03:31.299> on<00:03:31.690> some<00:03:32.140> dark

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
but it will even show up on some dark

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.420 
but it will even show up on some dark
black<00:03:33.340> cardstock<00:03:33.940> if<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.450> need<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:35.099> also<00:03:36.099> I

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
black cardstock if you need it to also I

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.410 
black cardstock if you need it to also I
did<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.299> little<00:03:37.620> wood<00:03:38.620> piece<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:40.120> soaked

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
did this little wood piece and it soaked

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.170 
did this little wood piece and it soaked
in<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:41.099> left<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.190> really<00:03:42.310> nice<00:03:42.549> finish<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.030> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
in and left a really nice finish on that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.240 
in and left a really nice finish on that
as<00:03:43.330> well<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.560> also<00:03:44.830> did<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> bunch<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:46.090> playing

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
as well so I also did a bunch of playing

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.910 
as well so I also did a bunch of playing
as<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.459> read<00:03:48.640> just<00:03:48.970> here<00:03:49.269> momentarily<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:50.680> my

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
as I read just here momentarily in my

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.210 
as I read just here momentarily in my
journal<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.989> first<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.140> did<00:03:53.260> some<00:03:53.470> direct<00:03:53.859> to

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
journal and first I did some direct to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.170 
journal and first I did some direct to
paper<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:55.769> use<00:03:56.769> just<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.340> wet<00:03:57.519> edge<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.030> kind

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
paper and use just the wet edge and kind

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.819 
paper and use just the wet edge and kind
of<00:03:58.209> blend<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.870> together<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.440> can<00:03:59.560> see<00:03:59.709> it's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
of blend it together you can see it's

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.520 
of blend it together you can see it's
really<00:04:00.160> really<00:04:00.489> vibrant<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.450> love<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.290> rich

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
really really vibrant I love that rich

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.670 
really really vibrant I love that rich
vibrant<00:04:03.010> color<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:04.630> got<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> couple<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.470> hard

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
vibrant color and I got a couple of hard

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.000 
vibrant color and I got a couple of hard
edges<00:04:06.069> but<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.430> blended<00:04:07.209> fairly<00:04:07.660> well<00:04:08.010> just

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
edges but it blended fairly well just

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.930 
edges but it blended fairly well just
going<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.609> know<00:04:09.700> right<00:04:10.060> into<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.900> surface<00:04:11.350> I

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
going you know right into the surface I

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.360 
going you know right into the surface I
also<00:04:13.049> used<00:04:14.049> a<00:04:14.380> stencil<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:15.280> went<00:04:16.269> ahead<00:04:16.389> and

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
also used a stencil and went ahead and

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.620 
also used a stencil and went ahead and
did<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.400> little<00:04:18.609> bit<00:04:18.760> more<00:04:18.789> color<00:04:19.209> over<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.600> top

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
did a little bit more color over the top

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.870 
did a little bit more color over the top
and<00:04:20.049> then<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.500> spritzed<00:04:21.010> it<00:04:21.190> with<00:04:21.310> water<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.760> so

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
and then I spritzed it with water and so

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.370 
and then I spritzed it with water and so
that's<00:04:22.090> why<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.330> looks<00:04:22.389> really<00:04:22.750> soft<00:04:23.020> here

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
that's why it looks really soft here

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.820 
that's why it looks really soft here
these<00:04:23.560> are<00:04:23.860> water<00:04:24.669> soluble<00:04:25.000> paints<00:04:25.690> or<00:04:25.960> pinks

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
these are water soluble paints or pinks

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.879 
these are water soluble paints or pinks
and<00:04:27.210> if<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.389> go<00:04:28.600> ahead<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.930> hit<00:04:29.200> them<00:04:29.350> while

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
and if you go ahead and hit them while

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.890 
and if you go ahead and hit them while
they<00:04:30.160> are<00:04:30.310> still<00:04:30.520> damp<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.510> can<00:04:31.630> get<00:04:31.750> them<00:04:31.870> to

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
they are still damp you can get them to

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.629 
they are still damp you can get them to
move<00:04:32.320> just<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:32.860> little<00:04:33.070> bit<00:04:33.190> you'll<00:04:33.370> see<00:04:33.400> of

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
move just a little bit you'll see of

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.250 
move just a little bit you'll see of
that<00:04:33.669> a<00:04:33.789> little<00:04:34.000> bit<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.180> bleeding<00:04:34.450> here<00:04:35.110> I

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
that a little bit of bleeding here I

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.440 
that a little bit of bleeding here I
also<00:04:35.919> used<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.340> with<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.460> different<00:04:36.669> stencil

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
also used it with a different stencil

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.570 
also used it with a different stencil
and<00:04:37.750> move<00:04:38.410> things<00:04:38.710> around<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:39.220> little<00:04:39.340> bit<00:04:39.520> I

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
and move things around a little bit I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.090 
and move things around a little bit I
used<00:04:39.700> some<00:04:40.120> gesso<00:04:40.660> over<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.020> top<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.530> then

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
used some gesso over the top and then

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.570 
used some gesso over the top and then
this<00:04:42.630> was<00:04:43.630> literally<00:04:44.050> just<00:04:44.229> right<00:04:45.100> on<00:04:45.280> top

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
this was literally just right on top

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
this was literally just right on top
just<00:04:45.610> kind<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.539> a<00:04:46.630> big<00:04:46.810> smudge<00:04:48.120> now<00:04:49.120> what<00:04:49.479> I'm

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
just kind of a big smudge now what I'm

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.510 
just kind of a big smudge now what I'm
noticing<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.410> as<00:04:50.800> I'm<00:04:50.979> pulling<00:04:51.220> up<00:04:51.400> do

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
noticing is that as I'm pulling up do

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.570 
noticing is that as I'm pulling up do
you<00:04:51.580> see<00:04:51.729> how<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:53.500> color<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.979> actually<00:04:54.159> still

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
you see how the color is actually still

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.460 
you see how the color is actually still
coming<00:04:55.000> off<00:04:55.210> on<00:04:55.539> my<00:04:55.750> fingers<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.140> little<00:04:56.320> bit

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
coming off on my fingers a little bit

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.380 
coming off on my fingers a little bit
that's<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.950> really<00:04:57.159> thick<00:04:57.400> application

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
that's a really thick application

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.200 
that's a really thick application
I<00:04:58.480> did<00:04:58.840> not<00:04:59.020> heat<00:04:59.290> set<00:04:59.650> this<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.400> something

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
I did not heat set this so something

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.490 
I did not heat set this so something
tells<00:05:01.360> me<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.690> if<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.840> hit<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.140> with<00:05:02.260> water

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
tells me that if I hit this with water

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.770 
tells me that if I hit this with water
it<00:05:02.680> would<00:05:02.800> just<00:05:02.920> bleed<00:05:03.280> like<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.640> dickens<00:05:03.820> so

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
it would just bleed like the dickens so

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.600 
it would just bleed like the dickens so
just<00:05:05.140> be<00:05:05.260> aware<00:05:05.290> that<00:05:05.530> this<00:05:05.890> is<00:05:05.950> about<00:05:06.280> three

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610
