flaws in the model as you usually do in

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.610 
flaws in the model as you usually do in
a<00:04:48.729> third<00:04:48.970> models<00:04:49.389> when<00:04:49.720> they<00:04:49.900> first<00:04:50.380> released

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
a third models when they first released

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.740 
a third models when they first released

them but didn't find any very happy with
it

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.790 
it
was<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.330> worth<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:58.750> money<00:05:01.199> yeah<00:05:02.199> I<00:05:02.229> would<00:05:02.650> say

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
was it worth the money yeah I would say

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.270 
was it worth the money yeah I would say
it<00:05:02.889> would<00:05:02.979> be<00:05:03.009> worth<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.550> money<00:05:04.680> because<00:05:05.680> it

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
it would be worth the money because it

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.909 
it would be worth the money because it
is<00:05:06.610> on<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.659> believe<00:05:07.990> it's<00:05:08.110> on<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.500> same<00:05:08.680> level
