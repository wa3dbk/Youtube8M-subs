00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.600
 hello very good two are them here we are 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.080
 again commenting and well this time 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.420
 I bring a multiplayer game of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.120
 this game piece I mean watch 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.820
 box is a good game we already know that the 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.430
 main objective is that what is 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.500
 can hack does not bring a game of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.780
 multiplayer as I say it would be a kind 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.430
 of team duel and well we have to 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.810
 as a goal in this game we have 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.090
 than to get a file that has 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.030
 imitated the map in which good the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.400
 team that get it and as I say all 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.800
 English is the moment everything 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.930
 is is revealing and filtering and 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.510
 that's all in English so I do not know 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.300
 what name will you receive in Spanish but 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.760
 come on it's like a team duel with 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.590
 an objective as I say we can take it out 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.150
 everything on the map as if we want 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.940
 put a trap door and as we see for 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.730
 so that they do not give us as if we want 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.230
 let's eat that we have already the second round 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.880
 I know how to put bombs and such there for 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.460
 when the enemies come to 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.700
 we can do everything is a 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.159
 authentic passed because 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.830
 from the camera can see it all 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.600
 everything we can see and one thing 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.060
 very pretty that you have is that we can 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.610
 modify our character completely 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.770
 of the multiplayer we can dress it like 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.080
 we want and it's one thing that is very 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.630
 pretty because as I say have a 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:34.990
 character in which you after the clothes 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:37.030
 it's personalized is also a code not 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.300
 it is a small map is played on the map 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.220
 of the game and we can go up as we have with 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.940
 the team then we try to make the other 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.289
 team chases us we do not try 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.179
 stop to gain from 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.520
 there they do not ask us for files like 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.229
 you see up we are winning and the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.869
 objective as I say get file and 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.100
 that the other team does not have it is a 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.170
 variety of gameplay that in the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.789
 multiplayer still do not know much 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.789
 but good this in a way that is already 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.490
 confirmed as you are seeing and as 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.319
 we see is very similar to people at 5 the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 system that has choose the soul's worth 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 with some roulet and already that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.209
 otherwise what you are seeing is 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.880
 One last game you are watching 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.080
 right now that really is fine 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.750
 or does not have any quality slump 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.850
 graphic like how it looks in a trailer 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.410
 so what about the game is 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.320
 very handsome the truth this game mode 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.620
 It is very good and nothing is an authentic 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.610
 I do not have past, I do not have words to 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.560
 describe it more there is how we will get excited 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.760
 game one has the last guy 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.690
 this has been all and see you in the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.690
 next video goodbye
