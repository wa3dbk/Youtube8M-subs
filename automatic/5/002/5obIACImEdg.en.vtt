00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
surprisingly low amounts of base come

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.449 
surprisingly low amounts of base come
out<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.060> speaker<00:03:18.010> one<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.160> reasons

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
out of the speaker one of the reasons

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.490 
out of the speaker one of the reasons
that<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.140> DSP<00:03:21.950> control<00:03:22.340> speaker<00:03:23.500> it

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
that is it is a DSP control speaker it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.340 
that is it is a DSP control speaker it
also<00:03:24.739> has<00:03:25.190> feedback<00:03:25.940> control<00:03:28.810> thing<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.989> when

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
also has feedback control thing is when

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.770 
also has feedback control thing is when
dying<00:03:30.709> quick<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.340> speed<00:03:31.670> or<00:03:31.820> up<00:03:31.970> really<00:03:32.450> loud

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
dying quick that speed or up really loud

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.370 
dying quick that speed or up really loud
and<00:03:35.530> backs<00:03:36.530> out<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:38.300> processor<00:03:38.959> heard

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
and backs out that the processor heard

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.240 
and backs out that the processor heard
is<00:03:39.560> down<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:40.010> base<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:41.920> gives<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.010> more

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
is down the base and gives you more

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.430 
is down the base and gives you more
Headroom<00:03:43.760> there<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.630> good<00:03:44.840> on<00:03:44.930> occasions

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
Headroom there that is good on occasions

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.860 
Headroom there that is good on occasions
in<00:03:45.650> live<00:03:45.890> sound<00:03:46.340> when<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:46.850> have<00:03:47.060> subwoofers

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
you're an ETA system it only act for

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.720 
you're an ETA system it only act for
these<00:03:53.390> two<00:03:53.720> idiots<00:03:53.840> stack<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:55.280> need<00:03:55.459> more

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
these two idiots stack and you need more

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.120 
these two idiots stack and you need more
and<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.600> doesn't<00:03:57.019> have<00:03:57.410> more<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:57.950> just

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
and it doesn't have more and it just

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.280 
and it doesn't have more and it just
cuts<00:03:58.340> out<00:03:58.430> all<00:03:58.489> your<00:03:58.820> base<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.450> is<00:03:59.690> not<00:03:59.930> good

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
cuts out all your base that is not good

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.710 
cuts out all your base that is not good
that's<00:04:01.130> one<00:04:01.430> thing<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.820> look<00:04:02.030> out<00:04:02.209> for<00:04:02.269> me

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
that's one thing to look out for me

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.449 
that's one thing to look out for me
because<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.260> print<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.769> up<00:04:03.799> for<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:04.190> starts

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
because I print it up for it starts

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.990 
because I print it up for it starts
flipping<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.320> same<00:04:06.320> song<00:04:06.590> or<00:04:07.370> all<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.790> same

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
flipping and same song or all the same

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.699 
flipping and same song or all the same
base<00:04:08.239> risk<00:04:08.630> it's<00:04:09.410> not<00:04:09.769> looking<00:04:10.100> any<00:04:10.400> more

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
base risk it's not looking any more

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.630 
base risk it's not looking any more
whatever<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.830> is<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.160> I

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
whatever that is and I

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.880 
whatever that is and I
further<00:04:13.880> look<00:04:14.240> Lorraine<00:04:14.630> law<00:04:14.810> as<00:04:15.020> I<00:04:15.530> crank<00:04:15.800> it

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
further look Lorraine law as I crank it

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.110 
further look Lorraine law as I crank it
up<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.370> process<00:04:16.609> returns<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.299> base<00:04:17.450> then<00:04:17.720> on

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
up the process returns the base then on

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.699 
up the process returns the base then on
on<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.299> triple<00:04:20.750> if<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:21.019> really<00:04:21.260> have<00:04:21.500> high

on the triple if you really have high
amounts<00:04:22.130> of<00:04:22.130> trouble<00:04:22.640> don't<00:04:23.120> do<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.590> unless

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
amounts of trouble don't do it unless

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.860 
amounts of trouble don't do it unless
you<00:04:25.010> die<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:26.000> some<00:04:26.150> people<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.480> may<00:04:26.660> mean
