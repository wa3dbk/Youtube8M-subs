and then you can set it to always block

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
and then you can set it to always block
and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.290> obviously<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.580> AI<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.000> set<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and then obviously the AI is set to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.760 
and then obviously the AI is set to
always<00:01:27.390> block<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.500> should<00:01:28.740> be

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
always block here so he should be

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.300 
always block here so he should be
blocking<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.729> back<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.240> punishes

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
blocking this but back to punishes

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
blocking this but back to punishes
forward<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> three<00:01:32.700> also<00:01:32.970> punishes<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
forward to three also punishes which is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840 
forward to three also punishes which is
why<00:01:34.049> he<00:01:34.259> got<00:01:34.409> hit<00:01:34.619> again<00:01:34.829> let's<00:01:35.460> try<00:01:35.579> something

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
why he got hit again let's try something

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.380 
why he got hit again let's try something
else<00:01:36.680> 113<00:01:37.680> also<00:01:38.579> punishes<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.180> switch<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
else 113 also punishes will switch to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.130 
else 113 also punishes will switch to
staff<00:01:41.180> 111<00:01:42.180> punishes<00:01:42.659> look<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.020> that's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
staff 111 punishes look at that that's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.910 
staff 111 punishes look at that that's
pretty<00:01:43.350> crazy<00:01:43.560> huh<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.729> else<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.119> do<00:01:45.920> 12

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pretty crazy huh what else can I do 12

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.730 
pretty crazy huh what else can I do 12

damn that works to sweep oh my god I
have<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.250> many<00:01:50.399> options<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.270> oh<00:01:51.509> he

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
but yeah you have so many options like

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.120 
but yeah you have so many options like
you<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.320> need<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.680> into<00:01:55.829> training<00:01:55.979> mode

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you just need to go into training mode

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
you just need to go into training mode
and<00:01:56.399> practice<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.240> there's<00:01:57.479> every

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and practice that's it there's every

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.929 
and practice that's it there's every
character<00:01:58.680> has<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.860> ways<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> deal<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.610> with

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
character has a ways to deal with with

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.600 
character has a ways to deal with with
flip<00:02:00.180> kick<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.009> sort<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
flip kick and you sort of just have to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.709 
flip kick and you sort of just have to
learn<00:02:02.700> how<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.939> deal<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
learn how to deal with it's not that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.510 
learn how to deal with it's not that
hard<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> deal<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.409> people<00:02:04.619> always<00:02:05.280> make<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
hard to deal with people always make it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.889 
hard to deal with people always make it
a<00:02:05.579> bigger<00:02:05.759> deal<00:02:05.850> than<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> don't

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
a bigger deal than it is if you don't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.270 
a bigger deal than it is if you don't
know<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> punish<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.710> find<00:02:07.920> out<00:02:08.099> like

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
know the punish to it then find out like

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
know the punish to it then find out like
if<00:02:08.489> there's<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.119> move<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.479> always<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:10.229> do

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
if there's a move that always people do

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.270 
if there's a move that always people do
that's<00:02:10.440> negative<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.920> don't<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.129> how<00:02:11.190> to

that's negative you don't know how to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
that's negative you don't know how to
stop<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:11.819> go<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> training<00:02:12.390> mode<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
stop it then go on a training mode and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
stop it then go on a training mode and
find<00:02:12.840> out<00:02:12.989> that's<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.349> did<00:02:13.500> with

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
I stop it I went into training mode I

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.680 
I stop it I went into training mode I
found<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.880> how<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.240> now<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.480> guys<00:02:21.630> know

found out how to do it now you guys know

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.220 
found out how to do it now you guys know
when<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.050> played<00:02:22.320> max<00:02:22.560> he<00:02:22.710> was<00:02:22.830> using<00:02:23.960> flash<00:02:24.960> I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.900 
when I played max he was using flash I
was<00:02:25.410> stopping<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.830> move<00:02:26.040> why<00:02:26.280> cuz<00:02:26.580> i<00:02:26.670> went

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
was stopping that move why cuz i went

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.400 
was stopping that move why cuz i went
into<00:02:27.030> training<00:02:27.330> mode<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.690> i<00:02:27.780> figured<00:02:28.170> out<00:02:28.290> how

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
into training mode and i figured out how

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.810 
into training mode and i figured out how
to<00:02:28.470> stop<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.460> have<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.610> do

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
to stop it that's what you have to do

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820 
to stop it that's what you have to do
okay<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:30.660> now<00:02:31.230> we're<00:02:31.350> going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> move<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.800> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
okay so now we're going to move on to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
okay so now we're going to move on to

saying<00:02:44.459> oh<00:02:44.640> yeah<00:02:44.850> we'll<00:02:45.090> Nightwing's<00:02:45.540> dash<00:02:45.750> is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.600 
saying oh yeah we'll Nightwing's dash is
so<00:02:46.110> fast<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:46.830> honestly<00:02:46.980> not<00:02:47.220> most

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
so fast but it's honestly not most

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.650 
so fast but it's honestly not most
characters<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.090> dash<00:02:48.300> that's<00:02:48.510> very

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
characters have a dash that's very

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.110 
characters have a dash that's very
similar<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.080> speed<00:02:49.380> or<00:02:49.560> even<00:02:49.800> faster<00:02:50.250> so

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
similar in speed or even faster so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.910 
similar in speed or even faster so
there's<00:02:51.750> no<00:02:51.870> reason<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> watch<00:02:52.709> okay

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
