00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.110
 Cycling is a sport of endurance 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.849
 and discipline that if we go to the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.770
 achievements in Mexico can only be 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.020
 relate to a single man a 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.730
 regiomontano that left its mark and put 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.279
 monterrey on the map with the great ones of 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.720
 europe the name raúl al claro 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.119
 animations obviously that with a 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.660
 bicycle all life and they're going to 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.480
 relate to 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.119
 wheels raul has won stages in the tour 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.250
 Raúl was the favorite for the tour of 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.860
 France Raul was the team leader more 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.690
 important in the world at that time and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.940
 Raúl was in the top 10 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.680
 cyclists of the world of young their 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.320
 restlessness is for his walk some about 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.160
 his remarkable talent there were many people who 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.489
 I did not bet on raúl because raúl was not 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.400
 as good as a child had had 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.500
 class and has an exceptional talent 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.500
 but when it reaches 15 years 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.940
 Raúl becomes a prospect 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.700
 debuted at 18 in the games 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.130
 olympics of the angels 84 where he got 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.690
 the eleventh place his impulsiveness what 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 led to learn a valuable lesson 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.060
 this unrepeatable experience in your life 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.720
 and he escaped was giving a great 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.840
 show and there they also observe it and 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.470
 is going to professional cycling I missed 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.450
 a little bit of maturity I think that I 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.410
 I rushed at the time of the flight that 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.620
 I did I was escaped 70 kilometers on 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.990
 which I already felt myself winner 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.090
 then it would be best to become the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 first and only Mexican to date 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 in finishing and highlighting in the tour of 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.260
 France 'feat that Adela will return to 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.260
 repeat 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.930
 and over there I tell you I feel a 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.420
 little bit as in debt to the system 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.140
 Mexican and right now I'm working to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.170
 make events to form a team 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.510
 continental where the continental team 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.270
 can be the springboard for all 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 Mexicans in Europe and it's a tour of 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.350
 France 'being in the top 10 worldwide and 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.080
 share routes with your great idols 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.100
 they have made raúl alcalá an addict of the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.519
 psyche I have not retired cycling 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.269
 I'm still on the bike, I'm still going, I'm leaving 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.900
 to shoot still with my group of friends 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.430
 things that I can not leave 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.430
 Juan Peña, I do not know what
