00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
floor or let it drop two feet come from

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.900 
floor or let it drop two feet come from
height<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:27.039> just<00:00:28.039> don't<00:00:28.250> do<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.369> you<00:00:28.730> know<00:00:28.820> you

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
height of just don't do it you know you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.499 
height of just don't do it you know you
probably<00:00:29.510> break<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:29.990> glass<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:32.210> is<00:00:32.239> what

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
probably break the glass so this is what

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.049 
probably break the glass so this is what
I<00:00:32.539> did<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:33.069> think<00:00:34.069> the<00:00:34.129> problem<00:00:34.339> is<00:00:34.579> causing<00:00:34.969> is

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
I did I think the problem is causing is

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.430 
I did I think the problem is causing is
the<00:00:35.179> power<00:00:35.420> by<00:00:36.039> why<00:00:37.039> because<00:00:37.870> it<00:00:38.870> turns<00:00:39.139> on<00:00:39.260> and

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
the power by why because it turns on and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.049 
the power by why because it turns on and
off<00:00:39.559> it's<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:40.100> it's<00:00:40.280> rebooting

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
off it's like it's rebooting

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.520 
off it's like it's rebooting
automatically<00:00:41.839> it's<00:00:41.929> like<00:00:42.050> if<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:42.260> have<00:00:42.409> in
