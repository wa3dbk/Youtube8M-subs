00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.180
Zardoz.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.400
Zardoz.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.020
I don’t know how I came up with that, it just happened.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.960
The name sounds good somehow.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.160
But it was too long.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.020
Then I got the last two letters, which are oz.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.640
When you include a z and a dot, it has a better effect.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.280
This just kinda happened with the spraying, it wasn’t my intention.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.600
I used to want to be a hairdresser, but I didn’t like it.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.120
You have to make permanent waves and such Firlefanz and you have to dye and get along

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.190
with the people.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.619
That just wasn’t my world.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.150
I think if I were to do that, then preferably as something privat.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.939
Like a hobby hairdresser, huh?

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.690
But when you’re not much of a ladies' man – it’s a bit of an issue.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.380
Although, I’ve done that.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.060
But it’s always a bunch of work, to talk them into letting me, bla bla bla.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.200
.  I met this woman once, whose hair I cut too short and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.060
then she started whining.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.460
That’s really not necessary, all that drama.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.040
And when I spray, it’s easy, I know where I’m at.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.460
I do it as it comes to me, I don’t think about it too much.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.540
I mean, a smiley isn’t that difficult.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.140
To paint a flower is a bit harder.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.260
And smiley’s always look funny.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.760
Yeah and the spiral just sort of happened and then I thought of cyclones (dt.: Zyklon).

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.940
The spiral kind of looks like a cyclone, typhoon.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.660
And then you add a B and then it’s Zyklon B.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.480
For every dead jew or gypsy or whatever, I paint a spiral to commemorate them.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.460
I don’t give much of a thought to whether I’m an artist or not.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.120
I do what I have to.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.940
I mean, I didn’t start drawing just because I am an artist, but because I felt the need to.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.020
To me, it’s enough that my art is outside, that’s enough for me.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.730
But when you exhibit them, you can make money.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.340
And then I can present the lawyer something.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.370
Here you have 5 euros and tomorrow there’ll be another 5 euros for a different artwork.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.000
So that the lawyer gets his money.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.300
That’s why I make the canvases, otherwise I wouldn’t feel like it.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.280
I don’t really have a desire for exhibitions and if I’m unlucky, when I did the exhibition

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.230
, that lasts like 3 weeks or 4 weeks, and most likely people will come

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.593
and yeah draw this, do that.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.560
And you can do another exhibition there, but I really don’t feel like it.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.000
And whether it’s in Paris or Hong Kong or so, it’s just not my thing.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.740
If they wish, I will add an extra smiley but that’ll cost extra.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.300
The bigger the smiley, the more it’ll cost.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.220
Yes, but I might want to do that with the internet someday.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.240
Before, I didn’t even know that the internet existed.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.640
I found that out last year, huh? Last year.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.980
When was that? In November I believe.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.400
I didn’t know before that.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.040
I think if I had known before, then I think I would probably have dealt with the internet a lot more.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.440
Internet is also rather a pastime somehow,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.420
but can also be quite stressful, huh? Internet, huh?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.240
Well, when you have to search around for something and you don’t know your way around the internet,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.620
and I don’t know much about it.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.640
And then I click around but nothing happens.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.760
That can be quite annoying, huh?
