think<00:01:03.620> one<00:01:03.889> of<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.129> reasons<00:01:04.549> that<00:01:04.790> Germans

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
think one of the reasons that Germans

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
is because he doesn't know what the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.080 
is because he doesn't know what the
other<00:01:09.440> scriptures<00:01:09.890> were<00:01:10.190> like<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.520> years<00:01:10.730> past
