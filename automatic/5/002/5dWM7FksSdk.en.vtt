00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
and the only thing that bothers me a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.090 
and the only thing that bothers me a
little<00:00:15.599> bit<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.020> when<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.379> started<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:16.859> you

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
little bit is when it started out you

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800 
little bit is when it started out you
checked<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.550> checked<00:00:17.760> out<00:00:17.880> Chicago<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.539> loved

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
checked we checked out Chicago I loved

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.090 
checked we checked out Chicago I loved
that<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.990> thought<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.320> really<00:00:19.529> good<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.039> was

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
that I thought it was really good it was

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000 
that I thought it was really good it was
one<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.340> my<00:00:20.460> favorite<00:00:20.789> tracks<00:00:21.439> st.<00:00:22.439> Louis<00:00:22.710> was

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
one of my favorite tracks st. Louis was

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
one of my favorite tracks st. Louis was
a<00:00:23.220> little<00:00:23.550> bit<00:00:23.670> down<00:00:23.789> from<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.600> bit

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
a little bit down from that a little bit

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.380 
a little bit down from that a little bit
more<00:00:24.869> simple<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.220> even<00:00:26.820> more<00:00:27.180> so

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
more simple this one is even more so

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.279 
more simple this one is even more so
it's<00:00:27.930> very<00:00:28.260> very<00:00:28.590> short<00:00:29.810> honestly<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
it's very very short honestly if you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.200 
it's very very short honestly if you
take<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.769> outside<00:00:32.040> lines<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.669> everything<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
take the outside lines on everything you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
take the outside lines on everything you
don't<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> preload<00:00:33.780> anything<00:00:34.350> it'll<00:00:34.829> all

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
don't have to preload anything it'll all

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.520 
don't have to preload anything it'll all
be<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.000> an<00:00:36.210> online<00:00:36.630> race<00:00:36.870> it'll<00:00:37.350> be

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
be if this is an online race it'll be

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.840 
be if this is an online race it'll be
whoever<00:00:37.980> makes<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> least<00:00:38.520> amount<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
whoever makes the least amount of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.160 
whoever makes the least amount of
mistakes<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:42.020> there's<00:00:43.020> no

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
mistakes because it's there's no

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680 
mistakes because it's there's no
pre-loading<00:00:43.710> there's<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.600> very

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pre-loading there's it's just it's very

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.869 
pre-loading there's it's just it's very
simple<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.039> feels<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.579> little

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
simple it kind of feels like a little

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
simple it kind of feels like a little
bit<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.239> nod<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.899> Arenacross<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.980> it's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
bit of a nod to Arenacross because it's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.369 
bit of a nod to Arenacross because it's
so<00:00:51.020> it's<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.379> kind<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> tight<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:52.920> short<00:00:53.340> but

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
so it's it's kind of tight and short but

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.930 
so it's it's kind of tight and short but
it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.500> good<00:00:55.649> track<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.489> good<00:00:56.670> track

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it's a good track it's it's a good track

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
it's a good track it's it's a good track
it's<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.750> short<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.590> very

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's just really short and it's very

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.760 
it's just really short and it's very
very<00:00:59.129> easy<00:00:59.329> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.930> rolled<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.260> two<00:01:01.530> laps

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
very easy I think I rolled like two laps

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.229 
very easy I think I rolled like two laps
on<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.250> felt<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.670> had<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.850> down<00:01:03.059> pretty

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
on it I felt like I had it down pretty

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.980 
on it I felt like I had it down pretty
good<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> watch<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.409> fail<00:01:04.680> epically<00:01:05.489> but

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
good and watch all fail epically but

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.500 
good and watch all fail epically but
well<00:01:06.990> let's<00:01:07.020> check<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:08.000> off<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> start

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
well let's check it out off the start

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.760 
well let's check it out off the start
it's<00:01:09.659> kind<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> weird<00:01:10.110> dude<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> got

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it's kind of weird dude how you got

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.260 
it's kind of weird dude how you got
across<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> track<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.119> guess

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
across the track like that but I guess

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
across the track like that but I guess
it's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> game<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.960> doesn't<00:01:13.200> matter<00:01:13.350> then

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it's a game so it doesn't matter then

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
it's a game so it doesn't matter then
you<00:01:13.920> hit<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.340> triple<00:01:14.790> over<00:01:15.479> jump<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you hit this little triple over jump a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.800 
you hit this little triple over jump a
little<00:01:15.869> bit

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
little bit

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.819 
little bit
a<00:01:16.930> double<00:01:17.770> another<00:01:18.399> triple<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:20.439> short

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
a double another triple a little short

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.050 
a double another triple a little short
on<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.189> but<00:01:21.399> she's<00:01:21.549> still<00:01:21.729> don't<00:01:21.909> need<00:01:22.000> a

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
on that but she's still don't need a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.460 
on that but she's still don't need a
preload<00:01:23.070> triple<00:01:24.070> triple<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.869> big<00:01:26.049> triple

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
preload triple triple and a big triple

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.850 
preload triple triple and a big triple
and<00:01:27.460> there's<00:01:28.329> no<00:01:28.689> preload<00:01:29.200> at<00:01:29.320> all<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:29.799> don't

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
and there's no preload at all I don't

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.310 
and there's no preload at all I don't
see<00:01:30.100> any<00:01:30.250> reason<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:30.610> ever<00:01:30.820> take<00:01:31.090> an<00:01:31.320> inside

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
see any reason to ever take an inside

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.960 
see any reason to ever take an inside
line<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.740> anything<00:01:33.039> then<00:01:33.610> you'd<00:01:33.789> have<00:01:33.909> to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
line on anything then you'd have to

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.080 
line on anything then you'd have to
preload

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.120 

then<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> guess<00:01:40.799> we're<00:01:40.979> getting

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
then this well I guess we're getting

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.910 
then this well I guess we're getting
stuck<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> inside<00:01:41.820> line<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.799> we

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
stuck with the inside line here so we

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.919 
stuck with the inside line here so we
had<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> preload<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.509> shoots<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
had to preload there but it shoots you

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.169 
had to preload there but it shoots you
up<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.350> too<00:01:46.409> high<00:01:46.679> so<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.969> stay<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
up way too high so you want to stay to

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.910 
up way too high so you want to stay to
the<00:01:48.359> outside<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.109> hundred<00:01:49.350> percent<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the outside I'm a hundred percent you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.260 
the outside I'm a hundred percent you
want<00:01:50.039> to<00:01:50.189> save<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> outside<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.909> little<00:01:51.030> wheel
