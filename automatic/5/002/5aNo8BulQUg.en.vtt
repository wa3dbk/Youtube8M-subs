with the offseason you can use it for

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.849 
with the offseason you can use it for
learning<00:00:46.160> how<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.489> control<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.120> kite<00:00:47.859> we're

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859

boarding<00:01:20.690> trainer<00:01:20.990> kite<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:25.130> got<00:01:25.280> our

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
boarding trainer kite and we got our

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.480 
boarding trainer kite and we got our
test<00:01:25.640> pilot<00:01:26.090> we'll<00:01:26.800> going<00:01:27.800> back<00:01:27.980> to<00:01:28.100> check<00:01:28.340> it

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
test pilot we'll going back to check it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.990 
test pilot we'll going back to check it
out

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
out

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.390 
out
little<00:01:29.930> does<00:01:30.110> we'll<00:01:30.320> know<00:01:30.560> he's<00:01:30.860> never<00:01:31.070> flown

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
little does we'll know he's never flown

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.640 
little does we'll know he's never flown
with<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> three-line<00:01:32.180> kite<00:01:32.510> before<00:01:32.690> or<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.620> a

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
with a three-line kite before or on a

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.950 
with a three-line kite before or on a
bar<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.940> he<00:01:35.060> really<00:01:35.270> doesn't<00:01:35.450> know<00:01:35.570> what<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.720> do

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
bar so he really doesn't know what to do

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.660 
bar so he really doesn't know what to do
so<00:01:36.410> this<00:01:37.010> might<00:01:37.280> be<00:01:37.310> interesting<00:01:39.490> okay<00:01:40.490> with

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
so this might be interesting okay with

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.910 
so this might be interesting okay with
the<00:01:40.820> bar<00:01:41.750> here<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:43.040> left<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:44.230> red<00:01:45.230> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
the bar here the left is the red the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.980 
the bar here the left is the red the
right<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.640> black<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.570> way<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.750> could

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
right is the black and the way you could

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.560 
right is the black and the way you could
tell<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.590> because<00:01:49.040> if<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.580> says<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.330> this

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
tell is because if it says this is this

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.910 
tell is because if it says this is this
wrong<00:01:51.050> way<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:54.020> what's<00:01:54.290> going<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.530> tempt<00:01:54.830> is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
wrong way so what's going to tempt is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.940 
wrong way so what's going to tempt is
launch<00:01:55.160> first<00:01:55.460> launch<00:01:55.730> of<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:56.000> three<00:01:56.270> line<00:01:56.950> 3

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
launch first launch of a three line 3

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.510 
launch first launch of a three line 3
line<00:01:57.980> kite<00:01:58.400> let's<00:01:58.670> see<00:01:58.790> how<00:01:58.910> he<00:01:58.970> does

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
line kite let's see how he does

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.220 
line kite let's see how he does
well<00:02:01.520> look<00:02:01.910> at<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.150> he<00:02:02.390> can<00:02:02.540> actually<00:02:02.720> do<00:02:03.080> it

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
well look at that he can actually do it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.749 
well look at that he can actually do it
so<00:02:04.120> how<00:02:05.120> does<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.330> fly<00:02:05.510> we'll<00:02:06.850> good

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
so how does it fly we'll good

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.090 
so how does it fly we'll good
spectacular

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
you have to keep it moving when it's

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.690 
you have to keep it moving when it's
like<00:02:42.010> when<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.990> yeah<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.430> is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700

I<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:50.350> even<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:51.130> had<00:02:52.030> more<00:02:52.239> wind<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.780> would<00:02:52.900> be<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
I can even I had more wind it would be a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.320 
I can even I had more wind it would be a
lot<00:02:53.350> faster<00:02:53.830> flying<00:02:54.160> they<00:02:55.000> have<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> lot<00:02:55.300> more

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
lot faster flying they have a lot more

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.790 
lot faster flying they have a lot more
pull<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.370> especially<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:58.239> video<00:02:58.330> purposes

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
this is good because it makes it easy to

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.710
