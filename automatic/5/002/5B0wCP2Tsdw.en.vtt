piece of PVC pipe that's been split we

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.799 
piece of PVC pipe that's been split we
have<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.980> twin<00:00:31.580> lead<00:00:31.820> coming<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:32.390> through

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
have the twin lead coming that through

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.380 
have the twin lead coming that through
which<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.199> all<00:00:33.350> locked<00:00:33.559> with<00:00:33.800> twist<00:00:34.070> ties<00:00:34.390> 14

all tied together and comes in and is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.120 
all tied together and comes in and is
soldered<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.750> twin<00:00:45.079> lead<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.890> then<00:00:46.010> we've

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
soldered to the twin lead and then we've

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.549 
soldered to the twin lead and then we've
got<00:00:46.280> shrink<00:00:46.610> wrap<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:47.059> goes<00:00:47.210> over<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:47.750> this

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
got shrink wrap that goes over it this

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.700 
got shrink wrap that goes over it this
Center<00:00:49.309> hole<00:00:49.520> will<00:00:49.790> actually<00:00:50.120> be<00:00:50.710> supporting

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
Center hole will actually be supporting

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.160 
Center hole will actually be supporting
this<00:00:51.829> up<00:00:52.070> in<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.340> tree

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
this up in the tree

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.229 
this up in the tree
take<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.530> shot<00:00:54.770> up<00:00:54.890> at<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.129> tree<00:00:55.430> we<00:00:55.910> hope<00:00:56.090> to

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
take a shot up at the tree we hope to

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.060 
take a shot up at the tree we hope to
get<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:56.450> up<00:00:56.600> if<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:56.840> have<00:00:57.050> 2530<00:00:57.980> feet

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
get it up if you have 2530 feet

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.690 
get it up if you have 2530 feet
something<00:00:58.489> like<00:00:58.730> that<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.590> then<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.430> twin

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
something like that and then the twin

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.049 
something like that and then the twin
lead<00:01:02.379> will<00:01:03.379> be<00:01:03.410> going<00:01:03.860> into<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.280> ballon<00:01:04.850> which

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
lead will be going into a ballon which

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.340 
lead will be going into a ballon which
will<00:01:05.210> be<00:01:05.330> mounted<00:01:05.449> on<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.780> backside<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.229> the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
will be mounted on the backside of the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.190 
will be mounted on the backside of the
tree<00:01:06.380> with<00:01:06.740> coax<00:01:07.160> into<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.580> shack<00:01:08.050> we<00:01:09.050> have

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
tree with coax into the shack we have

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.559 
tree with coax into the shack we have
roughly<00:01:09.530> 55<00:01:10.160> feet<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.640> wire<00:01:10.819> on<00:01:11.060> each<00:01:11.270> end

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 
roughly 55 feet of wire on each end

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.380 
roughly 55 feet of wire on each end
which<00:01:11.840> works<00:01:12.080> really<00:01:12.229> well<00:01:12.500> with<00:01:13.459> a<00:01:13.520> with<00:01:14.270> the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
which works really well with a with the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.300 
which works really well with a with the
broad<00:01:14.600> range<00:01:14.869> ldg<00:01:16.060> 8200<00:01:17.060> auto<00:01:17.179> tuner<00:01:18.310> so

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
broad range ldg 8200 auto tuner so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.770 
broad range ldg 8200 auto tuner so
that's<00:01:19.490> about<00:01:19.729> all<00:01:19.910> we've<00:01:20.060> got<00:01:20.209> for<00:01:20.240> now<00:01:20.539> we'll

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
that's about all we've got for now we'll

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.339 
that's about all we've got for now we'll
be<00:01:20.869> back<00:01:21.080> with<00:01:21.560> more<00:01:21.590> in<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:22.069> minute<00:01:22.660> w<00:01:23.660> 5xj

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:24.349 
be back with more in a minute w 5xj

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:28.270 
be back with more in a minute w 5xj
signing<00:01:24.950> off<00:01:25.750> okay<00:01:26.750> well<00:01:27.050> we

like to take it some more shots but

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.240 
like to take it some more shots but
we've<00:01:36.470> got<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:40.250> ballon<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.790> place<00:01:41.060> here

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
we've got the the ballon in place here

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.630 
we've got the the ballon in place here
and<00:01:43.250> we're<00:01:43.400> using<00:01:44.740> good<00:01:45.740> old<00:01:45.890> Aggie<00:01:46.100> welding

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
and we're using good old Aggie welding

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.660 
and we're using good old Aggie welding
rod<00:01:46.820> which<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.210> bailing<00:01:48.020> wire<00:01:48.580> just<00:01:49.580> to

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
rod which is bailing wire just to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.490 
rod which is bailing wire just to
temporarily<00:01:50.180> attach<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:51.400> brick<00:01:52.400> port

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
temporarily attach it to that brick port

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.850 
temporarily attach it to that brick port
get<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.530> close-up<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.160> Bala<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:56.620> see<00:01:57.620> it's

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
get a close-up of that Bala you see it's

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.620 
get a close-up of that Bala you see it's
a<00:01:59.200> ballon<00:02:00.200> design<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.880> 10<00:02:02.300> a<00:02:02.330> tuner<00:02:02.720> ballon

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
a ballon design and 10 a tuner ballon

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.120 
a ballon design and 10 a tuner ballon
and<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:06.050> works<00:02:06.260> really<00:02:06.410> well<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.070> of

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
and it works really well and we have of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.920 
and it works really well and we have of
course<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> feed<00:02:11.120> through<00:02:11.330> going<00:02:11.600> into<00:02:11.840> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
course the feed through going into the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.300 
course the feed through going into the
house<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.700> right<00:02:14.030> here<00:02:14.210> with<00:02:14.330> LMR<00:02:15.310> 400

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
house this is right here with LMR 400

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.190 
house this is right here with LMR 400
ultra<00:02:16.640> flex<00:02:17.800> which<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:18.830> nice<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.900> we're<00:02:21.080> going

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
ultra flex which is nice and we're going

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.220 
ultra flex which is nice and we're going
to<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.440> little<00:02:22.240> drip<00:02:23.240> line<00:02:23.510> here<00:02:23.900> coming

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
to have a little drip line here coming

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.620 
to have a little drip line here coming
out<00:02:24.350> like<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:27.320> have<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:28.480> pull<00:02:29.480> back

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
out like that and so we have a pull back

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.820 
out like that and so we have a pull back
up<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.990> tree<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> little<00:02:30.650> bit<00:02:30.770> you

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
up to the tree there a little bit you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.710 
up to the tree there a little bit you
can<00:02:31.070> see<00:02:31.570> it
