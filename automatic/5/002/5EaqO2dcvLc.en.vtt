00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.769
 so far none 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.749
 Algorithms but that come now 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.629
 but we are not heavy 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.369
 our 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.650
 So solved would keep solving offers so 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.279
 like earthquakes and people pleads resolved and about to take the next step 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.339
 Immediately we have to solve the next level we have the throws now 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.879
 always turn around for us the top saniert the GelbeSeiten de 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.730
 "Now we have to become one 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.620
 knew 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010
 Pieces dar 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 really coli will ever be 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.400
 this is right and the bench press 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.480
 under a chronic 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 Cleebronn Rheine is old 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.220
 you will look up here 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.030
 because casting 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.650
 edged bottoms 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.340
 Kaya that does not contain any money 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.050
 for example, that has no money is blue orange 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.050
 Now turn the page where it belongs 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.100
 they are watching 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.330
 Blaum 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.730
 Rooney sends 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.850
 that has to go there 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.940
 So seekers and seats plumped piece planned and Bremen will now 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.380
 under bankruptcy 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.200
 So Voltas needs to do so on Mustafa then at 5 am 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 but that does not work because otherwise the bottom 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 that's why all come the first because of that 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.400
 Algorithm around this 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.470
 can be a bit to the right 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.600
 position 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 and the Alba and goes like this 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.490
 right 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.450
 April located 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.050
 would stay 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.220
 Achim will be there 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.040
 Franken will be 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.790
 from 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.750
 Bern 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.750
 and we see 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.309
 a piece is now in the right places 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.349
 Let's do a little bit of change 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.979
 here is a 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.009
 that will bring it back open now 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.009
 that also matches the blue side 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.689
 so true and it must 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.790
 turn back to the right would do so Albbruck must 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.099
 once again 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.349
 from 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.279
 Martin will be owned by Raith 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.329
 is changed 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.329
 especially Frings worked 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.659
 I somehow did something wrong 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.779
 the bag no problem I'll be right back 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.279
 with Na 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.709
 if I do not worry 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.739
 then there is still the same 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.739
 the piece will be on the 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.569
 blueness 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.419
 both of them make the trees algorithm displayed here 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 Harmony still Mark 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.989
 if I were happy Korbach 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.939
 the Premier League 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.120
 with 4 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.339
 have here 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.339
 and again for understanding 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.579
 but now you have it 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.250
 Debt would be missing though 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.039
 fortunately this is only a guest of the farmers 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.199
 also the 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.649
 otherwise so perfect before 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.199
 and so hear Markus Winter 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.829
 sometimes mistakes make mistakes 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.059
 so also a piece of small change may be omitted 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.299
 Orange Green is on the Green Side 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.879
 and it has to be turned right again so the alcohol rhythm 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.419
 easy to do 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.840
 from 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.759
 April will grab 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.389
 happy Birthday 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.389
 Dreaming stopped 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.270
 and it is 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.860
 again 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.860
 the last piece will not be money and help 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.779
 we turn to the customer side 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.639
 and now it has to be turned to the left as you need 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.020
 Of course there is another algorithm just was just the same 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:58.680
 instead of always on 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.870
 or 108 points 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.159
 Rank instead 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.400
 would prepare more 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.889
 or leptin would 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.100
 of course the sailor in front of this 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.139
 Piece of neighbors 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.610
 to get 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.569
 you have to do that 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.569
 vote Purple 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.509
 from 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.610
 directly into cubes 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.800
 Ron 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.379
 is being listened to 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.009
 Continental 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.430
 so Nils Peter belly turned to the left 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.130
 The worst case should be that we have no up here 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.889
 populated finds that 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.129
 There is no money but only pieces that somehow contain money 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.460
 Percent and the team is not completely solved 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.340
 since AndrÃ© is just any piece of what money is so lift and we can 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.189
 an algorithm 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.240
 Expert 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.120
 The piece will be for example Bahrain and some should be above 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.389
 Percent after being blown up under the bottom Na clear 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:08.710
 there must be a look in the air 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.520
 Altdorf 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.509
 solved at the European Championships 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.419
