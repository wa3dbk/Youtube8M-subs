00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:24.130
 we always have 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.179

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:45.630

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:53.040
 the flakes eat us with the pompadour 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.890
 good the letters of always more jungle 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.739

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.860
 because the earth is the floor below and there 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.590
 little amount of land that I do not see 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.250

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.100

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.500
 If you are more pumpkin and what we are 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.360
 doing is trying to get entangled in 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.360
 the window because there is no pass 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.380
 we follow more step by step more little plants 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.660
 of tomato the idea of just being 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.480
 mixed everything so that they do not consume the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.270
 nutrients the same plants 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.539
