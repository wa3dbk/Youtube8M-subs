on<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.670> Xbox<00:00:55.089> Live<00:00:55.329> and<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:56.229> really<00:00:56.620> think<00:00:56.889> that

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
on the Xbox Live and I really think that

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.430 
on the Xbox Live and I really think that
the<00:00:57.280> demo<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.760> very<00:00:58.059> close<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.780> what<00:00:59.139> the<00:00:59.260> game

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
the demo is very close to what the game

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.139 
the demo is very close to what the game
is<00:00:59.589> gonna<00:00:59.739> be<00:00:59.920> like<00:01:00.129> because<00:01:00.459> the<00:01:00.879> game<00:01:01.059> is

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
is gonna be like because the game is

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.639 
is gonna be like because the game is
getting<00:01:01.269> released<00:01:01.719> within<00:01:01.959> less<00:01:02.260> than<00:01:02.289> two

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
getting released within less than two

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.950 
getting released within less than two
weeks<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.760> what<00:01:04.119> you<00:01:04.239> see<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.479> what<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.690> get

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
weeks so what you see is what you get

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.180 
weeks so what you see is what you get
and<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:06.280> can<00:01:06.490> go<00:01:06.640> back<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.180> draw<00:01:08.010> from<00:01:09.010> the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
and we can go back and draw from the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.960 
and we can go back and draw from the
older<00:01:09.520> game<00:01:09.760> and<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:11.290> comparison<00:01:12.250> wise<00:01:12.640> how

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
older game and see comparison wise how

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.240 
older game and see comparison wise how
it<00:01:13.150> stacks<00:01:13.450> up<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.930> new<00:01:14.110> game<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.160> the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
it stacks up to the new game so the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.890 
it stacks up to the new game so the
older<00:01:15.520> one<00:01:15.640> is<00:01:15.760> on<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:15.940> right<00:01:16.030> hand<00:01:16.360> side<00:01:16.450> and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
older games actually loading faster but

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.230 
shifts into the new environment instead
of<00:01:32.080> giving<00:01:32.260> me<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.440> loading<00:01:32.740> screen<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
of giving me a loading screen that

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.490 
of giving me a loading screen that
changes<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:35.050> really<00:01:35.440> neat<00:01:35.620> I<00:01:35.860> like<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:37.500> we're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
changes is really neat I like it we're

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.530 
changes is really neat I like it we're
going<00:01:38.680> already<00:01:38.980> on<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.310> older<00:01:39.580> team<00:01:39.790> you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
going already on the older team you

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.800 
going already on the older team you
could<00:01:40.720> see<00:01:41.040> once<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.220> game<00:01:42.430> starts<00:01:42.910> combos

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
could see once the game starts combos

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.840 
could see once the game starts combos
are<00:01:43.990> very<00:01:44.260> similar<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.770> each<00:01:44.830> other<00:01:45.100> since<00:01:45.730> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
are very similar to each other since the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.210 
are very similar to each other since the
super<00:01:46.180> moves<00:01:46.390> but<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.320> only<00:01:47.680> difference<00:01:48.040> is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
super moves but the only difference is

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.860 
super moves but the only difference is
the<00:01:48.370> new<00:01:48.580> game<00:01:48.850> kind<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.300> stepped<00:01:49.570> back<00:01:49.840> a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
the new game kind of stepped back a

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.420 
the new game kind of stepped back a
little<00:01:50.140> bit<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.530> think<00:01:50.950> Batman

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
little bit I think Batman

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.280 
little bit I think Batman
and<00:01:51.640> on<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.120> right<00:01:52.270> hand<00:01:52.420> side<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.020> older

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
and on the right hand side in the older

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.850 
and on the right hand side in the older
game<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:54.070> bigger<00:01:54.490> size<00:01:55.240> wise<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:56.440> cameras

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
game is bigger size wise the cameras

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.340 
game is bigger size wise the cameras

games we all love them from The Mortal

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.560 
Kombat and I think he's offering us a
decent<00:04:58.470> game<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:59.150> think<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.270> could<00:05:00.389> have<00:05:00.479> been

decent game I think it could have been
better<00:05:00.840> of<00:05:01.590> course<00:05:02.150> but<00:05:03.150> it's<00:05:03.300> still<00:05:03.630> it's<00:05:03.960> a

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
better of course but it's still it's a

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.320 
better of course but it's still it's a
