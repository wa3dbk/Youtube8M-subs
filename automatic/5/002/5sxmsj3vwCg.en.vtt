00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
communicating with the team is a big

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.250 
communicating with the team is a big
thing<00:02:48.670> because<00:02:48.850> he's<00:02:49.360> used<00:02:49.570> all<00:02:49.720> these<00:02:49.960> rally

thing because he's used all these rally

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.530 
thing because he's used all these rally
terms<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.250> he<00:02:51.340> needs<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.760> adjust<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.720> the
