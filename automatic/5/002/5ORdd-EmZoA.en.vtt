00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
people say point six grams of protein

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
people say point six grams of protein
per<00:01:10.320> body<00:01:10.710> weight<00:01:11.040> some<00:01:11.250> people<00:01:11.490> say<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
people say two grams of protein per body
weight<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.250> can't<00:01:14.700> tell<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.150> precise

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
weight I can't tell you your precise

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
weight I can't tell you your precise
number<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> nobody<00:01:16.590> else<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.070> therefore<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
number and nobody else can therefore to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.340 
number and nobody else can therefore to
be<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> safe<00:01:18.330> side<00:01:18.360> guys<00:01:18.720> I'd<00:01:18.900> say<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.320> for

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
be on the safe side guys I'd say go for

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
be on the safe side guys I'd say go for
at<00:01:19.619> least<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:20.100> gram<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.670> protein<00:01:20.909> per<00:01:21.750> body

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
at least one gram of protein per body

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.230 
at least one gram of protein per body
weight<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.619> weigh<00:01:22.770> 180<00:01:23.310> pounds<00:01:23.430> char

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
weight so if you weigh 180 pounds char

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420 
weight so if you weigh 180 pounds char
goes<00:01:24.390> over<00:01:24.540> 180<00:01:25.110> grams<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.950> protein<00:01:26.250> per<00:01:26.280> day

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
goes over 180 grams of protein per day

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.830 
goes over 180 grams of protein per day
and<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.570> safe<00:01:27.810> side

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and that's just to be on the safe side

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.300 
and that's just to be on the safe side
when<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.439> read<00:01:28.560> articles<00:01:28.710> saying<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
when you read articles saying that you
