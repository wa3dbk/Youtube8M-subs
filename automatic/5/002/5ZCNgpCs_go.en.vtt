00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
let's just go ahead and select that and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.050 
let's just go ahead and select that and
you<00:01:10.860> want<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> make<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> always<00:01:11.850> get

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you want to make this one I always get

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.310 
you want to make this one I always get
it<00:01:12.150> backwards<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.290> needs

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

to be light green you see how there's a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.810 
to be light green you see how there's a
light<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> dark<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
light and there's a dark these are the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.920 
light and there's a dark these are the
two<00:01:17.939> colors<00:01:18.150> you'll<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.479> messing<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
two colors you'll be messing what I

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.810 
two colors you'll be messing what I
think<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.259> yeah<00:01:19.920> no<00:01:20.070> no<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.790> think

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
think it's yeah no no I think I think

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
think it's yeah no no I think I think
it's<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> light<00:01:21.299> green<00:01:21.680> alright<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.100> we're<00:01:23.250> done

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it's a light green alright so we're done

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.469 
it's a light green alright so we're done
with<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.670> that's<00:01:24.060> good

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
with that and that's good

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.560 
with that and that's good
so<00:01:24.659> layer<00:01:24.869> two<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.250> need<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
so layer two you need to go to it is

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
so layer two you need to go to it is
like<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.829> third<00:01:29.220> ergo<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.090> Soviet<00:01:30.540> Stars<00:01:30.750> on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's over it all right and then when you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
it's over it all right and then when you
select<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.710> light

select it you go down here to light

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.069 
select it you go down here to light
green<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.689> star

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
green and there you go that is the star

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.100 
green and there you go that is the star
and<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.579> done<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.869> all

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and you are done with that that's all

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
and you are done with that that's all
you<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.500> with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> star<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.520> to

you have to do with the star now on to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.210 
you have to do with the star now on to
the<00:01:44.850> letter<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.950> literally

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the letter or I think it is literally

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
the letter or I think it is literally
like<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> second<00:01:48.090> page<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.600> second<00:01:49.140> page

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
like the second page I go second page

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.160 
like the second page I go second page
first<00:01:49.799> row<00:01:50.040> number<00:01:50.520> four<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:51.600> basic<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
first row number four very basic you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569 
first row number four very basic you
want<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> move<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> top<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.460> it

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
duplicate the layer by hitting X and

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.440 
duplicate the layer by hitting X and
then<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.370> layer<00:02:20.610> again<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.269> you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
then you go to that layer again and you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.830 
then you go to that layer again and you
want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:23.400> greens<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.629> want<00:02:24.780> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840

of<00:02:36.930> blends<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.349> more<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.880> uh<00:02:38.910> yeah

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
of blends in more with it but uh yeah

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.990 
of blends in more with it but uh yeah
you<00:02:40.590> see<00:02:40.739> how<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.890> do<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.489> then<00:02:41.670> you

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
you see how you do that and then you

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.880 
you see how you do that and then you
know<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.870> technically<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:43.349> here<00:02:43.739> this

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
know this is technically right here this

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.520 
know this is technically right here this
is<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.099> emblem<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.140> do<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.410> i

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
is the emblem but what I like to do is i

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.039 
is the emblem but what I like to do is i
duplicated<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.280> more<00:02:47.459> time<00:02:47.810> select<00:02:48.810> it

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
duplicated it one more time select it

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.229 
duplicated it one more time select it
and<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.200> made<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.860> slightly<00:02:50.310> bigger<00:02:50.819> I

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
and I made it just slightly bigger I

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.330 
and I made it just slightly bigger I
should<00:02:52.170> bring<00:02:52.349> out<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> thickness<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
should bring out the thickness of the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.729 
should bring out the thickness of the
four<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.329> could<00:02:54.480> easily<00:02:54.660> spot<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.410> and

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
four so you could easily spot it and

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.890 
four so you could easily spot it and
there<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.190> go<00:02:56.310> that's<00:02:56.640> how<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.880> make<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.599> I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
there you go that's how you make it so I
