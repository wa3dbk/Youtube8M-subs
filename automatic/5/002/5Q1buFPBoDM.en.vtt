00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.940
TO THE FIRE.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.520
WE TALKED TO THE COMMAND CENTER.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.120
THEY SAY THEY HAVE NO PLANS TO

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.480
LIFT THE MANDATORY EVACUATION

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.490

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.750
THOSE RESIDENTS WILL HAVE TO

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.460
STAY AWAY.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.030
THEIR CONCERN THAT THIS FIRE

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.760
COULD BE COMING OVER THIS RIDGE,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.330
BUT THEY HAVE PLENTY OF

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.530
FIREFIGHTERS HERE TO PREVENT

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.000
THAT.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.110
THE NUMBERS AS THIS FIRE HAS

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.740
GROWN HAVE BEEN EXPLOSIVE.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.440
WHEN YOU ARE THERE IN PERSON,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.410
ARE YOU SAYING A BIG CHANGE IN

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.480
THE FIRE FROM YESTERDAY?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.280
WE ARE SEEING A DIFFERENT

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.350
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE YESTERDAY WE

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.720
WERE BY POLLOCK PINES.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.280
HERE, WE SEE THE RESIDENTIAL

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.560
SIDE WHERE MOST FOLKS LIVE.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.460
WE HAVE SEEN MORE SMOKE AND MORE

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.430
PEOPLE BUT YOU CAN FEEL THE

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.630
INTENSITY IN THE AIR, JUST THE

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.590
SENSE OF CONCERN FROM THE

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.860
RESIDENCE AT THE FLAMES AND THE

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.800
SMOKE IS.
