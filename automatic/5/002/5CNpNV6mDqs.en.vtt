way around and so you have a solid round

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.620 
way around and so you have a solid round
tube<00:01:08.180> again<00:01:09.790> so<00:01:10.790> putting<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.210> pump<00:01:11.450> back

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
tube again so putting the pump back

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.590 
tube again so putting the pump back
together<00:01:12.130> make<00:01:13.130> sure<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.700> white<00:01:14.210> tube

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
pump you've got two pins in there so

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.600 
pump you've got two pins in there so
make<00:01:23.509> sure<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.720> two<00:01:23.900> pins<00:01:24.170> are<00:01:24.350> lined<00:01:24.590> up<00:01:24.830> with

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610

with<00:01:51.610> both<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.000> pins<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.390> place<00:01:52.510> you<00:01:53.470> can

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
with both of the pins in place you can

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.930 
with both of the pins in place you can
start<00:01:53.770> putting<00:01:53.890> all<00:01:54.070> back<00:01:54.220> together
