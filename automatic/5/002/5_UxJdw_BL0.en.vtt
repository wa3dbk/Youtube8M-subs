00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 developer pandemic studios and by the profit came according to experts the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.110
 most world in flames on their own coin were great games 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.000
 recently the studio was closed but now comes 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.910
 nevertheless participation in the competition preceded 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.440
 we are happy with this release on a wooden leg and have to be sabotaged ourselves 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 to become 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 in the channel tour you crawl in the skin of mushroom inside if i want to get back 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.329
 time of the Second World War and is rich 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.020
 so that even a nice soft fucking to orphan 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.660
 he does like a beer at 19 and is certainly not afraid of the fight and 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.010
 talk with a great irish accent 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.530
 now everyone starts in paris where you and the french friend walk through the streets 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.530
 Paris student is fighting and racing against the Nazis 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.869
 it is right in the action 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.680
 he understands that the cell is central with care 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.359
 it will teach the Nazis and faking a big explosion 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.289
 But before you even wonder why is the greatest of all he does 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.300
 three men back in time 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.410
 once back in time you end up just before the race 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.570
 you will become acquainted with simonsplein racing team when according to nature point you have to 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.340
 driving his biggest rival happens to be a German and a pamphlet 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.570
 lose the race 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.509
 So now of course the questions intend to mole the German soldiers 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.850
 however, this goes wrong and becomes one of his friends of murder 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.500
 in addition, the german also turns out to be a general of a nation's hendrik 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 just out of the second world war 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.170
 6 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.709
 can be refused there if you already have a flight to paris and decide 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.030
 to join the French resistance fighters to the practices of the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.729
 sabotage occupiers 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.920
 it is a fictional story in it is all very exaggerated 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.270
 from the terrible act the centercourt is incredible Germans who 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.319
 by people 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.620
 but of course this does not alter the fact that it is a fascinating church all in all 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.229
 This story has been invented 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.729
 as the name of the game it betrays site free said that ensures 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.579
 of course to sabotage 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.260
 to be exact it goes here as mentioned earlier 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.909
 to sabotage various important points of the Nazis 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.329
 you can do it in different ways now it's up to some kind of people 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.129
 a customer team to celebrate and assassin's creed 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.770
 they can be elected 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.630
 to use the violence from this is popping in the road 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.550
 but you can also choose to be very subtle and careful 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.550
 the Germans index this is the break the team's attract 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.219
 and then not to wait 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.680
 all sorts of ways are fun to do but it just went by bus 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.570
 to state 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.969
 yet the sleeping area was not quite right 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.349
 who can be a member of a German city to be supervised 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.329
 They think the Germans seem to be lovely people because they can be three 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.479
 meters away immediately see if I really am not Nazi 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:23.159
 when to close another nation's band of the snp to that something is not right 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.870
 if you have a suspicious behave and that is pretty soon different about that 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.929
 netherlands a person feel 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:33.349
 when it is completely full, one of the Nazis led by attacks 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.729
 Finally you can also test the game the different cars these oldies 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.970
 really degenerated they look great 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.109
 moreover, the range is on as well as very large television channels and the score 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.559
 the competition was in May 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.819
 is being moved 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.999
 but i'm going 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.559
 plan 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:56.769
 all this takes place in paris this city provides a great setting 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.679
 of the game 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:01.960
 pandemic studios in paris recreated an important points in it 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.449
 it makes the woodpecker feel like your class live 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.629
 and the black this effect adds another open and added 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.040
 every area that is occupied by the Nazis lacks colors 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.540
 You can also see that the brand is a new basis for the newest generation 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.889
 but it is mainly black and white 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.680
 Once you do this area businesses in that color return to this area and you should 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.729
 the stock market as bahrami rebellion against the occupiers 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.110
 the family 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.840
 5 incorporated in the game 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.560
 especially the presentation of the game looks slick from a graphic area 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.860
 something against it 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.210
 if next to see during this video pietseweg a woman says that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.479
 time but luckily valve during the wb itself even though some pieces 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.139
 to be finished then you look well cared for but it can occur 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.569
 of course do not measure with the current top 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.679
 the audio in the game, on the other hand, is much better cared for, the music is perfect 

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:52.979
 for the setting and it brings the right atmosphere 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.449
 necessary water left after the engines and explosions and good in the game 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.199
 processed 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.819
 such a skirts accent is really great 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.110
 the firm statements of the other character are very exaggerated 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.110
 sometimes what results in situations under the shelter 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.749
 he brakes 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.750
 the sensor can be set up anywhere in the Netherlands thanks to the right atmosphere 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.360
 the black and white spot played a major role 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.620
 and is therefore a plus in this game 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.770
 not only ff well followed driving 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.880
 it will improve but the game of course mainly revolves around is really a bit 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:39.560
 Worried 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.190
 in the open world of paris at the age of twenty the arke time was busy 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.000
 he said that for may not be a problem 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.139
 but entertaining is certainly there 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.620
 it is certainly worth it that this game is still busy
