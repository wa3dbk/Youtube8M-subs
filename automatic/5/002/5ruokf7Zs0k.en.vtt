you're<00:01:30.479> gonna<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.780> lightly<00:01:31.200> padded<00:01:31.470> full

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're gonna see lightly padded full

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
you're gonna see lightly padded full
cuff<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> way<00:01:32.850> down<00:01:33.060> notice<00:01:33.270> it's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
cuff going all the way down notice it's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.539 
cuff going all the way down notice it's
perforated<00:01:33.900> speedy<00:01:34.710> logo<00:01:35.040> working<00:01:35.340> its<00:01:35.460> way

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
perforated speedy logo working its way

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.920 
perforated speedy logo working its way
and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> direction<00:01:36.210> Speedy's<00:01:36.780> gone

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and I like the direction Speedy's gone

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.270 
and I like the direction Speedy's gone
with<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> lot<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> their<00:01:37.530> designs<00:01:37.890> they're

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
with a lot of their designs they're

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.069 
with a lot of their designs they're
definitely<00:01:38.640> improving<00:01:38.909> over<00:01:39.210> time<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.720> we

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
definitely improving over time as we

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.510 
definitely improving over time as we
move<00:01:40.200> into<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> back<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> hand<00:01:41.040> nice

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
move into the back of the hand nice

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
move into the back of the hand nice
raised<00:01:41.880> area<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.450> dense<00:01:42.630> foam<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.079> gonna<00:01:43.200> be

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
raised area of dense foam it's gonna be

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410 
raised area of dense foam it's gonna be
lightly<00:01:43.530> perforated<00:01:44.070> leaving<00:01:44.610> me<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.090> cuff

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
lightly perforated leaving me to my cuff

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.319 
lightly perforated leaving me to my cuff
now<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.619> classic<00:01:47.460> style<00:01:47.670> carbon<00:01:48.119> fiber

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
now this is a classic style carbon fiber

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.609 
now this is a classic style carbon fiber
protector<00:01:48.899> we've<00:01:49.079> seen<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.380> type<00:01:49.590> of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
protector we've seen this type of

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.960 
protector we've seen this type of
protector<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.220> many<00:01:50.430> gloves<00:01:50.700> from<00:01:50.790> many

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
protector on many gloves from many

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.819 
protector on many gloves from many
manufacturers<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> nice<00:01:52.350> part<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.680> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
manufacturers but the nice part about it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
manufacturers but the nice part about it
is<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.909> low-profile

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
is it is not low-profile

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.389 
is it is not low-profile
it<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:54.990> has<00:01:55.229> those<00:01:55.380> raised<00:01:55.619> edges<00:01:56.070> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it actually has those raised edges so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.590 
it actually has those raised edges so
those<00:01:56.549> points<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.060> create<00:01:57.329> less

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
those points are gonna create less

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.999 
those points are gonna create less
surface<00:01:57.840> area<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> happen<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> go<00:01:58.860> down

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
surface area so if you happen to go down

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.350 
surface area so if you happen to go down
on<00:01:59.100> your<00:01:59.219> knuckle<00:01:59.490> you're<00:01:59.729> gonna<00:01:59.820> slide<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
on your knuckle you're gonna slide a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.120 
on your knuckle you're gonna slide a
little<00:02:00.659> bit<00:02:00.810> easier<00:02:01.439> moving<00:02:01.920> into<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
little bit easier moving into the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.709 
little bit easier moving into the
fingers<00:02:02.430> dual<00:02:02.729> layers<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.240> leather<00:02:03.360> remember

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
fingers dual layers of leather remember

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.420 
fingers dual layers of leather remember
this<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.960> all<00:02:04.200> cowhide<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.799> you're<00:02:05.340> gonna

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this is all cowhide and you're gonna

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.370 
this is all cowhide and you're gonna
have<00:02:05.640> mid<00:02:05.909> digital<00:02:06.329> raised<00:02:06.570> points<00:02:07.049> which<00:02:07.320> are

have mid digital raised points which are

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.930 
have mid digital raised points which are
gonna<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> dense<00:02:07.920> foam<00:02:08.220> kind<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.580> keeping

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
gonna be a dense foam kind of keeping

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940 
gonna be a dense foam kind of keeping
you<00:02:09.090> addition<00:02:09.959> giving<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:10.530> additional

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
area of shock absorption now if you look

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.490 
area of shock absorption now if you look
at<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.050> first<00:02:13.200> two

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500

when you're working your controls

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.570 
when you're working your controls
they're<00:02:16.380> gonna<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.680> an<00:02:16.770> additional<00:02:17.160> area<00:02:17.490> of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
they're gonna have an additional area of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.100 
they're gonna have an additional area of
flexibility<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.510> can<00:02:18.630> look<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> pre

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
flexibility and you can look at the pre

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.600 
flexibility and you can look at the pre
curve<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.470> hand<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:19.830> not<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.130> overly

call it a sport pre curve and remember

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.460 
call it a sport pre curve and remember
here<00:02:24.210> being<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.900> mixture<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.230> goat

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
here being that it is a mixture of goat

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.170 
here being that it is a mixture of goat
and<00:02:25.590> cow<00:02:25.740> hides<00:02:26.010> throughout<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:27.060> gonna

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and cow hides throughout it is gonna

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.060 
and cow hides throughout it is gonna
break<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.600> about<00:02:27.780> ten<00:02:27.990> percent<00:02:28.170> now<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:28.950> we

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
break in about ten percent now if we

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.040 
break in about ten percent now if we
move<00:02:29.220> over<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> thumb<00:02:29.940> basic<00:02:30.720> another

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
move over to the thumb basic another

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.660 
move over to the thumb basic another
area<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.500> raised<00:02:31.740> ends<00:02:31.950> foam<00:02:32.160> would<00:02:32.550> have

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
area of raised ends foam would have

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.600 
area of raised ends foam would have
loved<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.240> seen<00:02:33.390> an<00:02:34.190> elasticated<00:02:35.190> panel

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
loved to have seen an elasticated panel

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.160 
loved to have seen an elasticated panel
on<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> thumb<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.330> actually<00:02:36.630> chose<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.050> to

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
on the thumb they actually chose you to

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.810 
on the thumb they actually chose you to
give<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.500> another<00:02:37.830> area<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.430> dense<00:02:38.580> foam

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
give you another area of dense foam

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.160 
give you another area of dense foam
that's<00:02:39.060> worked<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.360> there<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:39.990> when<00:02:40.080> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
that's worked in there and then when you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.560 
that's worked in there and then when you
move<00:02:40.320> into<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.709> palm<00:02:41.150> again<00:02:42.150> we're<00:02:42.270> gonna<00:02:42.360> see

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
move into the palm again we're gonna see

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.170 
move into the palm again we're gonna see
it's<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.870> basics<00:02:43.350> here<00:02:43.530> goatskin<00:02:44.400> reinforce

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
it's just basics here goatskin reinforce

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.550 
it's just basics here goatskin reinforce
the<00:02:45.330> area<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.660> control<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.140> hand<00:02:46.380> and

the area in the control of the hand and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.930 
the area in the control of the hand and
then<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.920> gets<00:02:47.130> into<00:02:47.340> chlorine<00:02:47.700> Oh<00:02:47.730> which

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
then it gets into chlorine Oh which

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.970 
then it gets into chlorine Oh which
isn't<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.300> equate<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.959> would<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.800> see

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980
