horizontal shock on the big bites

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.710 
horizontal shock on the big bites
that'll<00:01:17.960> be<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.380> new<00:01:18.500> ninja<00:01:19.450> from<00:01:20.450> there

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
that'll be in the new ninja from there

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.770 
that'll be in the new ninja from there
it's<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:21.050> whole<00:01:21.350> new<00:01:21.740> engine<00:01:22.070> its<00:01:22.550> gains<00:01:23.240> 90

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
it's a whole new engine its gains 90

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.990 
it's a whole new engine its gains 90
cc's<00:01:24.170> it's<00:01:24.350> now<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.740> thousand<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.310> 40<00:01:25.580> CCS

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
cc's it's now a thousand and 40 CCS

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.630 
cc's it's now a thousand and 40 CCS
instead<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:26.450> 950<00:01:27.260> it's<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.920> longer<00:01:28.280> stroke

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
instead of 950 it's a longer stroke

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.880 
instead of 950 it's a longer stroke
they've<00:01:29.630> had<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.900> put<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.170> crank<00:01:30.410> blower<00:01:30.710> down

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
they've had to put the crank blower down

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.370 
they've had to put the crank blower down
so<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.220> whole<00:01:31.460> new<00:01:31.700> new<00:01:32.210> engine<00:01:32.600> casings<00:01:33.080> the

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
so the whole new new engine casings the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.110 
so the whole new new engine casings the
works<00:01:33.620> your<00:01:34.580> throttle<00:01:34.940> bodies<00:01:35.440> new<00:01:36.440> pipes<00:01:37.120> you

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
works your throttle bodies new pipes you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:47.410 
works your throttle bodies new pipes you
buy

absolutely brilliant this thing stops on
a<00:02:01.729> dime

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
a dime

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.620

it's 218 kilos fully wet ready to go

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.559 
it's 218 kilos fully wet ready to go
that's<00:02:06.110> not<00:02:06.920> exactly<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.310> light<00:02:08.030> sports<00:02:08.360> white

that's not exactly a light sports white

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.330 
that's not exactly a light sports white
but<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:09.019> portly<00:02:09.380> either<00:02:09.530> from<00:02:10.160> there

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
but it's not portly either from there

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.850 
but it's not portly either from there
you<00:02:10.459> come<00:02:10.580> back<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.000> all-new<00:02:11.860> really

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
you come back to this all-new really

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.070 
you come back to this all-new really
narrow<00:02:13.069> gutted<00:02:13.489> frame<00:02:13.940> they've<00:02:14.660> managed<00:02:14.989> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
narrow gutted frame they've managed to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.370 
narrow gutted frame they've managed to
shrink<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.190> down<00:02:16.340> drop<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.269> 815<00:02:17.959> mil<00:02:18.140> so

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
shrink it down drop it to 815 mil so

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.930 
shrink it down drop it to 815 mil so
it's<00:02:18.470> 5<00:02:18.769> mils<00:02:19.040> lower<00:02:19.280> than<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.580> previous

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
it's 5 mils lower than the previous

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.790 
it's 5 mils lower than the previous
model<00:02:20.269> but<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.080> throttle<00:02:21.380> bodies<00:02:21.650> are

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800

model but the throttle bodies are
overlies<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.030> you've<00:02:23.239> got<00:02:23.390> less<00:02:23.870> work

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
overlies so that you've got less work

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110 
overlies so that you've got less work
and<00:02:24.319> it's<00:02:24.650> really<00:02:25.040> narrow<00:02:25.250> makes<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.819> easy<00:02:26.000> for

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
and it's really narrow makes it easy for

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.360 
and it's really narrow makes it easy for

you to touch the ground even if you're a
shorty<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.940> actually<00:02:29.090> jump<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.870> this

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
shorty you can actually jump on this

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.449 
shorty you can actually jump on this
thing<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.349> go<00:02:30.470> well<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> little

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
thing and go well this is like a little

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:40.210 
thing and go well this is like a little
600<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.810> haven't
