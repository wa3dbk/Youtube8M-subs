00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
okay I think when you get to the sort of

know we can do well there'll be a degree
of<00:00:28.590> experimentation<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of experimentation but but not much it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
of experimentation but but not much it
will<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.619> know<00:00:31.710> settle<00:00:32.070> group<00:00:32.279> as<00:00:32.460> well<00:00:32.610> as

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
will be you know settle group as well as

we've got with with you know perhaps one
or<00:00:35.550> two<00:00:36.140> different<00:00:37.140> faces<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.219> know<00:00:38.520> won't

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730

or two different faces so you know won't
be<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.719> time<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.020> many<00:00:40.379> experiments

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
be really the time for many experiments

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
be really the time for many experiments
may<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.760> few<00:00:41.940> before<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.620> start<00:00:43.620> next

people probably looking at your team and
trying<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> deduce<00:00:50.760> whether<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.420> be

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
trying to deduce whether that will be

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.779 
trying to deduce whether that will be
the<00:00:51.660> team<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.140> they're<00:00:52.829> still<00:00:52.920> potentially

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the team but they're still potentially

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.010 
the team but they're still potentially
wanted<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.120> openings<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> guys<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020

training next week as well yeah there's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
training next week as well yeah there's
there's<00:00:58.199> there's<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> two<00:00:59.129> close

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
there's there's one of the two close

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
there's there's one of the two close
calls<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.000> should<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
calls and there should be because you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.680 
calls and there should be because you
need<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.050> than<00:01:01.260> 11<00:01:01.559> players<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.690> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
know in my ideal world I've got I've got

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.960 
know in my ideal world I've got I've got
20<00:01:07.710> players<00:01:07.950> where<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.310> closed<00:01:08.460> between<00:01:08.640> all

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
20 players where it's closed between all

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
20 players where it's closed between all
of<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.159> my

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
of them and you know that's that's my

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
of them and you know that's that's my
aim<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.210> tried<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.900> as

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
aim really and then tried to get as

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
aim really and then tried to get as
strong<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.740> possible<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.369> mean<00:01:14.790> how<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
strong as possible I mean how you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
strong as possible I mean how you
mentioned<00:01:15.330> sort<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.689> settled<00:01:15.990> team<00:01:16.259> over

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
mentioned sort of settled team over

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.499 
mentioned sort of settled team over
preseason<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> they've<00:01:17.820> looked<00:01:18.030> good<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
preseason and they've looked good and I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600 
preseason and they've looked good and I
guess<00:01:18.869> momentum<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.439> building<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.490> you're

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
guess momentum is building so you're

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.740 
guess momentum is building so you're
still<00:01:20.790> looking<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.360> new<00:01:21.570> faces

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
still looking for one or two new faces

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660 
still looking for one or two new faces
we<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> real

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
we can but is that is that a real

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
we can but is that is that a real
positive<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> lads<00:01:24.540> who<00:01:24.930> did<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.350> well

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
positive that the lads who did so well

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.780 
positive that the lads who did so well
last<00:01:25.560> season<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:26.100> still<00:01:26.130> together<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
last season are still together and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
last season are still together and
obviously<00:01:27.030> ambitious<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.840> again

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
obviously ambitious to do it all again

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
obviously ambitious to do it all again
