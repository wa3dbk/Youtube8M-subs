00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
perspective and there's two ways to do

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
perspective and there's two ways to do
this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.150> new<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> pro<00:01:19.110> way<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.439> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
this is a new way in the pro way this is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.249 
this is a new way in the pro way this is
the<00:01:19.710> new<00:01:19.860> way<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.180> spinning<00:01:22.020> around

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the new way this is just spinning around

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.390 
the new way this is just spinning around
the<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.770> dolphin

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the and like that and just dolphin

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.609 
the and like that and just dolphin
diving<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.900> gets<00:01:28.080> its<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.409> funny

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
need to have a high sensitivity I'd

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.539 
need to have a high sensitivity I'd
recommend<00:01:39.630> between<00:01:40.079> 10<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.350> 14<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.130> personally

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
recommend between 10 and 14 I personally

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.830 
recommend between 10 and 14 I personally
use<00:01:41.790> 13<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.799> because<00:01:43.799> i'm<00:01:43.920> indy<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.840> this

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
use 13 because because i'm indy and this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.289 
use 13 because because i'm indy and this
is<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> pro<00:01:46.439> way<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.700> many<00:01:47.909> flare

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
is the pro way to get as many flare

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
is the pro way to get as many flare
points<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.280> possibly<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> see
