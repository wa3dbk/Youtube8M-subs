00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the metallic blue I believe I backed

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.910 
the metallic blue I believe I backed
that<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> an<00:02:18.000> Indy<00:02:18.360> silver<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.200> then

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
that with a an Indy silver and then

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.590 
that with a an Indy silver and then
white<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.550> then<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> black<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.270> see<00:02:21.420> here

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
white and then the black you see here

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.050 
white and then the black you see here
just<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.870> kind<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.490> keep<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> dark<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
just to kind of keep it dark on the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.170 
just to kind of keep it dark on the
interior<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> don't<00:02:26.130> really<00:02:26.340> notice<00:02:26.520> any

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
interior so you don't really notice any

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.640 
interior so you don't really notice any
kind<00:02:27.299> of<00:02:27.390> Sun<00:02:27.659> bleed<00:02:27.989> 3<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.349> anything<00:02:28.500> like

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
kind of Sun bleed 3 or anything like

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.890 
kind of Sun bleed 3 or anything like
that<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.950> body<00:02:29.099> looks<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.609> great<00:02:29.900> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that on the body looks really great a

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.429 
systems I ordered from Ram RC those guys
have<00:02:37.469> been<00:02:37.560> around<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.099> long<00:02:38.670> time<00:02:39.409> as<00:02:40.409> you

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
have been around for a long time as you

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.890 
have been around for a long time as you
can<00:02:40.650> see<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.799> routed<00:02:41.219> all<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.670> all<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.719> wires

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
can see I routed all the all the wires

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.720 
can see I routed all the all the wires
and<00:02:43.170> shoot<00:02:43.620> them<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.099> body<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.609> they're

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
and shoot them to the body so they're

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.490 
and shoot them to the body so they're
not<00:02:44.819> going<00:02:45.030> anywhere<00:02:45.209> they're<00:02:46.170> actually

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
not going anywhere they're actually

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.459 
not going anywhere they're actually
incandescent<00:02:47.189> light<00:02:47.609> bulbs<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.510> gives<00:02:48.840> in

incandescent light bulbs which gives in
my<00:02:49.650> opinion<00:02:50.519> more<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.299> realistic<00:02:51.920> lighting

this this old Ford Bronco it just adds

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.610 
this this old Ford Bronco it just adds
more<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.480> realistic<00:02:57.870> pop<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.230> me<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.530> got

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
more of a realistic pop to me it's got

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.879 
more of a realistic pop to me it's got
the<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.040> soft<00:02:59.819> kind<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.590> yellowish<00:03:01.590> white

you<00:03:04.680> can<00:03:04.919> see<00:03:05.040> there's<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.280> little<00:03:07.280> electronics

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
you can see there's a little electronics

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.089 
you can see there's a little electronics
board<00:03:08.489> here<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.840> for<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.680> tail<00:03:10.889> lights

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099

board here this is for the tail lights
there's<00:03:11.730> actually<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.480> set<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.989> wires<00:03:13.200> that's

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
there's actually a set of wires that's

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500 
there's actually a set of wires that's
soldered<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> motor<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.120> when<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.359> put

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
soldered to the motor and when you put

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.959 
soldered to the motor and when you put
the<00:03:15.599> body<00:03:15.780> down<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.200> plug<00:03:16.439> this<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:17.129> those

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:17.969 
the body down you plug this in to those

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.940 
the body down you plug this in to those
wires<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.659> don't<00:03:19.079> have<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.409> but<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.739> plug

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
wires you don't have to but you plug

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.259 
wires you don't have to but you plug
these<00:03:20.099> in<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.900> when<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.109> let<00:03:22.799> off<00:03:22.919> the<00:03:23.269> off

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
these in and when you let off the off

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.179 
these in and when you let off the off
the<00:03:24.780> throttle<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.530> actually<00:03:25.829> get<00:03:25.980> brake

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
the throttle you actually get brake

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.459 
the throttle you actually get brake
lights<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.879> that's<00:03:27.120> that's<00:03:27.359> pretty<00:03:27.599> cool<00:03:27.840> and

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:28.469 
lights so that's that's pretty cool and

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.599 
lights so that's that's pretty cool and
that's<00:03:28.829> all<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.069> kind<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.310> tied<00:03:29.489> together

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
that's all just kind of tied together
