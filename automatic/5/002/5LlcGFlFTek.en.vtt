I'm gonna show you the excursion and
some<00:00:06.629> testing<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.400> -<00:00:08.400> extruded<00:00:09.000> 12-inch

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
some testing from the - extruded 12-inch

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.789 
some testing from the - extruded 12-inch

600<00:00:14.519> watts<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.949> total<00:00:16.949> watches<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> thousand

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
600 watts and total watches a thousand

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.220 
600 watts and total watches a thousand
two<00:00:17.910> hundred<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.300> believe<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.660> can't<00:00:18.900> remember

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
two hundred I believe I can't remember

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.189 
two hundred I believe I can't remember
but<00:00:19.770> I'm<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.220> doing<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.910> demo<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
but I'm going to be doing a demo of a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.040 
but I'm going to be doing a demo of a
base<00:00:22.680> song<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.730> guess<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.449> can<00:00:24.600> call<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.810> like

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
base song I guess you can call it like

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.070 
base song I guess you can call it like
dance<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.390> electronic<00:00:27.390> or<00:00:27.539> whatever<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.930> don't

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
if you want the same setup my amplifier

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.130 
if you want the same setup my amplifier
is<00:00:52.170> by<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> sound<00:00:52.770> stream<00:00:53.190> live<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:54.360> 1,000

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
is by a sound stream live it's 1,000

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.099 
is by a sound stream live it's 1,000
watts<00:00:55.350> max<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.000> I'm<00:00:57.360> running<00:00:57.780> H

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
negative running at 4 ohms and I only

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.490 
negative running at 4 ohms and I only
have<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> volume<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.000> almost<00:01:09.810> halfway

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
have the volume at like almost halfway

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.640 
have the volume at like almost halfway
no<00:01:11.220> bass<00:01:11.430> boost<00:01:11.790> no<00:01:12.030> nothing<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.229> regular

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
no bass boost no nothing it just regular

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
no bass boost no nothing it just regular
amplifier<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.430> I've<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.670> heard<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
amplifier because I've I heard that you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.219 
amplifier because I've I heard that you
need<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.900> run<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:17.040> subs<00:01:17.810> for<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> little<00:01:19.110> bit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
need to run the subs for a little bit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.140 
need to run the subs for a little bit
without<00:01:19.619> putting<00:01:19.979> bass<00:01:20.280> boost<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.759> anything

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
without putting bass boost or anything

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
without putting bass boost or anything
full<00:01:21.299> volume<00:01:21.659> otherwise<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.320> might<00:01:22.439> blow

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
full volume otherwise you might blow

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.840 
full volume otherwise you might blow
them<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.159> want<00:01:23.340> them<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> stretch<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
them out so you want them to stretch a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:02:54.200 
them out so you want them to stretch a
little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.450> here's<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> demo

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.480 

alright<00:02:55.210> guys<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.810> was<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.990> demo<00:02:56.260> um<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:57.100> don't

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
alright guys that was a demo um I don't

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.950 
alright guys that was a demo um I don't
really<00:02:57.640> have<00:02:57.880> much<00:02:58.060> time<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.510> provide<00:02:58.900> a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
really have much time to provide a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.240 
really have much time to provide a
little<00:02:59.140> bit<00:02:59.320> more<00:02:59.380> in<00:02:59.740> different<00:03:00.100> type<00:03:00.220> of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
little bit more in different type of

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.720 
little bit more in different type of
music<00:03:00.960> but<00:03:01.960> uh<00:03:01.990> just<00:03:02.440> let<00:03:02.590> me<00:03:02.650> know<00:03:02.860> what<00:03:03.640> you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
music but uh just let me know what you

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.360 
music but uh just let me know what you
guys<00:03:03.850> think<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.590> remember<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.620> got<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> thousand

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
guys think I remember I got a thousand

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.840 
guys think I remember I got a thousand
watt<00:03:06.490> SSL<00:03:07.240> then<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.200> got<00:03:08.410> 1.5<00:03:09.010> farad<00:03:10.260> capacitor

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
watt SSL then I got 1.5 farad capacitor

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:21.000 
watt SSL then I got 1.5 farad capacitor
and<00:03:12.850> this<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> pioneer<00:03:14.880> AV<00:03:15.880> h<00:03:18.090> AV<00:03:19.090> h<00:03:19.390> P<00:03:19.990> 43<00:03:20.410> DVD

this thing has amazing amazing type of
amazing<00:03:25.930> type<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:27.960> options<00:03:28.960> you<00:03:29.080> can<00:03:29.200> go<00:03:29.350> with

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
amazing type of options you can go with

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.050 
amazing type of options you can go with
and<00:03:29.830> stuff<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.460> you<00:03:30.520> have<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.700> normal

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
and stuff like that so you have a normal

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.230 
and stuff like that so you have a normal
level<00:03:31.570> frequency<00:03:32.140> or<00:03:32.410> levels<00:03:33.160> at<00:03:33.490> zero<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.060> can

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
level frequency or levels at zero I can

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.230 
level frequency or levels at zero I can
go<00:03:34.750> less<00:03:35.020> or<00:03:35.230> more<00:03:35.380> if<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.650> wanted<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.070> but<00:03:37.060> yeah

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
go less or more if I wanted to but yeah
