00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.580
 last Sunday the rural globe showed the situation of farmers affected 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.750
 by the floods in Alagoas 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.490
 after the report we received several media from viewers emphasizing that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.650
 the areas most affected by the flood are those 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.220
 has forest protection along the river 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.780
 and that the rural globe should point out this really you are right 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.639
 the environmental issue is something very serious in this disaster 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.079
 we will see an unpublished excerpt from the interview with the specialist who 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.880
 participated in the report 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 meteorologist luiz carlos molion of the federal university of alagoas knows 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.630
 well the rivers of the region 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.040
 shows that floods in recent weeks have 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 basins of two great rivers the paraiba 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.680
 both have springs in Pernambuco and running through fields and ponds towards the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.550
 sea ​​in a few days fell several storms exactly on top of the two 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.540
 children 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.730
 to the doctor molion other factors contributed to the crowds being so 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.150
 big run piece so strong 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.490
 is that the region has sun in the compacted cases 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.900
 the wires are consolidated and the riparian forests have been cut long ago 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.480
 What you even do? 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.440
 with the root system of the trees being slightly deeper 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 then it provides infiltration and this infiltration 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.240
 every 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270
 because of the delay 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.990
 in the response of the system as a whole 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.210
 it's different you do not have one thing I have soil compaction 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.320
 water that fell during a collective on the riverbed. 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.420
 if I have checked 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.250
 the water infiltrates first river 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370
 the river book goes up 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.850
 slowly not as quickly as 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.290
 happened in this case 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.480
 people have the tendency 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480
 very participative life 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.119
 the facts that could not be filled in which he affirmed 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.700
 avarice 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.190
 if we had 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.439
 but environmental conservation 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.679
 So 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.679
 this risk is zero would be reduced 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:18.099
 tragedies reveals how many people remember how important it is to preserve the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.339
 environment
