great<00:00:12.180> Schaffer<00:00:12.629> looks<00:00:12.959> like<00:00:13.260> this<00:00:13.529> it<00:00:14.039> can<00:00:14.250> be

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
great Schaffer looks like this it can be

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.849 
great Schaffer looks like this it can be
used<00:00:14.520> to<00:00:14.699> control<00:00:14.879> the<00:00:15.209> card<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:16.020> maintain<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
used to control the card to maintain a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.360 
used to control the card to maintain a
stack<00:00:17.609> or<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.600> even<00:00:18.810> force<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.320> card<00:00:19.590> which<00:00:20.070> is

know<00:00:24.650> base<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.950> example<00:00:26.520> let's<00:00:26.730> say<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.750> would

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
know base for example let's say I would

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.070 
know base for example let's say I would
ask<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> say<00:00:29.280> stop<00:00:29.789> over<00:00:30.270> here<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:30.960> you
