 Welcome, welcome, 1 more Ana.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.550
 today the recipe will be that delicious 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 wonderful creamy net 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.690
 This is the simplest recipe I have ever 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 I made the drug and it was very few. 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.130
 Ingredients 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.800
 all six ingredients let's go to them 5 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 spoons of corn starch a yolk of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.769
 egg a can of condensed milk 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.550
 powdered chocolate and chocolate that is not 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.340
 mescal that is not todd chocolate powder 1 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.140
 liter of milk and a can of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 milk without whey 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 of course I thought you would like 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.860
 I before google did not know either 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 to sleep off the can of sour cream 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
 I'm going to teach you the first one. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 step is to let you reach the cream 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.390
 milk in the refrigerator for a period of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 About three-four hours 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.559
 or you can leave a freezer for 30 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 minutes this will make the cream 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.870
 of milk he goes up and sleep is all 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.430
 underneath and then just hold the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.120
 procedures in a quick how to do 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 now 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:11.430
 Then you just open the can and you put 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 the knife show that you put knife 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 finally till the end and raise you will find 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.739
 the solar in the bottom will fall in the lap but 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.739
 [Music] 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.090
 all gold has been withdrawn 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:48.020
 the first step is the following you play 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:49.380
 the milk buddy while he's staying 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.240
 crowded 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:02:03.840
 so now the condensed milk can 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:06.469
 also the condensed milk can leave 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.469
 nothing left 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:16.430
 I want to read is not the recipe of 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.830
 net son of condensed milk you 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:25.400
 mix the two tablespoons of chocolate 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:28.250
 pop that is not in that case is not todd and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 that marotta gem that I do not know for 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:38.450
 that serves a stretch in the recipe 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:41.240
 So imagine now you turn on the fire. 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.980
 down and starts to tinker while you 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.320
 have a move on it can form these 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.390
 chocolate balls but this does not want 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.140
 say that piloted are the balls that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.600
 make up why, but it was really her 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.490
 will melt according to the text to 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.650
 massaroca that was blended year and 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.630
 warm up while you have while we 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.280
 Move it now, we'll play in the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.770
 mixture of milk and corn starch 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.690
 very slowly so as not to embark 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.690
 You're going to play and you're going to play me. 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.620
 ask yourself are you mixing until you form 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.010
 a cream 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.680
 after almost 40 minutes stirring I 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 I think the exchange is ready 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:33.380
 the texture of it does not get much 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:42.500
 do not understand much when you 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:45.110
 move fast when you move fast and 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.360
 got the bottom of the pan 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.580
 Okay, you turn the fire off and wait. 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.070
 cool a little now we have to 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.750
 expect us to fully brake for 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.470
 Only then can we mix the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.959
 milk 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.800
 after the crime would be he gets with 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:07.300
 this texture much more similar already with 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:12.410
 internet understood a firmer texture 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.000
 cut this is the time that you mix 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.030
 milk cream 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.030
 so you get it without the serum, right? 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:32.970
 play when the environment is a treat 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.210
 mixing the study until the cream 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.020
 involve in its entire mix of 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.960
 chocolate you had made after 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.180
 that your blend of chocolate cream 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.970
 with the cream remaining homogeneous 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.190
 It's just you throwing it in a container in my 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:55.080
 if I put in this and in others 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.190
 this and cover and put in the refrigerator by 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.440
 two hours 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.620
 I do not comment on being cold because I 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.930
 taste is not perfect but after it freezes 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.720
 the taste is extremely similar let's go 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.160
 store two hours have passed and this is 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.870
 the result of our net to 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.870
 texture looks like I like it 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.110
