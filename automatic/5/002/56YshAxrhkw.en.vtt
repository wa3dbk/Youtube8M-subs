I<00:01:40.490> had<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> larger<00:01:41.970> version<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
I had the larger version of this I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.330 
I had the larger version of this I
carried<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> me<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> year<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
carried it on me for about a year and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
carried it on me for about a year and
handles<00:01:45.329> too<00:01:45.450> looked<00:01:45.600> brand<00:01:45.840> new<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
handles too looked brand new so you

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
handles too looked brand new so you
don't<00:01:46.380> probably<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.460> gonna<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
don't probably not not gonna have to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.530 
don't probably not not gonna have to
worry<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> handle<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.700> blade<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.329> does

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
worry about the handle the blade it does

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
worry about the handle the blade it does
not<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> frost<00:01:52.259> finish<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
not have the frost finish like the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.780 
not have the frost finish like the
larger<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.170> rust<00:01:55.399> could<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.640> issue

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
larger one so rust could be an issue

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.310 
larger one so rust could be an issue
with<00:01:57.030> this

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.920
