 a dribbling tutorial for fifa 15 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.980
 Today I want to show you how to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 dribble as always I will with the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.910
 basics and then there is one 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.410
 few helpful tips as always happy 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.390
 I am very happy when he gives the video one 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.310
 thumbs up if you have more 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.800
 to see tutorials from me recommend 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.689
 I just give you this playlist on the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.949
 press the screen or the link in the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 video description will follow 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.510
 Let's start with the control here 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.610
 I have this great screenshot 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.710
 fifa taken the playstation control 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.690
 has been added in green by me 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.059
 You all know that with the left 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350
 Stick the player can move the first 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.300
 touch could stick with the right one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.430
 and if you do this in one 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.399
 sprint move do you want to stop 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.420
 You can do that with this combination as well 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.399
 submit the ball 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 a skill move will be right 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.989
 stick running you can open the ball 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 two because of stopping once you so 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 looking at the gate this works with 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.050
 pressing lb and the other 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.149
 could just stop the ball like that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.010
 you have to press rt 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 You can not sprint with the known 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.750
 back from rtm protector ball 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.610
 works with lte last you can 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 still dribbling with his head up 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 Do it by rt and lt 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.330
 At the same time, now I show you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.700
 a few basic things then it works 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 continue with special tips if you are with 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 You should dribble your player two 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.680
 Keep things in mind 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.509
 the faster you run the less 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 You also have ball control 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.049
 the triple works with tricky ones 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.950
 best for players but that is 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.049
 of course logical 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.729
 then it is still important that you if 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.590
 possible the body of your player 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.930
 between the ball and the opponent brings 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.009
 This is the most effective method 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.799
 not to lose the ball 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.850
 you can only be fouled if 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.710
 now the example in the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 background sees you recognize that me 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 mostly without many skills triple 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.399
 I use a combination 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.899
 fast and slow if you are 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.430
 you want to change your direction 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.110
 Just give her the sprint button 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.670
 let go and as soon as the change 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.270
 you can continue 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.280
 sprint 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.409
 This will give you more control over 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.479
 the ball if you follow with your player 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.340
 Running in front could also stop the ball 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.590
 here is the choice between tor 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.239
 Watch or not if you have the ball 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.050
 so you can stop the game tempo 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.970
 throttle 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.860
 This can be helpful, for example 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.340
 to assist fellow players 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.200
 waiting 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.960
 the dribbling is with raised head 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.240
 very good you see how effective it is 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.660
 your player is leading the ball tight 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.400
 body 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.680
 you have the best here 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.330
 Ball control this kind of dribbling 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.460
 is perfect for ball control too 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.120
 get and to speed up the game too 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.310
 throttle 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.200
 in my opinion it is really effective 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.970
 because you, for example, after that too 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.950
 just normal and fast continue running 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 what can surprise the opponent 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 you can also use it to 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.760
 wait until you have a perfect pass 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.560
 can play a good variant which 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 will also enrich offensively game 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.340
 if he has a video for the deadly or 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.870
 also want to look perfect pass 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.080
 Now click on the screen or 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.550
 Follow the link in the video description 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.500
 projects board is one of my favorites 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.850
 features that you can against 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.400
 the bumping and tugging of your opponent 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.720
 would be using projects ball by her 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.940
 the key for this often in a row 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.740
 presses when your opponent close to you 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.020
 is and wants to work on you 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.730
 Example with a trikotzupfer 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.120
 detailed tutorial you will find 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.880
 here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.680
 you know yes we there cometh when their 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.660
 some space has put the ball before you 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.950
 for that you have to stick to the right stick 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.640
 Sprint in the desired direction 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.709
 patch 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.940
 this method is perfect for yours 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.220
 to run away from opponents 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.050
 but be careful if he does not 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.380
 watching you lose easily the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.239
 ball 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.550
 because you do not really have one here 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.660
 You should have good ball control on everyone 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.280
 have a lot of space 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.410
 I also have my own for this 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.720
 tutorial creates which the topic 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.820
 describes in more detail then there is 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.320
 Of course, the skills I'll be in 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.090
 in the future a special one in any case 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.890
 But video about skills can do one thing 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.870
 I'll tell you now if you 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.180
 want to use a skill makes it 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.760
 then if you are about two to three meters 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.980
 before your opponent are let shortly before 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.510
 the sprint started off for the skill 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.440
 and then you can go back to normal 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.600
 continue 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 the right timing is here 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.980
 most important now there are a few more 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.380
 useful tips for dribbling the first 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.880
 What you should do is before he 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.760
 you should get the ball 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.380
 Think about where you 're running Volt is waiting for 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.480
 not on the ball but go for it 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.430
 if possible contrary especially if 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.650
 your opponent sits in the neck uses 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.100
 the left stick around the ball towards 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.650
 go 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.870
 You can also use the first touch 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.940
 to bring into an advantageous position 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.560
 you just have to stick the right one in 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.389
 stain the desired direction and you 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.880
 You will see that your player has a few 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.130
 doing cool moves as he knows me 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.759
 There is also a tutorial look for this 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.680
 to you 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.139
 now there is one in my eyes 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.880
 perfect example if you have a pass 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.500
 gets to stand with the back to the gate 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.289
 you should only stick the left one 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.580
 Use it to move the ball once 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.710
 to the opponents around us in the 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.820
 Background really only looks the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.860
 use left stick 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.720
 It can not be better the opponent can 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.210
 Ball does not reach your player because of him 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 with his body again protects to 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.570
 actual dribbling 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.210
 many ask themselves how one an opponent 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.770
 comes over without any skills I 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.470
 personally, this kind of dribbling likes 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.750
 skills are effective, yes, but it is 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.639
 works without you if you have the freedom 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.500
 have dribbled best in sprinting 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.630
 as soon as an opponent approaches 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.250
 you should let go of the sprint aces 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.470
 This will give you better ones 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.449
 ball control just uses the 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.240
 Left stick around the opponent around 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.340
 dribble if necessary uses projects ball 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.229
 After that, of course, it goes on 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.910
 the next opponent just comes with the 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.220
 dribble left stick around and on 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.260
 you go you have simply your pace 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.120
 slows down and use the times 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.949
 if you have a tricky player 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.000
 he'll be a few here and there 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.250
 perform tricks 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.229
 this method is very effective and if 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.229
 you could get the hang of it 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.510
 go through the whole range of defense as I do 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.460
 it said at the beginning of my dribbling 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.840
 is a combination of fast and easy 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.090
 slow running 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.010
 it depends on the situation 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.440
 Of course, I use that but how 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.919
 A special tutorial will be coming soon 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.870
 consequences 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.909
