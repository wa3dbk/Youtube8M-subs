my main phone i always have as my iphone
5<00:01:11.700> mainly<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.080> fits<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.470> well<00:01:13.619> into

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
5 mainly because it fits so well into

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
5 mainly because it fits so well into
the<00:01:14.220> ecosystem<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.000> I've<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.689> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the ecosystem that I've got like with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.859 
the ecosystem that I've got like with
Max<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.799> various<00:01:17.369> other<00:01:17.549> bits<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.270> Apple

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
Max and and various other bits of Apple

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
Max and and various other bits of Apple
equipment<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.920> literally<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.820> note<00:01:21.090> 2

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
equipment but literally with this note 2

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.350 
equipment but literally with this note 2
I<00:01:21.600> found<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.049> easier<00:01:22.619> than<00:01:22.650> ever<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.369> use<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
I found it easier than ever to use this

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.950 
I found it easier than ever to use this
instead<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.979> apple<00:01:26.490> mobile<00:01:26.850> phone<00:01:27.360> device

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
instead of an apple mobile phone device

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
instead of an apple mobile phone device
and<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> whole<00:01:28.979> bunch<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.369> reasons<00:01:29.460> for

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and there's a whole bunch of reasons for

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390 
and there's a whole bunch of reasons for
that<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:31.170> let's<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.740> run<00:01:31.890> through<00:01:31.920> some<00:01:32.280> of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that now let's just run through some of

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
that now let's just run through some of
the<00:01:32.490> specs<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.509> explain

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the specs for this because they explain

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.109 
the specs for this because they explain
some<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.710> first<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.729> we've<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
some of it first up we've got a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.920 
some of it first up we've got a
quad-core<00:01:36.619> 1.6<00:01:37.619> gigahertz<00:01:38.189> processor<00:01:38.570> with<00:01:39.570> 2

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
quad-core 1.6 gigahertz processor with 2

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.260 
quad-core 1.6 gigahertz processor with 2
gigabytes<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.890> RAM<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.060> makes

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
gigabytes of RAM and I think that makes

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.359 
gigabytes of RAM and I think that makes
a<00:01:42.390> huge<00:01:42.659> difference<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> overall<00:01:43.950> kind<00:01:44.280> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
a huge difference to the overall kind of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.450 
a huge difference to the overall kind of
smoothness<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.630> butter<00:01:46.229> ishness<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.979> this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
smoothness or butter ishness of this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.389

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.910 
galaxy note 2 it really doesn't make it
so<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.119> smooth<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.840> we've<00:01:52.170> jelly<00:01:52.409> been<00:01:52.649> over

so so smooth and we've jelly been over

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
so so smooth and we've jelly been over
the<00:01:53.009> top<00:01:53.070> four<00:01:53.610> point<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:53.939> point<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.570> it

the top four point one point one it
really<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> fantastic<00:01:55.860> device<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:56.969> just

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
really is a fantastic device to use just

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.050 
really is a fantastic device to use just

has<00:02:03.090> come<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> long<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.899> leaps<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> bounds

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
has come a long kind of leaps and bounds

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.410 
has come a long kind of leaps and bounds
especially<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> last<00:02:05.460> sort<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.149> six

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.779 
especially in the last sort of six
months<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.930> would<00:02:07.140> say<00:02:07.380> since<00:02:07.710> jelly<00:02:08.069> bean<00:02:08.310> I've

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
months I would say since jelly bean I've

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.699 
months I would say since jelly bean I've
also<00:02:09.239> found<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.289> get

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
also found that I can actually get

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.860 
also found that I can actually get
pretty<00:02:11.250> much<00:02:11.610> every<00:02:12.060> app<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.480> I've<00:02:12.569> got<00:02:12.750> on

device<00:02:16.800> for<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.460> matter<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:18.390> seem<00:02:18.630> to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
device for that matter but they seem to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.780 
device for that matter but they seem to
work<00:02:18.930> particularly<00:02:19.350> well<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.070> note<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.490> do

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
work particularly well on the note to do

work particularly well on the note to do
to<00:02:20.970> those<00:02:21.060> amazing<00:02:21.660> specifications<00:02:22.670> now<00:02:23.670> I've

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
to those amazing specifications now I've

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.540 
to those amazing specifications now I've
got<00:02:24.240> over<00:02:24.660> one<00:02:25.020> overwhelming<00:02:25.620> factor<00:02:26.430> that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
got over one overwhelming factor that

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.360 
got over one overwhelming factor that
makes<00:02:26.760> me<00:02:27.120> love<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.230> galaxy<00:02:28.680> note<00:02:28.710> 2<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.100> I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
makes me love the galaxy note 2 and I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.650 
makes me love the galaxy note 2 and I
will<00:02:29.520> come<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.880> right<00:02:30.270> at<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> end

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
will come to that right at the end

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.870 
will come to that right at the end
something<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.320> think<00:02:31.380> makes<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.370> blow<00:02:32.640> pretty

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
something I think makes it blow pretty

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.640 
something I think makes it blow pretty
much<00:02:33.090> every<00:02:33.480> other<00:02:33.510> phone<00:02:33.930> out<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> water

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
much every other phone out of the water

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410 
much every other phone out of the water
but<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> say<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> will<00:02:35.760> come<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.060> just

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
but like I say I will come to that just

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.360 
but like I say I will come to that just
at<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.600> end<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> contributing

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
at the end one of the contributing

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.449 
at the end one of the contributing
factors<00:02:38.430> towards<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:40.020> huge<00:02:40.680> screen

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
factors towards that is this huge screen

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.360 
factors towards that is this huge screen
it<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.240> absolutely<00:02:42.650> massive<00:02:44.209> 5.5<00:02:45.209> inches<00:02:45.870> of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
it is absolutely massive 5.5 inches of

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.360 
it is absolutely massive 5.5 inches of
beautiful<00:02:47.370> none<00:02:48.030> pentile<00:02:48.840> display<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.130> it

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
beautiful none pentile display and it

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.150 
beautiful none pentile display and it
really<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> fantastic<00:02:51.260> screen<00:02:52.260> much<00:02:52.890> better

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
really is a fantastic screen much better

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.330 
really is a fantastic screen much better
than<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> galaxy<00:02:53.880> s3<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.980> kind

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
than the galaxy s3 and it's just a kind

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.860 
than the galaxy s3 and it's just a kind
of<00:02:56.430> pleasure<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.910> work<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.120> really<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
of pleasure to work with really with the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.260 
of pleasure to work with really with the
size<00:02:58.290> now<00:02:59.100> there<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.340> obviously<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.700> downside

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
size now there is obviously a downside

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.060 
size now there is obviously a downside
to<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.570> size<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.410> fact<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.830> can't

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
to the size in the fact that you can't

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.550 
to the size in the fact that you can't
with<00:03:02.550> one<00:03:02.760> hand<00:03:03.060> reach<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.140> corners

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
with one hand reach all of the corners

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.840 
with one hand reach all of the corners
of<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.800> device<00:03:05.100> which<00:03:05.340> means<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.700> is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
of the device which means that is

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.570 
of the device which means that is
definitely<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.330> two-handed<00:03:07.020> device<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:08.310> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
definitely a two-handed device but the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.400 
definitely a two-handed device but the
benefits<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.150> come<00:03:09.360> along<00:03:09.840> with<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.170> size

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
benefits that come along with the size

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.880 
benefits that come along with the size
of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> phone<00:03:10.890> kind<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.730> negate<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.390> issue

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
of the phone kind of negate that issue

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
of the phone kind of negate that issue
sometimes<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.130> little<00:03:14.160> bit<00:03:14.430> awkward<00:03:14.790> when

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
sometimes it's a little bit awkward when

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.280 
sometimes it's a little bit awkward when
you<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.330> know<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.540> want<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.810> do<00:03:15.989> something

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
you you know you want to do something

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.020 
you you know you want to do something
one-handed<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.160> maybe<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.580> can't<00:03:17.820> you've

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
one-handed and maybe you can't you've

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.120 
one-handed and maybe you can't you've
got<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> kind<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.510> jig<00:03:19.110> around<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.799> your<00:03:19.890> phone

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
got to kind of jig around and your phone

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.920 
got to kind of jig around and your phone
and<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.430> gets<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.670> little<00:03:20.790> bit<00:03:20.970> awkward<00:03:21.390> but<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and it gets a little bit awkward but the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.789 
and it gets a little bit awkward but the
benefits<00:03:22.380> far<00:03:22.470> outweigh<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.640> negative<00:03:24.799> now

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
benefits far outweigh that negative now

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.490 
benefits far outweigh that negative now
also<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.670> say<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> phone<00:03:27.600> loads<00:03:28.290> of

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
also like I say on the phone loads of

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.259 
also like I say on the phone loads of
the<00:03:28.650> applications<00:03:29.310> are<00:03:29.519> available<00:03:29.820> now

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
the applications are available now

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.360 
the applications are available now
through<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.140> Play<00:03:31.350> Store<00:03:31.410> pretty<00:03:32.220> much

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
through the Play Store pretty much

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
instead of using your fingers and
