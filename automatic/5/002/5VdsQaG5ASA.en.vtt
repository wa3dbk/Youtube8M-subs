00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
that fusion and ditch off the fusions

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.880 
that fusion and ditch off the fusions
for<00:02:17.560> extra<00:02:17.830> pluses<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.780> main<00:02:19.990> heart<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
for extra pluses so the main heart and

soul<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.280> deck<00:02:21.460> i<00:02:21.640> guess<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.120> can't<00:02:22.390> really

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
soul the deck i guess that can't really
