00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.250
 hi culeros tells you about father dx on this occasion I bring you a great 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.040
 stay of psp let's start dark alex also known as dark alex dax es 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.059
 the pseudonym of a daughter programmer who the Spanish 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.979
 his real name is Alejandro programmed special software versions 

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:19.279
 internal of portable playstation portable game console 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.100
 custom firmware custom firmware customwares is that 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.909
 they combine the new features that they are and incorporate into their firmwares 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.019
 Officials with other applications that allow executing unofficial programs 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.930
 homebrew 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.530
 He also made developments that allow to return to versions 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.070
 previous crater firmware if you repair the console software 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.420
 blocked mainly the pandora battery that is explained later 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.650
 abandoned its activities related to psp in July 2007 among others 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.060
 things for the threats poured by sony towards the jacales of the ps3 their work 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.500
 It has been important for fans of this console not only for their work 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.150
 but because it opened the door for other developers to 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.800
 continue expanding the possibilities of using this console 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.850
 to get it to be as versatile as the point console the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.080
 Firmware updates must be digitally signed and be superior 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.280
 to the console firmware so that an update can be carried out 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.320
 theoretically you can not go back to a previous firmware 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.909
 in this way sonny would prevent you from going back to firmware 1 5 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.899
 with which you can load any unsigned software by sony between the 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.140
 that there are a variety of home games and console emulators 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 as the super nintendo the sega megadrive point dark alex prepared an application 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.509
 that allowed to modify the data of the version of the console to make it 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.429
 believe that we have affirmed in lower reversion so as to allow execute 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.190
 an update 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.290
 these patches she sent a serious and next to the custom firmwares 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.560
 were the programs that gave him the most popularity 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.380
 one of the first of a serious is that he programmed together with other colleagues was 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.020
 the two 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.260
 fifty 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.000
 60 took a great being 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.810
 which used the method found by edison carter 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.640
 who developed the device for the efesé 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.720
 the recorder was executed through an elo created by the team in the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.219
 zero-zero time zeta 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:16.279
 the downgrade needed a copy of firmware 1 5 which would write the 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.569
 files from the 1 5 in the flash or from the psp point initially prepared a firmware 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.269
 adapted as proof of concept for firmwares 1 5 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.259
 showing that it was impossible to run home software on the console 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.009
 later he was combining the official firmwares of sony with the 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.689
 new possibility that I had already presented allowing loading games 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.689
 from iso or made compressed cso and other applications 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.909
 firmwares costs also called open editions open editions 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.909
 they contained code owned by sony 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.900
 which made its distribution illegal, so giving kalex prepared a 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.709
 application that patched the official firmwares instead of distributing them 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.679
 altered firmware 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:02.549
 in july 2007 dark alex officially left his job on the scene of 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.019
 psp citing having had problems with sony as one of the reasons for his 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:07.949
 retirement 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.699
 4 many people who collaborated in the development of new applications for 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.799
 the psp were surprised by his departure making even some 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.239
 suggest they are and had hired him 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.230
 On August 6, 2007 Yon Cordero denied in an interview that Kalex had 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.149
 been hired by such company 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:30.699
 in August 2007 it was discovered that Kalex was a member of the c + d team 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.319
 also known as create and destroy créate andes today 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.790
 consisting of north 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.919
 lemuel ccoo and fajita among other 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.029
 who created the pandora battery 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.189
 pandoras 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.340
 which helped the owners of psp and blocked making them functional 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.999
 again point is added to your custom firmwares a menu of 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.359
 recovery through which the console can recover from a 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:52.980
 seminarian 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.629
 and from which you can activate an option that allows it to load 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.459
 backup copies of games also called backups without having to have 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.269
 an original world in the console 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.459
 although it is well known that not all backups work correctly with this 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.489
 option if a large majority 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.039
 also allows you to configure the console region allowing you to view a 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.739
 month of different region 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.499
 A very important option is that you can add new functions to the 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:22.240
 firmware of the corresponding recovery mode easily the so-called 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.520
 plugins 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.340
 another of them also the ability to access the flash 0 memory 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.600
 internal of the psp from the us going that it is not necessary to use programs 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.900
 homebrew to modify the xmb xrossmediabar 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.630
 initial menu of the psp or anything related to the firmware 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.620
 it also allows you to reset the flash 1 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.580
 option that is used to restore the default values ​​of the console 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.430
 and activate the playback of extension files mariel flash player 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.429
 to access it you have to have pressure on the r button at the moment of 

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:57.589
 turn on the point console created an iso image compressor that gets 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.069
 reduce the size of these to expedite their download and installation 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.159
 together with a program for the console called dax ciso that allows you to use these 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:06.169
 files 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.370
 was developed for users of firmware version 1 5 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.750
 although those who have this custom can also use 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.719
 of the 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.069
 its development has not continued that taking on version 0 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.439
 62 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.589
 although he was popular he never entered into any official pack of nominees of 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.460
 boot punto pandora is the definitive engraver 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.539
 basically it's a battery and a memory stick pro duo 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.059
 that taking advantage of the nature of the psp starts software independently 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:38.309
 of the version installed on the psp and allows to repair damage called brics 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.439
 final block of a psp 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.309
 besides allowing to degrade any psp 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.060
 Pandora was not the only creation of giving kalex 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.880
 but the team called prometheus ustea have been formed by the largest huts in 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.370
 the psp 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.990
 so far the story of this god of psp ends I hope you liked me
