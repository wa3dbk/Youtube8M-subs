00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.750
 Thomas Rohregger like a short start 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.990
 video and yes again an exercise 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.820
 dollar due i sit hope we bank 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.130
 so to speak, this step set 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.010
 look at that would have to be about 45 degrees 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.449
 I'm not a math genius and I'm fine 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 It's around the back shoulder and around today 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 the upper back can year what can 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.099
 you do as you might think 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.619
 could 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.340
 Bank set two at the dock 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.290
 entertaining relatively little weight on it 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.120
 have the last seven and a half kilo 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.710
 and if I personally do the exercises 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 I really do not need to do that either 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.480
 more overestimate themselves at the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.180
 exercise or actually perform 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 relatively wrong yes what are we doing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
 reverse free with the dumbbells and me 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 especially here in the video 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.629
 to enter a matter and that to one 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.109
 different execution with the us 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.399
 two different ones, so to speak 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.960
 Muscle games meet or stop with the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.650
 a model, especially a muscle 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.970
 isolate partie more and that will be around 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.909
 Of course that shows just here 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.580
 now a very important thing is hiding you 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.799
 with the breast on the front of the pad 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.799
 You can place the feet either under 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.619
 the weight bench, so to speak, sometimes that way 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.110
 pinch small books under it or as 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.820
 set up stable and then we go 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.670
 here at the first execution the before 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.470
 Everything for the back shoulder is with 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.479
 the evening more stretched backwards and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
 especially to the outside so really after 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.430
 go outside and lead the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 shoulder blades not aware together 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.000
 in that we have the shoulder blades 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.200
 do not consciously merge and forward 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.960
 to go outside and the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.490
 elbows are not really big 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.860
 have borrowed we meet before the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.840
 Rear delta head start of exercise 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 very nice you back shoulder 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.430
 isolate and feel very very nice yes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.259
 especially without swing with little weight 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.180
 that you worry about number one especially 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.950
 for the back shoulder if we do 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.049
 with the reverse free with the short ones 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.000
 especially on the weight bench 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.979
 want to address the upper back more 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.970
 then we make the following statements 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.400
 and bland in the lead as the poor 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.900
 up and pull 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.760
 the shoulder blades still together so 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.769
 speaks the flexion in the ellenbogengelenk 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.329
 is the larger relate the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.310
 shoulder blades stay together dreaming 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.700
 you with the breast on it that stood it 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.140
 firmly 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.140
 and so we meet especially on the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.730
 hooded muscle the Romans are the yes 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.260
 equipment, of course, had to be behind 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.810
 shoulder but here we have of course 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.939
 this sadist of the upper back in the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.379
 verbund trains yes I wanted you 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.970
 Just point it out 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.159
 Above all, we have two options 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.900
 have different types of reverse meat 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.489
 to meet muscle parts 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.019
 as I said for some, first and foremost 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.030
 want to isolate in the back shoulder 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.780
 but stretched more stretched and you are 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.180
 not up 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.159
 in the second version especially the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.019
 Shoulder blades together intensively 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.940
 Bring the shoulders to stay 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.709
 always lowered and always very important with 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.810
 the breast on the front really wants it 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.579
 not too much weight yes we meet 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.139
 very small muscles play a role here 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.750
 We only get to play this without a swing 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.609
 out with a very concentrated 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.310
 execution and yes the video should 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.680
 Just be enlightening on what 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.959
 you have to pay attention here and what you do 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.340
 can work differently 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.510
 I hope I could give you a little bit 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.319
 further help maybe something new 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.449
 teach 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.739
 The reverse free which is good too 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.599
 I'm a fan, too 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.579
 from the cable deep in the exercise also great 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.349
 cool and make it easy 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.750
 I would be glad I tried the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.010
 really distinguished the music as well 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.210
 to feel nature 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.210
 See you 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.210
 really 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.930
 more
