especially young fiction because in part

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.260 
especially young fiction because in part
that's<00:01:27.960> an<00:01:28.140> easy<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:29.340> kids<00:01:29.670> have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that's an easy way to that kids have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.660 
that's an easy way to that kids have
action<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:31.049> agency<00:01:31.650> among<00:01:32.070> themselves<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
action have agency among themselves and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.149 
action have agency among themselves and
have<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.030> strike<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.659> Independence<00:01:34.350> it's

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
have that strike of Independence it's

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.010 
have that strike of Independence it's
kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> given<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.119> guess<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.720> some

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
kind of like a given i guess in some

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.200 
kind of like a given i guess in some
ways<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.860> their<00:01:38.009> sorts<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.369> characters<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
ways with their sorts of characters I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880 
ways with their sorts of characters I
didn't<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> real

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
didn't really think of it as a real

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.499 
didn't really think of it as a real
thing<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.450> problem

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
thing and I think that can be a problem

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
thing and I think that can be a problem
with<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> being<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.799> troop<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
with that being a troop you think of it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
with that being a troop you think of it
as<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.360> actual<00:01:45.540> loss<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> think

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
as an actual loss so much as you think

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.020 
as an actual loss so much as you think
of<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.340> oh<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.670> something<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
of it as like oh that's something that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
of it as like oh that's something that
happen<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.479> their<00:01:48.600> life<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.320> bear<00:01:49.590> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
happen in their life and now bear this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
happen in their life and now bear this
very<00:01:50.040> independent<00:01:50.640> active<00:01:51.000> person<00:01:51.509> whereas

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
very independent active person whereas

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.539 
very independent active person whereas
now<00:01:52.079> having<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> happened<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.310> quite

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
now having how it happened not in quite

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
now having how it happened not in quite
the<00:01:53.729> same<00:01:53.759> way<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.840> still<00:01:55.140> having<00:01:55.500> had<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the same way but still having had it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.530 
the same way but still having had it
happen<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.700> does<00:01:56.969> give<00:01:57.390> me<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
happen it really does give me a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330 
happen it really does give me a
different<00:01:57.750> insight<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.680> characters<00:01:59.250> who

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
different insight into characters who

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.770 
different insight into characters who
use<00:01:59.490> their<00:01:59.640> parents<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.149> also<00:02:00.390> how<00:02:00.509> they<00:02:00.630> talk

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
use their parents and also how they talk

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
use their parents and also how they talk
about<00:02:00.840> them<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.950> feel<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.640> trying<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
about them and I feel like not trying to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
about them and I feel like not trying to
be<00:02:03.240> too<00:02:03.270> judgmental<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.680> extent<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
be too judgmental but the extent to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.649 
be too judgmental but the extent to
which<00:02:05.219> an<00:02:05.460> author<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.909> using<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.390> it's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
which an author is using it because it's

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.029 
which an author is using it because it's
a<00:02:06.750> true<00:02:06.930> problem<00:02:07.170> because<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.530> useful<00:02:07.860> or

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
a true problem because it's useful or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.210 
a true problem because it's useful or
because<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.369> understand<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
because they understand what that

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.830 
because they understand what that
really<00:02:09.670> does<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.030> someone<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.600> feel<00:02:10.750> like

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
really does to someone so feel like

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.410 
really does to someone so feel like
that's<00:02:11.020> like<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.230> huge<00:02:11.590> thing<00:02:11.890> has<00:02:12.220> changed

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that's like a huge thing has changed

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.790 
that's like a huge thing has changed
while<00:02:13.420> I'm<00:02:13.540> reading<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.350> Hunger<00:02:14.590> Games

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
while I'm reading the Hunger Games

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.300 
while I'm reading the Hunger Games
another<00:02:15.250> big<00:02:15.490> one<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.680> very<00:02:17.680> much<00:02:17.770> felt

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
another big one is that I very much felt

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.280 
another big one is that I very much felt
like<00:02:18.670> when<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.030> first<00:02:19.300> read<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.600> Katniss<00:02:20.050> was<00:02:20.260> a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
like when I first read it Katniss was a

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.710 
like when I first read it Katniss was a
week<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.190> didn't<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.640> concern<00:02:22.480> for

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
week and I didn't like that concern for

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.600 
week and I didn't like that concern for
Peter<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.350> didn't<00:02:23.560> understand<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.220> just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
Peter and I didn't understand that just

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.300 
Peter and I didn't understand that just
didn't<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.270> kind<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:27.040> naked

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
didn't like this kind of really naked

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.890 
didn't like this kind of really naked
vulnerability<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.390> even<00:02:28.690> though<00:02:28.840> she

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
vulnerability that even though she

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
vulnerability that even though she
presented<00:02:29.320> herself<00:02:29.590> calm<00:02:30.040> collected<00:02:30.550> when

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
presented herself calm collected when

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520 
presented herself calm collected when
dealing<00:02:31.000> with<00:02:31.120> other<00:02:31.480> people<00:02:31.990> especially<00:02:32.200> in

district 13 she kind of exhibited
through<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.780> weight<00:02:34.930> she<00:02:35.170> was<00:02:35.320> narrating<00:02:36.070> her

of the 13 waddup characters that I dread

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
Peter to me did seem like a sign of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.260 
Peter to me did seem like a sign of
falling<00:02:47.230> into<00:02:47.560> their<00:02:47.740> stereotype<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.910> wasn't

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
falling into their stereotype it wasn't

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.790 
falling into their stereotype it wasn't
understanding<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.200> wasn't<00:02:50.740> a

understanding that it wasn't a
stereotypical<00:02:51.550> love<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.090> wasn't<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.510> love

stereotypical love and it wasn't a love

the<00:03:50.620> way<00:03:50.709> they<00:03:50.860> operate<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.400> very<00:03:51.640> much<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:52.120> the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
the way they operate is very much of the

the way they operate is very much of the
same<00:03:52.780> old<00:03:53.140> again<00:03:53.709> something<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.190> really

popped out to me when I was rereading

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.170 
popped out to me when I was rereading
was<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.440> idea<00:03:56.709> of<00:03:56.830> district<00:03:57.160> 13<00:03:57.489> there's<00:03:57.730> true

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
experts in leverage and you see that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.440 
experts in leverage and you see that
through<00:04:00.580> their<00:04:00.760> actions<00:04:00.790> throughout<00:04:01.360> the

understand their history they basically

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.479 
understand their history they basically
had<00:04:04.540> all<00:04:04.690> these<00:04:04.810> nuclear<00:04:05.410> weapons<00:04:05.890> pointed<00:04:06.370> at

the Capitol you use that as leverage to

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.720 
the Capitol you use that as leverage to
get<00:04:08.560> what<00:04:08.709> they<00:04:08.769> want<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.250> allow<00:04:09.489> themselves

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
get what they want to allow themselves

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.640 
get what they want to allow themselves
to<00:04:10.120> dissipate<00:04:10.600> it<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.900> allow<00:04:11.080> themselves<00:04:11.320> to

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
to dissipate it to allow themselves to

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.470 
to dissipate it to allow themselves to
be<00:04:11.739> an<00:04:11.920> independent<00:04:12.190> community<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.180> yet<00:04:13.360> and

that<00:04:13.510> came<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.840> power<00:04:13.959> they<00:04:14.140> also<00:04:14.320> restrict

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
that came to power they also restrict

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.590 
that came to power they also restrict
themselves<00:04:14.920> because<00:04:15.549> they<00:04:15.730> are<00:04:15.880> unseen<00:04:16.419> live

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
themselves because they are unseen live

themselves because they are unseen live
to<00:04:16.810> live<00:04:16.930> on

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
to live on

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.150 
to live on
ground<00:04:17.449> they're<00:04:17.930> very<00:04:18.199> strict<00:04:18.350> limits<00:04:19.039> on

themselves and that just goes to my

themselves and that just goes to my
places<00:04:22.160> like<00:04:22.310> North<00:04:22.430> Korea<00:04:22.669> East<00:04:23.150> Germany<00:04:23.630> etc
