00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi guys in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.779
 teach how and why the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.460
 contour apart I want to share a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.960
 technique that we makeup artists use 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.360
 especially for makeup for 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
 photography the photos tend to plan 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.860
 the features what makes your face 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 it looks without relief therefore it is very 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.150
 important to do a good contour for 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 the photo sessions for this 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.520
 we use a dark color that helps us 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 to give depth and definition too 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.840
 we use a light color that helps us 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.150
 to use and give volume if your skin is 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 uses a color darker slightly 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.160
 darker in this technique we apply the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.810
 contour before the base what it does 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 to see through it in a way 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.860
 very natural 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.780
 the contour is based on the light and shadow 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.079
 dark color is applied where 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.700
 there would normally be shadow on your face 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.390
 this is below the bone of your 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.180
 cheekbone in the line of the jaw in the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.020
 corners of your forehead and on the sides of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.020
 bridge of your nose 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.740
 the light color is applied in the points 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.570
 highest of your face that is where there 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.300
 more volume and where the light hits 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.200
 naturally this is in the middle of your 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.990
 front on the bridge of your nose on 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.790
 the cheekbones and in the jaw just in 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.310
 half of what we had already done with the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.240
 dark color do the same in both 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.240
 sides of your face 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.690
 you have to see something this weird or you 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.540
 worry because in the end it does not even 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.600
 is going to notice now take a sponge and 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.370
 begins to blur I use one to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.860
 the light color and another for the color 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.720
 dark so they do not mix if you want 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.150
 you can wet the sponge a little so that 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.920
 it is not so difficult to blur you have 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.300
 to see something has been laughing but not you 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.180
 worry because everything is worth it 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.060
 Now take your favorite base and apply it 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.070
 on the outline I use a brush 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.550
 fiber optic but you can use the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.550
 what do you want 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.229
 in the middle of my face you can first 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.740
 see how the contour is seen through 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.740
 from the base 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.489
 Take this powder to make contour of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.000
 light color and apply it on all my 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.000
 eyelid mobile 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.710
 and then I took this one that's a little bit more 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.960
 dark and use it to mark the 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.120
 account is very important that the powder 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.700
 what are you going to use to do contour 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.250
 call t since the chimbero shines 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.350
 they make enlargement effect that is just 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.300
 otherwise what we want to 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.700
 maximize the effect I do again 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.650
 with Turkish powder on the base for 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.990
 make a tanned effect that is very 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.880
 different to the contour if you can use 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.130
 a powder with geimer since this one 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.350
 Apply where the sun usually gives you 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.310
 which is where you burn that is where 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.260
 we apply light color 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.360
 to give it an effect what are not my 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.940
 skin I re- apply highlighter 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.920
 On the base 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.460
 do it in the places where you had 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.060
 applied the clear concealer 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.530
 and apart add the arch of the eyebrow 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.530
 the cupid's bow 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.060
 the center of your mobile eyelid 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.730
 and the tear 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.230
 define and comb your eyebrows 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.230
 add a little powder 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.270
 eyelash mask 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.740
 the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.069
 and a little bit of limit to have a 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.069
 full makeup 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.090
 you already saw how a good contour can 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.190
 make a difference I hope this
