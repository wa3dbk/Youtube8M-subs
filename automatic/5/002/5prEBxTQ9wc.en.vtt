00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.670
 you can put a more or less pose 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.670
 would be for a serious program 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:19.359
 since it comes in a note 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:22.570
 for after all one thing that I'm going to 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.130
 do listen to me as we speak we speak 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.630
 the tank whistles the goal we talk like 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 he held the ball now a lot of 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.720
 things 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.220
 fine too 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.879
 because important I say in Brazil cup 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.829
 special mouth with a pretty history 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.600
 important in Brazilian territory in the 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.710
 Liberators Cup is special and that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.690
 party wants to play them 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.670
 particularly if especially 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.519
 matches 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.079
 of mouths of angels to play but in 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.480
 special the cup was a field 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.210
 and actively agree on the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:09.590
 classification in brazil the truth that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:11.600
 It is very motivating but to be there 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.310
 and being able to do things well and when 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.030
 expelled think of that today no 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.030
 I can be in Brazil 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.020
 and play that game or play to the limit and 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.020
 I do not think 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.980
 and when you fall when it 's wii 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.210
 camila I can not be female 7 party 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.979
 so important something like that and obviously 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.170
 at the moment we do not realize it is going to be 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.170
 Hebrew where it happens that it is consumed is very 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.150
 good 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.150
 It did not matter too much because I take it 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.400
 how are we when so many tournaments 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.470
 the truth that the other day also what 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.050
 I thought a little bit and they can eat 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.540
 Christian ranks 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.190
 and go back to see the plays and you say and 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.080
 good for here is the referee has 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.180
 reason here not next I will try to 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.180
 do not go so much obviously 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.539
 I said it, I can lose 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.619
 the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.970
 because you know that out there like that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.800
 he deserved the yellow card out there 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.120
 you're wrong to go around, you have to 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.360
 wait more considering that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.360
 habit 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.420
 He said different valence 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.180
 because good left the team is 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.660
 almost everything in attack 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.280
 I went to the ball but not 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.870
 what is some time cameras and 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.140
 playing cup liberators and I remember 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.020
 of the end of the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.160
 from palmeira I remember the 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.740
 criminal classification I remember 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.090
 the truth that has a lot of history like that 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.990
 that has always gone well, let's hope not 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.990
 be 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.060
 let's see something these games I'm going 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.800
 to be there in a special outing something 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.530
 because a couple of weeks more quiet 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.410
 especially with the family with my baby 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.480
 the concentrations one wants I want the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.480
 territory and the mother here 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.450
 and it's a dream to be in that without those 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.340
 mouth videos champion of the cup 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.130
 liberators in some years put play 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.739
 to be a voice hopefully there was already one that 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.780
 it was the last tournament and well here 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.180
 you're continually losing things like that 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.440
 that hopefully tomorrow 11 will 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.610
 can see 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.690
 in the pictures good videos look 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.690
 you do not want to talk seriously 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.430
 in these words 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.230
 good since the contrast does not 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.040
 I was talking about soccer 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.259
 Well now, yes, it is true that 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.259
 you feel the weather different 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.130
 that were a couple of weeks 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.770
 if you want to say bad but the skull 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:57.340
 having lost two matches 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:00.889
 in another club that loved you so much 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.530
 and that you like let's say the transcendence 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.990
 mouth racing and since it smelled to demand 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.090
 day to day so and that's good that the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.740
 groups get used to winning and that each 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.410
 defeat seems to seem to be 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.440
 the saddest thing helps and talking about 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.759
 demanded day by day mouth demands you and the 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.919
 since it is demanding more and more 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.849
 good because I say Pablo is entering 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.060
 is making goals 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.729
 well lucas is talking let's say they are a 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.110
 lot so yeah yeah there 's a lot ahead 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.110
 competition there are many players 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.960
 I do not know how it is fair 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.330
 good now that everyone went to look 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.330
 to rom√°n to affirm
