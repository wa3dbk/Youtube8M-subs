00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
really cool and then they have this I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.679 
really cool and then they have this I
forgot<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.479> but

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
forgot I don't know what this is but

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
forgot I don't know what this is but
it's<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.979> has<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.250> being<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's a this is this has up being the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
it's a this is this has up being the
missile<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.970> her<00:01:21.210> weapon<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.409> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
missile for her weapon so like that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.109 
missile for her weapon so like that
stores<00:01:22.979> place<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.610> know<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.970> it

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
stores place I don't know if I have it

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850 
stores place I don't know if I have it
on<00:01:24.210> backwards<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.740> right

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
on backwards but I think this is right

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.560 
on backwards but I think this is right
way<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> put<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.939> put<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> both<00:01:27.330> sides

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
way to put it you can put on both sides

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.609 
way to put it you can put on both sides
because<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.080> attached<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.439> by<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
because you just attached it by the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.760 
because you just attached it by the
stick<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:29.970> both<00:01:30.090> sides<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> uh<00:01:31.200> yeah

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
stick which is on both sides so uh yeah

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.060 
stick which is on both sides so uh yeah
I<00:01:33.049> guess<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> real<00:01:34.680> quick<00:01:34.710> size

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I guess we can do a real quick size

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.969 
I guess we can do a real quick size
comparison<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.750> figure<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.650> ends<00:01:37.920> up

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
comparison with the figure that ends up

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.399 
comparison with the figure that ends up

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.770 
these in and that's basically it
it's<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.720> transformer<00:04:56.140> RC<00:04:56.470> so<00:04:57.540> just<00:04:58.540> going<00:04:58.660> to

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
it's a transformer RC so just going to

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.330 
it's a transformer RC so just going to
see<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.080> fix<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.680> lighting<00:04:59.890> I<00:05:00.100> don't<00:05:00.280> know

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
see if it fix the lighting I don't know

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
see if it fix the lighting I don't know
if<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.520> looks<00:05:00.550> nice<00:05:00.820> right<00:05:00.940> now

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
if it looks nice right now

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.940 
if it looks nice right now
it<00:05:01.990> always<00:05:02.110> looks<00:05:02.320> different<00:05:02.380> on<00:05:02.650> my<00:05:02.710> camera

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
it always looks different on my camera

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.430 
it always looks different on my camera
that<00:05:03.720> they're<00:05:04.720> always<00:05:04.840> like<00:05:04.990> still<00:05:05.169> on<00:05:05.320> the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
that they're always like still on the

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.200 
that they're always like still on the
computer<00:05:05.740> then<00:05:05.890> doesn't<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.280> camera<00:05:06.550> but

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
computer then doesn't a camera but

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.250 
computer then doesn't a camera but
they're<00:05:07.919> just<00:05:08.919> better<00:05:09.100> lighting<00:05:09.340> uh<00:05:10.200> going<00:05:11.200> to

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
they're just better lighting uh going to

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
one of those holes uh it'll just go in

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.230 
one of those holes uh it'll just go in
there<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:20.080> then<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:21.550> put<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.850> missile<00:05:22.150> in

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
mentioned all the other are SUVs is the

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.850 
mentioned all the other are SUVs is the
early<00:05:42.160> state<00:05:42.400> of<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.790> to<00:05:43.630> 2007<00:05:44.350> movie<00:05:44.440> July

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
early state of the to 2007 movie July

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.940 
early state of the to 2007 movie July
4th<00:05:45.100> 2007<00:05:45.550> so<00:05:45.820> that<00:05:45.940> was<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.060> pretty<00:05:46.210> new<00:05:46.660> touch

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
4th 2007 so that was a pretty new touch

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.340 
4th 2007 so that was a pretty new touch
but<00:05:47.950> that's<00:05:48.370> basically<00:05:48.550> it<00:05:48.910> there's<00:05:49.750> RC<00:05:50.140> I

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
but that's basically it there's RC I

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.780 
but that's basically it there's RC I
guess<00:05:50.710> I<00:05:50.800> can<00:05:50.950> give<00:05:51.070> you<00:05:51.160> a<00:05:51.190> real<00:05:51.400> quick<00:05:51.550> size

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
guess I can give you a real quick size

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:58.790 
guess I can give you a real quick size
comparison<00:05:51.820> next<00:05:52.720> to<00:05:53.370> movie<00:05:54.370> B<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.930> jazz

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.260 

Justin<00:05:59.800> tell<00:06:00.010> jazz<00:06:00.340> is<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:00.669> shortest<00:06:01.060> out<00:06:01.180> of

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
Justin tell jazz is the shortest out of

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.780 
Justin tell jazz is the shortest out of
all<00:06:01.419> them<00:06:01.660> and<00:06:02.100> RC<00:06:03.100> is<00:06:03.160> just<00:06:03.370> a<00:06:03.490> little<00:06:03.669> bit

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
all them and RC is just a little bit

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.560 
all them and RC is just a little bit
taller<00:06:03.940> than<00:06:04.150> on<00:06:04.300> Bumby<00:06:04.780> just<00:06:05.350> pretty<00:06:06.510> this<00:06:07.510> is

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
taller than on Bumby just pretty this is

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.090 
taller than on Bumby just pretty this is
the<00:06:07.750> heels<00:06:08.140> it<00:06:08.350> gives<00:06:08.500> you<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.770> advantage<00:06:11.100> so

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100
