00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
take a few tries to kind of perfect this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.110 
take a few tries to kind of perfect this
especially<00:02:20.459> when<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.670> want<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.000> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
especially when you want to do it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.479 
especially when you want to do it
quickly<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.810> am<00:02:22.410> able<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:22.920> as<00:02:23.280> quick

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
quickly I am able to do it just as quick

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.570 
quickly I am able to do it just as quick
as<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.700> did<00:02:23.849> in<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.060> video<00:02:24.270> sometimes<00:02:25.110> quicker

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
as I did in this video sometimes quicker

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.070 
as I did in this video sometimes quicker
it<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.150> does<00:02:27.300> take<00:02:27.480> practice<00:02:27.629> so<00:02:28.050> don't

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it but it does take practice so don't

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.680 
it but it does take practice so don't
get<00:02:28.319> frustrated<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> first<00:02:29.250> few<00:02:29.400> tries

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
get frustrated on the first few tries

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.780 
get frustrated on the first few tries
after<00:02:30.690> you've<00:02:31.560> done<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.980> few<00:02:32.010> times<00:02:32.340> it'll

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
after you've done it a few times it'll

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.240 
after you've done it a few times it'll
be<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.840> easiest<00:02:34.140> thing<00:02:34.260> ever<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
be like the easiest thing ever and it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.640 
be like the easiest thing ever and it
actually<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.150> most<00:02:36.480> comfortable<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:37.500> to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
actually is the most comfortable up to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.100 
actually is the most comfortable up to
you<00:02:37.769> ever<00:02:38.010> because<00:02:38.790> these<00:02:39.000> bits<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.900> sides

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
you ever because these bits on the sides

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.290 
you ever because these bits on the sides
are<00:02:40.440> basically<00:02:41.099> holding<00:02:41.489> up<00:02:41.670> all<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.000> rest<00:02:42.150> of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
are basically holding up all the rest of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.509 
are basically holding up all the rest of
your<00:02:42.420> hair<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.930> kind<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.349> gives<00:02:44.160> your<00:02:44.310> neck
