that<00:03:01.139> it<00:03:01.290> almost<00:03:01.439> looks<00:03:01.620> as<00:03:01.799> if<00:03:01.980> he's<00:03:02.129> forming

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
that it almost looks as if he's forming

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.009 
that it almost looks as if he's forming
a<00:03:02.639> Rasengan<00:03:03.209> but<00:03:03.389> he's<00:03:03.480> actually<00:03:03.659> sitting

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
a Rasengan but he's actually sitting

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.420 
a Rasengan but he's actually sitting
inside<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.469> kurama's<00:03:05.040> mouth

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
who's going to fire it off it just it's

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.140 
who's going to fire it off it just it's
really<00:03:07.799> unique<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.430> got<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.579> love<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.000> two

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
blasts finally getting next to each

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.379 
blasts finally getting next to each
other<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.950> then<00:03:11.250> they<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.549> explode<00:03:12.030> nartz

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
other and then they just explode nartz

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.909 
other and then they just explode nartz
was<00:03:12.540> actually<00:03:12.780> really<00:03:12.989> clever<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.530> he

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
was actually really clever here he

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.680 
was actually really clever here he
manages<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.459> fire<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.969> little<00:03:15.180> bit<00:03:15.329> lower<00:03:15.510> so

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
manages to fire it a little bit lower so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.020 
manages to fire it a little bit lower so
he's<00:03:15.989> able<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.229> divert<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.739> giant<00:03:17.129> blast<00:03:17.370> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
he's able to divert this giant blast it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.430 
he's able to divert this giant blast it
doesn't<00:03:18.329> matter<00:03:18.479> that<00:03:18.659> they<00:03:18.780> pan<00:03:19.019> out<00:03:19.139> you<00:03:19.199> get

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
doesn't matter that they pan out you get

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.319 
doesn't matter that they pan out you get
to<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.709> how<00:03:19.859> destructive<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.609> really<00:03:20.879> is<00:03:21.060> I

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
to see how destructive it really is I

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.610 
to see how destructive it really is I
also<00:03:21.479> like<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> fact<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.079> notch<00:03:22.290> was<00:03:22.470> going

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
also like the fact that notch was going

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.809 
also like the fact that notch was going
to<00:03:22.709> try<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.010> save<00:03:23.190> all<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> bees<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.699> of

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
to try and save all the bees you of

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.640 
to try and save all the bees you of
himself<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.329> even<00:03:24.419> during<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.870> battle<00:03:25.169> he

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
himself and even during the battle he

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.020 
himself and even during the battle he
keeps<00:03:25.829> trying<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.159> figure<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.519> where<00:03:26.639> all<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
keeps trying to figure out where all the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.610 
keeps trying to figure out where all the
different<00:03:27.120> chakra<00:03:27.629> rods<00:03:27.780> are<00:03:28.019> all<00:03:28.260> over<00:03:28.500> their

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
different chakra rods are all over their

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.039 
different chakra rods are all over their
bodies<00:03:28.949> and<00:03:29.099> then<00:03:29.669> this<00:03:29.790> really<00:03:30.209> weird<00:03:30.569> moment

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
bodies and then this really weird moment

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.469 
bodies and then this really weird moment
happens<00:03:31.409> it's<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.979> essentially<00:03:32.729> Naruto<00:03:33.150> going

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.479 
happens it's a essentially Naruto going

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
these things yet what's good about the

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.700 
these things yet what's good about the
scene<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:36.780> we<00:04:36.900> actually<00:04:37.169> get<00:04:37.289> to<00:04:37.320> see<00:04:37.440> them

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
scene is we actually get to see them

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.770

interacting<00:04:38.340> with<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.610> sage<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.449> we<00:04:39.539> get<00:04:39.660> to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
interacting with the sage and we get to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.210 
interacting with the sage and we get to
see<00:04:39.960> at<00:04:40.259> this<00:04:40.440> point<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.770> time<00:04:40.919> they<00:04:41.190> were

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
see at this point in time they were

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.040 
see at this point in time they were
actually<00:04:41.639> a<00:04:41.669> little<00:04:41.940> bit<00:04:42.240> more<00:04:42.479> nicer<00:04:42.930> to

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
actually a little bit more nicer to

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.510 
actually a little bit more nicer to
humans<00:04:43.440> maybe<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:43.860> was<00:04:44.009> a<00:04:44.039> point<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.340> time

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
humans maybe this was a point in time

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.920 
humans maybe this was a point in time
when<00:04:44.759> they<00:04:44.850> weren't<00:04:45.000> shunned<00:04:45.360> as<00:04:45.539> much<00:04:45.720> and

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
when they weren't shunned as much and

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.170 
when they weren't shunned as much and
just<00:04:46.020> seen<00:04:46.259> as<00:04:46.440> just<00:04:46.470> weapons<00:04:47.430> or<00:04:47.639> monsters

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
just seen as just weapons or monsters

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.629 
just seen as just weapons or monsters
and<00:04:48.470> obviously<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:49.889> why<00:04:50.039> all<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.400> the

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
and obviously this is why all of the

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.010 
and obviously this is why all of the
tailed<00:04:50.850> beasts<00:04:51.120> are<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.389> intrigued<00:04:51.750> in

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
tailed beasts are so intrigued in

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.990 
tailed beasts are so intrigued in
particular<00:04:52.560> Kurama<00:04:52.979> they<00:04:53.250> essentially<00:04:53.610> see

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
particular Kurama they essentially see

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.870 
particular Kurama they essentially see
the<00:04:54.539> sage<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.020> six<00:04:55.139> paths<00:04:55.590> in<00:04:55.860> Naruto<00:04:56.520> and

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
you know a lot of people been theorizing

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.230 
you know a lot of people been theorizing
that<00:04:58.680> there's<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.340> great<00:04:59.520> possibility<00:04:59.550> that

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
that there's a great possibility that

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240 
that there's a great possibility that
Naruto<00:05:00.599> himself<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.199> like<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.560> reincarnation

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
Naruto himself is like the reincarnation

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.310 
Naruto himself is like the reincarnation
of<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.610> sage<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.030> six<00:05:03.090> paths<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.720> seeing

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
of the sage of the six paths and seeing

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.839 
of the sage of the six paths and seeing
his<00:05:04.440> brand-new<00:05:04.740> form<00:05:05.039> in<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:05.280> episode<00:05:05.699> it

his brand-new form in this episode it

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.460 
his brand-new form in this episode it
obviously<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.599> know<00:05:06.690> makes<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:06.990> lot<00:05:07.139> of<00:05:07.169> sense

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
obviously you know makes a lot of sense

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.510 
obviously you know makes a lot of sense

like when he just changed them and drags
their<00:05:37.320> body<00:05:37.530> across<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.070> then<00:05:38.159> it<00:05:38.250> gets

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
their body across and then it gets

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.310 
their body across and then it gets
absorbed<00:05:38.550> in<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:38.970> get<00:05:39.090> Amazo<00:05:39.389> just<00:05:39.690> something
