00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.270
 Today I'll show you how to get one 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.260
 Defective battery from the samsung s4 recognizes 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.090
 and although there are the partially acute 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.039
 problem that these easily inflate and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.440
 then losing power means losing 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.600
 get cellphone turned on and on 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.310
 have a blow you have the cellphone 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.910
 also without warning such as if 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.340
 the loading of 40 percent or so and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.629
 more it is here noticed with my 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.749
 and you see on the back 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.649
 that the housing is quite light 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:43.649
 is shaken 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.859
 because the acoustic bit bloated 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.370
 You can easily see that from the outside 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.079
 it means 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.920
 usually the back is here 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.389
 completely flat apart from the camera 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.510
 and if you then notice that here 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:59.429
 so a very small bump results 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.350
 Thus markets overlap then should 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:09.390
 you open it and look it up 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.550
 do it here and see 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.800
 you already here if he the battery 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.630
 take out that their bit until that 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.120
 can be very difficult in the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 camera then show a small tummy 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.150
 here yes and if that was all 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.790
 The battery normally needs to be completely flat 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.920
 otherwise it will not be the lid 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 then you should be more correct 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.720
 necessarily replace the battery advises on 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.760
 Best with the dealer where he got the phone 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.410
 bought on the battery is 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.340
 usually a guarantee of 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.530
 six months 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 then it should definitely be with touch 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.820
 work and that was also from 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.060
 samsung will publish it 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.760
 problem areas mack and or he takes 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.870
 contact samsung directly then 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.030
 Swap works again 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.640
 I 've done that through my and now 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:09.360
 have bought a new one 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:12.629
 the normal get on so I recommend 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 you buy the original Samsung batteries 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:23.579
 the now has stood at the beginning of 2014 16 euro 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.670
 about the important costs if you like that 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.730
 buy a new battery please look 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.529
 what is on the battery on it and that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.700
 So if you nfc used nerve 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:41.629
 then communication has to be in the battery 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.930
 standing there because there is the antenna 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.560
 installed 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.749
 that is always when you are with this 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.599
 sharing for example where he is the two 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:54.269
 can hold samsung of each other if 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.269
 you could transfer pictures directly 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:04.230
 then you need the nfc and there are 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:06.200
 also certain phones certain 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.109
 store functions on it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:15.419
 these are the tactics of samsung 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.159
 that means there are so stickers there 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.400
 stores your functions on it and you 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:23.189
 can then just the phone 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.319
 sometimes keep it in the back then on it 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.859
 and then the function is executed 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.209
 for example, wlan can disable 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.650
 bluetooth and so on for example 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.650
 if you get into the car you do so 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.290
 glue on you and then you would 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.870
 the corresponding functions are activated 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.180
 or disabled and important is just 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.359
 for that to work you need one 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.639
 corresponding battery of nfc near field 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:51.299
 communication supports 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.730
 and that's in there in the battery and because 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.499
 We now feel the battery so im here 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.290
 compared to the broken one is 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:04:00.870
 completely flat that means I even 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.750
 nothing bloated and the broken one there me 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.600
 just a little bit 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.370
 I do not know if you can do it now 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.050
 so maybe he sees that tells 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.320
 a bit, but the upper one 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.989
 estimated broken here is not 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.890
 100 percent flat then yes takes that 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.050
 Simply insert the new one has 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.660
 certain state of charge son 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.090
 but we should complete it anyway 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.170
 fully loaded 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:36.910
 that was important for you to get the battery 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.610
 system ashore ok and then could already 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.490
 again the mobile phone in operation and 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.410
 20 views and the old one 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.419
 corresponding recycling center in numbers 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.690
 Do not throw in most garbage 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.400
 okay that was helpful for you so 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.419
 if her little bloated battery 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.629
 turn the main train directly to the dealer 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.629
 See you
