can pretty much see that the Revlon

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.210 
can pretty much see that the Revlon
didn't<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.720> lose<00:02:19.930> any<00:02:20.170> color<00:02:20.470> whereas<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
didn't really lose any color whereas the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.110 
didn't really lose any color whereas the
Urban<00:02:21.610> Decay<00:02:22.110> did<00:02:23.110> smudge<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> lot<00:02:23.890> because<00:02:24.700> my

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
Urban Decay did smudge a lot because my

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.810 
Urban Decay did smudge a lot because my
fingers<00:02:25.180> block<00:02:25.780> from<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.890> next<00:02:30.310> test<00:02:30.550> I

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
fingers block from it the next test I

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.640 
fingers block from it the next test I
did<00:02:31.120> was<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.630> see<00:02:31.840> whether<00:02:31.870> or<00:02:32.290> not<00:02:32.470> these

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
did was to see whether or not these

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.460 
did was to see whether or not these
eyeliners<00:02:33.100> are<00:02:33.550> waterproof<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:35.080> can

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
eyeliners are waterproof and I can

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.530 
eyeliners are waterproof and I can
definitely<00:02:35.860> say<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.340> both<00:02:36.790> are<00:02:37.060> waterproof

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
definitely say that both are waterproof

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.770 
definitely say that both are waterproof

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
when I did where these eyeliners and its

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
data on the next test I did and it's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.860 
data on the next test I did and it's
pretty<00:02:47.560> much<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.769> popular<00:02:48.400> use<00:02:48.640> for<00:02:49.480> both

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
pretty much the popular use for both

pretty much the popular use for both

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
tried playing these two on my waterline

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.590 
tried playing these two on my waterline
and<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.579> don't<00:03:15.760> have<00:03:15.880> pictures<00:03:16.209> for<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.480> all

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.330 
and I don't have pictures for you all
but<00:03:18.180> when<00:03:19.180> applying<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.959> found<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:21.040> Urban

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
but when applying I found that the Urban

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.090 
but when applying I found that the Urban
Decay<00:03:21.370> was<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.060> lot<00:03:22.360> easier<00:03:22.660> due<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.680> its<00:03:23.799> creamy

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
Decay was a lot easier due to its creamy

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.000 
Decay was a lot easier due to its creamy
consistency<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:25.840> getting<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.500> color<00:03:26.709> so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
consistency of just getting the color so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.789 
consistency of just getting the color so
one<00:03:27.340> swipe<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.060> was<00:03:28.150> on<00:03:28.269> my<00:03:28.450> waterline

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
one swipe and I was on my waterline

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.069 
one swipe and I was on my waterline
whereas<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.430> Revlon<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:31.120> really<00:03:31.480> did<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.930> to

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
whereas the Revlon I really did have to

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.780 
whereas the Revlon I really did have to
build<00:03:32.410> up<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.620> color<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.340> know<00:03:33.459> going<00:03:33.700> back

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
build up the color you know going back

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.990 
build up the color you know going back
and<00:03:34.239> forth<00:03:34.540> Basil's<00:03:34.989> lot<00:03:35.320> harder<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:36.640> get<00:03:36.820> that

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
and forth Basil's lot harder to get that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.360 
and forth Basil's lot harder to get that
intense<00:03:37.450> black<00:03:37.840> I've<00:03:38.620> read<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.130> watch

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
waterline even when I set it with

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.250 
waterline even when I set it with
eyeshadow<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.360> would<00:03:52.570> just<00:03:52.690> smudge<00:03:53.049> off

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
eyeshadow it would just smudge off

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.250 
eyeshadow it would just smudge off
easily<00:03:53.560> or<00:03:54.010> at<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.030> end<00:03:55.299> of<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.540> day<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:56.079> would

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
easily or at the end of the day it would

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.620 
easily or at the end of the day it would
just<00:03:56.410> kind<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.769> be<00:03:56.950> on<00:03:57.100> my<00:03:57.250> lower<00:03:57.459> lash<00:03:57.820> line<00:03:58.180> so

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
just kind of be on my lower lash line so

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.620 
just kind of be on my lower lash line so
i<00:03:58.660> really<00:03:59.260> don't<00:03:59.380> put<00:03:59.739> any<00:03:59.920> eyeshadow<00:04:00.880> or

line which one's the winner well Urban
Decay<00:04:29.500> wins<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:33.160> reason<00:04:33.550> being<00:04:33.760> is<00:04:34.000> that

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
Decay wins the reason being is that

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.779 
Decay wins the reason being is that
urban<00:04:34.599> decay<00:04:34.870> applies<00:04:35.320> more<00:04:35.650> easily<00:04:36.099> on<00:04:36.400> my

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
urban decay applies more easily on my

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.469 
urban decay applies more easily on my
eyelids<00:04:37.390> whereas<00:04:38.289> Revlon<00:04:38.950> actually<00:04:39.849> tugs<00:04:40.210> on

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
eyelids whereas Revlon actually tugs on

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.870 
eyelids whereas Revlon actually tugs on
them<00:04:40.690> is<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:41.140> takes<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.530> longer<00:04:41.740> time<00:04:41.919> for<00:04:42.460> the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
them is it takes a longer time for the

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.510 
them is it takes a longer time for the
color<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.419> build<00:04:43.659> up<00:04:44.099> when<00:04:45.099> you're<00:04:45.220> just<00:04:45.340> gonna

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
from it lovely and classy takes like a

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.540 
from it lovely and classy takes like a
longer<00:04:52.599> time<00:04:52.810> for<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.200> color<00:04:53.890> to<00:04:54.159> build<00:04:54.400> up

longer time for the color to build up

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.060 
longer time for the color to build up
here<00:04:55.030> it's<00:04:55.990> kind<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.229> hard<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.530> do<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:56.890> on

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
here it's kind of hard to do this on

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.800 
here it's kind of hard to do this on
camera<00:04:57.460> but<00:04:58.360> where's<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:59.610> Urban<00:05:00.610> Decay<00:05:00.810> one

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
camera but where's the Urban Decay one

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.000 
camera but where's the Urban Decay one
swipe<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.349> then<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.560> get<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.830> color<00:05:05.010> it's

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
swipe and then you get the color it's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.170 
swipe and then you get the color it's
really<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.610> creamy

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.120 

also<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.420> color<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.750> urban<00:05:11.260> decay<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.830> lot

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
also the color of urban decay is a lot

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.400 
also the color of urban decay is a lot
more<00:05:12.160> vibrant<00:05:12.850> so<00:05:13.090> you<00:05:13.150> do<00:05:13.480> get<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:13.870> intense

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
more vibrant so you do get that intense

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.980 
more vibrant so you do get that intense
black<00:05:14.890> and<00:05:15.310> even<00:05:16.120> though<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.600> it<00:05:16.750> does

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
black and even though that it does

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.440 
black and even though that it does
smudge<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.530> can<00:05:17.830> excuse<00:05:18.280> that<00:05:18.520> because<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.210> lot

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
smudge I can excuse that because a lot

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.780
