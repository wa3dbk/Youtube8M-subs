00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.529
 the guys it's greg so listen here 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.089
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.569
 recruitment challenge of the artist 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.599
 gaming 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.759
 so we actually want to try to give 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.639
 luck to the number of people who 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.220
 increase each day of re - entry into 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 the in the hardt you like to say yeah 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.640
 but it's been forty times 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 make a look that's all 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 bah actually one makes air that is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.210
 because there we really need 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 before we did not need it now 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 we need especially at the level of ps3 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.800
 because we had little worries 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.219
 caused the section to recover 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.079
 zero 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.570
 there were people who are barred 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.309
 emitters finally stopped that's what you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.120
 know it's on me I can not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 too much to condone 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.649
 they know it so I do not know why 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.739
 they continue to do that but good 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:51.149
 it does not matter a fact 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.710
 here it is done the leader stopped I 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.320
 spoken with an enclave and I do not know 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.280
 here it was it puts a guy that I 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 have known for an extremely long time 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.500
 so I know if she missed because 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.320
 that there is a reason 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.699
 and after we do down here were given 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.129
 leaders is actually turns out that one 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.810
 of his leaders finally broke good on 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.040
 sees the time they have most have 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.780
 chose the facility rather than 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.979
 overcome the difficulty but it's this 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.299
 that I blame the community a bit 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.590
 French this time is that as soon as 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.810
 the one team is in trouble we are 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.759
 bar in a team to ensure his 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.500
 back before thinking about his mates and 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.450
 to the team that made us progress 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.680
 think of his own ass and I find 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.939
 really that's unacceptable 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 but well after that is my point of view 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.430
 you can think what you want 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 but for me that kind of thing game 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 I can not guarantee or that it is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.770
 for that that's what I'm girl 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.689
 very dry towards the people who make 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.180
 that and a lot of people are surprised by that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.799
 but yeah if I was not like that 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.970
 for most of the time I would not have 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.420
 there would not have been late there would not be 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.090
 had hart 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.009
 the homily at the moment so for 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.290
 the rc it's going to be a rc only on a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.909
 clip why because we found that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.960
 balearic ones the one that we did you was there 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 not really appreciated by the community 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 because that's what shit people 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.840
 to have to play and that's it I can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.700
 understand because here it is not a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.750
 big team compared to everything that is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 100 thousand subscribers three hundred thousand 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.760
 subscribers all that 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.260
 and so most of the time people 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.190
 are less attracted to behind his 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.399
 flanks tags by there rather than ben here 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.650
 by dr it's not tunes it's safe to 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.120
 clips as we will do today we 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.050
 so it's safe to clips so basically 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.390
 you have to send us your flip apps in 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.640
 comment mine in comment so 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 I had treats or so I import 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.530

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.570

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.430

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.300
 link of your fit and so with regard to 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.340
 regards the xbox cheater so that's fine 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.770
 to be only of mw2 why because 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.290
 that there is only the ju section 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.400
 only on baby's charm 2 so 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.380
 here otherwise you will find yourself all 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.090
 only then on ps3 as I wanted 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.070
 that they have a little bit and a reset 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.830
 so I run a lot of people in this 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.400
 moment so for the trick shots this is 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.930
