00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
forced alright I would say that because

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160 
forced alright I would say that because
seeing<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.120> they<00:02:31.210> did<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.450> shocker<00:02:31.930> in

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
segregate their fans alright because I

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.260 
segregate their fans alright because I
don't<00:02:41.920> know<00:02:42.010> what<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.310> would<00:02:42.459> have<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.970> store
