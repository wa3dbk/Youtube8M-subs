welcome to PC which gets tech talk today
we're<00:00:13.530> looking<00:00:13.620> at<00:00:13.860> part<00:00:14.099> two<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.429> my<00:00:14.580> review

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
we're looking at part two of my review

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.990 
we're looking at part two of my review
of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> Sapphire<00:00:15.540> AMD<00:00:15.960> Radeon<00:00:16.350> HD<00:00:16.850> 6950<00:00:17.850> in

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
of the Sapphire AMD Radeon HD 6950 in

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.599 
of the Sapphire AMD Radeon HD 6950 in
part<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.990> showcased<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.859> card<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.250> did<00:00:20.460> an

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
part one I showcased the card we did an

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.490 
part one I showcased the card we did an
unboxing<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.359> went<00:00:21.900> through<00:00:22.109> some<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
unboxing and went through some of the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.050 
unboxing and went through some of the
specs<00:00:22.800> today<00:00:23.460> we're<00:00:23.609> gonna<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.850> some

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
specs today we're gonna do some

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.650 
specs today we're gonna do some
benchmarking<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.050> part<00:00:25.890> two<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:26.880> looking<00:00:27.570> at

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
benchmarking in part two now looking at

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
benchmarking in part two now looking at
the<00:00:27.750> card<00:00:27.990> itself<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.740> installed<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.369> my

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the card itself here installed in my

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.790 
the card itself here installed in my
test<00:00:29.789> system<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.960> specs<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.650> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
test system here are the specs so that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440 
test system here are the specs so that
way<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:31.980> guys<00:00:32.219> know<00:00:32.430> exactly<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.360> I'm

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
way you guys know exactly what I'm

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.330 
way you guys know exactly what I'm
running<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.120> basically<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.870> card

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
running this in and basically this card

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.790 
running this in and basically this card
I<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.850> say<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.270> almost<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:40.110> strong<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.710> as

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
I would say is almost as strong or as

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
I would say is almost as strong or as
strong<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.360> 8d<00:00:42.930> 58<00:00:43.500> 70<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.789> respects<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
strong as a 8d 58 70 in some respects so

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.850 
strong as a 8d 58 70 in some respects so
if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> look<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> stats<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
if you look at the stats here and you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.209 
if you look at the stats here and you
see<00:00:47.100> okay<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:48.030> does<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.530> fit<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.010> this

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
see okay how does this fit in in this

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
see okay how does this fit in in this
chart<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.059> how<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> fits<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> there

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
chart you can see how it fits in there

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.139 
chart you can see how it fits in there
with<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.320> those<00:00:52.440> specs<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.039> also<00:00:53.520> when<00:00:54.030> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
with all those specs and also when it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.810 
with all those specs and also when it
comes<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> GTX<00:00:55.379> series<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> Nvidia

comes to the GTX series of the Nvidia

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
comes to the GTX series of the Nvidia
cards<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.809> halfway<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.379> between<00:00:58.410> their<00:00:59.000> GTX

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
cards it's halfway in between their GTX

here in Windows 7 and gpu-z you can see

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
here in Windows 7 and gpu-z you can see
all<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> specifications<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.860> mentioned

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
all the specifications that I mentioned

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.539 
all the specifications that I mentioned
in<00:01:08.340> part<00:01:08.610> 1<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.510> showing<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
shaders and of course a decent GPU clock

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.399 
shaders and of course a decent GPU clock
and<00:01:24.990> memory<00:01:25.439> clock<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:26.189> lots<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.729> room<00:01:26.970> for

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
and memory clock with lots of room for

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.719 
and memory clock with lots of room for
overclocking<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.799> further<00:01:29.070> actually<00:01:29.579> from

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
overclocking it further actually from

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
overclocking it further actually from
the<00:01:29.880> default<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> defaults<00:01:31.320> with

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the default so this is the defaults with

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.190 
the default so this is the defaults with
the<00:01:31.530> fan<00:01:31.770> running<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.280> auto<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.079> see

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the fan running on auto and you can see

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
the fan running on auto and you can see
the<00:01:34.320> temperatures<00:01:34.860> obviously<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the temperatures obviously if you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
the temperatures obviously if you
increase<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> fan<00:01:36.570> speed<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.650> temperatures

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
increase the fan speed the temperatures

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130 
increase the fan speed the temperatures
will<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> course<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> noise

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
will go down but of course the noise

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
will go down but of course the noise
levels<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.490> found<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> by<00:01:42.509> having

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
levels will go up I found that by having

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.550 
levels will go up I found that by having
it<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.079> around<00:01:43.590> 40%<00:01:44.509> fan<00:01:45.509> speed<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.409> was

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it at around 40% fan speed it was

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.920 
it at around 40% fan speed it was
actually<00:01:46.860> still<00:01:47.070> pretty<00:01:47.100> quiet

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
actually still pretty quiet

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.660 
actually still pretty quiet
the<00:01:48.930> default<00:01:49.350> fan<00:01:49.560> speed<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.280> here

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the default fan speed you can see here

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580 
the default fan speed you can see here
the<00:01:50.970> rpm<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.509> actually<00:01:51.869> very<00:01:52.110> low<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the rpm is actually very low and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.859 
the rpm is actually very low and
whisper-quiet<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> temperatures

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
whisper-quiet here are the temperatures

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
whisper-quiet here are the temperatures

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
information and now let's get into some

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.069 
information and now let's get into some
benchmarks<00:01:59.549> ok<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.450> looking<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
benchmarks ok so looking at the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.240 
benchmarks ok so looking at the
benchmarks<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.590> always<00:02:01.799> start<00:02:01.979> off<00:02:02.040> with

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
benchmarks I always start off with

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.399 
benchmarks I always start off with
3dmark<00:02:02.640> Vantage<00:02:02.759> there's<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> GPU<00:02:03.990> score<00:02:04.320> at

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
3dmark Vantage there's the GPU score at

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.370 
3dmark Vantage there's the GPU score at
defaults<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:06.180> exactly

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
defaults so that way you know exactly

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.630 
defaults so that way you know exactly
what<00:02:07.380> we're<00:02:07.560> getting<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.979> comparing<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
what we're getting and comparing it

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.170 
what we're getting and comparing it
against<00:02:09.090> other<00:02:09.800> GPUs<00:02:10.800> other<00:02:11.129> graphic<00:02:11.819> cards

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
against other GPUs other graphic cards

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.610 
against other GPUs other graphic cards
that<00:02:12.330> I've<00:02:12.420> installed<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.140> system

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that I've installed in this system

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.880 
that I've installed in this system
and<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.159> can<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.580> also<00:02:15.150> how<00:02:15.720> those<00:02:16.440> scores

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and you can see also how those scores

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.539 
and you can see also how those scores
compared<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.269> HD<00:02:18.870> 6950<00:02:19.680> from<00:02:20.040> sapphire

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
compared to the HD 6950 from sapphire

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.880 
compared to the HD 6950 from sapphire
now<00:02:21.090> obviously<00:02:22.019> there's<00:02:22.319> lots<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.680> room<00:02:22.860> for

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
now obviously there's lots of room for

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.850 
now obviously there's lots of room for
overclocking<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.200> before

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
overclocking as you can see but before

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.649 
overclocking as you can see but before
we<00:02:25.950> get<00:02:26.040> into<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.340> let's<00:02:27.090> look<00:02:27.269> at<00:02:27.420> some<00:02:27.569> more

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
we get into that let's look at some more

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.690 
we get into that let's look at some more

anything can touch that at this point

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.270 
anything can touch that at this point
and<00:03:09.440> also<00:03:11.030> looking<00:03:12.030> at<00:03:12.090> how<00:03:12.840> much<00:03:12.989> does<00:03:13.680> the

new GPU the 6900 series alleviate the
CPU<00:03:19.919> from<00:03:20.370> processing<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.209> if<00:03:21.299> you're<00:03:21.450> doing

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
CPU from processing so if you're doing

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.050 
CPU from processing so if you're doing
video<00:03:21.780> conversion<00:03:22.560> for<00:03:22.739> example<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.459> you

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
video conversion for example and you

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.680 
video conversion for example and you
enable<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:25.160> GPU<00:03:26.160> now<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.609> do<00:03:27.000> most<00:03:27.419> of<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
high well no it doesn't you can see

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.530 
high well no it doesn't you can see

there that enabling that it actually

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.229 
there that enabling that it actually
does<00:03:39.540> use<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.200> CPU<00:03:40.620> less<00:03:40.950> if<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.579> don't<00:03:41.879> enable

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
processing of the GPU then of course now

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.539 
processing of the GPU then of course now
we're<00:03:47.579> gonna<00:03:47.669> see<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> CPU<00:03:48.359> utilization

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
we're gonna see the CPU utilization

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.589 
we're gonna see the CPU utilization
skyrocket<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:50.699> go<00:03:50.819> high<00:03:51.000> because<00:03:51.269> now<00:03:51.540> the

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
skyrocket and go high because now the

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.330 
skyrocket and go high because now the
CPU<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.290> actually<00:03:52.650> doing<00:03:52.919> most<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
CPU is actually doing most of the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.839 
CPU is actually doing most of the
conversion<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> rendering<00:03:54.379> instead<00:03:55.379> of

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
conversion and the rendering instead of

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.530 
conversion and the rendering instead of
the<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:58.260> GPU<00:03:58.709> right<00:03:59.250> instead<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.699> the<00:03:59.790> 6900

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the the GPU right instead of the 6900

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.629 
the the GPU right instead of the 6900
series<00:04:00.569> card<00:04:01.169> so<00:04:01.650> that's<00:04:01.889> one<00:04:02.280> good<00:04:02.609> thing

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
series card so that's one good thing

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.229 
series card so that's one good thing
about<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.810> 6900<00:04:04.620> series<00:04:04.650> how<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.730> enables

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239

everything<00:04:16.019> always<00:04:16.260> maxed<00:04:17.010> out<00:04:17.160> when<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.459> do<00:04:17.579> my

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
everything always maxed out when I do my

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.729 
everything always maxed out when I do my
reviews<00:04:18.269> okay<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:18.720> don't<00:04:18.810> run<00:04:19.079> things<00:04:19.349> on<00:04:19.500> low

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
reviews okay I don't run things on low

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.640 
reviews okay I don't run things on low
or<00:04:19.769> medium<00:04:20.430> or<00:04:20.669> no<00:04:21.299> AAA<00:04:21.599> because<00:04:22.260> that's<00:04:22.440> not

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
or medium or no AAA because that's not

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.350 
or medium or no AAA because that's not
fair<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.919> gotta<00:04:23.159> max<00:04:23.550> things<00:04:23.909> out<00:04:24.090> if<00:04:24.270> you

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
fair you gotta max things out if you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.379 
fair you gotta max things out if you
really<00:04:24.479> truly<00:04:24.870> want<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.289> see<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.650> card

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
really truly want to see the card

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.939 
really truly want to see the card
at<00:04:26.479> work<00:04:26.870> okay<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:27.650> here<00:04:28.460> are<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.909> different

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
at work okay so here are the different

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.350 
at work okay so here are the different
resolutions<00:04:30.949> and<00:04:31.219> the<00:04:31.550> frames<00:04:31.789> per<00:04:31.999> second

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
resolutions and the frames per second

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.119 
resolutions and the frames per second
that<00:04:32.389> I've<00:04:32.539> been<00:04:32.629> getting<00:04:32.810> at<00:04:33.169> default<00:04:33.620> clocks

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129 
that I've been getting at default clocks

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.409 
that I've been getting at default clocks
and<00:04:34.400> also<00:04:34.699> some<00:04:35.360> results<00:04:35.960> at<00:04:37.419> overclocked

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
and also some results at overclocked

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.540 
and also some results at overclocked
okay<00:04:39.169> because<00:04:39.349> overclocked<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.189> do<00:04:40.310> get<00:04:40.520> a

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
okay because overclocked you do get a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.070 
okay because overclocked you do get a
few<00:04:40.849> more<00:04:41.029> frames<00:04:41.240> per<00:04:41.509> second<00:04:41.870> obviously

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
few more frames per second obviously

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.379 
few more frames per second obviously
depending<00:04:43.009> on<00:04:43.159> the<00:04:43.279> game<00:04:43.520> you'll<00:04:43.939> get<00:04:44.090> more

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
depending on the game you'll get more

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.390 
depending on the game you'll get more
and<00:04:44.629> other<00:04:44.779> games<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.199> get<00:04:45.319> less<00:04:45.529> okay<00:04:46.189> but

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
and other games you get less okay but

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.189 
and other games you get less okay but
I've<00:04:46.580> tried<00:04:46.819> a<00:04:46.909> different<00:04:47.180> variety<00:04:47.719> of<00:04:47.930> games

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
I've tried a different variety of games

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.600 
I've tried a different variety of games
so<00:04:48.409> that<00:04:48.439> way<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.680> guys<00:04:48.860> can<00:04:48.919> see<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:51.249> the<00:04:52.249> the

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
so that way you guys can see the the the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.029 
so that way you guys can see the the the
frames<00:04:53.180> per<00:04:53.360> second<00:04:53.719> and<00:04:53.900> not<00:04:54.710> just<00:04:54.919> the

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
frames per second and not just the

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.010 
frames per second and not just the
minimum<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.610> max<00:04:55.849> but<00:04:56.150> also<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.870> average

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
minimum in the max but also the average

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.920 
minimum in the max but also the average
which<00:04:57.529> is<00:04:57.650> very<00:04:57.830> important<00:04:58.279> now<00:04:58.930> overclocking

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
which is very important now overclocking

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.070 
which is very important now overclocking
here<00:05:00.439> we<00:05:00.560> got<00:05:00.740> some<00:05:00.979> overclocking<00:05:01.629> using<00:05:02.629> the

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
here we got some overclocking using the

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.809 
here we got some overclocking using the
catalyst<00:05:03.680> control<00:05:04.039> center<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.520> ATI

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
catalyst control center the ATI

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.119 
catalyst control center the ATI
overdrive<00:05:05.389> utility<00:05:05.900> unfortunately<00:05:06.680> was

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
overdrive utility unfortunately was

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.279 
overdrive utility unfortunately was
capped<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.849> you<00:05:08.509> could<00:05:08.659> not<00:05:08.750> overclock<00:05:09.259> it

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
capped and you could not overclock it

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.269 
capped and you could not overclock it
more<00:05:09.590> than<00:05:09.740> 840<00:05:10.490> for<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:10.819> core<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.770> 1325<00:05:12.770> for

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:13.279 
more than 840 for the core and 1325 for

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.629 
more than 840 for the core and 1325 for
the<00:05:13.370> memory<00:05:13.729> so<00:05:14.409> what<00:05:15.409> I<00:05:15.439> did<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:16.009> I<00:05:16.069> install

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
the memory so what I did is I install

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.140 
the memory so what I did is I install
the<00:05:16.819> Sapphire<00:05:17.419> tricks<00:05:18.229> utility<00:05:18.949> instead<00:05:19.430> okay

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
the Sapphire tricks utility instead okay

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.969 
the Sapphire tricks utility instead okay
now<00:05:20.629> keep<00:05:20.930> in<00:05:21.080> mind<00:05:21.289> that<00:05:21.439> now<00:05:21.620> with<00:05:21.800> these<00:05:21.919> new

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
now keep in mind that now with these new

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.850 
now keep in mind that now with these new
cards<00:05:22.849> there's<00:05:23.330> a<00:05:23.419> power<00:05:23.719> tune<00:05:24.020> technology<00:05:24.740> in

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
cards there's a power tune technology in

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.290 
cards there's a power tune technology in
there<00:05:25.069> which<00:05:25.219> is<00:05:25.400> basically<00:05:25.759> a<00:05:25.879> GPU

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
there which is basically a GPU

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.899 
there which is basically a GPU
throttling<00:05:26.960> technique<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:28.400> conserves

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
throttling technique that conserves

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.529 
throttling technique that conserves
energy<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:30.800> know<00:05:30.830> down<00:05:31.610> cores<00:05:32.000> or<00:05:32.300> I

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
energy and you know down cores or I

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.149 
energy and you know down cores or I
shouldn't<00:05:32.810> say<00:05:32.960> down<00:05:33.139> core<00:05:33.379> but<00:05:33.560> just

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
shouldn't say down core but just

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.909 
shouldn't say down core but just
decreases<00:05:34.729> the<00:05:35.089> the<00:05:35.449> GPU<00:05:35.930> utilization<00:05:36.740> and

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
decreases the the GPU utilization and

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.300 
decreases the the GPU utilization and
the<00:05:37.099> maximum<00:05:37.699> I<00:05:37.879> like<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.509> max<00:05:39.289> everything<00:05:39.979> out

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
the maximum I like to max everything out

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.779 
the maximum I like to max everything out
when<00:05:40.879> it<00:05:41.029> comes<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.569> the<00:05:42.379> power<00:05:42.589> tune<00:05:43.009> so<00:05:43.639> that

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
when it comes to the power tune so that

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.820 
when it comes to the power tune so that
way<00:05:43.909> my<00:05:43.939> overclocking<00:05:44.810> does<00:05:44.960> not<00:05:45.169> get

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
way my overclocking does not get

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.570 
way my overclocking does not get
inhibited<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:46.669> here<00:05:47.389> you<00:05:47.509> can<00:05:47.689> see<00:05:47.990> that<00:05:48.580> with
