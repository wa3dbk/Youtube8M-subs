00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.840 
clockwise in this direction but you
could<00:04:00.720> go<00:04:00.870> counterclockwise<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:02.340> can<00:04:02.459> go<00:04:02.610> up

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
could go counterclockwise you can go up

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.770 
could go counterclockwise you can go up
and<00:04:03.060> down<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.989> back<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.440> up<00:04:05.070> etc<00:04:05.340> etc<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.600> you

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
and down and back and up etc etc so you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.270 
and down and back and up etc etc so you
could<00:04:06.930> do<00:04:07.020> all<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.410> variations<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.160> you

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
could do all the variations that you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.490 
could do all the variations that you
want<00:04:08.520> as<00:04:08.670> far<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.910> motion<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:10.320> way<00:04:10.440> you

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
want as far as motion and that way you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.130 
want as far as motion and that way you
can<00:04:10.620> get<00:04:10.770> different<00:04:10.950> sounds<00:04:11.280> out<00:04:11.610> of<00:04:11.670> each<00:04:11.880> one

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
can get different sounds out of each one

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:24.200 
can get different sounds out of each one
sounds<00:04:13.140> like<00:04:13.260> this

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.210 

you<00:04:25.210> can<00:04:25.390> do<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.780> same<00:04:26.020> exact<00:04:26.500> concept<00:04:27.040> an

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
you can do the same exact concept an

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.340 
you can do the same exact concept an
idea<00:04:27.610> but<00:04:28.000> using<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.540> of<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.780> filling<00:04:29.140> in<00:04:29.260> the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
idea but using one of the filling in the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.950 
idea but using one of the filling in the
triplet<00:04:29.770> version<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.570> originally<00:04:31.570> we<00:04:31.690> played

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
triplet version so originally we played

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.870 
triplet version so originally we played
this<00:04:32.320> filling<00:04:32.980> in<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.220> triplet<00:04:33.580> version

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
this filling in the triplet version

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.850 
this filling in the triplet version
where<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.180> bass<00:04:34.360> drum<00:04:34.660> read<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.170> the<00:04:35.620> soon

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
where the bass drum read and the soon

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.350 
where the bass drum read and the soon
and<00:04:36.040> I'm<00:04:36.100> filled<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.640> missing<00:04:36.670> triplets

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
and I'm filled in the missing triplets

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:52.140 
and I'm filled in the missing triplets
and<00:04:37.510> it<00:04:37.570> sounded<00:04:37.900> like<00:04:37.960> this<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.850> go

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
and it sounded like this and you go

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.060 
and it sounded like this and you go
around<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.630> drums<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.290> I'll<00:04:53.740> sound<00:04:53.920> like

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
around the drums and I'll sound like

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:08.380 
around the drums and I'll sound like
this

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.930 

you<00:05:09.390> do<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.840> same<00:05:09.870> thing<00:05:10.350> using<00:05:11.040> natural

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
you do the same thing using natural

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.670 
you do the same thing using natural
reeds<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.480> bass<00:05:12.930> drum<00:05:13.200> fills<00:05:13.470> in<00:05:13.620> the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
reeds and bass drum fills in the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.790 
reeds and bass drum fills in the
triplets<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.610> go<00:05:14.940> counterclockwise<00:05:15.590> you<00:05:16.590> can

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
triplets you go counterclockwise you can

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.400 
triplets you go counterclockwise you can
add<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:20.460> you<00:05:21.180> can<00:05:21.330> go<00:05:21.450> in<00:05:21.600> any<00:05:21.750> motion<00:05:22.260> that

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
add and you can go in any motion that

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:32.690 
add and you can go in any motion that
you<00:05:22.530> like<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:23.070> good<00:05:23.490> motion<00:05:23.880> is<00:05:24.030> this<00:05:31.460> bass<00:05:32.460> drum

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
you like a good motion is this bass drum

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.820 
you like a good motion is this bass drum
plays<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.300> quarter<00:05:33.660> notes<00:05:33.840> some<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.650> room

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
plays the quarter notes some and room

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.440 
plays the quarter notes some and room
fills<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.370> trip<00:05:35.640> into<00:05:35.910> missing

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
fills and the trip into missing

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.240 
fills and the trip into missing
Sharklets<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:37.020> then<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.530> move<00:05:37.710> it<00:05:37.830> around<00:05:37.920> in

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
Sharklets and then you move it around in

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.860 
Sharklets and then you move it around in
that<00:05:38.400> order<00:05:38.670> you<00:05:39.030> get<00:05:39.330> out<00:05:39.450> something<00:05:39.750> like

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
help you understand how to use jazz

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.159 
help you understand how to use jazz
coordination<00:06:06.240> tune<00:06:07.240> in<00:06:07.389> next<00:06:07.509> time<00:06:07.780> when<00:06:07.840> we

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
coordination tune in next time when we

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.170 
coordination tune in next time when we
examine<00:06:08.740> ways<00:06:09.009> that<00:06:09.340> you<00:06:09.460> can<00:06:09.669> learn<00:06:09.879> how<00:06:09.940> to

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
examine ways that you can learn how to

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.020 
examine ways that you can learn how to
phrase<00:06:10.690> your<00:06:11.500> jazz<00:06:11.830> coordination<00:06:12.789> because

phrase your jazz coordination because

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.879 
phrase your jazz coordination because
that's<00:06:13.210> really<00:06:13.569> important<00:06:14.169> this<00:06:14.379> is<00:06:14.560> just<00:06:14.770> a

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
that's really important this is just a

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.790 
that's really important this is just a
nuts-and-bolts<00:06:15.430> of<00:06:15.699> coordinating<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.419> body

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
nuts-and-bolts of coordinating the body

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.469 
nuts-and-bolts of coordinating the body
then<00:06:17.800> you're<00:06:18.009> gonna<00:06:18.129> apply<00:06:18.550> it<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.909> music<00:06:19.090> so

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
then you're gonna apply it to music so

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.800 
then you're gonna apply it to music so
tune<00:06:19.930> in<00:06:20.080> next<00:06:20.169> time<00:06:20.349> Thanks
