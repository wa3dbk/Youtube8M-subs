00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.420
 the piece of bach the cantata is here 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 to get used to the pivot ie 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 change 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:19.110
 the passage of the thumb below you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.550
 remember your back range 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.770
 that's exactly what we're going to work 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.070
 in this track follow the fingerings well 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.470
 that they are indicated they are there for 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.760
 help you to finish the piece 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:39.030
 without finally a fluid way without a hitch 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.460
 so we'll start with just one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.930
 little note before playing note 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.430
 although the chords that are written 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.540
 in a series in France is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.370
 exceptionally but they are not 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.920
 necessarily of good measure it is necessary 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.920
 play them together with the note at 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.510
 above which to go c I chose 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.660
 to write his pieces in this way 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 so that we do not get used to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.009
 always look in agreement at the beginning of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.009
 extent where both so many here it's 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.330
 every three times that there is an agreement 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.080
 so I start on the 1st of May the pot 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.470
 on the back I put the metronome with and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.470
 that I'm going it's a little bit 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.570
 always at 60 so you show them the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.880
 first notes are without agreement the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 first agreement happens only on the 3rd 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 minute 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 Oh 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.780
 no 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 pivot 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270
 all 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.990
 the 106 kg 1 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.060
 who 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.030
 all 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.299
 no 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.299
 all 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 Oh 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.300
 no 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.320
 all 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.320
 for 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.269
 no 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.269
 all 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.360
 so you'll notice that I chose 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.360
 at times a princess of an agreement 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.720
 up down 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.270
 it's a show that 's first 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.190
 its practical aspect since I want 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.220
 always avoid both hands 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.600
 gets confused with each other so if 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.490
 I see that at some point the left hand 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.910
 is likely is too good me I the 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.160
 do an octave cuba that's all 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.770
 just once we know a little 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 better our agreements we can think of 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.190
 a little more logical way 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.420
 turn into the future commander lessons 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.900
 go out another way 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.340
 but for now I confess you enough to 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.250
 know that two things about this 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.900
 piece to finish 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.180
 respect that I wanted 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.520
 already said but it's really important 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.820
 to practice at the pivot and then to 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.910
 the place of the fingers on the keyboard is 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.000
 also there is a note that you are 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.890
 not supposed not necessarily supposed to know 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.620
 in any case there is a serious incident in 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.400
 bleeding below the back we see it the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.620
 second line 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.290
 the third line third measure to 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.670
 every time you believe the third 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.370
 measure begins with a put then y'a 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.819
 a back and after there is so serious and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.439
 so the back was on number 2 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.829
 and so the siggraph is the one of 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.370
 underneath just that's good back 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:08.579
 it's not a big problem but 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.519
 This is not so far that's right the 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.609
 height matters here in height costs 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.120
 it is she who determines the note the name 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.880
 of note 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.310
 height is also his position on the 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.009
 keyboard you will have noticed from any 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.259
 way that the back the one that 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.080
 now I think it's the one that 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.550
 you find the best back, for example 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.849
 the first note of this piece 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.090
 this is the sweet center of the keyboard 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:39.750
 it tells you that all the notes before 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.150
 the back as here the shrink that I that I 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.560
 tell you I'm carrying you 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.289
 your attention above and below 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.000
 why because in the score he 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:52.710
 is lower half who before the back he 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.820
 is on top because he's on the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.919
 partition is the hottest 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.630
 here we have another water in the 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.630
 score cse dolla the back and gu 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.830
 how is it that's not it 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.780
 just because that's not it 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.550
 because he feels not noted of the same 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.450
 way on the score this one is 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.000
 higher than this one so note well 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.270
 this nuance in the in the height of 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.270
 Notes 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.060
 this one can help you also more note 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.920
 plus a note and water on the score 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.080
 the more she'll be on the right of the 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.990
 keyboard but had made you dream 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.340
 always in relation to the basic back 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.350
 the one that is rated one so I was saying in 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.540
 first date of this partition is 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.400
 well the central back of the keyboard for a 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.860
 case via 88 keys they have that the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.640
 fourth of water otherwise it's ludo du 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.640
 simply middle
