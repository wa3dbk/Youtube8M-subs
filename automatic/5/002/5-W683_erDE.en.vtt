00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
Nikon did not make a battery grip for

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.609 
Nikon did not make a battery grip for
this<00:00:14.030> this<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.599> here<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.230> an

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
this this one I have here is an

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.689 
this this one I have here is an
aftermarket<00:00:16.949> brand<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.289> basically<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.710> got

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
aftermarket brand and basically I got

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.220 
aftermarket brand and basically I got
this<00:00:21.650> for<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.070> couple<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> reasons<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.330> for

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this for a couple of reasons one is for

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.060 
this for a couple of reasons one is for
the<00:00:25.350> extra<00:00:25.789> grip<00:00:26.789> you'll<00:00:27.029> get<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.890> will<00:00:28.980> be

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the extra grip you'll get so it will be

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.830 
the extra grip you'll get so it will be
more<00:00:29.250> comfortable<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:30.359> hold<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
more comfortable to hold on to the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.700 
more comfortable to hold on to the
camera<00:00:31.940> because<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.180> Nikon<00:00:33.899> camera<00:00:34.440> itself

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
good camera for why I need it now I'm

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.190 
good camera for why I need it now I'm
going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> take<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> script<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.930> I'll<00:01:06.930> show

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
going to take the script off I'll show

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.090 
going to take the script off I'll show
you<00:01:07.790> what<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.909> looks<00:01:09.060> like

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
you what this looks like

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
you what this looks like
basically<00:01:11.100> there's<00:01:11.760> storage<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
basically there's storage here for the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.340 
basically there's storage here for the
battery<00:01:13.229> flap<00:01:14.750> what<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
battery flap what you do is that you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.899 
battery flap what you do is that you
take<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.159> flap<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> compartment<00:01:19.909> if

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
take the flap out of the compartment if

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.640 
take the flap out of the compartment if
you<00:01:21.030> pull<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.270> 45<00:01:21.840> degrees<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> comes

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you pull it 45 degrees and it comes

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.070 
you pull it 45 degrees and it comes
right<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> store<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
here over on the end here there is a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.890 
here over on the end here there is a
Department<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> battery<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.689> will

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Department for the battery this one will

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.730 
Department for the battery this one will
fit<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.380> en<00:01:34.829> eo9<00:01:35.369> batteries<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.530> want

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
fit to en eo9 batteries or if you want

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.679 
fit to en eo9 batteries or if you want
you<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.130> fit<00:01:38.479> six<00:01:39.479> AAA<00:01:39.750> batteries<00:01:40.579> now<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
you can fit six AAA batteries now in the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.830 
you can fit six AAA batteries now in the
manual<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.409> does<00:01:43.880> mention<00:01:44.880> using<00:01:45.329> regular

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
manual it does mention using regular

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
manual it does mention using regular
alkaline<00:01:46.200> batteries<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> math

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
alkaline batteries if you do the math

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.569 
alkaline batteries if you do the math
for<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> regular<00:01:49.320> alkaline<00:01:49.770> battery<00:01:50.310> that's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
for in regular alkaline battery that's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.660 
for in regular alkaline battery that's
1.5<00:01:51.299> volt<00:01:51.540> times<00:01:51.780> 6<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.399> give<00:01:53.579> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
1.5 volt times 6 and that will give you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
1.5 volt times 6 and that will give you
9<00:01:53.880> volt<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.909> original<00:01:57.200> Engl<00:01:58.200> 9<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.829> 7<00:01:59.399> point<00:01:59.610> 4

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
9 volt the original Engl 9 is 7 point 4

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.510 
9 volt the original Engl 9 is 7 point 4
volt<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:01.979> recommend<00:02:02.369> using

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
volt so I really don't recommend using

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.950 
volt so I really don't recommend using
alkaline<00:02:02.969> batteries<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.750> use

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
alkaline batteries if you use

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
alkaline batteries if you use
rechargeable<00:02:04.880> AAA<00:02:05.880> batteries<00:02:06.649> ok<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
rechargeable AAA batteries ok the a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.119 
rechargeable AAA batteries ok the a
batteries<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.750> rate<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.379> point<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.709> 5<00:02:10.920> volt

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
batteries is rate at one point to 5 volt

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.250 
batteries is rate at one point to 5 volt
times<00:02:12.030> 6

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
times 6

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.429 
times 6
and<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:14.129> will<00:02:14.310> give<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:15.150> 7.5<00:02:15.900> volts<00:02:16.310> so

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
and that will give you like 7.5 volts so

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.179 
and that will give you like 7.5 volts so
that's<00:02:19.439> what<00:02:19.620> I'm<00:02:19.680> using<00:02:19.920> rechargeable

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
that's what I'm using rechargeable

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.780 
that's what I'm using rechargeable
batteries<00:02:20.879> okay<00:02:21.120> basically<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.590> slap<00:02:23.310> slap

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
batteries okay basically you slap slap

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.440 
batteries okay basically you slap slap
the<00:02:24.980> battery<00:02:25.980> grip<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.489> there<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:29.450> bit

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the battery grip in here there is a bit

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.430 
the battery grip in here there is a bit
