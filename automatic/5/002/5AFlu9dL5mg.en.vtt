charging uphill obliques who is helping
me<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.760> test<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> be

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
me with this test is going to be

me with this test is going to be
charging<00:00:19.830> downhill<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.699> will<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.150> pause

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
charging downhill and I will just pause

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.870 
charging downhill and I will just pause
at<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:23.189> point<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.550> impact<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.609> that

at the point of impact you can see that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.599 
at the point of impact you can see that
pretty<00:00:27.359> much<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.689> entire<00:00:28.260> unit<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.010> sent

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
standing here but the better part of the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.440 
standing here but the better part of the
unit<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.170> knocked<00:00:46.530> down<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:47.039> will<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.420> long

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
unit is knocked down I will see how long

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
unit is knocked down I will see how long
it<00:00:48.809> takes<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.620> these<00:00:49.739> Legionnaires<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> get

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it takes for these Legionnaires to get

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.299 
it takes for these Legionnaires to get
back<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:51.379> they<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.410> heavily<00:00:52.739> armored<00:00:53.129> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
back up they are heavily armored so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
back up they are heavily armored so
they're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> use<00:00:53.879> quite<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.420> time

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
they're going to use quite some time

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:05.140 
they're going to use quite some time
getting<00:00:54.930> back<00:00:55.170> up

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.010 

they're<00:01:05.630> starting<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.170> get<00:01:06.440> up<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:08.720> looks

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
they're starting to get up and it looks

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.650 
they're starting to get up and it looks
like<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.530> took<00:01:09.560> these<00:01:10.010> legionaries<00:01:10.760> eight

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
like it took these legionaries eight

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.380 
like it took these legionaries eight
seconds<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.440> get<00:01:12.590> back<00:01:12.770> up<00:01:12.980> so<00:01:13.940> if<00:01:14.120> you<00:01:14.270> are

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
seconds to get back up so if you are

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.530 
seconds to get back up so if you are
charging<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:15.200> with<00:01:15.440> shock<00:01:15.860> cavalry<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.730> might

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
charging in with shock cavalry it might

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.080 
charging in with shock cavalry it might
be<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.840> good<00:01:18.230> idea<00:01:18.320> against<00:01:19.100> very<00:01:19.610> heavy<00:01:19.880> male

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
be a good idea against very heavy male

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.170 
be a good idea against very heavy male
infantry<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:21.410> get<00:01:21.950> in<00:01:22.190> get<00:01:22.580> out<00:01:22.850> after

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
infantry to get in get out after

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.020 
infantry to get in get out after
something<00:01:24.110> like<00:01:24.380> six<00:01:24.650> or<00:01:24.830> seven<00:01:24.860> seconds<00:01:25.490> so

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
something like six or seven seconds so

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.970 
something like six or seven seconds so
you'll<00:01:26.180> be<00:01:26.300> able<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.690> pull<00:01:26.900> out<00:01:27.140> while<00:01:27.650> the

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
you'll be able to pull out while the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.980 
you'll be able to pull out while the
unit<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.340> down<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:28.850> while<00:01:29.150> they<00:01:29.360> are<00:01:29.510> not<00:01:29.690> able

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
unit is down and while they are not able

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.580 
unit is down and while they are not able
to<00:01:30.140> retaliate<00:01:31.720> let's<00:01:32.720> see<00:01:32.870> what<00:01:33.020> happens<00:01:33.380> if

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
to retaliate let's see what happens if

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.580 
to retaliate let's see what happens if
I'm<00:01:34.040> charging<00:01:34.490> uphill<00:01:34.940> they<00:01:35.930> will<00:01:36.110> stay<00:01:36.350> down

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
I'm charging uphill they will stay down

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.910 
I'm charging uphill they will stay down
for<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.040> exact<00:01:37.490> same<00:01:38.300> amount<00:01:38.480> of<00:01:38.780> time<00:01:38.960> but

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
for the exact same amount of time but

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.730 
for the exact same amount of time but
they<00:01:40.220> are<00:01:40.430> going<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.480> think<00:01:41.810> we're<00:01:42.500> going<00:01:42.650> to

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
they are going to I think we're going to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.520 
they are going to I think we're going to
see<00:01:42.980> that<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.990> Legionaries<00:01:44.990> are<00:01:45.110> not<00:01:45.290> going

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
see that the Legionaries are not going

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.010 
see that the Legionaries are not going
to<00:01:45.770> be<00:01:45.950> knocked<00:01:46.760> down<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.210> such<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> significant

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
to be knocked down to such a significant

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.260 
to be knocked down to such a significant
degree<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.040> here<00:01:49.190> we<00:01:49.280> go<00:01:49.430> for<00:01:49.820> ranks<00:01:50.090> deep

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
degree so here we go for ranks deep

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.980 
degree so here we go for ranks deep
braced<00:01:52.240> posting<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.480> point<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:53.810> maximum

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
braced posting at the point of maximum

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.170 
braced posting at the point of maximum
impact<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.190> you<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.430> see<00:01:55.580> there<00:01:55.760> are<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:55.940> lot

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
impact so you can see there are a lot

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.460 
impact so you can see there are a lot
more<00:01:56.210> legionaries<00:01:57.020> left<00:01:57.290> standing<00:01:57.830> here<00:01:58.240> a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
more legionaries left standing here a

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.050 
more legionaries left standing here a
significant<00:02:00.470> amount<00:02:00.680> more<00:02:01.040> than<00:02:01.400> what<00:02:01.730> we<00:02:01.910> saw

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
significant amount more than what we saw

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.280 
significant amount more than what we saw
in<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.390> previous<00:02:03.130> instance<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.420> charges<00:02:06.020> up

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
in the previous instance so charges up

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.230 
in the previous instance so charges up
hill<00:02:06.500> are<00:02:06.680> going<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.100> be<00:02:07.250> less<00:02:07.550> effective<00:02:08.060> in

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
hill are going to be less effective in

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.199 
hill are going to be less effective in
knocking<00:02:08.600> down<00:02:08.780> enemy<00:02:09.709> units<00:02:10.010> still<00:02:10.820> going<00:02:11.060> to

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
knocking down enemy units still going to

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.820 
knocking down enemy units still going to
knock<00:02:11.390> down<00:02:11.600> with<00:02:11.870> heavy<00:02:12.050> shock<00:02:12.320> very<00:02:12.650> heavy

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
knock down with heavy shock very heavy

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.110 
knock down with heavy shock very heavy
shock<00:02:13.040> cover<00:02:13.220> it's<00:02:13.430> still<00:02:13.640> going<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.880> knock

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
shock cover it's still going to knock

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.820 
shock cover it's still going to knock
down<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.360> significant<00:02:15.020> amount<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.470> enemy

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
down a significant amount of enemy

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.260 
down a significant amount of enemy
troops<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.880> nothing<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:18.110> what<00:02:18.380> we<00:02:18.590> saw<00:02:18.800> in

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
troops but nothing like what we saw in

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.580 
troops but nothing like what we saw in
the<00:02:20.270> downhill<00:02:20.510> charge<00:02:20.989> against<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the downhill charge against the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.430 
the downhill charge against the
legionary<00:02:21.950> cohort<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.450> some<00:02:23.989> people<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.410> to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
legionary cohort so some people like to

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.920 
legionary cohort so some people like to
keep<00:02:24.709> their<00:02:24.770> short<00:02:25.130> cavalry<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.640> for<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.450> bit<00:02:26.780> of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
keep their short cavalry in for a bit of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.199 
keep their short cavalry in for a bit of
time<00:02:27.140> after<00:02:27.590> they<00:02:27.709> have<00:02:27.830> charged<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:28.310> this<00:02:28.970> can

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
time after they have charged in this can

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.850 
time after they have charged in this can
be<00:02:29.360> done<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:29.720> cataphracts<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.530> problem

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
be done with cataphracts but the problem

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.860 
be done with cataphracts but the problem
is<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.040> short<00:02:31.970> cavalry<00:02:32.270> units<00:02:32.570> like<00:02:32.660> this

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
is that short cavalry units like this

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.410 
is that short cavalry units like this
that<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.350> 60<00:02:33.830> armor<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.820> believe<00:02:35.300> they

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that have 60 armor and I believe they

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.680 
that have 60 armor and I believe they
have<00:02:35.540> less<00:02:35.750> than<00:02:35.989> 20<00:02:36.730> melih<00:02:37.730> defense<00:02:38.150> they're

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
have less than 20 melih defense they're

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.020 
have less than 20 melih defense they're
going<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.020> get<00:02:39.110> hit<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.470> lot<00:02:39.500> by<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.400> units<00:02:40.850> that

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
going to get hit a lot by the units that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.449 
going to get hit a lot by the units that
get<00:02:41.180> back<00:02:41.390> up<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:42.200> charging<00:02:42.830> them<00:02:42.980> down<00:02:43.160> and

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
get back up so charging them down and

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.280 
get back up so charging them down and
pulling<00:02:43.670> back<00:02:43.880> out<00:02:44.090> can<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.570> very<00:02:45.050> effective

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
pulling back out can be a very effective

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.949 
pulling back out can be a very effective
way<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.680> destroying<00:02:46.360> enemy<00:02:47.360> infantry<00:02:47.570> units

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
way of destroying enemy infantry units

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.270 
way of destroying enemy infantry units
without<00:02:48.790> taking<00:02:49.790> many<00:02:50.180> casualties<00:02:50.769> so<00:02:51.769> keep

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
without taking many casualties so keep

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.300 
without taking many casualties so keep
in<00:02:52.400> mind<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.880> will<00:02:53.030> take<00:02:53.090> very<00:02:53.360> heavy

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
in mind that it will take very heavy

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.940 
in mind that it will take very heavy
many<00:02:55.310> inventory<00:02:55.900> eight<00:02:56.900> seconds<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.769> get<00:02:57.920> up
