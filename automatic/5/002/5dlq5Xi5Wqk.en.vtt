00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.200
 ingredients that we are going to use to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.789
 our revenue 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.990
 are three cups of rice meats and stew 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.619
 and shredded at will at will and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.439
 meat into very small pieces of carrots 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.350
 half a tomato will chopped without seed 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.680
 two tablespoons of green-smelling 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.379
 half onion, chopped into small pieces 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.809

 tpi of one teaspoon powdered flavor 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.690
 meat and two tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.379
 these are the ingredients we 're going to use 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.629
 for our today's recipe in a pan 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.620
 on the low fire we'll put the olive oil 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.309
 olive 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.500
 We are going to put in the luggage. 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.940
 we put the pod first because it 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.940
 it takes longer to braise 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 She establishes people like this but she 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.119
 it's forbidden 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.619
 It's a tip I learned many years ago. 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.270
 with my grandmother 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.810
 if you want it to be close 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.090
 so you get the glass of hot water 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.020
 put a pinch of bicarbonate of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.720
 Sodium throws over the dam 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.680
 before it led to advocate 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.020
 she retains coverage we put the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.840
 pod first it 's harder it takes 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 more cooking but here few 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.780
 aubert 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.970

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.049

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.829

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:23.489
 we put the chopped onion to cooked load 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.069
 and shredded and you do not have the dried meat 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:32.780

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.780
