roblox<00:00:12.719> ama<00:00:12.990> we've<00:00:13.830> decided<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.759> best

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
roblox ama we've decided that the best

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.640 
roblox ama we've decided that the best
option<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.780> sit<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> Warlock

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
option is to just sit on the Warlock

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.410 
option is to just sit on the Warlock
because<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.279> switch<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.180> much

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
because if you switch it all you do much

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.720 
because if you switch it all you do much
less<00:00:18.630> damage<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.920> don't<00:00:20.070> die<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
less damage and they don't die it and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.939 
less damage and they don't die it and
eventually<00:00:20.910> your<00:00:21.240> shaman<00:00:21.480> named<00:00:22.439> Yoli<00:00:22.740> out

and warlock is still on the bottom so

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
and warlock is still on the bottom so

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
out of the box on the other side so we

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.620 
out of the box on the other side so we
can't<00:01:55.950> lead<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.250> Suzie<00:01:57.090> comes<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.570> a

on<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.340> hunter<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.360> we're<00:02:00.600> able<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.930> some

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
on my hunter so we're able to do some

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
on my hunter so we're able to do some
damage<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.619> he's<00:02:01.920> gonna<00:02:02.009> port<00:02:02.280> again<00:02:02.460> because

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
damage but he's gonna port again because

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.319 
damage but he's gonna port again because
they<00:02:02.939> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.180> poured<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.570> cooldown

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
they kind of just poured on cooldown

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.880 
they kind of just poured on cooldown
because<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.479> clears<00:02:06.689> slows<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.740> makes

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
because it clears slows so that makes

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
because it clears slows so that makes
some<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.489> GC<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.879> completely<00:02:09.239> worthless<00:02:09.390> he

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
jumped off again so there's no reason to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
jumped off again so there's no reason to
