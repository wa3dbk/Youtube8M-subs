 be beneficial in another respect 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.560
 in the fight against obesity 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.149
 cardiologist Gustavo Orozco accompanies us from Mexico City with 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.240
 the data that have come red bulls tell us 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.770
 a mercedes pleasure 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.960
 the food to the maternal breast has been 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 a great propaganda like disease prevention but never like AIDS 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.680
 province and pantyhose can be prevented by the quality of the milk that consumes 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.580
 that baby 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.620
 so we can program children to health not to disease 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.120
 there are two fats that are important in the breast milk and the dh a 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.770
 those foods the mother can not ingest during pregnancy and lactation and 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.550
 transfer them to milk and then program the brain to form a brain 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.140
 new that is not mature in newborns 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 towards satiety 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.180
 doctor ekin 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.700
 it is stated that the false to breastfeeding recommends how long it should last 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.580
 there are people who believe that in three months it is enough if six months 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.560
 one year 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.810
 what is the recommendation for what 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 this kid 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 in the future do not be obese 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.750
 decimals studies speak 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.440
 that we require a minimum of six months of 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.420
 feeding the mother's womb 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.910
 and the most two and a half years like the Eskimos 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.460
 the storm elemente the Latino community consume very little amount of milk 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.200
 maternally less than three thousand subjects prolong one the time of breastfeeding 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.980
 This is of quality 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.400
 and take a lot of liquor for other foods other than milk 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.219
 less chances I have my city at the age of four or twelve years 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.059
 so the best thing will be that they go from pregnancy and lactation 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.099
 consume nutrients rich invest dh aa 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.059
 since this produces a protein 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.419
 fifa to the brain of the child daza city 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.269
 and in turn the child produces a protein that goes to the mother 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.339
 the delicate matinee after finishing the truth 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.909
 that's very interesting what doctor orozco is saying 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.890
 because when it started 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.960
 they say other foods 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.350
 Many mothers stop breastfeeding 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.350
 you can combine both 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:45.799
 Yes actually 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.619
 the ideal would be 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:52.059
 prolong breastfeeding as much as possible but being 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:56.819
 fed well the mother indeed in germany there are breast milk banks of 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.129
 good quality 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.409
 that put premature rings 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.549
 where this will prolong the time to start another food other than the 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.239
 milk 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.879
 facilitates the development of the child according to robust strong child but not 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:12.819
 obese 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.269
 doing that at the age of four or six years the spar the case of the case the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.959
 mother but the most important thing we want scientifically discovered 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.999
 and that is that we form the child's brain 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.999
 the first 14 days my extrauterine life 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:33.189
