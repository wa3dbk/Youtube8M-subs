00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.660 
get cheeky in there he will fit if I if
I<00:02:53.660> closed<00:02:53.989> it<00:02:54.170> up<00:02:54.290> he'd<00:02:54.590> be<00:02:54.620> okay<00:02:55.340> he<00:02:55.640> just

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
I closed it up he'd be okay he just

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.070 
I closed it up he'd be okay he just
wouldn't<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> lot<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.480> room<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.930> move

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
wouldn't have a lot of room to move

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.790 
wouldn't have a lot of room to move
around<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:59.590> it<00:03:00.590> could<00:03:00.830> work<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.250> fine<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:02.800> I

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
around so it could work just fine but I

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.220 
around so it could work just fine but I
probably<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.060> was<00:03:05.239> taking<00:03:05.690> him<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.930> long

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
probably if I was taking him on a long

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.310 
probably if I was taking him on a long
car<00:03:06.620> ride<00:03:06.650> for<00:03:07.160> example<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.880> wouldn't<00:03:09.250> do<00:03:11.320> hey

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
car ride for example I wouldn't do hey

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.610 
car ride for example I wouldn't do hey
yeah<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:13.209> probably<00:03:14.209> wouldn't<00:03:14.900> choose<00:03:15.290> this

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
yeah I probably wouldn't choose this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.890 
yeah I probably wouldn't choose this
carrier<00:03:16.070> just<00:03:16.310> because<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:16.940> kind<00:03:17.810> of

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
carrier just because it's kind of

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.650 
carrier just because it's kind of
compact<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.640> don't<00:03:20.030> know<00:03:20.180> if<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.480> fits

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
compact but I don't know if it fits

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.840 
compact but I don't know if it fits
airline<00:03:21.260> regulations<00:03:21.980> or<00:03:22.130> not<00:03:22.280> but<00:03:22.670> this

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
airline regulations or not but this

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.550 
airline regulations or not but this
would<00:03:23.030> be<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> good<00:03:23.360> one<00:03:23.570> for<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.140> airline

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
would be a good one for the airline

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.180 
would be a good one for the airline
because<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.250> has<00:03:25.700> these<00:03:25.910> see-through<00:03:26.480> pockets

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
because it has these see-through pockets

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.370 
because it has these see-through pockets
and<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.400> has<00:03:28.610> all<00:03:29.480> these<00:03:29.780> little<00:03:29.989> different

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
and it has all these little different

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.140 
and it has all these little different
compartments<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.100> store<00:03:31.340> stuff<00:03:31.459> oh<00:03:31.880> that's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
compartments to store stuff oh that's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.940 
compartments to store stuff oh that's
that<00:03:32.269> you<00:03:32.420> can<00:03:32.570> get<00:03:32.690> them<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:32.959> there<00:03:33.200> that's

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
that you can get them in there that's

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.520 
that you can get them in there that's
great<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.820> needed<00:03:35.600> one<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.810> those<00:03:35.959> when<00:03:36.200> Charlie

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
and Trevor come at home it's not as

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.539 
and Trevor come at home it's not as
flimsy<00:03:40.220> as<00:03:40.489> other<00:03:40.940> carriers<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.890> I'm<00:03:43.220> excited

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
flimsy as other carriers so I'm excited

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.590 
flimsy as other carriers so I'm excited
to<00:03:43.760> explore<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.630> one<00:03:44.840> with<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.079> kiddies
