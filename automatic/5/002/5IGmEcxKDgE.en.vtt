BCAA<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.060> take<00:02:00.299> BCAAs<00:02:00.810> intra<00:02:01.290> workout<00:02:01.320> which

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
BCAA so I take BCAAs intra workout which

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
BCAA so I take BCAAs intra workout which
means<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.250> take<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:02.969> working<00:02:03.119> out

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
means I take them as I'm working out

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
means I take them as I'm working out
basically<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.770> BCAAs<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.759> good<00:02:05.939> or

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
basically what BCAAs are good or

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.999 
basically what BCAAs are good or
branched<00:02:06.420> chain<00:02:06.719> amino<00:02:06.930> acids<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.649> good<00:02:07.799> for

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
branched chain amino acids are good for

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.339 
branched chain amino acids are good for
is<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.700> decrease<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> rate<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.869> perceived

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
is they decrease the rate to perceived

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.780 
is they decrease the rate to perceived
exertion<00:02:10.560> which<00:02:11.099> means

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
exertion which means

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
exertion which means
if<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.569> very<00:02:12.989> intense<00:02:13.319> workout

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
if you have a very intense workout

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.449 
if you have a very intense workout
planned<00:02:14.599> great<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.930> great<00:02:16.200> way<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.590> sustain

planned great a great way to sustain

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.490 
planned great a great way to sustain
energy<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:18.060> little<00:02:18.299> bit<00:02:18.420> longer<00:02:18.599> so<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.079> love<00:02:19.349> my

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
energy a little bit longer so I love my

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.610 
energy a little bit longer so I love my
BCAAs<00:02:20.150> right<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> don't<00:02:21.810> always<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.409> this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
BCAAs right now I don't always take this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.479 
BCAAs right now I don't always take this
this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.069> C<00:02:23.459> okay<00:02:23.849> or<00:02:24.299> CLA<00:02:25.079> which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.829> a<00:02:25.860> kanji

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
this is C okay or CLA which is a kanji

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.819 
this is C okay or CLA which is a kanji
I'm<00:02:26.939> gonna<00:02:27.120> butcher<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.829> conjugated

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
I'm gonna butcher this conjugated

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.350 
I'm gonna butcher this conjugated
linoleic<00:02:29.010> acid<00:02:30.079> it's<00:02:31.079> great<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:32.280> gray<00:02:32.610> how

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
linoleic acid it's great it's gray how

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.600 
linoleic acid it's great it's gray how
am<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.510> gonna<00:02:33.629> explain<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:35.129> keeps<00:02:35.400> you

am I gonna explain this so it keeps you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.250 
am I gonna explain this so it keeps you
lean<00:02:35.819> alright<00:02:36.329> in<00:02:36.510> other<00:02:36.629> words<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.079> it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
lean alright in other words it's it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.819 
lean alright in other words it's it
promotes<00:02:38.120> lean<00:02:39.120> body<00:02:39.450> mass<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:40.709> this

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
promotes lean body mass and so in this

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.309 
promotes lean body mass and so in this
one<00:02:41.010> there's<00:02:41.280> some<00:02:41.519> raspberry<00:02:41.849> ketones<00:02:42.319> and

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
one there's some raspberry ketones and

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.619 
one there's some raspberry ketones and
some<00:02:43.739> quarantine<00:02:44.220> which<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.579> also<00:02:44.700> very<00:02:45.329> good

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
some quarantine which are also very good

some quarantine which are also very good
very<00:02:46.530> good<00:02:46.650> properties<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.370> lean<00:02:47.640> muscle

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
very good properties for lean muscle

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.599 
very good properties for lean muscle

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
taking that I don't always take that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.479 
taking that I don't always take that
these<00:02:52.200> other<00:02:52.349> things<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.799> always<00:02:53.190> pretty

so I haven't you see the seal still on
it<00:02:58.019> because<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.889> my<00:02:59.370> carb<00:02:59.670> cycle<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.239> getting

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
it because of my carb cycle and getting

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.300 
it because of my carb cycle and getting
into<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.900> sort<00:03:01.139> of<00:03:01.260> bodybuilding<00:03:01.889> thing<00:03:02.129> I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
into this sort of bodybuilding thing I

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.640 
into this sort of bodybuilding thing I
was<00:03:02.819> recommended<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.810> took<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.139> one<00:03:04.379> time

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
was recommended this I took it one time

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.140 
was recommended this I took it one time
a<00:03:04.680> friend<00:03:05.129> gave<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.370> me<00:03:05.430> one<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:05.909> after

pumps like pump City for sure so anxious
to<00:03:14.220> implement<00:03:14.940> more<00:03:15.299> of<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.680> protein<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.980> I

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
to implement more of this protein so I

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.009 
to implement more of this protein so I
cycle<00:03:17.760> between<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> few<00:03:18.299> different<00:03:18.359> proteins

my own line and and that'll be called

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.430 
my own line and and that'll be called
primal<00:03:24.000> body<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.480> will<00:03:24.629> be<00:03:24.750> an<00:03:25.139> all-natural

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
primal body which will be an all-natural

primal body which will be an all-natural
grass<00:03:25.859> fed<00:03:26.040> whey<00:03:26.280> that's<00:03:26.609> what<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:26.849> stick<00:03:27.239> to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
grass fed whey that's what I stick to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.280 
grass fed whey that's what I stick to
again<00:03:28.699> this<00:03:29.699> is<00:03:29.940> an<00:03:30.060> all-natural<00:03:30.299> way<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
again this is an all-natural way you

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.360 
again this is an all-natural way you
know<00:03:31.379> I<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:31.560> there's<00:03:31.769> like<00:03:31.859> six<00:03:32.190> or<00:03:32.340> seven

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
know I think there's like six or seven

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.220 
know I think there's like six or seven
