00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.750
 what is the right age to start 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:15.509
 weight lifting weight it does not 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.580
 stop the growth of children and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.600
 adolescents in the growth phase 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.600
 still no aspect of any're way 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.359
 if you then sees a stocky quietly in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.960
 street was already going to be below any 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.780
 because it is not the sport that defines 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 the size you will get actually 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.540
 sport chooses the sizes 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.750
 that they will get better at it for example the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 football is a pretty sport 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.950
 democratic being that you are either tall or 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.079
 down if you have a good level of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.719
 ability you will get out well 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.570
 different from volleyball by 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.210
 example sports that are more 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 tall a very low guy playing 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.410
 basketball has to have a level of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.760
 very impressive skill to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.899
 get well in the middle 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.510
 professional 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.090
 these sports that I named as soccer 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.360
 basketball the very race they are 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.430
 infinitely more harmful with 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.369
 growth of a person than the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.340
 why bodybuilding because 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.810
 she has no impact they do not have falls or 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.810
 at least you should not 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.620
 In this stolen this pump can make 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620
 gas 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.950
 provided that none of these 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.109
 terrible accidents in your gym 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.709
 Yes, you can practice bodybuilding. 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:02.009
 not only have traction and the 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.170
 impact the breaks they are 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.009
 far more damaging than growth 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.379
 reveals a year saying that the child or 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.400
 teenager does the growth then 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.390
 train if 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.349
 but it is not good to train very heavy what 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.640
 it's very heavy a very heavy 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.700
 defined is only one thing 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.760
 limiting the weight is good technique 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.280
 execution of the exercise that is well done 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.590
 there is not too much weight 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.510
 when you put too much weight on and start 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.849
 to make things tart starts to 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.269
 use other muscle groups 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.450
 who are not the target to raise the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.209
 same charge you undo a good standard of 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.849
 movement is at this time that we know 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.310
 which has more charge and while it does not have 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.290
 load plus the movement is well done is 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.299
 so the end works 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.639
 then if the child can screw 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.530
 with 100 kilograms on each side 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.790
 maintaining a technique of execution 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.430
 proper 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.829
 It's quite difficult but beauty can make a 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.829
 There is no problem so always 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.880
 limiting load is the good way to 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.430
 execution 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.650
 My personal opinion is that child 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.599
 I did not have to do weight training, not me. 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.450
 I think there are other things too 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.989
 most important legal experiences 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.269
 motor and social experiences of the child 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.000
 or adolescent has to have that phase 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.579
 then in bodybuilding, do not fight with 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.970
 one does not reach anyone at the cut jumps 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.940
 do not get hurt, and in soccer 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.919
 basketball volleyball various other sports 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.310
 there is a greater variety of 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.750
 movements a greater variety of 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.620
 social situations which is very 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.769
 interesting 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.709
 development of the person now who is going 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.620
 solve if this is the coolest thing in the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.730
 world is going to do is not you are not the father 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.170
 it's not the mother 's own child like it 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.450
 each has its own 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.409
 beauty thanks to the guys 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.409
