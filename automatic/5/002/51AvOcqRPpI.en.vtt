them<00:03:52.280> after<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.880> but<00:03:53.090> with<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.600> microsd

them after that but with that microsd
expansion<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.830> probably<00:03:55.280> shouldn't<00:03:55.520> be<00:03:55.580> too

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
expansion it probably shouldn't be too

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.760 
expansion it probably shouldn't be too

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
much of a problem the device itself

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.380 
much of a problem the device itself
though<00:03:58.100> it's<00:03:58.310> pretty<00:03:58.670> good<00:03:58.790> i've<00:03:59.000> had<00:03:59.240> no

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
though it's pretty good i've had no

issues with performance the speakers are

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.280 
issues with performance the speakers are
pretty<00:04:01.160> good<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.730> even<00:04:02.630> though<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.840> have

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
pretty good on it even though you have

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.810 
pretty good on it even though you have
those<00:04:03.470> dual<00:04:03.800> speakers<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.610> would<00:04:04.700> think

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
those dual speakers you would think

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.030 
those dual speakers you would think
would<00:04:05.060> be<00:04:05.240> really<00:04:05.450> amazing<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.620> i<00:04:06.740> would<00:04:06.860> say

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
would be really amazing and i would say

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.590 
would be really amazing and i would say
it's<00:04:07.190> good<00:04:07.340> but<00:04:07.520> they're<00:04:07.670> little<00:04:07.970> tinny<00:04:08.390> they

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
it's good but they're little tinny they

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.730 
it's good but they're little tinny they
don't<00:04:08.870> have<00:04:08.959> too<00:04:09.140> much<00:04:09.260> bass<00:04:09.530> or

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
don't have too much bass or

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.650 
don't have too much bass or
reverberation<00:04:10.459> with<00:04:10.610> them<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.270> button<00:04:11.570> on

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
reverberation with them the button on

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.390 
reverberation with them the button on
top<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:12.080> good<00:04:12.290> there<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.740> you<00:04:12.950> can<00:04:13.070> see<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.310> the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
top is good there and you can see in the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400 
top is good there and you can see in the
bottom<00:04:13.730> here<00:04:13.910> this<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.240> big<00:04:14.420> deal<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:15.050> do<00:04:15.230> have

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
bottom here this is big deal you do have

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.020 
bottom here this is big deal you do have
the<00:04:15.470> capacitive<00:04:16.190> button<00:04:16.459> which<00:04:16.730> can<00:04:16.910> also

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
the capacitive button which can also

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.330 
the capacitive button which can also
wake<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.630> device<00:04:17.930> it's<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.680> pretty<00:04:18.980> solid

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
wake up the device it's a pretty solid

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.330 
wake up the device it's a pretty solid
button<00:04:19.910> but<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.660> find<00:04:21.590> sometimes<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.040> doesn't

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
button but I find sometimes it doesn't

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.550

pretty<00:04:47.270> nice<00:04:47.600> my<00:04:47.810> big<00:04:47.960> complaint<00:04:48.170> like<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.470> said

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
pretty nice my big complaint like I said

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.050 
pretty nice my big complaint like I said
it's<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.830> little<00:04:49.280> bit<00:04:49.400> thicker<00:04:49.610> than<00:04:49.880> other

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
it's a little bit thicker than other

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.120 
it's a little bit thicker than other
devices<00:04:50.390> but<00:04:50.750> because<00:04:51.080> it's<00:04:51.260> curved<00:04:51.650> it's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
devices but because it's curved it's

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.160 
devices but because it's curved it's
actually<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.550> little<00:04:52.760> bit<00:04:53.030> shorter<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:54.110> way

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
actually a little bit shorter that way

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.790 
actually a little bit shorter that way
so<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:55.130> actually<00:04:55.370> feels<00:04:55.640> good<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.120> hold<00:04:56.450> I<00:04:56.870> have

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
so it actually feels good to hold I have

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
anything it's just a black screen that's

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.800 
anything it's just a black screen that's

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
for the rear camera I'm not sure maybe a

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.420 
for the rear camera I'm not sure maybe a
software<00:05:12.260> bug<00:05:12.380> maybe<00:05:12.770> something<00:05:13.040> my<00:05:13.160> device

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
software bug maybe something my device

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.460 
software bug maybe something my device
it<00:05:13.670> works<00:05:13.820> other<00:05:14.030> times<00:05:14.330> video<00:05:14.720> works<00:05:14.990> well<00:05:15.230> to

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
it works other times video works well to

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.560 
it works other times video works well to
the<00:05:16.040> front<00:05:16.280> facing<00:05:16.640> camera<00:05:16.970> is<00:05:17.000> also<00:05:17.390> pretty

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
the front facing camera is also pretty

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.410 
the front facing camera is also pretty
decent<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.170> 2<00:05:18.350> megapixel<00:05:18.790> but<00:05:19.790> I<00:05:19.820> will<00:05:19.970> say<00:05:20.180> this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
decent a 2 megapixel but I will say this

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.840 
decent a 2 megapixel but I will say this
it<00:05:20.780> performs<00:05:21.290> very<00:05:21.620> well<00:05:21.710> in<00:05:22.100> low<00:05:22.340> light<00:05:22.640> in

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
it performs very well in low light in

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.790 
it performs very well in low light in
the<00:05:22.970> sense<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.600> can<00:05:23.870> actually<00:05:24.080> see<00:05:24.290> the

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
the sense that you can actually see the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.670 
the sense that you can actually see the
image<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.700> will<00:05:25.760> be<00:05:26.030> highly<00:05:26.480> noisy<00:05:27.110> but<00:05:27.500> when<00:05:27.650> I

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
image it will be highly noisy but when I

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.980 
image it will be highly noisy but when I
compared<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.310> other<00:05:28.460> tablets<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.840> get

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
compared to the other tablets you get

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.710 
compared to the other tablets you get
visible<00:05:30.830> highly<00:05:31.250> noise<00:05:31.460> or<00:05:31.880> you<00:05:32.330> got<00:05:32.510> not

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
visible highly noise or you got not

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.710 
visible highly noise or you got not
visible<00:05:33.050> at<00:05:33.170> all<00:05:33.320> with<00:05:33.800> no<00:05:34.070> noise<00:05:34.490> so<00:05:34.790> it's<00:05:35.570> a

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
visible at all with no noise so it's a

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.180 
visible at all with no noise so it's a
pretty<00:05:35.930> interesting<00:05:36.140> camera<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:36.800> toshiba

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
pretty interesting camera so toshiba

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.160 
pretty interesting camera so toshiba

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
seems to have done a pre decent job with

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.040 
seems to have done a pre decent job with
it<00:05:39.200> other<00:05:40.190> than<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.550> though<00:05:40.930> respects<00:05:41.930> it

it other than that though respects it

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.780 
it other than that though respects it
very<00:05:42.200> similar<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.590> other<00:05:42.770> 8-inch<00:05:43.250> devices

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
very similar to other 8-inch devices

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
is coming that micro HDMI which I'll

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.090 
is coming that micro HDMI which I'll
give<00:05:47.540> it<00:05:47.660> a<00:05:47.720> spin<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:47.990> see<00:05:48.290> how<00:05:48.440> well<00:05:48.620> it<00:05:48.680> works

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
give it a spin to see how well it works

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.850 
give it a spin to see how well it works
but<00:05:50.030> other<00:05:50.210> than<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.390> the<00:05:51.080> back<00:05:51.380> is<00:05:51.650> also

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
