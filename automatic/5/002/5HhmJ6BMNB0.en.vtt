00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi youtube hi community 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.050
 today's video is quite 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.179
 experimental in my opinion let's say 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.820
 so experience is for me in some way 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:22.460
 In general, the first thing that I ever life 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:25.939
 I did but what I want to do something 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.279
 question-answer list 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.070
 to be more clear, I will try 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.670
 little old man start then the channel was 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.890
 small when the channel was not very 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.420
 many subscribers I made my videos off 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 I had the opportunity to respond 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 almost all comments are at 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.600
 least there were questions but as they grew 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.930
 the channel is now more than four thousand 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.399
 subscribers it is of course very nice but 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.610
 it leaves a certain mark 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.920
 the form of a very large information 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.210
 flow that comes to me with 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.220
 comments cream with skype mail 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 from anywhere 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.810
 Naturally all questions are not answered 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.750
 I can and the first because on it simply 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.159
 There is no time in the second because 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.180
 let's say in the same form 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.799
 comments explain something we just 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.450
 pretty hard yes that is what you 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.280
 can you say three words sometimes 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.790
 you have to describe 20 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.650
 sentences and it turns out 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.630
 a situation that is not very strong for me 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.310
 like 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.250
 It turns out if smith previously compiled 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.380
 you know how would a guy star nuza yeah there 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.400
 or followers you are so cool that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.240
 even when on the lab 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 and in fact i'm sometimes trying to somehow 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 video answer to maximum 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.780
 number of comments , squeezed as 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 the lemon after that, that is, I already have not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.150
 that not enough time is even harder 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.190
 the situation with them that is when he or 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.760
 kit simple questions i will try on 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.760
 them to answer 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.000
 and sometimes they send email and where people like 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.890
 would 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 Thank you for doing something that is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 you make it cool it's very nice 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.390
 but sometimes give it happens but not on 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.000
 A4 sheets and read you need to understand 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.520
 time you need to change lan always daughter 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.620
 who are you doing now for what 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.320
 to answer man naturally is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.970
 not enough time nor energy 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.640
 All this leads to the fact that for example 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.970
 is it not easy here is liquid methane hall 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.720
 g10 stylus of them cast 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.570
 nobunaga candle 10 Damascus caste itself 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.840
 In general, the story is separate there in fact 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.270
 deed the purpose associated with it is easier for you 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.310
 The bones of my home subscriber are already pretty 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.890
 long ago and in principle she sharpened too 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.989
 test hands do not reach that is 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 I basically do not particularly annoyed 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.760
 the moment that I have some of our days 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.450
 did what some don't even do 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.770
 reviews that resemble and i never 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.530
 read a review of useful 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.500
 father's a blogger because any man is 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.100
 only his opinion what god was 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 and secondly, the review will start to show something 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.750
 there is roughly speaking let's say too 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.250
 Top-most skim it may be packagings 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.310
 because let's say so some kind of steel not 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.440
 I know there are there who are roughly there 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.350
 garage wall tries daeman through 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.390
 It will be despite the fact that the rest is cool 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.280
 or vice versa, how can it be very 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.500
 interesting leaving a good term but when 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.200
 this is his some say so controversial 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000
 forms they will be compensated by this 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.700
 I think with you no matter what they may be 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.390
 any not indicative reviews not 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.920
 so 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.870
 and that's the moment when I stopped 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.560
 have enough time to do the test and 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.080
 so many reviews i started thinking about 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.060
 tom how would i fix this situation 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.500
 how would i get out of this situation with 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.230
 some minimal losses 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.570
 carry with it the opportunity 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.440
 how to ask people what is not 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.930
 I want nothing better than 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.580
 of what I am offering now in this video I 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.650
 I suggest to leave under this video 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.130
 comments with questions what questions are you 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.850
 would like to ask me a click on knives 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.690
 sharpening anything i am in a week 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.770
 accordingly all these questions are similar and 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.650
 I will try to make a video in which 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.550
 I will answer most or all if 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.320
 there will be little good too naturally 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.360
 I will give priority 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.180
 issues related to knives and for 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.070
 handjob and naturally more priority 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.490
 attention will be paid to that question 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.099
 as 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.639
 were let's say so demanded to people then 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.009
 there is 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.830
 sought after and that is when you 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.690
 click on the button like that 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.229
 there is a video like joining this 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.900
 the subject 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.830
 accordingly, it will be displayed 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.520
 accordingly these questions were in 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.370
 priority 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.900
 if any topic will be in demand 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.849
 pretty much and I think that for her 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.940
 it is not enough just to casually mention 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.009
 or somehow consider but short 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.889
 time span i build a separate 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.599
 video on this thing I once again i understand not 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.909
 I had what it will pour out but in my opinion 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.139
 it is at least enough for me 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.470
 good exit 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:20.970
 to and still help people as far as 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.830
 it is possible and at the same time let's say no 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.530
 turn youtube into full life 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.120
 which when for which she took 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.870
 Thank you for watching 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.870
 the struggle is that
