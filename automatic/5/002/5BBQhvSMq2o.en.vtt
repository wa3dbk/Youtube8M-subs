has somehow actually managed to make the
controls<00:01:08.720> work<00:01:08.990> better<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.710> think<00:01:10.009> than<00:01:10.340> they

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
controls work better I think than they

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.880 
controls work better I think than they
did<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.940> ps2<00:01:11.180> you're<00:01:11.869> missing<00:01:12.259> buttons<00:01:12.649> so

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
did on the ps2 you're missing buttons so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.620 
did on the ps2 you're missing buttons so
they<00:01:13.160> basically<00:01:13.340> combined<00:01:14.030> things<00:01:14.390> which

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
they basically combined things which

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.660 
they basically combined things which
make<00:01:15.200> some<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.560> access<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.130> some<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.580> your

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
make some of the access to some of your

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.520 
make some of the access to some of your

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you're not going to put it down so you

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340 
you're not going to put it down so you
know<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.790> basically<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.300> repeat<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:00.930> it's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
know it is basically a repeat but it's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.830 
know it is basically a repeat but it's
extremely<00:03:02.160> well<00:03:02.519> done<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> only

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
extremely well done now one of the only

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.000 
extremely well done now one of the only
disappointing<00:03:04.350> things<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:04.709> found<00:03:04.860> in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
disappointing things that we found in

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.590 
disappointing things that we found in
the<00:03:05.070> game<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.940> there<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.180> are<00:03:06.480> only

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the game is that there really are only

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.270 
the game is that there really are only
three<00:03:07.170> boss<00:03:07.380> fights<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.860> game<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.190> only

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
three boss fights in the game and only

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.729 
three boss fights in the game and only
one<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.610> them<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.840> scale<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.650> know

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
one of them is on the scale of you know

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.259 
one of them is on the scale of you know
huge<00:03:11.220> fights<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.700> you've<00:03:11.820> seen<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
huge fights that you've seen it in the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.449 
huge fights that you've seen it in the
past<00:03:12.300> game<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.230> don't<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.590> those<00:03:13.800> huge

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
past game so you don't have those huge

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.640 
past game so you don't have those huge
boss<00:03:15.209> battles<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:16.260> had<00:03:16.350> seen<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.560> past

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
boss battles that we had seen in past

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.800 
boss battles that we had seen in past
games<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.310> little<00:03:17.640> disappointing<00:03:18.180> but<00:03:18.299> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
games a little disappointing but you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.750 
games a little disappointing but you
know<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.049> does<00:03:19.320> work<00:03:19.500> well<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.860> story<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.489> it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
know it does work well the story so it

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580 
know it does work well the story so it
seems<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.239> little<00:03:21.269> weird<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.170> kind<00:03:22.470> of

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
seems a little weird but it's kind of

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.289 
seems a little weird but it's kind of
more<00:03:22.769> realistic<00:03:23.310> than<00:03:23.340> before<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.209> know

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
more realistic than before but you know

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.940 
more realistic than before but you know
we<00:03:24.420> would<00:03:24.570> have<00:03:24.690> liked<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.959> seen<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.860> know

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
we would have liked to seen you know

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.259 
we would have liked to seen you know
some<00:03:26.130> bigger<00:03:26.280> fights<00:03:26.549> with<00:03:26.730> Nina<00:03:26.910> some<00:03:27.090> cool

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
some bigger fights with Nina some cool

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:41.179 
some bigger fights with Nina some cool
finishes

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.530 

if<00:03:42.189> you<00:03:42.280> fan<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.579> series<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.120> probably<00:03:43.299> didn't

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
if you fan a series we probably didn't

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.699 
if you fan a series we probably didn't
need<00:03:43.629> to<00:03:43.780> tell<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.079> go<00:03:44.170> by<00:03:44.319> in<00:03:44.439> the<00:03:44.500> first

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
need to tell you to go by in the first

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.100 
need to tell you to go by in the first
place<00:03:44.890> but<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.519> definitely<00:03:45.700> should<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:47.049> a

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
place but you definitely should it's a

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.069 
place but you definitely should it's a
great<00:03:47.319> reason<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.620> in<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.829> PSP
