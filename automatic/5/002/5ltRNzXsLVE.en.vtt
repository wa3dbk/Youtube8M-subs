00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
it too so that this guitar would have a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.469 
it too so that this guitar would have a
really<00:01:50.180> great<00:01:50.479> punch<00:01:50.990> sustain<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.240> volume<00:01:53.240> to

it now this wood is extremely dense and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.450 
it now this wood is extremely dense and
heavy<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:57.410> actually<00:01:57.530> really<00:01:57.890> feel<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.340> when

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
heavy you actually really feel it when

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.859 
heavy you actually really feel it when
you<00:01:58.550> pick<00:01:58.729> up<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:58.970> guitar<00:01:59.360> it's<00:01:59.570> got<00:01:59.840> a

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
you pick up this guitar it's got a

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.560

definite<00:02:00.380> weight<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.149> but<00:02:02.149> not<00:02:02.360> something

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
definite weight to it but not something

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.480 
definite weight to it but not something
that's<00:02:02.720> uncomfortable<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.619> really<00:02:04.250> really

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
that's uncomfortable I really really

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.850 
that's uncomfortable I really really
like<00:02:04.640> how<00:02:04.790> this<00:02:04.940> feels<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:05.990> little<00:02:06.229> wider

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
like how this feels it's a little wider

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.250 
like how this feels it's a little wider
at<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.220> nut<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.670> all<00:02:07.909> tailors<00:02:08.630> are<00:02:08.899> unless

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
at the nut like all tailors are unless

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.170 
at the nut like all tailors are unless
you<00:02:09.440> want<00:02:09.590> something<00:02:09.649> skinnier<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:11.000> did<00:02:11.150> a

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
short scale because I really like how a

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.699 
short scale because I really like how a
