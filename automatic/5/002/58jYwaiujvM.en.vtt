00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.560 

this<00:03:53.780> will<00:03:53.930> do<00:03:54.050> about<00:03:54.850> 60,000<00:03:55.850> damage<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.540> think

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
this will do about 60,000 damage I think

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.950 
this will do about 60,000 damage I think
and<00:03:57.520> then<00:03:58.520> Roman<00:03:59.030> will<00:03:59.180> do<00:03:59.390> his<00:03:59.600> thing<00:03:59.930> right

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
and then Roman will do his thing right

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.570 
and then Roman will do his thing right
afterwards<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.530> still<00:04:03.530> probably<00:04:04.040> will

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
afterwards and that still probably will

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.280 
afterwards and that still probably will
not<00:04:04.820> be<00:04:05.060> enough<00:04:05.300> to<00:04:05.450> kill<00:04:05.720> him<00:04:05.930> look<00:04:06.110> he's
