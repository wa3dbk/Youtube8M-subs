California and today we are introducing
dura<00:00:16.550> glide<00:00:16.880> which<00:00:17.540> is<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:17.750> proprietary<00:00:18.340> PTFE

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
dura glide which is a proprietary PTFE

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.460 
dura glide which is a proprietary PTFE
coating<00:00:19.850> that<00:00:20.300> would<00:00:20.480> be<00:00:20.600> used<00:00:20.840> on<00:00:21.050> medical

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
coating that would be used on medical

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.400 
coating that would be used on medical
devices<00:00:21.850> most<00:00:22.850> commonly<00:00:23.390> used<00:00:23.630> when<00:00:23.990> the

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
devices most commonly used when the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.650 
devices most commonly used when the
tolerances<00:00:25.100> on<00:00:25.369> assembly<00:00:25.910> start<00:00:26.210> to<00:00:26.360> stack<00:00:26.630> up

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
tolerances on assembly start to stack up

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.930 
tolerances on assembly start to stack up
and<00:00:27.440> the<00:00:27.530> assemblies<00:00:27.949> don't<00:00:28.190> actuate<00:00:28.670> very

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
and the assemblies don't actuate very

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.240 
and the assemblies don't actuate very
well<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.750> can<00:00:29.900> use<00:00:30.140> this<00:00:30.470> by<00:00:30.770> dipping<00:00:31.039> the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
well you can use this by dipping the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.310 
well you can use this by dipping the
part<00:00:31.490> down<00:00:31.699> into<00:00:32.059> it<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.599> it<00:00:32.750> reduces<00:00:33.170> the

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
part down into it and it reduces the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.220 
part down into it and it reduces the
actuation<00:00:33.800> forces<00:00:34.400> on<00:00:34.520> these<00:00:34.670> devices<00:00:35.180> by<00:00:35.449> 25

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
actuation forces on these devices by 25

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.830 
actuation forces on these devices by 25
to<00:00:36.470> 30<00:00:36.710> percent<00:00:37.030> it's<00:00:38.030> engineered<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:38.750> it

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
to 30 percent it's engineered so it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.320 
to 30 percent it's engineered so it
works<00:00:39.020> really<00:00:39.140> well<00:00:39.500> on<00:00:40.010> high<00:00:40.820> high

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330

operations<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.120> it<00:00:44.540> goes<00:00:44.690> really<00:00:44.900> fast<00:00:45.050> I

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
operations and it goes really fast I

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.320 
operations and it goes really fast I
know<00:00:45.739> if<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:45.949> can<00:00:46.100> get<00:00:46.250> this<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.089> I'm<00:00:47.180> going

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
know if you can get this but I'm going

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.210 
know if you can get this but I'm going
to<00:00:47.360> take<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:47.690> stainless<00:00:48.019> steel<00:00:48.170> clip<00:00:48.620> drop

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
to take this stainless steel clip drop

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.240 
to take this stainless steel clip drop
it<00:00:49.400> down<00:00:49.580> in<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.809> take<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.170> out<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.040> if<00:00:52.129> you

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
it down in and take it out and if you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.920 
it down in and take it out and if you
can<00:00:52.400> see<00:00:52.610> it<00:00:52.729> the<00:00:53.210> carrier<00:00:53.540> fluid<00:00:53.839> is

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
can see it the carrier fluid is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.930 
can see it the carrier fluid is
evaporating<00:00:54.500> away<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:55.339> leaving<00:00:55.549> a<00:00:55.729> very

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
evaporating away and it's leaving a very

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.320 
evaporating away and it's leaving a very
uniform<00:00:56.510> film<00:00:56.900> of<00:00:57.199> PTFE<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.760> covers<00:00:59.120> all

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
uniform film of PTFE and it covers all

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.479 
uniform film of PTFE and it covers all
of<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.629> surfaces<00:01:00.140> on<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.379> components<00:01:00.979> so

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
of the surfaces on the components so

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.280 
of the surfaces on the components so
that<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.790> will<00:01:01.909> move<00:01:02.089> it<00:01:02.629> will<00:01:02.809> reduce<00:01:03.110> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
that it will move it will reduce the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.680 
that it will move it will reduce the
actuation<00:01:03.739> forces<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:08.150> other<00:01:08.450> thing

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
actuation forces the the other thing

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.420 
actuation forces the the other thing
that<00:01:08.840> we<00:01:08.930> also<00:01:09.140> do<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:09.680> part<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.040> this<00:01:10.159> is<00:01:10.400> that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
that we also do is part of this is that

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.210 
that we also do is part of this is that
we<00:01:10.729> have<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.240> calibrated<00:01:11.930> coating<00:01:12.350> which<00:01:12.890> means

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
we have a calibrated coating which means

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.510 
we have a calibrated coating which means
that<00:01:13.490> we<00:01:13.730> can<00:01:13.910> very<00:01:14.600> closely<00:01:15.380> control<00:01:16.310> the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
that we can very closely control the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.400 
that we can very closely control the
amount<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:16.850> PTFE<00:01:17.450> that's<00:01:17.660> being<00:01:17.870> dispersed

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
amount of PTFE that's being dispersed

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.000 
amount of PTFE that's being dispersed
onto<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> part<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.910> by<00:01:20.540> doing<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.410> assures

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
onto a part and by doing that it assures

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.920 
onto a part and by doing that it assures
you<00:01:22.160> a<00:01:22.190> very<00:01:22.580> good<00:01:22.670> repeatability<00:01:23.330> from<00:01:23.750> one

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
you a very good repeatability from one

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.870 
you a very good repeatability from one
part<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.320> another<00:01:24.740> when<00:01:25.400> you're<00:01:25.520> treating

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
part to another when you're treating

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.120 
part to another when you're treating
them<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:26.480> the<00:01:26.630> actuation<00:01:27.080> forces<00:01:27.650> don't<00:01:27.890> vary

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
them so the actuation forces don't vary

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.130 
them so the actuation forces don't vary
wildly<00:01:28.400> they<00:01:29.000> stay<00:01:29.210> very<00:01:29.390> consistent<00:01:30.050> from

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
wildly they stay very consistent from

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.930 
wildly they stay very consistent from
one<00:01:30.350> production<00:01:30.650> run<00:01:30.980> to<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.280> other<00:01:31.400> heat

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
one production run to the other heat

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.420 
one production run to the other heat
treating<00:01:32.270> well<00:01:32.420> that's<00:01:32.600> true<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.590> this

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
treating well that's true this is this

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.580 
treating well that's true this is this
is<00:01:34.580> actually<00:01:34.730> applied<00:01:35.240> as<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.870> it<00:01:36.080> can<00:01:36.260> be<00:01:36.380> used

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
is actually applied as is it can be used

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.740 
is actually applied as is it can be used
as<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:37.790> can<00:01:37.910> also<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.210> heat<00:01:38.510> treated

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
as is but it can also be heat treated

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.080 
as is but it can also be heat treated
and<00:01:39.290> when<00:01:39.440> it's<00:01:39.560> he<00:01:39.710> treated<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.280> goes<00:01:40.520> clear

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
and when it's he treated it goes clear

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.330 
and when it's he treated it goes clear
and<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.690> gives<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.960> much<00:01:42.170> stronger<00:01:42.530> bond<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:43.190> to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
and it gives a much stronger bond on to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.190 
and it gives a much stronger bond on to
the<00:01:43.460> surface<00:01:43.790> of<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.000> part<00:01:44.240> we<00:01:44.690> have<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.930> part

where you can't see the difference but
you<00:01:50.930> can<00:01:51.200> tell<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.530> by<00:01:51.680> putting<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.159> marker<00:01:52.550> on

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
you can tell it by putting a marker on

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700 
you can tell it by putting a marker on
it<00:01:52.880> where<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.630> market<00:01:54.020> will<00:01:54.140> stick<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.620> the
