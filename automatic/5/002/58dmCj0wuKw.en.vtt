00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:05.260
 it was our veteran bites who discovered that grain was crowded 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.259
 of math 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.099
 the two shortest lines combined are exactly the third 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.329
 and we will be that the magical proportions of the famous rule of thumb 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.399
 the second and third lines are exactly the same as the fourth 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 we have again the golden rule 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.499
 but this is just the beginning 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.820
 hidden inside the pentagram is the secret of the creation of the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.770
 rectangle 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.930
 that the Greeks admire its beautiful proportions and its qualities 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.340
 magical 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 the country star in the urucu rectangle of times 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.950
 it's a fantastic way 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.970
 it can reproduce mathematically infinite times 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.670
 all those returns that do not exactly equal the proportions 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.840
 in this second also counts on a magic spiral that requires that the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.840
 proportions of the rule of thumb next 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.540
 of the Greeks the golden rectangle represents the validity mathematical liza 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.400
 he is in his 5th edition of the classic 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 the parthenon perhaps one of the most famous buildings in ancient greece 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.190
 contains several rectangles of gold 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.789
 dumb 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.180
 the proportions of the golden rule try to find themselves in their sculptures 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.209
 in the following centuries the golden rectangle dominated the concept of beauty of 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.209
 architecture around the western world 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 the cathedral of notre-dame a remarkable example 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.949
 the renaissance painters comission pcc wins 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.739
 nowadays the golden rectangle is part of our modern world 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.230
 Modern painters rediscover a magic of these proportions 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.769
 in fact this proportion of bial is found in one's life 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.599
 bush 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.849
 if you end the practice 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.829
 the extra quota 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.389
 the new north 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.939
 school counts 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.009
 do not let that happen 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.009
 the clinic 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.919
 no i think not 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.919
 now we can not all be mathematically perfect 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.509
 I just want to wake up early. 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.909
 now that you're inbuilt defeated 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 let's see how nature uses this same mathematical form 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.049
 the discussion 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.539
 today the ministers 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.539
 the flower said 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.509
 there are literally thousands of prominent members in the Pythagorean society of 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.509
 star in nature 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.569
 all works of mathematical technological nature these standards are 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.569
 unlimited 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:14.349
 we always find the pigs their magic of the golden rule of spirals 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.349
 of nature's drawings 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.539
 the function of mathematical forms reminds us of the words of nick arcuri 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.299
 everything is organized according to numbers and mathematical forms 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.699
 Yes there is math in the ball 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.729
 martÃ­ on practically everything 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.729
 and how the Greeks discovered the rules are always the same 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.639
 d 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.650
 n 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.249
 Did you like our media trip? 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.239
 I think this one of the few tomatoes the blockbuster tomato gave the back points
