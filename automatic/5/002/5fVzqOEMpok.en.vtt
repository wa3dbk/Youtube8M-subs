00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.130
 once you are on their site 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.730
 you download the software so you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.769
 click on 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480

 download to publish on ours 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.690
 I personally already have it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 downloaded before starting 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 dialogue and things to tell you what 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.270
 direct who fought with all 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.180
 devices that censor live 8 points 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.350
 currently no that appears on the screen 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.149
 before starting the genoa that is going 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.020
 have to disable the code or touch a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.100
 says on your device 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.110
 I do not seem to pick one 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.989
 code as you can see will have to go 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.940
 in the code and chaibi settings if you 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.320
 are on a 2-10 device so I 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.350
 know that codes because I'm on a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.369
 ipad r and you clear your code 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.080
 must also disable the function 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.360
 locate my iphone whose settings 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 have where other devices so a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.900
 once you have disabled 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.460
 settings locate my iphone locate 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.710
 my ipad - it can of all everything depends 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.689
 of the device you are going to have a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.890
 advice before starting back up 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.540
 your device and restore your 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.610
 device on itunes it's better for the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.960
 live because I had trouble 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.040
 before doing that good it was not working 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.840
 so I advise you to do it for 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 the smooth running of the trek now 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.229
 everything is white you open angoumois 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.799
 frozen I basically sum it up you run it if 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.619
 you request it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.900
 so here you come to this page and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.549
 your device will be detected so 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.970
 you'll see how that's an ipad 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.009
 r on the bones 8 points start drake and there 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.090
 you these games can actually you 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.560
 did the things I did 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.149
 advised to do at the beginning of the live 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.680
 so there say it is that will start 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.110
 so full of live process the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.670
 wind began so me for my part 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.990
 roughly lasting 15 to 30 minutes I 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270
 do not know exactly I have not when 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.250
 so here is where you are going to have a 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.179
 screen will stay science on your ipad or 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.649
 your iphone yes maybe you 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.270
 not worry it's normal it's the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.770
 dialogue process true that after 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.470
 your device 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.350
 this master has restarted so here is so 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.050
 which restarts and the direct finishing of the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.240
 raquet succeeds so there you can 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.180
 close itunes that opens up and tastes 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.220
 so there your ipad goes at least - it not 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.800
 for example restarts how your 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.800
 damage will restart brief so here is the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.540
 direc effect now that the direct which 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.220
 is practically over on your 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.500
 device your device will restart 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 he'll have a loading bar you 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.640
 do not worry this is quite 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.520
 normal so after that your device 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.920
 restarted with the icon of cydia and 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.340
 good taste on the springboard of your 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.200
 apparatus 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.880
 r my iPad will finally restart with 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.400
 sia and pong or on the home screen 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.170
 so you see there is so there is so for 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.120
 you do not care about it the most 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.470
 important is if there is so the first 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.050
 times you have to open six guys and it's okay 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.630
 prepare the file system 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.070
 and your device after that will make 1 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.130
 re spring and there you will finally 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.020
 functional insignia on your device 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.610
 so that proves you are good diallo 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.730
 riquet so where are we going then we will see if he 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.020
 ya on my ipad r as you see ipad 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.540
 area-on-the-lily 8 points 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.940
 so if there is and 100% functional so 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.150
 you will be able to install your tweak 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.490

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.820
