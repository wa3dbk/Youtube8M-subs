00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.960 

I<00:00:41.310> all<00:00:42.310> I<00:00:42.340> did<00:00:42.610> was<00:00:42.760> I<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:45.340> I<00:00:45.370> did<00:00:45.640> was<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.820> put

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
I all I did was I all I did was to put

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.810 
I all I did was I all I did was to put
different<00:00:46.120> carburetor<00:00:46.660> on<00:00:46.780> so<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:48.520> you<00:00:48.730> can

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
different carburetor on so as you can

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.229 
different carburetor on so as you can
see<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.180> oil<00:00:49.210> cap<00:00:49.660> was<00:00:49.900> a<00:00:50.170> hop<00:00:50.560> off

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
see the oil cap was a hop off

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.180 
see the oil cap was a hop off
so<00:00:52.239> let's<00:00:52.750> pour<00:00:53.260> some<00:00:53.290> job<00:00:53.590> acts<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:53.980> there

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
so let's pour some job acts in there

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.299 
so let's pour some job acts in there
let's<00:00:54.760> blow<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.360> up<00:00:55.650> blow<00:00:56.650> it<00:00:56.739> up<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.160> won't

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
let's blow it up blow it up so it won't

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:06.959 
let's blow it up blow it up so it won't
run<00:00:57.520> no<00:00:57.700> more

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:06.969 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.910 

that's<00:01:07.509> probably<00:01:07.749> more<00:01:07.929> than<00:01:07.990> enough<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.890> I

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
that's probably more than enough see I

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.830 
that's probably more than enough see I
was<00:01:12.039> gonna<00:01:12.159> do<00:01:12.310> this<00:01:12.429> before<00:01:12.819> quick<00:01:13.210> start<00:01:13.569> but

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
was gonna do this before quick start but

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.830 
was gonna do this before quick start but
be<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.799> waste<00:01:15.039> of<00:01:15.219> quick<00:01:15.460> start<00:01:15.789> so<00:01:18.569> that<00:01:19.569> should

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
be a waste of quick start so that should

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.709 
be a waste of quick start so that should
be<00:01:19.869> enough<00:01:20.170> job<00:01:20.439> acts<00:01:21.209> move<00:01:22.209> this<00:01:22.390> out<00:01:22.539> of<00:01:22.569> the

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
be enough job acts move this out of the
