very simple recipe actually

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.180 
very simple recipe actually
anyone<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.090> do<00:02:10.270> this<00:02:10.300> I'm<00:02:10.900> going<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> turn<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
anyone can do this I'm going to turn the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.380 
anyone can do this I'm going to turn the
phones<00:02:12.490> over<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.860> that's<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.460> slightly

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
phones over and that's going slightly

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.810 
phones over and that's going slightly
pinkish<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:19.300> try<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.660> curry<00:02:20.050> paste<00:02:20.820> the

pinkish and then try the curry paste the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.720 
pinkish and then try the curry paste the
curry<00:02:22.090> paste<00:02:22.390> needs<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.930> little<00:02:23.050> bit<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.320> liquid

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
curry paste needs a little bit of liquid

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.120 
curry paste needs a little bit of liquid
instead<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.850> adding<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:26.320> some<00:02:26.560> water<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.100> it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
instead of adding just some water to it

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.920 
instead of adding just some water to it
I'm<00:02:27.820> going<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.120> create<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.480> little<00:02:28.750> bit<00:02:28.840> of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
I'm going to create a little bit of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.180 
I'm going to create a little bit of
flavor<00:02:29.230> by<00:02:30.100> adding<00:02:30.720> some<00:02:31.720> coconut<00:02:32.080> milk<00:02:32.320> now

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
flavor by adding some coconut milk now

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.360 
flavor by adding some coconut milk now
the<00:02:33.250> coconut<00:02:33.670> milk<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.750> be<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.230> milk<00:02:35.470> or

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the coconut milk can be just a milk or

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.390 
the coconut milk can be just a milk or
can<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.150> coconut<00:02:37.360> cream<00:02:37.950> basically<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
can be coconut cream basically the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.510 
can be coconut cream basically the
difference<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:39.970> coconut<00:02:40.840> cream<00:02:41.370> happens<00:02:42.370> to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
difference is coconut cream happens to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.050 
difference is coconut cream happens to
be<00:02:42.700> thicker<00:02:43.690> then<00:02:44.260> coconut<00:02:44.650> milk<00:02:44.890> now<00:02:45.820> we're

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
be thicker then coconut milk now we're

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.280 
be thicker then coconut milk now we're
going<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.210> add<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.840> little<00:02:46.870> bit<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.880> squid<00:02:48.880> and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
then you've got some muscles and then

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.770

you don't have to what's the word call
chop<00:04:39.759> it<00:04:39.879> up<00:04:39.970> because<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:41.440> longer<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.979> better
