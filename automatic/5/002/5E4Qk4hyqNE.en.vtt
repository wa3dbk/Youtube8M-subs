00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.260
 how are you in girls, welcome in the morning 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.880
 but that is very good and today in 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.220
 I actually bring you a comparison that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.869
 you asked me what was the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.930
 comparison of two different brands in 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.020
 lipstick mate me in this case I will 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.580
 buy two this from mac and this from 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.500
 bullshit I want the marks that you 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.080
 they had asked me in the comparison and I 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.030
 I already swat that is here this is the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.470
 only and last selected that is this 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 burgundy that I love that also what 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.000
 I have applicators and this is one 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.640
 marc collection of helios mont 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.739
 that is the truth the things that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.220
 when the first application are very 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.860
 similar already and where will you do the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.020
 difference is the duration of the labial the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.390
 operation can last approximately 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.510
 about three hours like that without you leaving 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.520
 passing the effect and when it's gone 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.710
 passing the effect what I always 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.479
 is at the end it 's like the outline of the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.600
 lip that I find horrible as it is 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.210
 see then that displeases me quite 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.619
 but if it lasts me much longer than 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.800
 the one of marc in during the day eating 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.380
 drinking a coffee or doing whatever the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.200
 duration of the lip ringing is much more 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.720
 long now we are talking more or less 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.729
 of 15 thousand 100 pesos and the text analyzes 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.770
 17 thousand pesos more is not little the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.630
 difference but the other mentions for 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.840
 can you compare which of the two is 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.270
 better in general to see if I'm going to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.690
 invest in one of the lipsticks as 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.340
 this type which suits me more in the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.289
 I recommend you much more those of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.149
 portland although it has a range of 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.179
 much more bounded colors than the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.030
 much more extensive brand but yes 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:56.010
 with respect to duration and 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.780
 number of tones we can find 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.240
 and there it is as he is but it is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.730
 I recommend to see one of them 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.000
 they love it but if they are expensive then 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.310
 that as little by little go doing so we go 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.440
 to invest I recommend this now it's going to 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.380
 depend a lot on that tonality 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.360
 which we want to get 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.350
 because Marc as he mentioned them has a 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.480
 much wider range of matte colors 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.220
 now if we are going to use colors that are not 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.080
 be mate for example to labials 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.490
 comparing the same two brands the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.440
 evolution is quite similar I would say 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.620
 what law are a suture a couple of hours 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.740
 more but not so much the difference in the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.410
 coverage is very similar and where 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.120
 center the difference in both brands is 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.150
 in the labial mate 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.860
 so it's a very fast operation that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.510
 you are fine but I hope that you 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.640
 help a little to decide the girls that 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.909
 are looking for how to invest in our 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.310
 high-end imac lipsticks that is like 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.340
 a medium range and I hope if we give you 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.799
 say much more expensive than usa and it's 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.629
 something that I always tell you but 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.159
 it was mainly that I hope that they 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.140
 I liked video as I always tell you 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.720
 anything they need they want 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.680
 that makes the video they leave it to me down their 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.569
 comments 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.569
 I give you a million thanks 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.510
 because they are 7 support me a lot 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.810
 I leave a huge kiss if we are not seeing 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 in a next video of the channel and take care 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.410
 I had forgotten today I want 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.870
 make a special mention to a person 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.450
