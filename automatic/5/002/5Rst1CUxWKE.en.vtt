in<00:04:49.000> fact<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.630> probably<00:04:49.870> was<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.440> bully<00:04:50.860> of

so<00:04:52.770> no<00:04:53.310> doubt<00:04:53.640> would<00:04:54.180> have<00:04:54.330> been<00:04:54.540> very

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
so no doubt would have been very

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.320 
so no doubt would have been very

extremely large size are going to have

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.800 
extremely large size are going to have
this<00:05:25.710> tremendous<00:05:25.950> impact<00:05:26.610> rear<00:05:27.270> up<00:05:27.450> on<00:05:27.690> the

this tremendous impact rear up on the

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.560 
this tremendous impact rear up on the
hind<00:05:28.020> legs<00:05:28.430> show<00:05:29.430> how<00:05:29.670> big<00:05:29.910> they<00:05:30.150> are

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
hind legs show how big they are

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.050 
hind legs show how big they are
which<00:05:30.810> really<00:05:31.110> magnifies<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.220> size<00:05:32.460> spread

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
which really magnifies this size spread

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.410 
which really magnifies this size spread
out<00:05:33.210> those<00:05:33.510> front<00:05:33.840> paws<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:35.060> open<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.150> big

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
out those front paws and open that big

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.570 
out those front paws and open that big
mouth<00:05:36.630> show<00:05:37.020> those<00:05:37.170> big<00:05:37.410> teeth<00:05:37.620> I<00:05:37.950> think<00:05:38.430> that

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
mouth show those big teeth I think that

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.700 
mouth show those big teeth I think that
would<00:05:38.700> scare<00:05:38.910> almost<00:05:39.240> anything<00:05:39.660> away

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
would scare almost anything away

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.100 
would scare almost anything away
he<00:05:42.710> can<00:05:42.830> still<00:05:43.129> sustain<00:05:43.610> injury<00:05:44.059> so<00:05:44.659> the<00:05:44.779> first

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
he can still sustain injury so the first

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.659 
he can still sustain injury so the first
thing<00:05:45.409> you<00:05:45.529> want<00:05:45.740> to<00:05:45.830> do<00:05:46.069> is<00:05:46.279> you<00:05:46.429> want<00:05:46.610> to

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
thing you want to do is you want to

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.299 
thing you want to do is you want to
chase<00:05:47.029> away<00:05:47.300> your<00:05:47.449> potential<00:05:48.139> rival<00:05:48.589> but<00:05:49.189> if

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:49.309 
chase away your potential rival but if

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:51.459 
chase away your potential rival but if
that<00:05:49.460> doesn't<00:05:49.879> work<00:05:50.029> then<00:05:50.599> you<00:05:50.629> go<00:05:51.169> to<00:05:51.229> step

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
that doesn't work then you go to step

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.209 
that doesn't work then you go to step
two<00:05:52.929> scientists<00:05:53.929> determine<00:05:54.439> that<00:05:54.770> the<00:05:54.949> bear

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.600 
two scientists determine that the bear
using<00:05:55.939> all<00:05:56.169> 2500<00:05:57.169> pounds<00:05:57.679> was<00:05:58.069> particularly

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
using all 2500 pounds was particularly

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.750 
using all 2500 pounds was particularly
well<00:05:59.059> adapted<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.689> attack<00:06:00.169> in<00:06:00.439> close<00:06:00.740> quarters

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
well adapted to attack in close quarters

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.700 
well adapted to attack in close quarters
these<00:06:03.180> surface<00:06:03.600> bears<00:06:03.930> would<00:06:04.230> have<00:06:04.350> been<00:06:04.530> well

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
these surface bears would have been well

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.640 
these surface bears would have been well
adapted<00:06:05.280> for<00:06:05.340> close<00:06:05.730> combat<00:06:06.030> and<00:06:06.480> so<00:06:07.080> at<00:06:07.380> close

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
adapted for close combat and so at close

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.800 
adapted for close combat and so at close
distance<00:06:08.250> these<00:06:08.430> exceptionally<00:06:09.150> long<00:06:09.360> arms

with<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.170> big<00:06:10.350> claws<00:06:10.650> would<00:06:11.370> have<00:06:11.610> been

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
with the big claws would have been

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.090 
with the big claws would have been
really<00:06:12.090> efficient<00:06:12.540> tools<00:06:12.780> for<00:06:13.230> knocking<00:06:14.010> away

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100
