00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.050 
that in the first episode the biggest
narrator<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> Dragon<00:01:08.369> Ball<00:01:08.490> Absalon<00:01:08.909> guess

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
narrator of Dragon Ball Absalon guess

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090 
narrator of Dragon Ball Absalon guess
you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.299> call<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.659> told<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.979> know

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you can call it told that you know

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
you can call it told that you know
Vegeta<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> know<00:01:11.880> seeking<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.510> power<00:01:12.810> he

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
Vegeta you know seeking more power he

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.800 
Vegeta you know seeking more power he
left<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> space<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.850> find<00:01:15.270> even<00:01:15.540> more

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
left it the space to find even more

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.499 
left it the space to find even more
power<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> train<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> become<00:01:17.009> even<00:01:17.509> stronger

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
power and train and become even stronger

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.890 
power and train and become even stronger
so<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:20.310> pretty<00:01:20.580> sure<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.030> Goku<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
so I'm pretty sure that Goku is going to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.410 
so I'm pretty sure that Goku is going to
return<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> scene<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.060> guys<00:01:24.180> have

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and I'm assuming that Goku and piccolo

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.580 
and I'm assuming that Goku and piccolo
they<00:01:37.409> they're<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> need<00:01:38.759> Vegeta<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.590> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
they they're going to need Vegeta so you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080 
they they're going to need Vegeta so you
know<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:41.130> Goku<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
know because Goku is going to have to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.679 
know because Goku is going to have to
fuse<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.420> him<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.930> he's<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.689> he

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
fuse with him and he's going to be he

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.359 
fuse with him and he's going to be he
will<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.960> needed<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> battle<00:01:46.829> he<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.159> going

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to be a big help in the battles Vegeta

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.670 
to be a big help in the battles Vegeta
is<00:01:49.530> very<00:01:50.189> powerful<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> princes

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
is very powerful you know so the princes

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.190 
is very powerful you know so the princes
definitely<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> scene<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
definitely have to be in the scene and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
definitely have to be in the scene and
I'm<00:01:56.009> pretty<00:01:56.280> sure<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.729> reason<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
I'm pretty sure that's a reason that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
I'm pretty sure that's a reason that
Goku<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.810> piccolo<00:01:57.869> must<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.009> know

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
Goku and piccolo must have you know

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.300 
Goku and piccolo must have you know
going<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.329> space<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.960> find<00:02:01.320> them<00:02:01.560> cuz

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.410 
going on out into space to find them cuz
I<00:02:02.700> doubt<00:02:03.479> by<00:02:04.110> seeing<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.009> background<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.240> this

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
I doubt by seeing the background of this
that<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> earth<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.860> pretty<00:02:08.220> sure

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that this is the earth I'm pretty sure

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
that this is the earth I'm pretty sure
when<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.789> somewhere<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.899> outer

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
when it's somewhere out in the outer

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.199 
when it's somewhere out in the outer
space<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:11.069> find<00:02:11.099> Vegeta<00:02:11.790> where<00:02:11.940> he<00:02:12.090> was

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
space to find Vegeta where he was

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.100 
space to find Vegeta where he was
training<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:12.750> what

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
training or what

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.640 
training or what
now<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.570> don't<00:02:15.570> know<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.260> going<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
now I don't know if this is going to be

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.860 
now I don't know if this is going to be
in<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.830> third<00:02:16.980> episode<00:02:17.130> guys<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.540> fourth

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.860
