00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.490
 beachtime 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:15.860
 I arrived at Tokyo Station by Shinkansen 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.430
 from now on 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.940
 Where and when hackers blazingly repainted 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.210
 I would like to have and go the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.950
 I arrived at Omotesando Station 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.570
 See you 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.600
 Because this area will come to work 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.190
 Always hit, but I have a pussy in a crosswalk that came out from the easy-to-understand outlet 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.640
 That 's right from where the green light is 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.660
 get off 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.340
 I will go to play in various ways 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.440
 So here's a crash of clan 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.440
 In I would like to go to the office 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.720
 this is 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.690
 eh 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.230
 Ah 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.780
 City is Sakiko 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.780
 This I because this was interesting plump wife 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.960
 Is this a voice? 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.740
 Each one is this? Yes This customers who had you come to that Haley cafes all 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.740
 Oh an 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.780
 Yes, there is no video of the game this time 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.659
 I like walking from the station 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:44.830
 And a little show is not Toko say in the operation are also hanging on a little wall Nde were many 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:50.950
 I just copied the photos and this is this time 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:55.520
 If I say Taka have to talk about this kind of thing well and say you heard me What do you mean 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:00.020
 In a game called Crash of Clan 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.270
 I heard what it means to think about the user 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.890
 But well 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:13.110
 I thought that I was thinking about the user firmly 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:17.459
 It's something like Tokai , especially in the game industry, before I go 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:24.660
 It's hard to talk to something like wearing a suit crisply 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:26.850
 I thought there was an aura, but it is easier to talk to the princess 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.750
 Talked about the impact 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.730
 It was Mr. Kohei 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.180
 that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:44.330
 I already felt from Mr. Kohei 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:47.600
 I also carefully think through the views from each user 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.850
 I would like to report this kind of trouble 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.180
 I look closely 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.180
 that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.790
 It is all right because it received all Samakoe properly 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:05.290
 various 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:09.160
 Well, even if there are some bugs or not, I really think about the improvement show 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.220
 Let's get satisfied with everyone Let's enjoy it 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.630
 Thinking desperately and variously 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:22.340
 I understood that I was thinking in various ways desperately 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:27.170
 I thought of talking about that company of the crash of clan 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:32.780
 I work too, but a player as a company 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.360
 Idea Tteyuu to take care of it is your Tteyuu players customers 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.100
 Very I 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.100
 There was something I could sympathize with 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:49.660
 I think that there are various Twitter updates and updates, etc. 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.660
 In terms of my honest opinion 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.760
 Satisfied than that 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:02.049
 I felt Fu such kana not you have fun 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.260
 What do I that I never been to me I Tteyuu this Game Show Kanesou 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:10.209
 It seems that there is something to say but various schools 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.910
 It is really good to think of events to get everyone to enjoy 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.860
 understood 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.780
 So everyone from now on 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.620
 Let's play crash of clan possible breeding 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.130
 And if there is something that bothers me a little 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.980
 To the management 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.280
 E-mail becomes that 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:35.860
 Please send it 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.310
 Kyoaisha Junpei's whether is surely every person properly message 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.310
 We look 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:47.980
 Clash of clans again in frank opinion 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:54.310
 Like a felt like that talking about such want to go to play 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:58.750
 We do 15 again, but there seems to be event this time and the staff of living town Gran 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.810
 Feel free to see someone 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.650
 Please give a voice and if you have Mr. Kohei 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.670
 Please feel free to say Junpsan 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.670
 surely 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.910
 I think that will return 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:20.160
 True 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:24.300
 It's not have got a bribe to that another was a good person But I felt as a frankly adult 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:28.630
 I really want to entertain everyone 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:34.770
 In such a game I'd like to willing 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.770
 In the game Crash of Clan or supercell game Hayday 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:46.330
 I thought it was someone who was pouring love 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:50.880
 It is such a report today, but I want to end in such a place 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.880
 It was Matsuki in the room
