through these interests these left on

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.250 
through these interests these left on
one's<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.359> quite<00:00:24.539> interesting<00:00:24.930> what's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
one's here they quite interesting what's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
one's here they quite interesting what's
that<00:00:25.410> ok<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> rotary<00:00:26.430> dials<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that ok the rotary dials on it on the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.330 
that ok the rotary dials on it on the
front<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.019> various<00:00:28.320> map<00:00:28.500> position<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
front of a various map position so the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.679 
front of a various map position so the
driver<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.699> adjust<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> behavior<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
driver can adjust the behavior of the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.470 
driver can adjust the behavior of the
car<00:00:31.460> these<00:00:32.460> three<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> left<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
car these three on the left are for the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.750 
car these three on the left are for the
differential<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.680> rear<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> car<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
differential the rear of the car so that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400 
differential the rear of the car so that
you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.059> adjust<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.570> balance<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> car

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you can adjust the balance of the car

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.200 
you can adjust the balance of the car
through<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> corners<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.640> obviously<00:00:39.030> we

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
through the corners so obviously we

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
through the corners so obviously we
break<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.600> into<00:00:39.780> corner<00:00:40.320> entry<00:00:40.739> middle

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
break that up into corner entry middle

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.090 
break that up into corner entry middle
of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> corner<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> corner<00:00:42.629> exit<00:00:43.100> we

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
of the corner and the corner exit we

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.979 
of the corner and the corner exit we
pull<00:00:44.370> er<00:00:44.399> coded<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> dials<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.480> wet<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.870> dry

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
pull er coded the dials for wet and dry

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
pull er coded the dials for wet and dry
settings<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.129> obviously<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> driver<00:00:47.850> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
settings and obviously if the driver is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.459 
settings and obviously if the driver is
a<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.300> understeer<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.870> example<00:00:49.260> going

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a bit of understeer for example going

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
a bit of understeer for example going
into<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> corner<00:00:50.160> he<00:00:50.550> would<00:00:50.700> adjust<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
into the corner he would adjust the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.869 
into the corner he would adjust the
entry<00:00:51.510> dial<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.559> obviously<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.100> exit<00:00:53.430> he<00:00:53.699> can

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
entry dial and obviously on exit he can

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.459 
entry dial and obviously on exit he can
adjust<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.660> leave<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.170> set

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
adjust that and they leave them set

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.310 
adjust that and they leave them set
today<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.370> uh<00:00:56.870> he<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:58.020> probably

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
today but all that uh he will probably

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.510 
today but all that uh he will probably
play<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> few<00:00:58.800> times<00:00:58.980> during<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
play with it a few times during a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
play with it a few times during a
session<00:00:59.730> perhaps<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.420> tires<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.989> off<00:01:01.199> he

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
session perhaps as the tires go off he

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
session perhaps as the tires go off he
may<00:01:01.530> wish<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.710> adjust<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.190> balance<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
may wish to adjust the balance of the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.539 
may wish to adjust the balance of the
car<00:01:02.910> or<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.229> been<00:01:04.799> an<00:01:04.949> arrow<00:01:05.129> arrow

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
car or if there's been an arrow arrow

car or if there's been an arrow arrow
changing<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> pit<00:01:06.299> stop<00:01:06.330> he<00:01:06.720> may<00:01:06.840> wish<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
changing a pit stop he may wish to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
changing a pit stop he may wish to
adjust<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.729> what

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
adjust it so just just not me know what

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
adjust it so just just not me know what
what<00:01:09.390> changes<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> mate<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.229> let's<00:01:10.439> say

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
what changes you mate so let's say

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.200 
what changes you mate so let's say
you've<00:01:10.979> got<00:01:11.010> understeer<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.760> how<00:01:11.970> would<00:01:12.119> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you've got understeer what how would you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.820 
you've got understeer what how would you
change<00:01:12.240> something<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.229> well<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:13.710> you've

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
change something on here well if you've

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.429 
change something on here well if you've
got<00:01:13.950> under<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.490> need<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.990> open<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
got under see you need to open up the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.700 
got under see you need to open up the
diff<00:01:16.619> at<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> rear<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.360> probably<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
diff at the rear so you probably from it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.080 
diff at the rear so you probably from it
from<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> higher<00:01:20.189> position<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.790> probably

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
from a higher position you probably

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.550 
from a higher position you probably
slacking<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> off<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> bit<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
slacking it off a bit right and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.550 
slacking it off a bit right and
obviously<00:01:23.009> vice<00:01:23.310> versa<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> ring<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
obviously vice versa at the ring this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.819 
obviously vice versa at the ring this
wing<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.070> what's<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:27.650> I'm<00:01:28.650> not

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
pit limits of water maybe spring up on

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
pit limits of water maybe spring up on
it'll<00:01:34.590> return<00:01:34.829> 0<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.369> simply<00:01:35.670> press<00:01:35.909> it

it'll return 0 it's just simply press it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.580 
it'll return 0 it's just simply press it
once<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.689> series<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> lights<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.439> off<00:01:37.470> on

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the dash to indicates the driver that's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
the dash to indicates the driver that's
been<00:01:39.900> turned<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.130> obviously<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.640> he

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
been turned on and obviously as he

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.950 
been turned on and obviously as he
crosses<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> line<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.329> he<00:01:42.479> leaves<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> pit

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
crosses the line as he leaves the pit

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.710 
crosses the line as he leaves the pit
lane<00:01:42.990> press<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> again<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> disengage<00:01:44.340> it

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
lane press it again to disengage it

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.080 
lane press it again to disengage it
we've<00:01:45.720> got<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.320> neutral<00:01:46.920> button<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
we've got the neutral button so

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
we've got the neutral button so
obviously<00:01:48.390> from<00:01:48.630> first<00:01:48.840> gear<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> neutral<00:01:49.649> he

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
obviously from first gear to neutral he

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.440 
obviously from first gear to neutral he
just<00:01:49.950> simply<00:01:50.040> presses<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.909> he<00:01:51.180> comes

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
just simply presses that as he comes

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.260 
just simply presses that as he comes
into<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> box<00:01:52.009> pit<00:01:53.009> confirm<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
into the box pit confirm so when the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
into the box pit confirm so when the
drivers<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> circuit<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
drivers out on the circuit we get the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.260 
drivers out on the circuit we get the
confirmation<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.579> he's<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> come<00:01:57.060> in

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
confirmation that he's going to come in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050 
confirmation that he's going to come in
so<00:01:57.450> we're<00:01:57.570> already<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.979> radio<00:01:59.280> button<00:01:59.610> which

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so we're already the radio button which

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.090 
so we're already the radio button which
is<00:02:00.270> labeled<00:02:00.479> talk<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.140> obviously<00:02:01.350> an<00:02:01.469> LED<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
is labeled talk and obviously an LED so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
is labeled talk and obviously an LED so
he<00:02:02.280> knows<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.610> he's<00:02:02.729> left<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.119> open<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.780> he's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
he knows if he's left that open as he's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.980 
he knows if he's left that open as he's
driving<00:02:04.320> around<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.590> track

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
driving around on track

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.580 
driving around on track
and<00:02:05.079> we<00:02:05.200> were<00:02:05.290> cut<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:05.860> here<00:02:06.100> driving<00:02:06.549> around

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and we were cut just here driving around

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.109 
and we were cut just here driving around
the<00:02:08.590> blue<00:02:08.830> button<00:02:09.009> here<00:02:09.280> labeled<00:02:09.550> SC<00:02:10.000> that's

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
the blue button here labeled SC that's

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.290 
the blue button here labeled SC that's
for<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.390> safety<00:02:10.630> car<00:02:10.989> so<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.819> safety<00:02:13.090> cars

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
for the safety car so if the safety cars

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.080 
for the safety car so if the safety cars
deployed<00:02:13.860> there's<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.010> minimum<00:02:15.700> lap<00:02:15.880> time

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
deployed there's a minimum lap time

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.729 
deployed there's a minimum lap time
displayed<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.660> dash<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.080> that's<00:02:17.410> ascent

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
displayed on the dash and that's ascent

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.440 
displayed on the dash and that's ascent
essentially<00:02:18.250> an<00:02:18.310> acknowledgement<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
essentially an acknowledgement so that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.760 
essentially an acknowledgement so that
he<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.690> clear<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.110> concentrate<00:02:20.319> on<00:02:20.650> other

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
he can clear it and concentrate on other

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.089 
he can clear it and concentrate on other
things<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:22.239> drinks<00:02:22.540> button<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.890> driver

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
things the drinks button so the driver

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.470 
things the drinks button so the driver
can<00:02:24.190> get<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> drink<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.790> he<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:25.060> going<00:02:25.239> round

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
can get a drink is he just going round

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.170 
can get a drink is he just going round
piped<00:02:26.050> up<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.319> his<00:02:26.410> helmet<00:02:26.940> would<00:02:27.940> appear

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
piped up to his helmet would appear

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.020 
piped up to his helmet would appear
force<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.660> mean<00:02:28.870> sorry<00:02:29.620> yeah<00:02:29.980> yeah<00:02:30.190> what<00:02:30.519> BPF

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
force that mean sorry yeah yeah what BPF

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.930 
force that mean sorry yeah yeah what BPF
is<00:02:31.209> quite<00:02:31.480> point<00:02:31.780> fines<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.800> essentially<00:02:33.760> we

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
is quite point fines so essentially we

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.610 
is quite point fines so essentially we
can<00:02:34.209> test<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.900> behavior<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.380> clutch

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
can test the behavior of the clutch

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.229 
can test the behavior of the clutch
before<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.190> clutch<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.550> needed<00:02:36.880> at<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.090> race

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
before the clutch is needed at a race

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.140 
before the clutch is needed at a race
start<00:02:37.980> preparing<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.100> surfaces<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.910> clutch

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
start preparing the surfaces of a clutch

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.580 
start preparing the surfaces of a clutch
so<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.480> we've<00:02:40.569> got<00:02:40.720> constant<00:02:41.170> performance

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
so that we've got constant performance

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.960 
so that we've got constant performance
when<00:02:41.709> we<00:02:41.799> need<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.100> do<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.250> launch<00:02:42.459> at<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> race

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
when we need to do a launch at the race

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.300 
when we need to do a launch at the race
start<00:02:43.299> we've<00:02:43.900> got<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> tire<00:02:44.560> row<00:02:44.799> through<00:02:45.069> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
start we've got a tire row through here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.240 
start we've got a tire row through here
so<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.239> put<00:02:47.230> their<00:02:47.410> three<00:02:47.620> different<00:02:47.980> tires

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
so the put their three different tires

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.690 
so the put their three different tires
that<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.580> use<00:02:48.790> slips<00:02:49.209> intermediates<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:49.989> wet

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
that we use slips intermediates and wet

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.920 
that we use slips intermediates and wet
color-coded<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.150> final<00:02:52.299> segment<00:02:52.660> is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
color-coded and the final segment is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.420 
color-coded and the final segment is
just<00:02:53.110> simply<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.500> turn<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.830> rear<00:02:54.010> light<00:02:54.220> on

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
just simply to turn the rear light on

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.470 
just simply to turn the rear light on
and<00:02:54.640> what<00:02:54.730> does<00:02:54.819> that<00:02:54.850> actually<00:02:55.000> do<00:02:55.330> though

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
and what does that actually do though

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.090 
and what does that actually do though
one<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.900> positions<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:56.739> have<00:02:56.920> within

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
one of the positions that we have within

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.640 
one of the positions that we have within
each<00:02:57.340> segment<00:02:57.580> are<00:02:57.970> for<00:02:58.360> throttle<00:02:58.630> maps<00:02:58.989> Wow

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
each segment are for throttle maps Wow

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.220 
each segment are for throttle maps Wow
and<00:02:59.890> then<00:03:00.400> outside<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.690> when<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:01.959> change

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
and then outside of that when you change

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.559 
and then outside of that when you change
tires<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.920> for<00:03:03.489> example<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.970> rolling<00:03:04.269> radius

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
tires the for example the rolling radius

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.210 
tires the for example the rolling radius
of<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.810> tire<00:03:04.989> changes<00:03:05.470> between<00:03:05.620> slicks<00:03:06.099> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
of the tire changes between slicks and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.160 
of the tire changes between slicks and
wet<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.060> we<00:03:07.180> need<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.420> compensate<00:03:07.720> for<00:03:08.110> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
wet so we need to compensate for the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.170 
wet so we need to compensate for the
wheel<00:03:08.319> speed<00:03:08.680> otherwise<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.579> calculations

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
wheel speed otherwise the calculations

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
wheel speed otherwise the calculations
go<00:03:10.359> out<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:10.810> things<00:03:11.109> like<00:03:11.350> controlling<00:03:11.859> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
go out but things like controlling the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.770 
go out but things like controlling the
differential<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.790> everything<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.329> if<00:03:13.630> he

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
differential and everything so if he

case<00:03:20.859> so<00:03:21.250> we've<00:03:21.940> got<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.600> normal

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810

operation that toggles are down when it

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.970 
operation that toggles are down when it

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.509 
array start the toggles have to go up
and<00:03:28.840> what<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.560> does<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:29.920> simplifies<00:03:30.489> the

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
and what that does is it simplifies the

and what that does is it simplifies the
control<00:03:31.120> for<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.299> driver<00:03:31.540> rather<00:03:31.810> than

the right position he just flicks those

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.610 
the right position he just flicks those

the driver in and out of the car we've

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.520 
the driver in and out of the car we've
got<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.240> two<00:03:52.450> upper<00:03:52.690> pebbles<00:03:53.050> our<00:03:53.290> gear

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
got the two upper pebbles our gear

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.860 
got the two upper pebbles our gear
changeup<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.310> gear<00:03:54.490> change<00:03:54.790> down<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.360> then

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
changeup and gear change down and then

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.240 
changeup and gear change down and then
we've<00:03:55.990> got<00:03:56.020> two<00:03:56.320> clutch<00:03:56.560> pedals<00:03:56.950> which<00:03:57.070> do

we've got two clutch pedals which do

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.650 
we've got two clutch pedals which do
exactly<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.730> same<00:03:57.760> thing<00:03:57.970> so<00:03:58.330> it's<00:03:58.450> drive<00:03:58.630> a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
exactly the same thing so it's drive a

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.020 
exactly the same thing so it's drive a
preference<00:03:59.110> which<00:03:59.290> ones<00:03:59.530> used<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.730> usually

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
preference which ones used and usually

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.430 
preference which ones used and usually
at<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.180> start<00:04:01.420> we<00:04:01.510> use<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.660> combination<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.320> the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
at the start we use a combination of the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.010 
at the start we use a combination of the
two<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.800> provide<00:04:03.070> him<00:04:03.190> with<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.400> feel<00:04:03.900> if<00:04:04.900> you

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
two to provide him with the feel if you

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.630 
two to provide him with the feel if you
start<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.320> spin<00:04:05.620> does<00:04:05.830> he<00:04:05.920> grabbed<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.340> or<00:04:06.520> is

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
start to spin does he grabbed that or is

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.890 
start to spin does he grabbed that or is
there<00:04:06.730> an<00:04:06.820> anti<00:04:07.030> store<00:04:07.270> folks<00:04:07.510> there<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.780> an

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
there an anti store folks there is an

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.420 
there an anti store folks there is an
anti<00:04:08.110> store<00:04:08.320> function<00:04:08.740> already<00:04:09.010> programmed

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
anti store function already programmed

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.070 
anti store function already programmed
within<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.880> control<00:04:10.180> systems<00:04:10.600> on<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> car

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
within the control systems on the car

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.270 
within the control systems on the car
but<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.530> will<00:04:11.650> only<00:04:11.710> keep<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.040> clutch

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
but that will only keep the clutch

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.710 
but that will only keep the clutch
disengaged<00:04:12.790> for<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.000> certain<00:04:13.270> amount<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.540> time

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
disengaged for a certain amount of time

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.020 
disengaged for a certain amount of time
so<00:04:14.260> yeah<00:04:14.440> he<00:04:14.560> does<00:04:14.740> need<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.040> pull<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.880> clutch

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
so yeah he does need to pull the clutch

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.789 
so yeah he does need to pull the clutch
after<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.510> certain<00:04:16.660> period<00:04:16.900> yeah<00:04:17.230> thanks<00:04:17.770> for

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
after a certain period yeah thanks for

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:26.550 
after a certain period yeah thanks for
sharing<00:04:18.100> it's<00:04:18.220> no<00:04:18.340> problem
