 beautiful space that our kitchen in 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.990
 I like this girl together with carola 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.150
 the vegetables I like the vegetables 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.150
 obviously because today we are going to cook 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.700
 with potatoes with carrots and onions 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.890

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.800
 rost and carola what do you think if we start 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.559
 to work shredded some potatoes 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.200
 if we are going to grate with skin because 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.790
 always if it is organic we know that it is the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.460
 production or per man of production 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.070
 natural what we know the skin has 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.730
 many properties of both papa 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.559
 carrot let's let grow what 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.920
 keep washing it well, take all the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.230
 and now we are going to pray to 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.980
 this one and go up scratching a carrot 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.480
 also remembering that there are 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.570
 many varieties of potatoes that 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.520
 america is the cradle of the potato is cute 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.520
 has developed many varieties of 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.250
 the same and being the most used one 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.220
 of the most used chips that is 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.729
 for french fries and the pampeana is 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.390
 which is used to boil 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:29.000
 in this case we use the lightning 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.040
 onion you have the potato 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.370
 well everything we have in here 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.280
 is measured brownish by just the 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.920
 skin and it has a little fluid there 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 that starch is liquid in starch 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.479
 the potato that makes our 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.640
 secure programming then to this it 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.250
 let's now put the carrot the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.650
 onion goal 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.619
 a little rosemary I love this 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.280
 relationship with the fresh herbs meta 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.150
 I was taking out the little leaves 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.150
 and the shortest 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.520
 and that obviously come 2 here 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.569
 nails 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.620
 and later 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.200
 we have black sesame seeds here and 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.609
 always important poppy seeds 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.340
 then consume these seeds on 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.409
 all in younger ages when they are 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.650
 small children because they help us 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.879
 correct nutrition and in the big 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.590
 they favor good cholesterol for a 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.510
 side and apart from dragging all the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.760
 impurities of the blood so all the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.900
 people consume a lot of meat is good 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.900
 that consumes seeds 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.090
 what do we do the rest of the garbage 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.640
 what's in it 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.460
 Developing 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.319
 we mix impeccably what we did not say is 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.030
 important clear that the seeds 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.150
 we have put in the water 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.800
 first because that way they go 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.230
 softening have been energized and in the 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.180
 way to incorporate them into our flora 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.030
 intestinal and then they will go a little bit 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.830
 evident being metabolized to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.680
 get to our blood if you do not 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.490
 we eat dry they are so tiny that they 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.459
 lose 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.440
 as they entered they go without end another 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.569
 person seeds more balls very 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.940
 small the chia are also 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.000
 little ones and the one of sesame are a little 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.700
 bigger 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.520
 each one of those seeds is a plant 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.650
 and there are thousands and thousands of seeds that 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.380
 then they will give then you have to be 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.390
 very conscious when it comes to cooking 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.640
 food take a little oil 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.290
 to prevent sticking all this is , 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.810
 our pan is well hot 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.380
 with your hands remove a little bit of 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.110
 water we can grab a good amount 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.410
 and drain a little but the whole video 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.280
 of saleh 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.050
 they produce starch and as well as something 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.690
 unpublished and we put it there we crush it 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.270
 and then we are going to make our threads 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.020
 of the preparation of the center of europe 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:14.920
 what we do with products 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:18.250
 Americans last potato rosti 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.130
 carrot and onion we are finishing 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.130
 until the plate we made with expensive 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.850
 well very well remember that this recipe 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.980
 and others are in our space in 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.710
 so guys point inta point 2 with the 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.030
 scoring area and until here came then 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.870
 our little programs and we have 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.190
 newer 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.190
 Relations paintings 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.500
 and let's go
