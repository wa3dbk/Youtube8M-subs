00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.830
 Hello Today I was able for the energy and metabolism 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.780
 a 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.960
 Ets 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.269
 Oh dear 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.390
 Though it is energy like last 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.910
 First of all there is atp 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.260
 It is the leading role of today app 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 That 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.560
 There is a new triphosphate a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.119
 It feels like this swarm when written with a mask pen 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.930
 I that this app I thing not the example initials 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.570
 Please respond 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.630
 I 'm sorry I made a little bit more this a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:50.220
 I'm calm, but with the substance of that person 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.940
 The Tteyuu antiseptic to say ribose Lincoln three bind to of any sugar is bound God 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.610
 I was tucked 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.970
 Is good 8 is this substance 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.730
 When exchanging energy in cells 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.340
 a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.930
 I Nakata-cho 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 The last thing there is 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.610
 Substance that is being from the bend You Do 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.610
 Line the hole rather than the less 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 energy 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.420
 Gin-san 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.470
 very well 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:32.930
 Yes it has Yes E'e' and Well another first 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.010
 I will walk the alphabet again a 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.360
 Huh 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.680
 b 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.270
 Bip 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.500
 It is upper jaw psychology 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.470
 a 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 Oh 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.940
 It is a child of 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.350
 The spec is adp 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:59.159
 Yes 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:59.820
 Two single this 2 adenosine diphosphate sugar is bound to say substances and Ribosu that adenine 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.020
 is 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 Is it OK with the bound substance 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.450
 Yes 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.070
 Hey atp composition 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 But first 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.330
 with atp 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:25.750
 By referred to as a high rigidity 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:31.730
 Using what energy takes in the co2 Among Kano Well we made also it in five schools 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.920
 Process of synthesizing organic matter using energy 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.920
 Seki says what you say 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.690
 Speaking of 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.819
 Yes 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.000
 It entered the top 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.900
 At this time 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.129
 Using light energy 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:00.240
 A series of half around a series of versions to whether exploration using the app by combining the app 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.400
 Summarized in 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.400
 Often heard this strong 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.870
 If it says a, high rigidity is 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:22.370
 Well I think this Hago Zonchi takes place in the chloroplast 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:23.569
 As for this or placement atp breathing, 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.150
 a 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.610
 doing 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.210
 Among the following 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.970
 8 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:41.660
 o bread hydrate fat protein using o 2 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.660
 Such as 8 well respiratory 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.060
 9 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:58.850
 If I say or I say the reaction to attu combined extracts energy from 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.850
 Collectively called breathing 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.569
 Breathing in 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.719
 The one-year response of respiration is a cell 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.920
 Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:17.570
 Beliss manure 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.570
 It is the use of atp but first the synthesis of the substance 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:26.580
 The synthesis of organic matter such as this photosynthetic that come to 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.330
 Second exercise 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.330
 How Well 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.750
 This example muscle of the European inn 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.630
 It will shrink or stretch muscles 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.260
 Third 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.260
 Fever 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.420
 This is a picture of Omoto 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.720
 For example, humans are mammals 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:58.330
 Because it is a temperature-controlled animal , even if it goes to a cold place 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:02.430
 But it is not that the temperature has been lowered into body temperature during 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.430
 Issued to t 4 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:13.800
 This is the cherry blossom physiological phenomenon of the firefly roof deep sea life 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.800
 Is it all right today is energy and it is more than yes
