done in that freeform way and and maybe

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.390 
done in that freeform way and and maybe
molding<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.080> little<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.500> tweezing<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.280> and

tweaking it here and there you can get a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.080 
tweaking it here and there you can get a
first<00:02:23.209> draft<00:02:23.420> that's<00:02:23.780> very<00:02:24.080> very<00:02:24.730> close<00:02:25.730> to

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
months so it's very important to have

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
somebody in Chapter three and forgot and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.280 
somebody in Chapter three and forgot and
they<00:04:13.790> were<00:04:13.850> still<00:04:14.090> going<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.450> chapter<00:04:14.750> 20<00:04:15.110> and

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
so things like that I mean that might

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.580 
so things like that I mean that might
sound<00:04:17.570> crazy<00:04:17.780> but<00:04:17.959> actually<00:04:18.350> when<00:04:18.470> you're

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
sound crazy but actually when you're

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.170 
sound crazy but actually when you're
kind<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.370> in<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.640> book<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.910> you're<00:04:20.030> very

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.000 
kind of in the book and you're very
immersed<00:04:20.690> in<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.410> often<00:04:21.709> don't<00:04:21.859> see

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
immersed in it you often don't see

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.409 
immersed in it you often don't see
things<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.490> can<00:04:22.580> be<00:04:22.610> quite<00:04:22.790> obvious<00:04:22.910> even

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
things it can be quite obvious even

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.700 
things it can be quite obvious even
little<00:04:23.780> things<00:04:23.810> like<00:04:24.050> characters<00:04:24.530> whose

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
little things like characters whose

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.800 
little things like characters whose
names<00:04:24.950> are<00:04:25.160> too<00:04:25.280> familiar<00:04:25.460> too<00:04:25.940> similar<00:04:26.150> like

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
names are too familiar too similar like

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.659

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.610 
I had a Gary and a Greg that wasn't
working<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.419> just<00:04:30.050> kind<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.320> simple<00:04:30.590> things

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
working and just kind of simple things

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.700 
working and just kind of simple things
like<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.760> obviously<00:04:32.500> when<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.620> go

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.230 
like that and and obviously when you go
back<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.010> read<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.160> if<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.520> isn't<00:04:34.700> working

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
back and read it if it isn't working

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.780 
back and read it if it isn't working
you're<00:04:35.660> just<00:04:35.840> going<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.020> have<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:36.550> accept<00:04:37.550> it

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
you're just going to have to accept it

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.940 
you're just going to have to accept it
and<00:04:37.970> go<00:04:38.600> back<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.050> big<00:04:39.200> rewrite<00:04:39.530> because

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
and go back and do a big rewrite because

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.440 
and go back and do a big rewrite because
there's<00:04:40.130> no<00:04:40.340> point<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.729> sending<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.090> out<00:04:41.180> if

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
there's no point in sending it out if

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.330 
there's no point in sending it out if
it's<00:04:41.870> not<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.169> best<00:04:42.440> work<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.100> can<00:04:43.220> be

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
it's not the best work that it can be

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.590 
it's not the best work that it can be
and<00:04:43.430> if<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:43.640> not<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.850> best<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.150> can<00:04:44.300> do<00:04:44.419> I

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
you have to put it all in before you

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.930 
you have to put it all in before you
take<00:05:03.539> things<00:05:03.810> out<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.319> said<00:05:04.949> earlier<00:05:05.250> that<00:05:05.310> the

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
take things out I said earlier that the

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.180 
take things out I said earlier that the
decision<00:05:06.360> as<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.660> what<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.050> leave<00:05:07.259> out<00:05:07.440> is<00:05:07.620> as

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
decision as to what you leave out is as

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.309 
decision as to what you leave out is as
important<00:05:08.669> as<00:05:08.759> to<00:05:08.880> what<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.180> keep<00:05:09.360> in<00:05:09.599> but

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
important as to what you keep in but

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.589 
important as to what you keep in but
often<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:11.430> can<00:05:11.580> only<00:05:11.759> make<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.210> decision

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
often you can only make the decision

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.659 
often you can only make the decision
about<00:05:12.690> what<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.199> leave<00:05:13.410> out<00:05:13.590> after<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.430> put

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
about what you leave out after you put

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.180 
about what you leave out after you put
it<00:05:14.789> in<00:05:16.520> Hemingway<00:05:17.520> argued<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:19.190> correctly

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
it in Hemingway argued and correctly

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.870 
it in Hemingway argued and correctly
that<00:05:21.620> he<00:05:22.620> called<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:22.979> iceberg<00:05:23.400> theory

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
that he called it the iceberg theory

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.070 
that he called it the iceberg theory
that<00:05:24.870> when<00:05:25.169> you<00:05:25.380> take<00:05:25.650> something<00:05:25.979> out<00:05:27.080> having

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
that when you take something out having

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.439 
that when you take something out having
written<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.710> put<00:05:28.889> it<00:05:29.009> in<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:30.030> reader<00:05:30.240> will

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
written it and put it in the reader will

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.969 
written it and put it in the reader will
know<00:05:30.570> it<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:32.210> he's<00:05:33.210> right<00:05:33.479> but<00:05:34.470> it<00:05:34.590> has<00:05:34.800> to

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
know it and he's right but it has to

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.730 
know it and he's right but it has to
have<00:05:35.130> been<00:05:35.310> written<00:05:36.349> first

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
have been written first

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.680 
have been written first
you<00:05:38.039> write<00:05:38.460> something<00:05:38.669> that's<00:05:38.849> 400<00:05:39.240> pages<00:05:39.389> and

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
you write something that's 400 pages and

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.649 
you write something that's 400 pages and
the<00:05:40.199> first<00:05:40.409> word<00:05:40.909> leads<00:05:41.909> to<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.150> second<00:05:42.479> word

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
the first word leads to the second word

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.499 
the first word leads to the second word
leads<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.770> third<00:05:43.800> word<00:05:44.220> so<00:05:44.729> there<00:05:45.300> is

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
leads to the third word so there is

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.149 
leads to the third word so there is
there<00:05:45.840> they<00:05:46.080> are<00:05:46.110> like<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.440> line<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.979> dominoes

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
there they are like a line of dominoes

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.310 
there they are like a line of dominoes
one<00:05:48.060> thing<00:05:48.330> knocking<00:05:48.690> down<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.050> next

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
one thing knocking down the next

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.589 
one thing knocking down the next
knocking<00:05:49.470> down<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:49.919> third<00:05:50.130> so<00:05:50.970> there's<00:05:51.180> there

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
knocking down the third so there's there

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.420 
knocking down the third so there's there
is<00:05:51.630> that<00:05:51.840> there<00:05:52.020> is<00:05:52.139> an<00:05:52.289> internal<00:05:52.889> coherence

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
is that there is an internal coherence

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.089 
is that there is an internal coherence
in<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.820> material<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.539> there<00:05:55.229> is<00:05:55.349> a<00:05:55.380> sub<00:05:55.889> l'm

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
in the material and there is a sub l'm

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.110 
in the material and there is a sub l'm
sublimated<00:05:57.030> code<00:05:57.590> there<00:05:58.590> is<00:05:58.620> a

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
sublimated code there is a

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.249 
sublimated code there is a
directionality<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.620> connectedness<00:06:03.259> when

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
directionality and connectedness when

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.170 
directionality and connectedness when
you<00:06:04.349> take<00:06:04.560> something<00:06:04.830> out<00:06:05.130> all<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.969> words

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
you take something out all the words

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.510 
you take something out all the words
leading<00:06:06.719> up<00:06:06.840> to<00:06:06.870> that<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:07.979> then<00:06:08.219> all<00:06:08.340> the

leading up to that and then all the

buried code pertaining to that missing

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.770 
buried code pertaining to that missing
material<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:17.759> the<00:06:17.849> reader<00:06:18.060> will<00:06:18.270> pick<00:06:18.449> up<00:06:18.599> on

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
material and the reader will pick up on

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.870 
material and the reader will pick up on
it<00:06:18.810> nice<00:06:19.770> doesn't<00:06:20.070> let's<00:06:20.280> go<00:06:20.370> back<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.699> read

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
it nice doesn't let's go back and read

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.700 
it nice doesn't let's go back and read
books<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.240> I've<00:06:21.449> written<00:06:21.570> and<00:06:22.259> I<00:06:22.409> still

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
books that I've written and I still

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.200 
books that I've written and I still
consume<00:06:23.070> it's<00:06:23.310> things<00:06:23.639> that<00:06:23.699> I<00:06:23.820> would<00:06:24.000> change

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
consume it's things that I would change

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.310 
consume it's things that I would change
so<00:06:24.360> I<00:06:24.389> don't<00:06:24.630> think<00:06:24.690> you're<00:06:24.870> ever<00:06:24.990> really

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
so I don't think you're ever really

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.439 
so I don't think you're ever really
finished<00:06:25.650> however<00:06:26.159> you<00:06:26.789> have<00:06:27.030> to<00:06:27.210> at<00:06:27.330> some

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
finished however you have to at some

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.600 
finished however you have to at some
point<00:06:27.509> just<00:06:27.990> draw<00:06:28.710> a<00:06:28.740> line<00:06:28.860> in<00:06:29.009> the<00:06:29.099> sand<00:06:29.280> so

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
point just draw a line in the sand so

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.820 
point just draw a line in the sand so
I'm<00:06:30.270> I<00:06:30.539> think<00:06:30.599> it<00:06:30.930> was<00:06:31.110> very<00:06:31.289> important<00:06:31.650> to<00:06:31.710> go

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
I'm I think it was very important to go

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.469 
I'm I think it was very important to go
over<00:06:32.130> and<00:06:32.340> go<00:06:32.460> over<00:06:32.699> and<00:06:32.909> make<00:06:33.000> it<00:06:33.120> the<00:06:33.210> best<00:06:33.330> it

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
over and go over and make it the best it

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:34.760 
over and go over and make it the best it
can<00:06:33.570> be<00:06:33.630> and<00:06:33.750> step<00:06:34.050> away<00:06:34.169> from<00:06:34.320> which<00:06:34.530> I<00:06:34.590> come

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
can be and step away from which I come

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.560 
can be and step away from which I come
back<00:06:34.919> to<00:06:35.070> us<00:06:35.190> and<00:06:35.430> do<00:06:35.909> all<00:06:36.060> those<00:06:36.270> kind<00:06:36.539> of

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
back to us and do all those kind of

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.570 
back to us and do all those kind of
things<00:06:36.860> but<00:06:37.860> then<00:06:38.099> there<00:06:38.250> comes<00:06:38.310> a<00:06:38.460> point

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
things but then there comes a point

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.920 
things but then there comes a point
where<00:06:38.759> you<00:06:38.820> just<00:06:38.849> have<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.300> let<00:06:39.419> it<00:06:39.479> go<00:06:39.690> because

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
where you just have to let it go because

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.629 
where you just have to let it go because
you<00:06:40.169> can<00:06:40.320> keep<00:06:40.560> going<00:06:40.770> over<00:06:41.099> for<00:06:41.130> the<00:06:41.340> rest<00:06:41.430> of

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
you can keep going over for the rest of

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.279 
you can keep going over for the rest of
your<00:06:41.759> life<00:06:41.880> when<00:06:42.449> it's<00:06:42.599> the<00:06:42.690> best<00:06:42.960> it<00:06:43.110> can<00:06:43.229> be

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
your life when it's the best it can be

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.499 
your life when it's the best it can be
when<00:06:43.949> you're<00:06:44.070> almost<00:06:44.250> sick<00:06:44.759> of<00:06:45.000> looking<00:06:45.360> at<00:06:45.449> it

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
when you're almost sick of looking at it

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:46.670 
when you're almost sick of looking at it
on<00:06:45.659> you're<00:06:45.780> almost<00:06:45.900> sick<00:06:46.169> of<00:06:46.259> your<00:06:46.349> characters

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
on you're almost sick of your characters

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.100 
on you're almost sick of your characters
I'm<00:06:46.800> nothing<00:06:47.039> normal<00:06:47.460> emotion<00:06:48.120> by<00:06:48.270> the<00:06:48.330> way<00:06:48.509> so

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
I'm nothing normal emotion by the way so
