my<00:03:28.389> pollito<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.079> take<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.290> wild<00:03:29.530> charge<00:03:29.739> I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
my pollito to take the wild charge I

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.500 
my pollito to take the wild charge I
believe<00:03:30.370> at<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:30.609> point<00:03:30.730> politoed<00:03:31.239> wasn't

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
believe at this point politoed wasn't

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.869 
believe at this point politoed wasn't
too<00:03:31.629> much<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:32.230> big<00:03:32.409> deal<00:03:32.439> to<00:03:32.680> me<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.129> I

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
too much of a big deal to me and I

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.490 
too much of a big deal to me and I
didn't<00:03:34.090> really<00:03:34.150> care<00:03:34.480> about<00:03:34.629> him<00:03:34.900> too<00:03:34.930> much<00:03:35.200> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
didn't really care about him too much so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.289 
didn't really care about him too much so
instead<00:03:36.189> I'm<00:03:36.430> gonna<00:03:36.549> go<00:03:36.700> back<00:03:36.879> out<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.209> my

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.629 
so at this point he's just gonna protect
stall<00:04:31.690> me<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.900> didn't<00:04:32.409> really<00:04:32.800> see<00:04:32.949> it<00:04:33.190> coming<00:04:33.490> I

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
stall me I didn't really see it coming I

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.610 
stall me I didn't really see it coming I
went<00:04:34.120> for<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.389> Shadow<00:04:34.659> Ball<00:04:34.930> hoping<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.500> just

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
went for the Shadow Ball hoping to just

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.700 
went for the Shadow Ball hoping to just
kill<00:04:36.099> him<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.430> be<00:04:37.330> done<00:04:37.360> with<00:04:37.840> him<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.229> didn't

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
kill him and be done with him but didn't

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.080 
kill him and be done with him but didn't
I<00:04:38.800> guess<00:04:39.039> I<00:04:39.159> should<00:04:39.310> have<00:04:39.400> gone<00:04:39.490> for<00:04:39.639> Thunder

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
I guess I should have gone for Thunder

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.370 
I guess I should have gone for Thunder
because<00:04:40.240> apparently<00:04:40.570> Thunder<00:04:41.020> in<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.229> rain

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
because apparently Thunder in the rain

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.050 
because apparently Thunder in the rain
has<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.740> chance<00:04:41.979> to<00:04:42.099> break<00:04:42.340> through<00:04:42.610> protect

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
has the chance to break through protect

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.659 
has the chance to break through protect
I<00:04:43.270> never<00:04:43.930> seen<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.320> happen<00:04:44.620> before<00:04:44.650> but<00:04:45.490> that's

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
I never seen it happen before but that's

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.600 
I never seen it happen before but that's
what<00:04:45.849> my<00:04:46.060> sources<00:04:46.389> tell<00:04:46.449> me<00:04:46.659> so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
what my sources tell me so

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.770 
what my sources tell me so
I<00:04:47.669> don't<00:04:47.879> know<00:04:47.969> I<00:04:48.150> probably<00:04:48.360> should<00:04:48.569> have<00:04:48.599> done

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
I don't know I probably should have done

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.050 
I don't know I probably should have done
that<00:04:48.810> anyway<00:04:49.590> he's<00:04:50.310> gonna<00:04:50.430> go<00:04:50.610> try<00:04:50.819> it<00:04:50.849> into

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
that anyway he's gonna go try it into

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
I didn't see that coming the entire game

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.939 
I didn't see that coming the entire game
I<00:05:21.539> didn't<00:05:21.960> realize<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.319> he<00:05:22.590> was<00:05:22.620> running<00:05:22.889> a

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
I didn't realize that he was running a

I didn't realize that he was running a
scar<00:05:23.189> stores<00:05:23.550> back<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.900> turns<00:05:25.169> out<00:05:25.259> just

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
scar stores back and it turns out just

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:26.950 
scar stores back and it turns out just
to<00:05:25.529> bite<00:05:25.680> me<00:05:25.800> in<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:25.889> ass<00:05:25.949> because<00:05:26.370> I'm

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
to bite me in the ass because I'm

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.309 
to bite me in the ass because I'm
although<00:05:27.960> he<00:05:28.229> is<00:05:28.610> he<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:30.060> can't<00:05:30.719> even<00:05:30.930> kill<00:05:31.169> him

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
although he is he I can't even kill him

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
with an ice punch and that's probably

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.399 
with an ice punch and that's probably
because<00:05:33.029> i<00:05:33.150> don't<00:05:33.360> have<00:05:33.389> an<00:05:33.539> item<00:05:33.900> if<00:05:34.110> only<00:05:34.229> i

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
because i don't have an item if only i

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.140 
because i don't have an item if only i
had<00:05:34.500> choice<00:05:34.949> band<00:05:35.219> equipped<00:05:35.610> then<00:05:35.849> i<00:05:36.000> could

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
had choice band equipped then i could

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.580 
had choice band equipped then i could
have<00:05:36.240> been<00:05:36.330> able<00:05:36.479> to<00:05:36.569> do<00:05:36.659> something<00:05:36.930> but<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.289> go

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
have been able to do something but I go

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.839 
have been able to do something but I go
for<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.800> Aquajet<00:05:38.099> just<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.490> try<00:05:38.639> and<00:05:38.669> finish

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
for the Aquajet just to try and finish

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.279 
for the Aquajet just to try and finish
him<00:05:38.969> off<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.300> make<00:05:39.449> it<00:05:39.569> closer<00:05:39.870> but<00:05:40.169> he

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
him off and make it closer but he

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.409 
him off and make it closer but he
predicts<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:40.800> again<00:05:41.189> goes<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.909> a<00:05:41.939> poor<00:05:42.330> ian

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
predicts that again goes to a poor ian

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.600 
predicts that again goes to a poor ian
gets<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:42.990> water<00:05:43.139> absorb<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:43.740> finishes<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.490> in

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
gets the water absorb and finishes it in

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.869 
gets the water absorb and finishes it in
style<00:05:44.879> so<00:05:45.569> I'm<00:05:45.779> that<00:05:46.680> was<00:05:46.800> from<00:05:46.979> a<00:05:47.009> stream<00:05:47.460> game

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
style so I'm that was from a stream game

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
I think it's from a night a few weeks

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.369 
I think it's from a night a few weeks
ago<00:05:50.310> when<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.669> just<00:05:51.000> was<00:05:51.180> playing<00:05:51.539> terribly<00:05:52.080> and
