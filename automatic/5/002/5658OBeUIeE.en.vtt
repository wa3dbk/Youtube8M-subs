00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
the two sides you can make this thing

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.770 
the two sides you can make this thing
rip<00:01:43.100> across<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.640> top<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.090> water<00:01:44.299> it's

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
rip across the top of the water it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.510 
rip across the top of the water it's
pretty<00:01:44.990> cool<00:01:45.200> little<00:01:45.469> device<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.219> that's

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
pretty cool little device so that's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.719 
pretty cool little device so that's
that's<00:01:46.969> pretty<00:01:47.270> neat<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.570> see<00:01:48.369> for<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.430> kids

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
that's pretty neat to see for the kids

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.670 
that's pretty neat to see for the kids
the<00:01:50.000> bedroom<00:01:50.509> tanks<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.290> little<00:01:51.500> office

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
the bedroom tanks the little office

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.429 
the bedroom tanks the little office
tanks<00:01:52.430> these<00:01:53.149> are<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.479> little<00:01:53.630> jelly<00:01:53.990> traps

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
tanks these are the little jelly traps

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.330 
tanks these are the little jelly traps
so<00:01:54.770> these<00:01:54.950> things<00:01:55.280> are<00:01:56.409> called<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.530> jelly<00:01:57.860> flap

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
so these things are called a jelly flap

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.179 
so these things are called a jelly flap
and<00:01:59.259> you<00:02:00.259> know<00:02:00.380> these<00:02:00.649> things<00:02:00.890> are<00:02:01.039> really

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
and you know these things are really

and you know these things are really
kind<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.520> cool<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:02.509> really<00:02:02.960> do<00:02:03.079> like<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.530> jelly

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
kind of cool I really do like the jelly

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.310 
kind of cool I really do like the jelly
flap<00:02:04.070> they<00:02:04.369> come<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:05.200> two<00:02:06.200> different

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
flap they come in two different

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.320 
flap they come in two different
configurations<00:02:07.280> as<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.520> can<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.880> complete

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
configurations as you can see a complete

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.300 
configurations as you can see a complete
see-through<00:02:08.810> version<00:02:09.230> and<00:02:09.410> then<00:02:09.890> one<00:02:10.130> that

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
see-through version and then one that

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.220 
see-through version and then one that
has<00:02:10.490> more<00:02:10.760> of<00:02:10.820> an<00:02:10.910> LED<00:02:11.330> with<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.600> background<00:02:11.870> in

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
has more of an LED with a background in

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.320 
has more of an LED with a background in
the<00:02:12.320> back<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.310> particular<00:02:13.820> black<00:02:14.060> one

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
the back and that particular black one

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.890 
the back and that particular black one
here<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.690> can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
here you can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.750 
here you can
get<00:02:15.019> with<00:02:15.170> different<00:02:15.500> rims<00:02:15.709> like<00:02:16.099> green<00:02:16.430> and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760

pink and so forth they're compact and
when<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.489> actually<00:02:19.689> buy<00:02:20.689> the<00:02:20.750> unit<00:02:21.379> all<00:02:22.340> you

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
when you actually buy the unit all you

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.130 
when you actually buy the unit all you
got<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.790> do<00:02:22.909> is<00:02:23.060> put<00:02:23.120> their<00:02:23.390> little<00:02:23.510> filter<00:02:23.780> pad

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
got to do is put their little filter pad

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.339 
got to do is put their little filter pad
in<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.849> throw<00:02:25.849> their<00:02:26.030> little<00:02:26.269> carbon<00:02:27.110> source

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
in and throw their little carbon source

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.800 
in and throw their little carbon source
in<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.069> basically<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.239> kind<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.540> plug

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
in and then basically it's kind of plug

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.690 
in and then basically it's kind of plug
and<00:02:30.019> play<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.439> every<00:02:31.010> month<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.549> do<00:02:31.670> a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and play and every month you just do a

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.119 
and play and every month you just do a
little<00:02:32.049> change<00:02:33.049> out<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.290> those<00:02:33.470> filter<00:02:33.859> pads

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
little change out of those filter pads

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.030 
little change out of those filter pads
and<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.879> carbon<00:02:35.120> media<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.590> know<00:02:36.709> change

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
and the carbon media and you know change

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.220 
and the carbon media and you know change
your<00:02:37.189> water<00:02:37.400> weekly<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.659> little<00:02:38.810> jellies

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
your water weekly and the little jellies

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.020 
your water weekly and the little jellies
can<00:02:39.260> live<00:02:39.560> up<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.920> year<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.790> can<00:02:40.909> even

a<00:02:54.920> lot<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.129> nano<00:02:55.400> stuff<00:02:55.760> coming<00:02:56.120> out<00:02:56.209> it's

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
a lot of nano stuff coming out it's

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.379 
a lot of nano stuff coming out it's
pretty<00:02:56.540> trendy<00:02:57.159> it's<00:02:58.159> a<00:02:58.340> little<00:02:58.609> light<00:02:58.819> that

about<00:03:03.439> this<00:03:03.889> is<00:03:04.159> the<00:03:04.280> interface<00:03:04.549> on<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.329> is

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
about this is the interface on it is

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.349 
about this is the interface on it is
pretty<00:03:06.109> much<00:03:06.290> gone<00:03:06.680> wireless<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.639> once<00:03:08.239> you
