00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
such as the gyroscope feature which the

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.189 
such as the gyroscope feature which the
iPad<00:00:26.859> at<00:00:27.160> one<00:00:27.429> does<00:00:27.730> not<00:00:27.939> have<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:29.019> I<00:00:29.050> just

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
want to say this is quite a big

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.600 
want to say this is quite a big
difference<00:00:30.849> in<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.839> in<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.770> device<00:00:33.070> itself

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
difference in the in the device itself

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.389 
difference in the in the device itself
as<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.510> gives<00:00:35.140> you<00:00:35.320> more<00:00:35.530> precision<00:00:35.920> in<00:00:36.219> the

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
as it gives you more precision in the

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.700 
as it gives you more precision in the
game<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:36.910> more<00:00:37.450> accuracy<00:00:37.930> when<00:00:38.410> you're

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
game and more accuracy when you're

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.100 
game and more accuracy when you're
moving<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.789> device<00:00:40.090> around<00:00:40.329> to<00:00:40.629> control

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
moving the device around to control

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.439 
moving the device around to control
various<00:00:41.770> characters<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:42.789> whatnot<00:00:43.180> in<00:00:43.210> the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
this game on my iPad one in comparison

this game on my iPad one in comparison
to<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.630> iPad<00:02:12.020> 2<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.740> notice<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.190> iPad<00:02:13.580> 2<00:02:13.910> is

to the iPad 2 and I notice the iPad 2 is

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.060 
to the iPad 2 and I notice the iPad 2 is
much<00:02:14.810> more<00:02:15.140> responsive<00:02:16.010> than<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:18.350> iPad<00:02:18.770> one

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
much more responsive than the iPad one

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.040 
much more responsive than the iPad one
due<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.150> having<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.990> gyroscope<00:02:21.950> feature

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
due to it having the gyroscope feature
