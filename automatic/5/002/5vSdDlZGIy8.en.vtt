00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430 
all right I'm getting to the point where

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.170 
all right I'm getting to the point where
I'm<00:00:09.670> just<00:00:09.910> about<00:00:10.660> done<00:00:10.720> here<00:00:11.940> I've<00:00:12.940> got<00:00:13.150> a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
I'm just about done here I've got a

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.980 
I'm just about done here I've got a
tester<00:00:13.690> on

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
tester on

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.620 
tester on
boiler<00:00:14.410> here<00:00:14.769> and<00:00:15.760> when<00:00:16.000> I<00:00:16.029> opened<00:00:16.360> the<00:00:16.420> valve

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
boiler here and when I opened the valve

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.480 
boiler here and when I opened the valve
it<00:00:16.960> blows<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.200> lot<00:00:17.439> of<00:00:17.560> steam<00:00:17.770> out<00:00:17.980> I<00:00:18.010> might<00:00:18.340> do

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
it blows a lot of steam out I might do

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.980 
it blows a lot of steam out I might do
another<00:00:18.700> test<00:00:19.029> run<00:00:19.180> just<00:00:19.539> to<00:00:19.630> put<00:00:19.779> it<00:00:19.869> on

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
another test run just to put it on

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.109 
another test run just to put it on
camera<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.570> right<00:00:23.020> now<00:00:23.200> I'm<00:00:23.439> working<00:00:23.619> on<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
camera and right now I'm working on the

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.370 
camera and right now I'm working on the
valve<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:27.849> here<00:00:27.910> this<00:00:28.750> is<00:00:28.930> going<00:00:29.079> to<00:00:29.169> open

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
valve right here this is going to open

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.790 
valve right here this is going to open
and<00:00:29.650> close<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.629> opens<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:35.320> exhaust<00:00:35.620> to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
and close and as it opens the exhaust to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.119 
and close and as it opens the exhaust to
come<00:00:35.830> out<00:00:36.160> there<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.400> when<00:00:36.699> it<00:00:36.820> closes<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
come out there and when it closes that

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.700 
come out there and when it closes that
it's<00:00:39.340> going<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.790> that's<00:00:40.089> when<00:00:40.360> this<00:00:40.570> is<00:00:40.720> for

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
it's going to that's when this is for

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:52.889 
it's going to that's when this is for
forward<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.460> spend<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.940> flywheel

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.029 

okay<00:00:53.899> never<00:00:54.140> gets<00:00:54.350> camera<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.770> cooperate<00:00:57.039> so

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
okay never gets camera to cooperate so

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.319 
okay never gets camera to cooperate so
what<00:00:58.250> I've<00:00:58.340> got<00:00:58.550> here<00:00:59.890> this<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:01.070> my<00:01:01.219> next<00:01:01.760> my

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
what I've got here this is my next my

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:13.670 
what I've got here this is my next my
other<00:01:02.570> actual<00:01:02.989> waiting<00:01:03.290> rod<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:07.100> linkage

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 

you'll<00:01:14.340> notice<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> flywheel<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.750> here

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you'll notice on the flywheel right here

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:25.760 
you'll notice on the flywheel right here
I've<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:17.240> roller<00:01:19.550> attached<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:24.770> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
I've got a roller attached to it now and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030 
I've got a roller attached to it now and
this<00:01:26.210> this<00:01:27.210> other<00:01:27.750> tubing<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.590> mounted

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
this this other tubing will be mounted

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
this this other tubing will be mounted
right<00:01:29.070> next<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.760> tubing<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:31.050> about

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
right next to this tubing right about

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.670 
right next to this tubing right about
this<00:01:31.590> area<00:01:31.860> somewhere<00:01:33.260> and<00:01:34.260> then<00:01:34.380> when<00:01:34.560> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
this area somewhere and then when this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.230 
this area somewhere and then when this
roller<00:01:34.950> comes<00:01:35.280> down<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.760> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> hit<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
roller comes down it's going to hit the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.990 
roller comes down it's going to hit the
actuator<00:01:38.270> forcing<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> open<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.850> as

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
actuator forcing this open and just as

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.440 
actuator forcing this open and just as
it<00:01:42.210> gets<00:01:42.450> open<00:01:42.900> this<00:01:43.610> will<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:44.880> clear<00:01:45.180> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it gets open this will will clear that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.050 
it gets open this will will clear that
and<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> spring<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.640> forced

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and with a spring this will be forced

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.320 
and with a spring this will be forced
back<00:01:48.210> closed<00:01:49.100> forcing<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> flywheel<00:01:51.119> on

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
back closed forcing the flywheel on

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.320 
back closed forcing the flywheel on
around<00:01:51.540> again<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:53.070> order<00:01:53.580> just<00:01:53.820> keep

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
around again and order just keep

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.010 
around again and order just keep
repeating<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:54.840> motion<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:57.540> steams

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
repeating that motion that steams

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.760 
repeating that motion that steams
Forster<00:01:59.570> hopefully<00:02:00.570> hopefully<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.500> works

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
Forster hopefully hopefully this works

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.770 
Forster hopefully hopefully this works
if<00:02:02.040> you're<00:02:02.190> going<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.580> not<00:02:02.700> sure<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:03.450> else<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
if you're going I'm not sure what else I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.900 
if you're going I'm not sure what else I
want<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.140> I'll<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.560> come<00:02:05.550> up<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
want to do I'll have to come up with a

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.100 
want to do I'll have to come up with a
different<00:02:06.119> design<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.929> will

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
different design but I think this will

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.979 
different design but I think this will
work

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
work

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.259

not well this is my valve for the
exhaust<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> screen<00:02:35.400> I

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.370 

haven't<00:02:39.209> got<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.360> hooked<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.720> my<00:02:39.840> rod<00:02:40.080> yet

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
haven't got it hooked to my rod yet

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.979 
haven't got it hooked to my rod yet
because<00:02:41.030> still<00:02:42.030> figuring<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.570> part<00:02:42.840> out

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
because still figuring that part out

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.509 
because still figuring that part out
though<00:02:43.260> I've<00:02:43.350> got<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.980> linkage<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
though I've got all the linkage and

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.270 
though I've got all the linkage and
everything<00:02:44.820> else<00:02:45.000> figured<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.980> I'm<00:02:47.100> going

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
everything else figured out so I'm going

everything else figured out so I'm going
to<00:02:47.340> I'm<00:02:47.670> going<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:48.739> act<00:02:49.739> like<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.610> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
to I'm going to act like this is on a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.370 
to I'm going to act like this is on a
spring<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.299> can<00:02:51.450> see<00:02:51.630> how<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.930> works<00:02:52.110> down

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
spring so you can see how it works down

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.920 
spring so you can see how it works down
here<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.890> got<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.310> roller<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:54.330> guck<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
here I got this roller this guck that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.960 
here I got this roller this guck that
runs<00:02:55.230> into<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:59.670> part

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
runs into this in here and this part

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.479 
runs into this in here and this part
that<00:03:00.470> since<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.829> spring<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:02.340> going

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
that since it's on the spring it's going

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.170 
that since it's on the spring it's going
to<00:03:02.549> reload<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.140> backwards<00:03:04.140> every<00:03:04.290> time<00:03:04.620> so

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
to reload this backwards every time so

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.690 
to reload this backwards every time so
as<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.480> comes<00:03:06.690> down<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.140> hits<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.700> and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
as this comes down and hits it and

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.819 
as this comes down and hits it and
pushes<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.329> forward<00:03:09.510> which<00:03:09.930> pushes<00:03:10.680> that

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
pushes it forward which pushes that

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.270 
pushes it forward which pushes that
forward<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.430> opens<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:13.950> as<00:03:14.130> it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
forward and opens that and then as it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.400 
forward and opens that and then as it
comes<00:03:14.489> on<00:03:14.640> around<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.360> comes<00:03:15.630> up<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.049> clears

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
comes on around it comes up and clears

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.350 
comes on around it comes up and clears
it<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.860> when<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.489> clears<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.060> spring

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
it and when it clears that the spring

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.380 
it and when it clears that the spring
will<00:03:18.570> push<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.900> back<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.670> will<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:20.850> set<00:03:21.120> for

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
will push it back and it will be set for

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.129 
will push it back and it will be set for
the<00:03:21.540> next<00:03:21.780> time<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.079> comes<00:03:22.200> around<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.959> like

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
the next time it comes around just like

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:34.869 
the next time it comes around just like
this

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.979 

kind<00:03:35.879> of<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.030> tricky<00:03:36.269> design<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:38.870> don't<00:03:39.870> even

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
kind of a tricky design I don't even

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.850 
kind of a tricky design I don't even
know<00:03:40.170> if<00:03:40.230> it'll<00:03:40.440> work<00:03:40.500> yet<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:43.290> looks<00:03:43.500> like<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
know if it'll work yet it looks like it

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.490 
know if it'll work yet it looks like it
should

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
should

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.559 
should
songs<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.739> don't<00:03:47.700> push<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:47.879> back<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.299> forward

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
songs I don't push it back to forward

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.539 
songs I don't push it back to forward
but<00:03:48.810> my<00:03:48.930> screen<00:03:49.260> will<00:03:49.500> control<00:03:49.860> how<00:03:50.040> far<00:03:50.250> goes

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
but my screen will control how far goes

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.809 
but my screen will control how far goes
back<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> shouldn't<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.190> problem

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
back so I shouldn't have that problem

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.289 
back so I shouldn't have that problem
it's<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.269> I'm<00:03:54.420> pushing<00:03:54.780> too<00:03:54.959> far<00:03:56.150> it's<00:03:57.150> only

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
it's just I'm pushing too far it's only

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:06.289 
it's just I'm pushing too far it's only
going<00:03:57.599> to<00:03:57.690> move<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.110> far<00:04:00.200> should<00:04:01.200> hit<00:04:05.299> just

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
going to move that far should hit just

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.650 
going to move that far should hit just
as<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.599> comes<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.859> clears<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.209> end<00:04:09.450> of

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
as it comes just as it clears the end of

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.009 
as it comes just as it clears the end of
its<00:04:09.810> road<00:04:10.590> here<00:04:11.540> starts<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.690> its<00:04:12.780> downward

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
its road here starts on its downward

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.640 
its road here starts on its downward
path<00:04:13.379> it<00:04:13.680> should<00:04:13.890> hit<00:04:14.069> this<00:04:15.019> push<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.229> forward

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
path it should hit this push it forward

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.820 
path it should hit this push it forward
open<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.760> way<00:04:20.269> it<00:04:21.269> allows<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:22.169> instead

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
open this that way it allows it instead

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.500 
open this that way it allows it instead
of<00:04:22.979> pushing<00:04:23.190> steam<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:23.789> this<00:04:23.970> way

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
of pushing steam up this way

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.020 
of pushing steam up this way
it<00:04:24.930> all<00:04:25.199> comes<00:04:25.470> out<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.889> way<00:04:26.130> as<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.699> exhausts

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
it all comes out this way as it exhausts

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.240 
it all comes out this way as it exhausts
I<00:04:32.570> hope<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.720> works

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
I hope it works

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
I hope it works
the<00:04:35.250> don't<00:04:35.490> I'll<00:04:35.669> have<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.910> figure<00:04:36.210> out

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
the don't I'll have to figure out

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.339 
the don't I'll have to figure out
something<00:04:36.599> else<00:04:37.250> I've<00:04:38.250> done<00:04:38.639> got<00:04:39.360> more<00:04:39.900> hours

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
something else I've done got more hours

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.620 
something else I've done got more hours
in<00:04:40.380> this<00:04:40.740> part<00:04:41.070> I'll<00:04:41.430> do<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.700> whole<00:04:41.880> thing<00:04:42.590> so

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
in this part I'll do the whole thing so

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:55.070 
in this part I'll do the whole thing so
it<00:04:45.630> will<00:04:45.870> keep<00:04:46.020> moving<00:04:46.229> forward<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:54.840> is<00:04:55.050> the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
it will keep moving forward this is the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.110 
it will keep moving forward this is the
end<00:04:55.289> of<00:04:55.380> my<00:04:55.470> linkage<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:56.160> got<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.729> hook<00:04:56.849> it<00:04:56.970> up<00:04:57.060> to

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
end of my linkage I got to hook it up to

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.310 
end of my linkage I got to hook it up to
here<00:04:57.389> somehow

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.310 

I'm<00:05:01.320> hoping<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.800> don't<00:05:02.039> travel<00:05:02.310> too<00:05:02.669> far<00:05:03.320> for

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
I'm hoping this don't travel too far for

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.180 
I'm hoping this don't travel too far for
this<00:05:06.139> if<00:05:07.139> it<00:05:07.289> does<00:05:07.500> that's<00:05:07.800> going<00:05:08.039> to<00:05:08.099> be<00:05:08.160> a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
this if it does that's going to be a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.560 
this if it does that's going to be a
problem<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.760> don't<00:05:09.000> know<00:05:09.090> what<00:05:09.300> I'm<00:05:09.389> going<00:05:09.539> to

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
problem I don't know what I'm going to

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.710 
problem I don't know what I'm going to
do<00:05:09.690> there<00:05:11.539> I'll<00:05:12.539> figure<00:05:12.780> something<00:05:13.260> out

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
do there I'll figure something out

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.600 
do there I'll figure something out
that's<00:05:15.720> where<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:15.990> stops<00:05:16.229> so<00:05:19.370> that<00:05:20.370> should<00:05:20.580> be

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
that's where it stops so that should be

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.100 
that's where it stops so that should be
perfect<00:05:21.210> right<00:05:21.419> there

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.710 

so<00:05:25.110> that's<00:05:25.349> got<00:05:25.560> our<00:05:25.680> opened<00:05:26.009> up<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.340> far

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.640 

that<00:05:30.720> should<00:05:30.900> be<00:05:30.960> perfect

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
that should be perfect

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:51.950 
that should be perfect
so<00:05:32.280> we'll<00:05:32.520> see<00:05:49.069> all<00:05:50.069> right<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:50.580> think<00:05:50.970> I<00:05:51.539> figured

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
so we'll see all right I think I figured

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.510 
so we'll see all right I think I figured
it<00:05:52.199> out<00:05:52.409> I'm<00:05:52.650> pretty<00:05:52.860> excited<00:05:53.220> at<00:05:53.550> this<00:05:53.759> point

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
it out I'm pretty excited at this point

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.969 
it out I'm pretty excited at this point
but<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.849> got<00:05:57.690> my<00:05:57.960> sprain<00:05:58.289> and<00:05:58.530> linky<00:05:58.800> tucked<00:05:59.039> up

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
but I got my sprain and linky tucked up

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:08.059 
but I got my sprain and linky tucked up
now<00:06:01.979> let's<00:06:06.500> still<00:06:07.500> need<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.770> do<00:06:07.889> a<00:06:07.919> little

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
now let's still need to do a little

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:15.040 
now let's still need to do a little
tweaking<00:06:08.370> don't<00:06:08.759> get<00:06:08.880> me<00:06:08.970> wrong<00:06:10.490> but<00:06:11.490> thank

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.499 

God<00:06:18.229> I'm<00:06:19.229> gonna<00:06:19.320> have<00:06:19.560> to<00:06:20.090> tighten<00:06:21.090> effort

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
God I'm gonna have to tighten effort

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:32.110 
God I'm gonna have to tighten effort
everything<00:06:21.870> up<00:06:22.199> real<00:06:22.440> quick<00:06:27.440> all<00:06:28.440> right

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.589 

see<00:06:33.120> if<00:06:33.180> I'm<00:06:33.360> stay<00:06:33.599> on<00:06:33.719> the<00:06:33.840> show<00:06:34.050> here<00:06:35.449> but<00:06:36.449> I'm

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
see if I'm stay on the show here but I'm

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:49.589 
see if I'm stay on the show here but I'm
just<00:06:36.630> turning<00:06:36.990> slowly<00:06:37.469> here

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.209 

it<00:06:50.599> probably<00:06:50.809> won't<00:06:51.080> move<00:06:51.349> much<00:06:51.589> faster<00:06:51.830> than

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
it probably won't move much faster than

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:56.499 
it probably won't move much faster than
that<00:06:52.309> anyway<00:06:53.770> I<00:06:54.969> still<00:06:55.969> got<00:06:56.149> to<00:06:56.240> do<00:06:56.300> some

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
that anyway I still got to do some

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.669 
that anyway I still got to do some
tweaking<00:06:56.629> because<00:06:57.080> it's<00:06:57.259> not<00:06:57.409> hitting

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:57.679 
tweaking because it's not hitting

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:01.449 
tweaking because it's not hitting
exactly<00:06:58.459> right<00:06:58.699> this<00:06:58.999> thing<00:06:59.240> here<00:06:59.599> my<00:07:00.459> clamp

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:01.459 
exactly right this thing here my clamp

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:06.040 
exactly right this thing here my clamp
here<00:07:01.639> keeps<00:07:01.999> moving<00:07:02.330> on<00:07:02.479> me<00:07:02.659> I<00:07:04.749> gotta<00:07:05.749> come<00:07:06.020> up

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
here keeps moving on me I gotta come up

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.100 
here keeps moving on me I gotta come up
with<00:07:06.169> a<00:07:06.349> better<00:07:06.529> clamp<00:07:06.860> right<00:07:07.159> here<00:07:11.110> because

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
with a better clamp right here because

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:18.989 
with a better clamp right here because
it<00:07:12.259> just<00:07:12.379> won't<00:07:12.709> stay<00:07:13.009> right<00:07:13.789> in<00:07:13.849> line<00:07:14.770> exactly

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:18.999 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.879 

and<00:07:19.999> it's<00:07:20.149> running<00:07:20.419> by<00:07:20.689> hand<00:07:20.959> like<00:07:21.259> that<00:07:21.529> who

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:21.889 
and it's running by hand like that who

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:31.299 
and it's running by hand like that who
knows<00:07:22.099> for<00:07:22.430> the<00:07:22.490> run<00:07:29.919> probably<00:07:30.919> won't<00:07:31.099> I'm

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:31.309 
knows for the run probably won't I'm

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:32.769 
knows for the run probably won't I'm
going<00:07:31.550> to<00:07:31.610> have<00:07:31.729> to<00:07:31.819> do<00:07:31.939> some<00:07:32.119> tweaking<00:07:32.479> yeah

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:32.779 
going to have to do some tweaking yeah

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:44.060 
going to have to do some tweaking yeah
I'm<00:07:33.259> getting<00:07:33.680> there

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.070
