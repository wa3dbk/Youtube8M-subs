 to human anatomy punto net presents 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.930
 muscles of the face and scalp 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.299
 the scalp on the skull is 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.809
 coated by the aponeurosis et and 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.570
 cranial or galia up or neurotic that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.170
 Adhere firmly to the skin and loosely 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.210
 alperi skull backwards it is inserted into 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.630
 the middle third of the curved line 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.340
 superior of the occipital and ahead in 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.269
 the top of the edge 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 supraorbital and to the sides it melts 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.400
 with the temporary aponeurosis above 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.980
 of the zygomatic arch limiting the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.520
 Extension of psuv spills 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.520
 aponeurotic 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.840
 the muscles of the face have the 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.199
 characteristics of participating in 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.879
 facial expressions and to insert in 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:01.030
 the skin the occipital muscle is 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.760
 constituted by two occipital bellies or 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.759
 later in the external two thirds of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.520
 the upper curved line of the occipital and 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.649
 the frontal or anterior that is confused 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.850
 with the handset of the eyelids and 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.909
 pyramidal nose 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.009
 the pyramidal muscle of the nose in the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 skin of the interciliary region and in 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.909
 nasal bones 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.700
 auricular muscles the previous one is 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.259
 small the superior is bigger and fit 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.119
 of fan 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.630
 both muscles are inserted in the face 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.579
 middle of the ear the posterior fills the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.069
 separation between the mastoid portion 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.390
 of the temporal and the cranial surface of 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.470
 ear 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.570
 in terms of actions these muscles 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.230
 participate in facial expressions 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.250
 Orbicular of the eyelids 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.410
 this muscle surrounds the orbital opening 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 the peripheral orbital portion is 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.670
 important and thick and describes a 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.520
 circle of the upper portion of the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.830
 internal palpebral ligament and bone 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.900
 to the palpebral ligament and the bone 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.250
 located lower mind distributing 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.780
 in eyebrows temporary region and cheeks 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.480
 some internal fibers called 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.150
 superciliares end in half 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.390
 internal of the eyebrows the portion 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.180
 Central palpebral is born from the ligament 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.460
 internal palpebral and bone and together with 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 the lacrimal portion go from one side to 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.500
 another one in front of the cartilages 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.170
 tarsi intertwining in the corner 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.220
 external and forming the palpebral rafi 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.960
 external the ciliary portion is formed 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.040
 by the fibers closest to the 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.140
 tabs 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.780
 the tear portion originates from the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.730
 lacrimal crest of a gray and the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.010
 aponeurosis that covers the lacrimal sac 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.609
 sending a fascicle that surrounds the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.609
 tear duct 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.750
 as for his actions the portion 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.630
 Orbital protects the eye against light 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.390
 intense and lesions the follicles 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.390
 eyelids make the tears go 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.960
 to the eye and keep the eyelids attached 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.700
 to the eyeball the fascicles 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.940
 superciliares join the eyebrows in the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.760
 Expressions of anger and suffering 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.100
 muscle box and nador this muscle 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.620
 separated from the flowerpot by the bag of 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.260
 poses of bichat and crossed by the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.050
 This conduit is not born of the drive 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.610
 anterior of the maxillary wheat ligament and 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.100
 of the external face of the maxilla 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.800
 and the lower one in front of the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.110
 molars the upper fibers and 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.030
 inferiors go directly to the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:47.050
 flaky part of the lips 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.090
 intermediate fibers are cured in 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.280
 how much its action acts synergistically 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.740
 with the tongue to keep the cheek 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.800
 near the teeth and ensures that the 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.470
 food is chewed by the molars the 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.239
 paralysis of the boxer allows the 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.470
 food and saliva accumulate in the 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.920
 mouth and escape through the mouth 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.930
 the orbicular muscle of the lips in its 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.420
 deeper layer consists of fibers 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.690
 of the box and nador reinforced by 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.510
 oblique fascicles the oblique fibers 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.030
 short calls compressor muscles 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.670
 the lips go through the thickness of the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.650
 lip of the skin to the mucosa its layer 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.960
 superficial is formed by the 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.690
 insertion of seven small muscles 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.430
 minor symptomatic zygomatic 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.650
 own elevator of the upper lip and 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.770
 common elevator of the upper lip and 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.360
 nose wing these muscles are born by 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.330
 below the lower edge of the orbit 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.750
 in a line that goes the malar to the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.730
 ascending process of the maxilla 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.760
 the external fibers go to the commissure 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.000
 mouth and the rest to the upper lip and 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.770
 more internal to the wing of the nose 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.860
 all these face muscles together 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.470
 with the scalp make up the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.750
 Musculature of the head
