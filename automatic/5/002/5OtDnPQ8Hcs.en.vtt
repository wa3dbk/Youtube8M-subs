good<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.280> still<00:03:14.549> use<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.760> because<00:03:15.000> that

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
good you can still use it because that

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.910 
good you can still use it because that
other<00:03:15.269> masks<00:03:15.989> here<00:03:16.079> clogging<00:03:16.470> discard<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.890> card

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
other masks here clogging discard a card

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.039 
other masks here clogging discard a card
so<00:03:17.760> we're<00:03:17.910> gonna<00:03:18.000> go<00:03:18.150> ahead<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.390> add<00:03:18.600> plasma

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
so we're gonna go ahead and add plasma

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.960 
so we're gonna go ahead and add plasma
now<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.680> course<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.920> did<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> two<00:03:20.370> sweet

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
now and of course you did the two sweet

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.390 
now and of course you did the two sweet
tokens<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.019> effective<00:03:22.500> Daniel<00:03:22.799> Ryan<00:03:22.950> and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
tokens in the effective Daniel Ryan and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.250 
tokens in the effective Daniel Ryan and
then<00:03:25.220> pretty<00:03:26.220> much<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.000> tributes<00:03:27.989> these

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
then pretty much you just tributes these

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.229 
then pretty much you just tributes these
three<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:29.160> course<00:03:29.400> keep<00:03:29.609> you<00:03:29.700> acid<00:03:30.090> here

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
three of course keep you acid here

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.910 
three of course keep you acid here
that's<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.720> completely<00:03:31.290> irrelevant<00:03:31.590> in

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
that's it is completely irrelevant in

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.099 
that's it is completely irrelevant in
this<00:03:32.150> you're<00:03:33.150> basically<00:03:33.180> your<00:03:33.780> opponent

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
this you're basically your opponent

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.360 
this you're basically your opponent
needs<00:03:34.170> just<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.590> fun<00:03:34.620> monster<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.310> you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
needs just to have fun monster and you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.310 
needs just to have fun monster and you
just<00:03:35.549> absorb<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.570> now<00:03:36.780> we've<00:03:36.989> skill

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
just absorb it and now we've skill

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.479 
just absorb it and now we've skill
drained<00:03:37.560> his<00:03:38.190> board<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:40.250> that's<00:03:41.250> pretty

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
drained his board and that's pretty

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.819 
drained his board and that's pretty
strong<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:43.049> don't<00:03:43.230> think<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.650> come

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
strong and I don't think you can come

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.380 
strong and I don't think you can come
back<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.220> dark<00:03:44.609> hole<00:03:44.730> isn't<00:03:45.150> really

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
back to this dark hole isn't really

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.470 
back to this dark hole isn't really
about<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.920> I'm<00:03:46.920> not<00:03:47.370> though<00:03:47.609> it's<00:03:48.359> looking

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
about it I'm not though it's looking

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.300 
about it I'm not though it's looking
pretty<00:03:48.750> good<00:03:48.870> for<00:03:49.140> me<00:03:49.230> no<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.890> did<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.040> need<00:03:50.250> a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
pretty good for me no it did not need a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.140 
pretty good for me no it did not need a
match<00:03:50.489> change<00:03:52.400> because<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.670> don't<00:03:53.940> really<00:03:54.060> want

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
match change because I don't really want

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.530 
match change because I don't really want
to<00:03:54.269> get<00:03:54.390> rid<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:54.600> guy<00:03:55.549> but<00:03:56.549> I'll<00:03:57.209> set<00:03:57.510> it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
to get rid of this guy but I'll set it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.090 
to get rid of this guy but I'll set it
just<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:57.870> case<00:03:57.900> he<00:03:58.320> has<00:03:58.470> snatched<00:03:58.680> deal

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
just in case he has snatched deal

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.520 
just in case he has snatched deal
selects<00:03:59.820> national<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.420> him<00:04:00.630> she<00:04:01.230> can't<00:04:01.410> take

selects national like him she can't take

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.780 
selects national like him she can't take

and it can't be supposed some about
other<00:04:13.049> ways<00:04:13.229> but<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.530> get<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.799> negate<00:04:14.070> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
other ways but you get to negate the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.310 
other ways but you get to negate the
effect<00:04:14.699> of<00:04:14.790> all<00:04:15.030> face-up<00:04:15.299> monsters<00:04:16.199> your

opponent

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.280 
opponent
and<00:04:17.239> then<00:04:17.570> once<00:04:17.720> per<00:04:17.840> turn<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.080> could<00:04:18.170> target

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and then once per turn you could target

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.199 
and then once per turn you could target
one<00:04:18.560> monster<00:04:19.310> opponent<00:04:19.580> Carleton<00:04:19.850> equip<00:04:20.090> it

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
one monster opponent Carleton equip it

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.320 
one monster opponent Carleton equip it
to<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.600> then<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:22.040> gains<00:04:22.370> attack<00:04:22.790> equally

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
to it and then it gains attack equally

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.720 
to it and then it gains attack equally
half<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.720> attack<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.230> I<00:04:24.470> absorb<00:04:25.010> deals<00:04:25.370> which

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
half the attack so I absorb deals which

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.610 
half the attack so I absorb deals which
has<00:04:25.910> 3000<00:04:26.540> attack<00:04:26.570> slugging<00:04:27.080> 50<00:04:27.410> on<00:04:27.500> their

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.650 
attack
he's<00:04:28.280> probably<00:04:28.550> confused<00:04:29.150> right<00:04:29.270> now<00:04:29.330> they'll

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
he's probably confused right now they'll

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.630 
he's probably confused right now they'll
probably<00:04:29.750> put<00:04:30.140> out<00:04:30.200> he<00:04:30.920> lost<00:04:31.070> connection<00:04:31.520> a

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
probably put out he lost connection a

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.310 
probably put out he lost connection a
coincidence<00:04:32.240> but<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.690> was<00:04:32.870> going<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.050> be<00:04:33.140> game

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
coincidence but it was going to be game

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.140 
coincidence but it was going to be game
anyways<00:04:33.620> we<00:04:33.740> attack<00:04:33.980> attack<00:04:34.070> but<00:04:34.760> die<00:04:34.940> and
