00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.450
 just grab my name is massa and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.910
 Today I show a kitkat 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.679
 chocolate cake filled with m &amp; ms 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.429
 is 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.430
 I have one for that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.869
 chocolate cake struck the me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 here in the middle with apricots or 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.140
 Marillenmarmelade fill and then above 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.390
 brush again 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.250
 so that the cake is a little more juicy 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.520
 the lower part is then painted 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.190
 I stick it in straw with it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.579
 I have a better stability with it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 I then the second arc on types 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.120
 I can cut that exactly on the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.520
 height and then the small floor 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 I sit on top have a bottom 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.159
 diameter of 26 centimeters and 18 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.400
 centimeter height 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:14.490
 and on top of that comes a diameter 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.990
 of 18 cm I'm right up here now 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.360
 I feel so in the back 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 middle with apricot jam sneaking 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.320
 me that smooth and then tower 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.259
 the second half on top I have yes 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.890
 already uploaded a video in the where 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.060
 I have a kitkat pie maker with me 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.549
 modems that was a dummies cake 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.710
 there are more out with a dead so 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.320
 I already mentioned that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.840
 a cake was ordered because we were in the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.009
 showcase the data pies dummies 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.920
 and that is the real dead now 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.619
 which was ordered 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.200
 if i did that i will get the kitkat 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:07.110
 tie with chocolate on and the stressed 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.879
 Around the baptism to his departed 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.479
 I realized that I have to do a little bit 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.530
 paint better 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.040
 The cake is so juicy and white 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.019
 they did not hold that back either 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.480
 Next , I think it was better 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.540
 if you put the whole pie with chocolate 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.810
 Cover or jam 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 I'm sure I have something here 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.500
 learned but otherwise I was very 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.319
 happy with the pie 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.379
 she was also very well I had one 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.640
 Good feedback from the customer and the 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:45.459
 Of course I am always happy when I am 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.609
 other people make people happy 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.079
 can 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:57.010
 Now it continues where I am on 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:59.319
 and when I'm around the pie I go 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.890
 I then see you on the upper floor 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:07.319
 the dot s 8 cm high and so a kitkat 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.799
 bar is just under ten centimeters 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.440
 so we make the entry and am above 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.799
 I now also through and you see 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.440
 Now here for the end to break 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.459
 I just let go and the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.459
 perfect on 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.620
 since we have seen that stability 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.780
 I'm not in a good mood with esther 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.989
 the gap with chocolate on it 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.849
 Keep kitkat even better, of course 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.530
 also a little more taste if you 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.470
 there was still chocolate made 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.480
 I have the sections of the cake 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.640
 it really tastes a great recipe 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.200
 I will then in the infobox 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.300
 sign up for copying at home 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.780
 can write me 1 comment we that 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.569
 video finds or the already or the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.590
 who baked the cake as you did the cake 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.840
 found cake 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.120
 I am always happy about feedback 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.970
 then I have a location 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.980
 how you find the videos or what I do 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.959
 can improve or what i already good 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:22.019
 thus , we are the ones we leave filled 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.830
 the chocolate gets a bit tighter 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.639
 and that was exactly the thirtieth 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.290
 birthday 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.330
 then I have a candle pay me 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.370
 Taken in the colors of the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:39.510
 modems is really well fitted and 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.960
 were then to the cavities with m &amp; ms too 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.120
 to fill 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.120
 I do not spend much effort there 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.210
 they are really beautiful on the wild 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.390
 tart be tasted easily 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.130
 really nice fill and then it looks 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.130
 really good too 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:12.710
 I think superior to him 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:16.030
 16 and 17 kitkat used and five or five 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.340
 six bags of amon dams for this tour and 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:26.110
 torte maybe so for this info 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:28.699
 Sure enough for 35 to 40 people 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.440
 does not look that big, but man 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.870
 Of course, that's very important 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.120
 rich and he is heavy one 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.340
 chocolate cake quite as many modems 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:43.630
 and the kitkat still so if I you o 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.800
 I have filled up there 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.539
 once again the stars are dispensed with 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.099
 show I have my colored roll 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.660
 gouged out of the 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:57.500
 attached with flower wire 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.840
 So the ones from the stars 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.889
 impaled and I put it now 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.630
 wild in the gate 3 it is safe from 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.250
 beneficial if you look at the pieces of the 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.070
 At dry then you have no 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.169
 problems when inserting and hold them 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.570
 I might as well maybe one day 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.090
 prepare in advance 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.610
 and yes, the pies are already done 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.650
 I look forward to the feedback if 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.789
 you liked it , I got thumbs up 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.440
