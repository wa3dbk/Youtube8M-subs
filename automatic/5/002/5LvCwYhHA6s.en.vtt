 known as sony and lg né 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.590
 but we'll be there even if a mod 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.960
 pec that will take a lot of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.930
 pulled totally different another one 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.870
 for each type of pc as each type of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 weight you go well on various types of 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.760
 different textures then start there myself 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 I'll teach you this tutorial works on 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.690
 version 1.1 7.10 I have a gap 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 original 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 the pirate did not work anymore 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.079
 I can watch a version with 17 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 russell minecraft pirate points with 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.100
 sure it will work also beauty 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.769
 what am I going to do now 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.799
 now it's going to be the next guys I'm going 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.590
 explain and start saying before 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.869
 since the last video I'm going to say 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.479
 mod is heavy it's not the whole machine 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.320
 which runs at least 100 video cards in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.729
 your computer 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.860
 off board not working mode one 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.990
 any plate has to be a good pc 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.659
 to run this here so let's start 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.579
 first features you will find this 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.110
 file that fiddles with the registration goes from 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.220
 It is clear that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 beauty will open this little window 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.990
 capiroto here because you will make you 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.170
 will see here in that selected backyard 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.880
 this futacs fort that is the version that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.290
 it starts already because my these 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 versions here né 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.759
 But I use it to start who does not have it. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.829
 vote in the way are not death and will 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.409
 ask if I was going to do a backup 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.760
 I think it's useless because the internet is 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.010
 30 so then 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.590
 it's useless because not because it lives 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.910
 tse sanders exterior water 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.680
 so that's who I was not fast 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.250
 because he had previously 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.190
 appear 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.200
 he looks great and reinstated move is a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.120
 simple run after you have done 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.360
 that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.780
 I recommend you reinstall mode 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.400
 it passes twice because of 51 psam 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.180
 he occasionally was not of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.430
 first 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.750
 I do not know why but that's it may 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.850
 close this here 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.850
 now you can learn the minecraft and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:44.670
 warned mother craft example start here 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.690
 Like I said I'm doing it on the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.790
 original 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.710
 so I 'm not sure if showing 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.709
 pirate besides I can not make a 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.290
 video showing the mpf pirate feller given 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.390
 by ibm and not speaking in piracicaba 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.850
 they are also liking 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.010
 You come here if you're using a 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.310
 3.2 strong point without profile 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.310
 I did not speak 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.300
 [Music] 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.300
 He's going to open the little boy here. 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.860
 [Music] 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.470
 now I'll move on to the personal flash 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.489
 better program the video to take 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.319
 whole game 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.569
 So the staff is back and now it's going to be 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.189
 The next I arrived with beauty and 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.840
 serginho 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.329
 the woman who molds the installed 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.790
 when the pec but managed to escape to 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.430
 install the module since yours is not 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.950
 one more hate is considered a chador 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.400
 How can you choose chess? 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.349
 huh 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.200
 now I will explain these textures here 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.500
 I did not test but from what I was told. 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.680
 You have the goals is your light vehicles. 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.810
 is the lightest version of the game 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.150
 a standard is a little bit version 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.370
 heavier the other is for those who do not have 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.739
 This is one more paulo for those who know that the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.709

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.859

 He is also very heavy. I'm going to use it. 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.330

 a commodity boom was going to deactivate 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.060
 chess is like this 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.840
 The great thing, I just called you here.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.650
 conditions to supply the slow in several 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.840
 versions there then one by one and that 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.760
 more to think it works than it has 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.170
 some textures that have a shadow or 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.020
 some do not even have 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.300
 she is simply just a Haitian 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.130
 march originating thames water is 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.530
 transparent but leaves a reminder 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.490
 more beautiful and leaves a more real touch 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.110
 than it really is because 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.360
 let's agree that minecraft on the graph 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.830
 his original is very thin 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.720
 so what was a chicken with 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.220

 I hope you have given me support 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.010
 I want to know who I am 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.170
