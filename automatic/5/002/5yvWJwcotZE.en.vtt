the systems that are currently available
look<00:01:17.070> look<00:01:17.400> outside<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.299> person<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.840> the

look look outside of the person for the
year<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> answer<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.189> they're<00:01:20.340> extra

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
year for the answer so they're extra

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.880 
year for the answer so they're extra
respective<00:01:21.509> we're<00:01:21.720> introspective<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.710> we're

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
respective we're introspective so we're

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
respective we're introspective so we're
looking<00:01:23.009> inside<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.880> client<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> answer

looking inside the client for the answer

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.420 
looking inside the client for the answer
so<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.500> answer<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:25.979> questions
