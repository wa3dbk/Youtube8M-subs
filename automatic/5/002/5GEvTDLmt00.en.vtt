things<00:01:31.619> called<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> bombs

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
things called the one of the bombs

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
things called the one of the bombs
basically<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.710> 20<00:01:35.009> bomb<00:01:35.159> that's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
basically so if you get 20 bomb that's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
basically so if you get 20 bomb that's
20<00:01:35.640> kills<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.090> bomb<00:01:36.360> last<00:01:36.869> their<00:01:37.439> kills<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
20 kills they bomb last their kills and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.980 
20 kills they bomb last their kills and
I<00:01:38.009> almost<00:01:38.579> got<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> 50<00:01:39.060> bottles<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.720> close

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I almost got the 50 bottles so close

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
I almost got the 50 bottles so close
away<00:01:40.140> from<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:41.009> kill<00:01:41.250> away<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.700> getting

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
away from it one kill away from getting

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.819 
away from it one kill away from getting
the<00:01:42.030> 50<00:01:42.299> bomb<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> unfortunately<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.470> didn't

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the 50 bomb and unfortunately I didn't

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
the 50 bomb and unfortunately I didn't
manage<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.570> i<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:45.960> got

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
manage to do it and i think i have got

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.230 
manage to do it and i think i have got
150<00:01:46.890> bomb<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> past<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:47.759> that's<00:01:48.060> probably

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
150 bomb in the past but that's probably

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.609 
150 bomb in the past but that's probably
the<00:01:48.390> highest<00:01:48.540> gameplay<00:01:48.990> I've<00:01:49.110> ever<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.470> in

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the highest gameplay I've ever got in

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.179 
the highest gameplay I've ever got in
public<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> yeah<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> pro<00:01:52.829> mod<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
public and so yeah what is pro mod and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.639 
public and so yeah what is pro mod and
what<00:01:53.340> does<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> balancing<00:01:55.049> in

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
what does it do so the balancing in

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.319 
what does it do so the balancing in
college<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> fall<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:57.180> first

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
college it fall when it was first

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.660 
college it fall when it was first
released<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.310> black<00:01:59.520> ops

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
released is what it's like in black ops

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
released is what it's like in black ops
2<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> SMGs<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.960> quite

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
2 now you know the SMGs are quite

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.950 
2 now you know the SMGs are quite
powerful<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.850> assault<00:02:03.090> rifles<00:02:03.479> am<00:02:03.659> as

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
powerful and the assault rifles am as

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.649 
powerful and the assault rifles am as
powerful<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.729> promod<00:02:06.240> does<00:02:06.450> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
powerful and so what promod does is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.320 
powerful and so what promod does is
balances<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> ak-47<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
balances the out so the ak-47 in this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.109 
balances the out so the ak-47 in this
game

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
game

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.930 
game
promod<00:02:10.899> actually<00:02:11.620> gets<00:02:11.769> buffed<00:02:12.010> up<00:02:12.190> but<00:02:12.670> gives

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
promod actually gets buffed up but gives

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.850 
promod actually gets buffed up but gives
it<00:02:13.030> obviously<00:02:13.750> got<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.140> lot<00:02:14.200> recall<00:02:14.739> in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
it obviously got a lot recall in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.410 
it obviously got a lot recall in
comparison<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.580> other<00:02:15.849> assault<00:02:16.390> rifles

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
comparison to the other assault rifles

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.680 
comparison to the other assault rifles
like<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> m4<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.519> info<00:02:18.879> gets<00:02:19.209> reduced<00:02:19.450> in

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
like the m4 so the info gets reduced in

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.440 
like the m4 so the info gets reduced in
damage<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.170> does<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.470> m60<00:02:21.090> when<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.150> comes<00:02:22.330> to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
damage so does the m60 when it comes to

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.250 
damage so does the m60 when it comes to
SMG<00:02:23.319> s<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.879> ak-74<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.080> most

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
SMG s and the ak-74 you is the most

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.530 
SMG s and the ak-74 you is the most
powerful<00:02:26.379> but<00:02:27.159> has<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> most<00:02:27.610> recoil<00:02:28.000> again

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
powerful but has the most recoil again

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.069 
powerful but has the most recoil again
like<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> ak-47<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.640> mp5<00:02:31.239> which<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.750> my

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
like the ak-47 and the mp5 which is my

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.690 
like the ak-47 and the mp5 which is my
choice<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.560> console<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.040> all<00:02:33.159> honesty<00:02:33.489> for

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
choice on console in all honesty for

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.220 
choice on console in all honesty for
college<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.150> file<00:02:34.360> with<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.540> silencer<00:02:35.079> and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
college it file with the silencer and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.259 
college it file with the silencer and
doesn't<00:02:36.129> really<00:02:36.310> get<00:02:36.519> used<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.879> much<00:02:37.030> in

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
doesn't really get used that much in

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.420 
doesn't really get used that much in
promenade<00:02:37.629> it's<00:02:37.870> again<00:02:38.379> like<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> m4<00:02:39.040> doesn't

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
promenade it's again like the m4 doesn't

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.550 
promenade it's again like the m4 doesn't
have<00:02:39.549> as<00:02:39.670> much<00:02:39.879> power<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:41.170> doesn't<00:02:41.470> have

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
have as much power and but doesn't have

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.979 
have as much power and but doesn't have
as<00:02:41.680> much<00:02:41.799> recoil<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.849> you<00:02:42.910> can<00:02:43.390> use<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.569> out<00:02:43.750> bit

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
as much recoil so you can use it out bit

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.750 
as much recoil so you can use it out bit
longer<00:02:44.170> ranges<00:02:44.709> but<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.129> just<00:02:45.280> got<00:02:45.430> make<00:02:45.609> sure

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
longer ranges but you just got make sure

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.630 
longer ranges but you just got make sure

playing the non Europe version of this
game<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.239> which<00:03:34.239> basically<00:03:34.720> means<00:03:34.959> there's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
game and which basically means there's

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.619 
game and which basically means there's
no<00:03:35.349> red<00:03:35.950> dots<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.790> map<00:03:36.819> so<00:03:37.239> this<00:03:37.389> is<00:03:37.510> why
