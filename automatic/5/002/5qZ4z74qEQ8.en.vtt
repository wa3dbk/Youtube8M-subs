00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.870
 blue that serves the truth that at a stroke 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.870
 suddenly in you 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.680
 like your volcano and it will be a rash 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.629
 of a replacement 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.629
 other times there is a contract 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.170
 and in the room it does not matter what happens 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.170
 forever 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.500
 which in the vibrant my heart if this 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.500
 bag of an entity 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.450
 and in the room he does not think 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.450
 it's just stain 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.440
 and in healing 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.860
 it does not matter what happens on the day 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.860
 best 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.640
