thumb working away and it's just walking
up<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.870> bases<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> sounds<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.980 

sounds<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:50.600> which<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> piece<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
sounds like this which is a piece of

sounds like this which is a piece of
cake<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.740> play<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.980> nice<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:53.490> slowly<00:01:53.700> let's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
cake we play it nice and slowly let's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.570 
cake we play it nice and slowly let's
take<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.260> my<00:01:55.800> right<00:01:56.070> hand<00:01:56.370> in<00:01:56.550> close

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
take a look at my my right hand in close

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.180 
take a look at my my right hand in close
up<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> tab<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> bottom<00:01:58.980> of

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
up and you see the tab at the bottom of

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:21.760 
up and you see the tab at the bottom of
the<00:01:59.250> page<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.640> well<00:01:59.820> let's<00:02:00.420> take<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> look

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.280 

now<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.250> twice<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.720> then<00:02:24.870> after<00:02:25.140> this

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
now we do this twice and then after this

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
now we do this twice and then after this
the<00:02:25.980> thumb<00:02:26.220> base<00:02:26.460> turns<00:02:26.820> into<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:33.300> it

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the thumb base turns into this so it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.850 
the thumb base turns into this so it
really<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> piece<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.230> cake<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:34.710> just

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
really is a piece of cake we're just

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.740 
really is a piece of cake we're just
using<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> thumb<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.970> could<00:02:36.120> play<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.480> slow

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
using the thumb we could play it as slow

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.080 
using the thumb we could play it as slow
or<00:02:36.780> as<00:02:37.080> fast<00:02:37.350> as<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:43.640> let's<00:02:44.640> take<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.850> quick

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
or as fast as we like let's take a quick

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.700 
or as fast as we like let's take a quick
look<00:02:45.210> at<00:02:45.330> my<00:02:45.360> right<00:02:45.660> hand<00:02:45.690> again<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
look at my right hand again and the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:03:08.360 
look at my right hand again and the
tablature<00:03:05.510> now<00:03:06.510> our<00:03:06.690> fourth<00:03:07.320> finger<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:07.980> going

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
tablature now our fourth finger is going

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.850 
tablature now our fourth finger is going
to<00:03:08.400> play<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.610> melody<00:03:09.110> which<00:03:10.110> again<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.620> really

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
to play the melody which again is really

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.740 
to play the melody which again is really
quite<00:03:11.160> simple<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.820> we<00:03:11.940> all<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.360> it

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
quite simple and we all know it it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:26.390 
quite simple and we all know it it
sounds<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:24.860> here<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.130> shown<00:03:26.370> in

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
sounds like this and here it is shown in

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.550 
sounds like this and here it is shown in
tablature<00:03:27.060> with<00:03:27.330> my<00:03:27.480> right<00:03:27.750> hand<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.200> close<00:03:28.230> up

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
tablature with my right hand in close up

00:03:28.560 --> 00:04:07.630 
tablature with my right hand in close up
again

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.980 

now<00:04:08.640> this<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:09.000> where<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.240> fun<00:04:09.420> starts

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
now this is where the fun starts

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.020 
now this is where the fun starts
we<00:04:10.260> start<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.620> put<00:04:10.770> them<00:04:10.890> together<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.910> then

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
we start to put them together and then

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.330 
we start to put them together and then
we<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.270> to<00:04:12.480> try<00:04:12.960> and<00:04:13.170> focus<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.860> some<00:04:14.130> way

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
we have to try and focus on some way

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.280 
we have to try and focus on some way
work<00:04:14.580> out<00:04:14.880> how<00:04:15.120> we're<00:04:15.330> going<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.600> let<00:04:16.110> our

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
work out how we're going to let our

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.890 
work out how we're going to let our
thumb<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.920> our<00:04:17.310> fingers<00:04:17.790> work<00:04:17.970> independently

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
thumb and our fingers work independently

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.320 
thumb and our fingers work independently
they're<00:04:19.799> not<00:04:19.950> really<00:04:20.190> working<00:04:20.520> independently

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
they're not really working independently

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.210 
they're not really working independently
though<00:04:21.570> because<00:04:21.959> we're<00:04:22.260> pinching<00:04:22.590> together

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
though because we're pinching together

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.790 
though because we're pinching together
it's<00:04:23.910> just<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.480> thumb<00:04:24.810> needs<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.500> change

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
it's just that the thumb needs to change

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.250 
it's just that the thumb needs to change
from<00:04:26.040> strings<00:04:26.520> overall<00:04:27.240> we've<00:04:27.570> also<00:04:27.720> got<00:04:28.080> the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
from strings overall we've also got the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.860 
from strings overall we've also got the
the<00:04:29.100> fretting<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.640> do<00:04:29.760> with<00:04:29.880> our<00:04:30.000> left<00:04:30.270> hand<00:04:30.360> so

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
the fretting to do with our left hand so

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.510 
the fretting to do with our left hand so
there's<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.110> lot<00:04:31.320> going<00:04:31.680> on<00:04:31.800> here<00:04:31.860> with<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.280> very

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
there's a lot going on here with a very

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.870 
there's a lot going on here with a very
simple<00:04:32.850> tune<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.660> it's<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.900> great<00:04:34.110> exercise

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
simple tune and it's a great exercise

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.190 
simple tune and it's a great exercise
let's<00:04:35.880> take<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> look<00:04:36.300> at<00:04:36.420> my<00:04:36.540> right<00:04:36.750> hand<00:04:36.810> in

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
let's take a look at my right hand in

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.200 
let's take a look at my right hand in
close<00:04:37.230> up<00:04:37.440> as<00:04:38.010> we<00:04:38.160> look<00:04:38.310> at<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.460> tablature<00:04:38.850> for

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
close up as we look at the tablature for
