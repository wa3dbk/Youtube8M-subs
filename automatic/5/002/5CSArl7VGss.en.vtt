this<00:00:19.140> tutorial<00:00:19.400> I'll<00:00:20.400> show<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.730> how<00:00:21.000> we

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
this tutorial I'll show you how we

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.480 
this tutorial I'll show you how we
incorporate<00:00:21.510> view<00:00:22.140> sets<00:00:22.439> into<00:00:22.830> our<00:00:23.220> part

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
incorporate view sets into our part

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.929 
incorporate view sets into our part
program<00:00:23.810> allowing<00:00:24.810> us<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> control<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:26.550> view

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
program allowing us to control what view

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.189 
program allowing us to control what view
appears<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.869> our<00:00:28.080> CAD<00:00:28.320> only<00:00:28.800> report<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> have

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
appears on our CAD only report so I have

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
appears on our CAD only report so I have
12<00:00:31.529> dimensions<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.279> report<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.540> want

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
12 dimensions to report but I don't want

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.680 
12 dimensions to report but I don't want
them<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> same<00:00:34.860> page<00:00:35.190> or

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
them to be all on the same page or

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.690 
them to be all on the same page or
unequally<00:00:36.690> distributed<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:37.680> two<00:00:38.010> pages<00:00:38.219> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
unequally distributed on two pages I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.080 
unequally distributed on two pages I
want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.480> control<00:00:39.899> over<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
want to have control over that so the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.250 
want to have control over that so the
way<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.020> by<00:00:43.770> using<00:00:43.800> view<00:00:44.460> sets

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
way we do that is by using view sets

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.920 
way we do that is by using view sets
first<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.530> define<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> view<00:00:47.309> set<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.690> we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
first we define a view set and then we

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.459 
first we define a view set and then we
recall<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> look<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.170> edit

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
recall it so if you look at my edit

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
recall it so if you look at my edit
window<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:54.090> three

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
window here you can see I have three

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.069 
window here you can see I have three
view<00:00:54.840> sets<00:00:55.110> defined<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> top<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.510> mid<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
view sets defined at the top the mid and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.459 
view sets defined at the top the mid and
the<00:00:58.140> right<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.300> then<00:01:00.300> I've<00:01:00.600> recalled<00:01:01.109> them

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the right and then I've recalled them

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.630 
the right and then I've recalled them
prior<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> four<00:01:02.940> dimension<00:01:03.449> clusters<00:01:03.960> so

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
prior to the four dimension clusters so

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.200 
prior to the four dimension clusters so
if<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.820> click<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:06.390> edit<00:01:06.570> window<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.000> see

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
if I click on my edit window you can see

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
if I click on my edit window you can see
that<00:01:09.420> that's<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.900> view<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.860> show

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that that's the view I want to show

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.530 
that that's the view I want to show
prior<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.180> dimensioning<00:01:12.750> those<00:01:12.930> four<00:01:13.260> heads

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
prior to dimensioning those four heads

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
prior to dimensioning those four heads
the<00:01:15.540> mid<00:01:15.840> view<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> right<00:01:19.049> view<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the mid view and the right view so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
the mid view and the right view so
because<00:01:20.280> I've<00:01:20.430> saved<00:01:20.729> those<00:01:20.970> ahead<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> time

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
because I've saved those ahead of time

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
because I've saved those ahead of time
and<00:01:21.900> recalled<00:01:22.380> them<00:01:22.650> before<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and recalled them before the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.300 
and recalled them before the
dimensioning<00:01:24.140> that's<00:01:25.140> how<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> will<00:01:25.799> appear

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
dimensioning that's how it will appear

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.569 
dimensioning that's how it will appear
on<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.610> report<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.950> I'll<00:01:29.040> quickly<00:01:29.189> show<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
on my report so I'll quickly show you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.730 
on my report so I'll quickly show you
how<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.850> did<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.990> I'll<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.290> scale<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
how I did that so I'll just scale the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.950 
how I did that so I'll just scale the
fit<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.150> focus<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
fit here so let's focus in on that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.080 
fit here so let's focus in on that
sphere<00:01:34.380> let's<00:01:34.770> say<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> wanted<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.400> recall<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
sphere let's say I wanted to recall that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.749 
sphere let's say I wanted to recall that
at<00:01:36.299> some<00:01:36.540> point<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.530> incorporate<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.340> into

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
at some point and incorporate that into

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.780 
at some point and incorporate that into
my<00:01:39.390> report<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.710> I've<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.829> zoomed<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.520> there

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
my report so I've just zoomed in there

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.639 
my report so I've just zoomed in there
and<00:01:42.060> once<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.780> screen<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.470> way<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and once I have the screen the way I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
and once I have the screen the way I
like<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.659> I'll<00:01:45.659> save<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.079> using<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.360> create

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
like it I'll save it using the create

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
like it I'll save it using the create
views<00:01:48.780> button<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.920> found<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.310> our

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
views button and this is found on our

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
views button and this is found on our
graphic<00:01:50.970> modes<00:01:51.390> toolbar<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> software

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
graphic modes toolbar so the software

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.380 
graphic modes toolbar so the software
will<00:01:54.000> ask<00:01:54.180> us<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.600> define<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.729> or<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.939> name<00:01:57.180> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
will ask us to define it or to name it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.930 
will ask us to define it or to name it
I'll<00:01:57.960> call<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.380> sphere<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.090> click<00:02:00.090> OK

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
I'll call it sphere and click OK

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.630 
I'll call it sphere and click OK
so<00:02:02.940> that<00:02:03.120> saved<00:02:03.630> view<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.440> now<00:02:04.680> stored<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so that saved view is now stored in the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.370 
so that saved view is now stored in the
settings<00:02:06.060> toolbar<00:02:07.040> in<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.100> view<00:02:08.520> pulldown<00:02:09.380> so

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
settings toolbar in the view pulldown so

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.250 
settings toolbar in the view pulldown so
you<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.590> see<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:11.100> sphere<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.990> can

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you can see it there sphere so I can

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.710 
you can see it there sphere so I can
define<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.800> anywhere<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.910> also<00:02:15.060> recall

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
define it anywhere and I can also recall

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.160 
define it anywhere and I can also recall
it<00:02:15.960> anywhere<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.730> let's<00:02:17.910> scale<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.420> fit<00:02:18.570> again

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
it anywhere so let's scale to fit again

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.200 
it anywhere so let's scale to fit again
I'll<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:19.950> my<00:02:20.100> cursor<00:02:20.520> at<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.700> beginning<00:02:21.150> of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
I'll put my cursor at the beginning of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.660 
I'll put my cursor at the beginning of
the<00:02:21.330> program<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.680> an<00:02:22.830> example<00:02:22.950> I'll

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the program and just as an example I'll

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.360 
the program and just as an example I'll
recall<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.710> see<00:02:25.740> all<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.130> view

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
recall that so you can see all the view

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.910 
recall that so you can see all the view
sets<00:02:26.640> I've<00:02:26.820> defined<00:02:27.150> ahead<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.570> time<00:02:27.920> let's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
sets I've defined ahead of time let's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.250 
sets I've defined ahead of time let's
click<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.340> sphere<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
click on sphere and you can see the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.100 
click on sphere and you can see the
graphic<00:02:31.680> window<00:02:32.390> automatically<00:02:33.390> snaps<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
graphic window automatically snaps to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.520 
graphic window automatically snaps to
that<00:02:34.260> saved<00:02:34.590> view<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.690> my<00:02:36.690> edit<00:02:37.020> window<00:02:37.320> now

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that saved view and my edit window now

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.460 
that saved view and my edit window now
has<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> recall<00:02:38.460> view<00:02:38.790> set<00:02:39.060> command<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.840> that

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
has a recall view set command and that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.530 
has a recall view set command and that
can<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.830> used<00:02:41.070> prior<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.700> dimension<00:02:42.270> on<00:02:42.480> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
can be used prior to a dimension on a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.170 
can be used prior to a dimension on a
CAD<00:02:43.110> only<00:02:43.500> report<00:02:43.950> just<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> way<00:02:44.640> I've<00:02:44.850> set<00:02:45.120> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
CAD only report just the way I've set it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.760 
CAD only report just the way I've set it
up

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
up

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.350 
up
okay<00:02:46.770> so<00:02:46.830> let's<00:02:47.100> delete<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.910> don't<00:02:48.210> want

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
okay so let's delete that I don't want

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.210 
okay so let's delete that I don't want
that<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.570> my<00:02:48.810> report<00:02:49.670> scale<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.880> fit<00:02:51.030> again

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
that in my report scale to fit again

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.680 
that in my report scale to fit again
okay<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.280> let's<00:02:53.640> have<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.820> look<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.180> our<00:02:54.300> report

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
okay so let's have a look at our report

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.180 
okay so let's have a look at our report
and<00:02:54.900> I'll<00:02:55.020> show<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> how<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.470> looks<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.980> here

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
and I'll show you how that looks so here

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.600 
and I'll show you how that looks so here
we<00:02:59.310> are<00:02:59.450> I'm<00:03:00.450> using<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.050> CAD<00:03:01.380> only<00:03:01.890> landscape

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
we are I'm using the CAD only landscape

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.110 
we are I'm using the CAD only landscape
report<00:03:03.120> template<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.489> think<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.880> works

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
report template so I think that works

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
report template so I think that works
well<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.780> part<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.130> see<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.340> have

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
well for this part you can see I have

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.930 
well for this part you can see I have
three<00:03:09.060> pages<00:03:09.330> my<00:03:10.320> first<00:03:10.620> page<00:03:10.920> shows<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> nice

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
three pages my first page shows a nice

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.570 
three pages my first page shows a nice
neat<00:03:12.530> representation<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.650> top<00:03:14.040> view<00:03:14.370> and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
neat representation of that top view and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.949 
neat representation of that top view and
my<00:03:15.450> four<00:03:15.750> dimensions<00:03:17.090> page<00:03:18.090> two<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.780> my

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
my four dimensions page two is my

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.710 
my four dimensions page two is my
midpoints<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.090> again<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.239> can<00:03:21.390> see<00:03:21.570> it's

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
midpoints and again you can see it's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.470 
midpoints and again you can see it's
nice<00:03:21.930> nicely<00:03:22.709> laid<00:03:23.130> out<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.610> don't<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:24.360> to
