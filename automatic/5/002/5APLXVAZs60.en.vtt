00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.329
 today we were all friends of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.020
 I'm going to show you how is the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.000
 almond tree a Chinese or almendrón 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.980
 as they say here is good maracaibo 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.960
 a fruit this this tree 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.390
 that has become so important between 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.000
 the veterans have a seed or something 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.180
 so it's like a fruit that is eaten 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.610
 this is taken away from him and maybe eaten 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.220
 until candy and these look state 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.110
 sabotages all of this color but 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.850
 doing we can use it is reddish to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.980
 Sometimes yellowish is changing color 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.690
 until it is made of change because I have 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.240
 some for my friends those of venezuela 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.750
 but as the boots cost 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.210
 very much and dirty this good explained the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.300
 almendrón if you do not have a story in 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.160
 to the south thousands of many many ago 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.830
 years this is all this that they grabbed 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.890
 those animals vetasen in the lagoons 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.600
 in the rice fields they realized 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.759
 that in one of the gaps that is 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.130
 overwhelmed by these trees 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.050
 the water was reddish yellowish 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.660
 as we know it with a good bit 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.120
 and the betas that they grabbed in that lagoon 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.570
 they were more active they reproduced more and 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:50.700
 they were easier they were easier to 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.610
 reproduce that those who were in it 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.220
 they had more amount was very for fights 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 they were really good they were faster 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.440
 they realized that it was dry short 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 this was super nice since 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.030
 way like a pe like a tecito 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.729
 Y 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.480
 and you control them piles of water ph 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.670
 it gets more acidic than it happened they started 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.390
 to use this water but this little leaf 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.160
 forgive the water of the betas good with 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 the time when it was discovered that 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.830
 this was in a biological filter 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.620
 natural that collects metals from water 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.200
 this happened to one I told the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.720
 Mr. sam boldly untied according to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.150
 biologists who told him about this because 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.030
 he is this half or this water collects 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.840
 metals and maybe that's why I'm not 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.140
 sure is that 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.780
 is that sometimes something will form a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.350
 up like a look in the middle is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.370
 so to be recognized 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.740
 there is a public coma 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.640
 this 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:04.630
 and well you already know how to manage them 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.970
 I recommend grabbing and crying in the water 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.190
 for several days about 34 days and after 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.930
 they take it out so that the water is 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.170
 put yellow and you can be happy 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.610
 it prevents diseases and has many 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.610
 benefits this little tree 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.330
 what I do is that the dry has to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.000
 be dry eye with that dry green miami 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.090
 half dry green there are totally people 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.700
 that they also put it on ballots and the and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.440
 puts them to heat and make tea and that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.080
 water is already filtered and there are people 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.880
 Good thing I put them in a bucket with 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.819
 water and the yellow water is made after 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.170
 well I took his and grabbed him with 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.730
 a syringe and I'm throwing them to each 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:55.459
 corpse so that this text will improve 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.459
 the ph to eliminate nitrate 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.140
 as well 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.220
 there are people who have played fish with 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.220
 only this 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.709
 this leaf that is good is natural a 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.849
 natural remedy and it serves for many 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.380
 well the idea of a sick go to 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.389
 control the water the ph of the water to 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.570
 that is faster and commented we have 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.400
 helps good already know something over 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.030
