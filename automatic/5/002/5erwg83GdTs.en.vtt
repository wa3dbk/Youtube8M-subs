here to the side everything's nice and
easily<00:02:31.239> accessible<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:39.420> let's<00:02:40.420> put<00:02:40.660> some

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.940 
easily accessible so let's put some
cards<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.319> see<00:02:41.590> how<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.099> look<00:02:42.340> looks

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
cards and see how this all look looks

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.470 
cards and see how this all look looks
all<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.610> these<00:02:45.790> are<00:02:45.849> actually<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.299> little

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
all right so these are actually a little

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.089 
all right so these are actually a little
thicker<00:02:46.720> than<00:02:46.840> regular<00:02:46.989> cards<00:02:47.739> because

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
thicker than regular cards because

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.650 
thicker than regular cards because
they're<00:02:48.280> hotel<00:02:48.640> key<00:02:48.819> cards<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.360> that's<00:02:49.540> what

even feeling really fancy let's just put
one<00:03:18.579> of<00:03:18.700> here<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.480> slide<00:03:19.660> pocket<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.859> here

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
one of here in this slide pocket so here

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.629 
one of here in this slide pocket so here
goes

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
goes

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:31.729 
goes
closes<00:03:25.329> just<00:03:25.540> fine<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.650> particularly<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.700> you

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
closes just fine and particularly if you

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.159 
closes just fine and particularly if you
have<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.919> the<00:03:34.319> strap<00:03:35.319> engaged<00:03:37.169> certainly

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
have this the strap engaged certainly

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.839

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
not gonna have any trouble closing it

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.759 
not gonna have any trouble closing it
even<00:03:40.180> with<00:03:40.359> all<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.569> those<00:03:40.840> cards<00:03:41.169> in<00:03:41.319> there<00:03:41.440> so

even with all of those cards in there so

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.030 
even with all of those cards in there so
this<00:03:42.160> really<00:03:42.370> has<00:03:42.639> quite<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.910> good<00:03:43.120> capacity

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
this really has quite a good capacity

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.680 
this really has quite a good capacity
I'm<00:03:45.040> definitely<00:03:45.609> impressed<00:03:45.700> with<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.299> as<00:03:46.480> far

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
I'm definitely impressed with it as far

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.409 
I'm definitely impressed with it as far
as<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.019> concerned<00:03:47.970> now<00:03:48.970> let's<00:03:49.180> see<00:03:49.269> how

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
as that is concerned now let's see how

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:55.289 
as that is concerned now let's see how
it<00:03:49.540> closes<00:03:49.750> with<00:03:50.109> fewer<00:03:50.410> cards<00:03:53.970> let's<00:03:54.970> see<00:03:55.180> we

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
it closes with fewer cards let's see we

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.210 
it closes with fewer cards let's see we
can<00:03:55.480> take<00:03:56.410> out<00:03:56.620> this<00:03:56.829> one<00:03:57.099> here

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.110 

let's<00:04:02.220> take<00:04:02.460> this<00:04:02.700> one<00:04:04.340> check<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.550> one<00:04:05.819> let's

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
let's take this one check this one let's

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.860 
let's take this one check this one let's
see<00:04:06.300> how<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.720> would<00:04:06.930> say<00:04:07.110> three<00:04:07.470> cards

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
see how it is would say three cards

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.150 
see how it is would say three cards
see<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.080> it's<00:04:10.470> practically<00:04:11.310> super<00:04:11.970> thin<00:04:12.180> now

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.300 

no<00:04:17.160> problems<00:04:17.579> at<00:04:17.760> all<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.829> definitely

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
no problems at all this is definitely

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.780 
no problems at all this is definitely
built<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:22.019> have<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.200> reasonable<00:04:22.919> amount<00:04:23.430> of

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
built to have a reasonable amount of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.830 
built to have a reasonable amount of
wallet

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
wallet

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.250 
wallet
contents<00:04:25.620> in<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.450> would<00:04:27.660> say<00:04:28.020> in

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
contents in it this is I would say in

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.680 
contents in it this is I would say in
contrast<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.919> many<00:04:29.430> wallet<00:04:29.910> cases<00:04:30.330> which

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
contrast to many wallet cases which

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.480 
contrast to many wallet cases which
seemed<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.260> be<00:04:31.470> designed<00:04:31.860> for<00:04:32.760> people<00:04:33.419> who<00:04:34.490> go

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
seemed to be designed for people who go

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.180 
seemed to be designed for people who go
lighter<00:04:35.940> than<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.810> would<00:04:37.080> ever<00:04:37.410> imagined<00:04:38.100> as

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
lighter than I would ever imagined as

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.890 
lighter than I would ever imagined as
humanly<00:04:38.580> possible<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.300> know<00:04:39.419> those<00:04:39.660> folks

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
humanly possible you know those folks

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.360 
humanly possible you know those folks
with<00:04:40.110> one<00:04:40.290> credit<00:04:40.650> card<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.040> driver's

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
with one credit card in a driver's

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.850 
with one credit card in a driver's
license<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.000> that's<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.440> I<00:04:43.440> certainly

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
license and that's it I certainly

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.400 
license and that's it I certainly
couldn't<00:04:44.280> do<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.580> there's<00:04:44.880> no<00:04:45.030> way<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:46.020> know

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
couldn't do that there's no way you know

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.560 
couldn't do that there's no way you know
so<00:04:46.620> for<00:04:46.830> me<00:04:46.950> something<00:04:47.580> like<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.910> hex<00:04:48.120> icon

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
so for me something like the hex icon

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.490 
so for me something like the hex icon
wall<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:48.930> gonna<00:04:49.110> work<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.470> whole<00:04:49.590> lot<00:04:49.650> better

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
wall it's gonna work a whole lot better

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.690 
wall it's gonna work a whole lot better
so<00:04:52.970> what<00:04:53.970> else<00:04:54.180> can<00:04:54.390> we<00:04:54.570> say<00:04:54.780> about<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.700> I

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
so what else can we say about this I

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.880 
so what else can we say about this I
like<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.570> addition<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.110> strap<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.680> always

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
like the addition of the strap I always

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.750 
like the addition of the strap I always
liked<00:04:59.130> these<00:05:00.090> wallets<00:05:00.360> which<00:05:00.990> allow<00:05:01.410> you<00:05:02.100> some

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
liked these wallets which allow you some

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.270 
liked these wallets which allow you some
ability<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.240> keep<00:05:03.630> them<00:05:03.870> closed<00:05:07.040> one<00:05:08.040> thing

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
ability to keep them closed one thing

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.130 
ability to keep them closed one thing
about<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.729> strap<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.660> keep<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:10.140> mind<00:05:10.850> is<00:05:12.140> you

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
about the strap to keep in mind is you

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.450 
about the strap to keep in mind is you
can't<00:05:13.470> have<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.890> closed<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:15.950> be<00:05:16.950> charging<00:05:17.370> it

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
can't have it closed and be charging it

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.580 
can't have it closed and be charging it
at<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.669> same<00:05:17.850> time<00:05:17.910> unless<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.690> maybe<00:05:19.350> if<00:05:19.500> you

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
at the same time unless you maybe if you

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.870 
at the same time unless you maybe if you
really<00:05:19.830> squished<00:05:20.130> it<00:05:20.250> over<00:05:20.460> no<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.669> don't<00:05:20.820> think

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
really squished it over no I don't think

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.690 
really squished it over no I don't think
you<00:05:21.090> can<00:05:21.330> because<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.320> strap<00:05:22.650> goes<00:05:22.680> right<00:05:23.520> in

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
you can because the strap goes right in

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.040 
you can because the strap goes right in
front<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.270> Lightning<00:05:24.600> port<00:05:24.800> so<00:05:25.800> oh<00:05:26.100> well

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
front of the Lightning port so oh well

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.380 
front of the Lightning port so oh well
you<00:05:28.050> know<00:05:28.140> perhaps<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.970> next<00:05:29.970> version<00:05:30.330> of

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
you know perhaps the next version of

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.730 
you know perhaps the next version of
this<00:05:30.600> they<00:05:30.870> might<00:05:31.020> have<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.290> strap<00:05:31.530> moved

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
this they might have the strap moved

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.380 
this they might have the strap moved
over<00:05:32.070> just<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.400> little<00:05:32.430> bit<00:05:32.760> sometimes<00:05:33.090> the

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
over just a little bit sometimes the

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.950 
over just a little bit sometimes the
straps<00:05:33.690> are<00:05:34.520> over<00:05:35.520> here<00:05:35.880> my<00:05:36.390> guess<00:05:36.450> is<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
straps are over here my guess is the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.900 
straps are over here my guess is the
reason<00:05:37.260> they<00:05:37.380> didn't<00:05:37.680> do<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.640> they

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
reason they didn't do that is that they

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.760 
reason they didn't do that is that they
have<00:05:39.060> this<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:39.690> know<00:05:39.720> rather<00:05:40.050> attractive

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
have this you know rather attractive

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.800 
have this you know rather attractive
little<00:05:40.919> hex<00:05:41.640> branding<00:05:42.120> here<00:05:42.270> at<00:05:42.390> the<00:05:42.479> bottom

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
little hex branding here at the bottom

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.150 
little hex branding here at the bottom
and<00:05:42.900> they<00:05:42.990> probably<00:05:43.229> didn't<00:05:43.710> want<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.950> strap

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
and they probably didn't want the strap

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.390 
and they probably didn't want the strap
to<00:05:44.190> go<00:05:44.400> over<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:46.070> personally<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.100> would

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
to go over it personally I would

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.740 
to go over it personally I would
probably<00:05:47.580> prefer<00:05:47.880> to<00:05:48.120> have<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.330> strap<00:05:48.600> go

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
probably prefer to have the strap go

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.120 
probably prefer to have the strap go
over<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.050> didn't<00:05:49.500> be<00:05:49.560> in<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.740> way<00:05:49.860> of<00:05:50.010> my

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
over that didn't be in the way of my

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.820 
over that didn't be in the way of my
lightning<00:05:50.700> port<00:05:50.880> but<00:05:51.240> then<00:05:51.600> again<00:05:51.720> this<00:05:52.590> is

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
lightning port but then again this is

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.320 
lightning port but then again this is
the<00:05:53.039> six<00:05:53.280> plus<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:53.850> doesn't<00:05:54.180> require

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
the six plus and it doesn't require

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.790 
the six plus and it doesn't require
charging<00:05:55.289> as<00:05:55.440> often<00:05:55.890> as<00:05:56.160> some<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:57.090> smaller

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
charging as often as some of the smaller

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.279 
charging as often as some of the smaller
iPhones<00:05:58.880> so<00:05:59.880> that's<00:06:00.090> definitely<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.720> pro<00:06:01.160> I

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
iPhones so that's definitely a pro I

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.659 
iPhones so that's definitely a pro I
really<00:06:04.289> like<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:05.780> orange<00:06:07.130> spine<00:06:08.130> here<00:06:08.460> think

to work just

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.369 
to work just
it's<00:06:14.309> nice<00:06:14.519> that<00:06:14.550> they<00:06:14.849> put<00:06:15.119> black<00:06:15.839> around<00:06:16.259> the

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
it's nice that they put black around the

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.379 
it's nice that they put black around the
edges<00:06:16.679> of<00:06:16.709> the<00:06:16.889> camera<00:06:17.219> here<00:06:17.519> so<00:06:17.550> that<00:06:17.999> there

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
edges of the camera here so that there

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.719 
edges of the camera here so that there
aren't<00:06:18.839> any<00:06:19.080> issues<00:06:19.559> with<00:06:19.739> any<00:06:20.099> kind<00:06:20.369> of<00:06:20.459> flash

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
diffusion and as you can see when this

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.350 
diffusion and as you can see when this
is<00:06:25.319> closed<00:06:25.649> when<00:06:26.339> there's<00:06:26.489> no<00:06:26.639> cards<00:06:26.969> in<00:06:27.059> it<00:06:27.239> at

all<00:06:27.539> it<00:06:28.349> really<00:06:28.589> completely<00:06:28.949> seals<00:06:29.339> up<00:06:29.869> where

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:30.869 
all it really completely seals up where

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:34.850 
all it really completely seals up where
the<00:06:31.349> phone<00:06:31.800> is<00:06:31.830> on<00:06:32.189> the<00:06:32.309> sides<00:06:32.629> I<00:06:33.629> really<00:06:34.289> like

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:43.019 
sometimes they wallet cases get a little

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:44.570 
sometimes they wallet cases get a little
bit<00:06:43.110> too<00:06:43.289> minimal<00:06:43.739> in<00:06:43.919> terms<00:06:43.949> of<00:06:44.309> the<00:06:44.399> phone

Texas<00:06:49.559> done<00:06:49.739> that<00:06:50.899> so<00:06:51.899> overall<00:06:52.229> it's<00:06:52.499> a<00:06:52.529> very

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:52.559 
Texas done that so overall it's a very

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:57.350 
Texas done that so overall it's a very
nice<00:06:53.239> leather<00:06:54.239> wallet<00:06:55.019> case<00:06:55.309> it's<00:06:56.309> sick<00:06:56.669> the

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
nice leather wallet case it's sick the

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.759 
nice leather wallet case it's sick the
leather<00:06:57.569> is<00:06:57.689> on<00:06:58.319> the<00:06:59.099> firmer<00:06:59.369> side<00:06:59.519> so<00:07:00.769> it

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:01.769 
leather is on the firmer side so it

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:03.979 
leather is on the firmer side so it
takes<00:07:02.459> a<00:07:02.579> while<00:07:02.610> to<00:07:02.789> get<00:07:03.179> it<00:07:03.300> softened<00:07:03.749> up<00:07:03.869> a

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:03.989 
takes a while to get it softened up a

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:09.109 
takes a while to get it softened up a
bit<00:07:04.729> but<00:07:05.729> I<00:07:06.059> think<00:07:06.779> that<00:07:07.589> it's<00:07:08.369> gonna<00:07:08.759> work<00:07:08.939> out

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:09.119 
bit but I think that it's gonna work out

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:11.299 
bit but I think that it's gonna work out
really<00:07:09.360> well<00:07:09.629> and<00:07:09.929> it<00:07:10.769> seems<00:07:11.009> like<00:07:11.159> a<00:07:11.189> very
