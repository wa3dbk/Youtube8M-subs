right away to fix this problem is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.990 
right away to fix this problem is
include<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.920> packaging<00:02:59.459> different<00:02:59.820> sized

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
ear tips and the one thing that I did

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040 
ear tips and the one thing that I did
know<00:03:02.190> because<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.300> size<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.870> these

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
know because of the size of these

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.720 
know because of the size of these
earbuds<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.100> stay<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.430> your<00:03:05.610> ear

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
