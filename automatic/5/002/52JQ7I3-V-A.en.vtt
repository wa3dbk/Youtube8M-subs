00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.120
 my brother I'm jonny guys this one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.400
 video to do a review show to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.349
 you the multilaser mouse war 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.730
 recently I was without a mouse used a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.570
 reserve vacancy 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 and since nothing is too expensive and I did not think 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.230
 the version I like that is 2014 then 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 I decided to ask for a video help from 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 you to buy a mouse the person 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 said soon reserved at the time is very 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 So I decided to buy this mouse. 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.500
 from multilaser 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's costing around 150 reais 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.690
 I liked it because it does not have these keyboards. 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.210
 is this numeric keypad right? 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 on the side and up here you see the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 depends on everything but anyway 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.649
 There, this evil has come for me. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.050
 I'm already testing him and I'm going to tell him 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 which I initially found it is clear that a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 test day can not you speak 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.730
 mouse is good or bad 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 O first comes this little box him 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.210
 all I've seen is the most generic of the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.159
 The nearest razr is similar and everything comes 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.340
 these little feet you can keep 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.100
 in this little box here are weights well 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 Little ones are not big but 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 which give left a little heavier 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.080
 or slightly lighter to fps what is it? 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 very good you can save these 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 all that reminds you of a chador right? 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.720
 It's good to have a steal. 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.360
 This is the little box you left open and I already 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 I'll show you the mouse and talk the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.740
 I think the mouse is initially 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.670
 remembering that initially the box a lot 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.670
 cool 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.049
 so I thought a nice care is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.220
 compared to the voices we have in the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.220
 Brazilian market today 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.380
 O 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.689
 they send a toast a mouse pad is not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.040
 very big to be very little 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.570
 I think it's for the mouse since they 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.950
 want to enter the market with 11 with a 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.009
 little more than the quality of life of a 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.959
 mouse pad 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.580
 the size of my bike mouse pad 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.900
 mouse comes out easy, right? 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.550
 There is no way, I'll put it from here. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.590
 Little mouse over you have a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:26.550
 good idea comes with an installation cd 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.340
 and a user guide cd cris boy 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.440
 it was the tiny actress who pulls out well 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.260
 I was little but I could find the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.629
 software drivers on the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.840
 multilaser it comes with software that 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.819
 you can adjust the tpi you can put the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.250
 A little slower vertical movement 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.379
 than horizontal can change the color of the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.470
 mouse to the colors you want is 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:56.310
 well of the hour in the fifth until photo images 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.810
 software on their guard here custody 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:05.220
 right because otherwise it turns into a giant 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:09.950
 for you to get a sack to see the mouse 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.950
 this is the multilaser mouse 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:22.769
 none I really found this keyboard and 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:25.080
 I find it very big here it gets bad for 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.489
 you access the back 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.239
 Suddenly I was a little more to 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.150
 front or a little lower would look better 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.730
 but it 's not bad, it's good, it's a keyboard 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.220
 Nice, I just think it's a little big, it 's not 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.560
 It's so easy for you to get back here like this. 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.840
 Can you get more could be a little 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.670
 smaller in my opinion the mouse footprint 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.489
 It's very good he dresses practically right. 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.769
 He is really good 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:58.950
 The difference in the mouse pad is good. 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.250
 use cool but if you like me like 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.530
 of a larger mouse pad looks bad here 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.270
 Underneath there are the little feet I told 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.300
 you 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.300
 little tiny little 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.300
 O is not large the size of the nail is smaller 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.770
 You 're very light on my mouse. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.380
 it's too heavy you can balance 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.930
 putting and taking these little feet out of here 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.660
 I let everyone is not so heavy like that 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.590
 It's not too heavy and I would kick the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.410
 years six years 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.010
 I'm bad at weight but should have a weight 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.870
 of what it rains like to compare to I do not know not 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.210
 I'm going to kick a weight, she's not that heavy. 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.250
 if not, I expected 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.240
 so I saw it was something much more 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.360
 heavy 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.020
 here you have a little button to change the 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.450
 profile you can have multiple profile 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.240
 Here on this button serves to 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.670
 change ipi to increase or decrease the 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 I think it's cool, it looks a bit 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.340
 fragile this button is it and I know if 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.360
 Taking good care of your mouse will not break 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.390
 easy not 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.820
 not something disposable and here 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.440
 you have a macro button reminding you that 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.560
 all these keys you can 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.800
 to customize in multilaser software 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.030
 so initially I thought it was very good yesterday 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.370
 I tested it by playing some fps games 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:26.300
 games in various games and the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:29.780
 mouse did very well indeed 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.520
 it has 4 thousand ipi do not know if it's real 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.240
 I do not know how to test ipi to see 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.290
 if all even one ms answer 18 buttons and 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.200
 it's very worth it 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.330
 Well, at least I liked it so far . 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.450
 I bought that mouse. 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.170
 multilaser oil is and recommends the 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.510
 Mouse 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.550
 but it's up to you, that's it. 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.590
 when I already have a little more 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.030
 time of use you have used with them and 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.400
 20 exchange more strange people one 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.980
 I'll tell you again if it's worth 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.290
 not worth it and see in the time of duration is 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.120
 the length of time varies from one 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.400
 user depends on how 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.250
 You treat the equipment but that's it. 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.410
 a lot of trouble with the multilaser mouse 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.150
 if you do not have the money to buy 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.660
 most expensive mouse suddenly who 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.330
 try another product 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.440
 I recommend 150 reais on average is this 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.520
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.410
 video liked 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.660
 Do not forget to take that little 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.860
 share with friends beauty I 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.210
 I'm here, we're looking at the next one. 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.630
 video a kiss 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.630
 God be with you
