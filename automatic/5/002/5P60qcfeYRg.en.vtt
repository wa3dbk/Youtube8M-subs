just kind of lights up the screen I

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.970 
just kind of lights up the screen I
presume<00:02:06.670> it's<00:02:06.820> just<00:02:07.260> designed<00:02:08.260> just<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.800> do

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
presume it's just designed just to do

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.620 
presume it's just designed just to do
simply<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.480> lock<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:12.270> really<00:02:13.270> do

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
simply that this is lock of it really do

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.870 
simply that this is lock of it really do
anything<00:02:13.990> I'm<00:02:14.260> not<00:02:14.380> quite<00:02:14.560> sure<00:02:14.590> why

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.310 

again<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.000> unlock<00:02:19.360> mechanisms<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.050> bit<00:02:20.200> I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
again this unlock mechanisms a bit I

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.650 
again this unlock mechanisms a bit I
know<00:02:20.380> it's<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.770> Microsoft<00:02:21.640> default<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.330> if<00:02:22.360> you

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
know it's a Microsoft default but if you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.040 
know it's a Microsoft default but if you
press<00:02:23.610> unlock<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.030> then<00:02:25.210> you're<00:02:25.450> press<00:02:25.690> star

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
press unlock and then you're press star

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.660 
press unlock and then you're press star
which<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.350> kinda<00:02:26.890> hard<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.100> find<00:02:27.400> it's

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
which is kinda hard to find it's

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.270 
which is kinda hard to find it's
actually<00:02:28.230> way<00:02:29.230> down<00:02:29.410> there<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.740> Zed<00:02:30.010> key

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
actually way down there on the Zed key

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.890 
actually way down there on the Zed key
so<00:02:30.460> you've<00:02:30.610> actually<00:02:30.730> got<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.060> really<00:02:31.660> get

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
so you've actually got to really get

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.130 
so you've actually got to really get
your<00:02:32.020> nail<00:02:32.230> into<00:02:32.500> there<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:34.060> think<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.020> should
