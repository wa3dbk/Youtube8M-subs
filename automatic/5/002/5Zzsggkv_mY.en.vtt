I<00:07:22.760> was<00:07:23.510> thinking<00:07:23.840> that<00:07:23.900> it<00:07:24.080> was<00:07:24.200> developed<00:07:24.740> and

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
I was thinking that it was developed and

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.280 
I was thinking that it was developed and
you<00:07:25.430> know<00:07:25.550> sometimes<00:07:25.940> things<00:07:26.360> get<00:07:26.660> lost<00:07:26.810> in

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.290 
you know sometimes things get lost in

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.880 
you know sometimes things get lost in
translation<00:07:27.320> and<00:07:28.750> it<00:07:29.750> seems<00:07:30.170> to<00:07:30.410> me<00:07:30.560> that<00:07:30.590> he

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:30.890 
translation and it seems to me that he

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.530 
translation and it seems to me that he
said<00:07:31.160> they<00:07:31.340> were<00:07:31.400> Deven<00:07:31.880> immed<00:07:32.090> but<00:07:32.360> I

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.540 
said they were Deven immed but I

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.390 
said they were Deven immed but I
remember<00:07:33.110> quite<00:07:33.320> clearly<00:07:33.380> the<00:07:34.010> year<00:07:34.220> before

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
remember quite clearly the year before

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.640 
remember quite clearly the year before
when<00:07:34.850> I<00:07:34.880> was<00:07:35.120> here<00:07:35.480> that<00:07:36.020> I<00:07:36.080> heard<00:07:36.350> about<00:07:36.500> a

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:36.650 
when I was here that I heard about a

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.190 
when I was here that I heard about a
snake<00:07:37.070> Swami<00:07:37.430> used<00:07:37.940> to<00:07:38.060> come<00:07:38.270> and<00:07:38.600> let<00:07:38.810> people

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:39.200 
snake Swami used to come and let people

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.500 
snake Swami used to come and let people
hold<00:07:39.440> his<00:07:39.680> snakes<00:07:40.070> that<00:07:40.460> were<00:07:40.610> not<00:07:41.030> Deven

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.510
