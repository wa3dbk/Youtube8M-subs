00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
bones in the front one of them got bent
so<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.019> took<00:01:04.170> them<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.619> it'd<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.830> rear

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
so I just took them out so it'd be rear

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
so I just took them out so it'd be rear
wheel<00:01:05.220> drive<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.030> we'll<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.270> them

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
new soon actually I love this sound it
actually<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:13.170> ESC<00:01:13.770> makes<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> normal

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
actually this ESC makes the normal

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
actually this ESC makes the normal
castle<00:01:14.909> sound<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> there's<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.710> again<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:25.110> is

love I love that sound about castle

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.569 
love I love that sound about castle
systems<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.930> pretty<00:01:37.380> big<00:01:37.710> compared<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
systems and it's pretty big compared to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.310 
systems and it's pretty big compared to
my<00:01:38.700> wrestler<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> mean<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.479> pre<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.200> it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
my wrestler I mean it's not pre bit it's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.370 
my wrestler I mean it's not pre bit it's
not<00:01:40.439> big<00:01:40.680> compared<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:42.020> bigger<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
not big compared to it but it's bigger a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.600 
not big compared to it but it's bigger a
little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.799> bigger<00:01:43.829> than<00:01:44.189> it'll<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
little bit bigger than it'll just and so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.389 
little bit bigger than it'll just and so
here's<00:01:50.790> my<00:01:50.909> Rustler<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> here's<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> comparison

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
here's my Rustler so here's a comparison

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.810 
here's my Rustler so here's a comparison
both<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.610> them<00:01:56.790> her<00:01:57.630> side<00:01:57.990> by<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
both of them her side by side as a

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.160 
both of them her side by side as a
bird's<00:01:59.820> eye<00:01:59.969> view<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> they're<00:02:03.840> about<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
bird's eye view so they're about the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.459 
bird's eye view so they're about the
same<00:02:04.350> size<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.770> guess<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.600> just<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.810> back<00:02:07.110> just

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
same size I guess I just got back just

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.400 
same size I guess I just got back just
ate<00:02:08.190> dinner<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.610> stuff<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:10.080> made<00:02:10.229> this

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
ate dinner and stuff so I just made this

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.110 
ate dinner and stuff so I just made this
video<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.220> tell<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.489> guys<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> got

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
video just to tell you guys that I got

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.440 
video just to tell you guys that I got
it<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.540> came<00:02:13.170> with<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.470> batter

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
it and then came with this batter

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.100 
it and then came with this batter
it<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.739> 11.1<00:02:16.739> volt<00:02:17.010> which<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.370> 3<00:02:17.640> s<00:02:18.110> 4,200

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
it was 11.1 volt which is a 3 s 4,200

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.180 
it was 11.1 volt which is a 3 s 4,200
milliamp<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.780> came<00:02:21.989> with<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.349> also<00:02:22.860> this

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
milliamp and it came with this also this

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.699 
milliamp and it came with this also this
onyx<00:02:23.610> charger<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.480> dirt<00:02:25.050> racks

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
onyx charger and dirt racks

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.520 
onyx charger and dirt racks
she's<00:02:26.459> pretty<00:02:26.700> awesome<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.410> actually

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
she's pretty awesome so I'm actually

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.640 
she's pretty awesome so I'm actually
