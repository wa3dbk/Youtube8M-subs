00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.540
 we come back here now with the question of 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.360
 number 4 let's name the protocol 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.260
 which enables communication between 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.259
 networks connected to the internet this is the language 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.320
 as one of the computers that integrate the 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.620
 internet is the biggest and wants to know people the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.400
 name of the protocol that enables 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:43.750
 communication between networks linked to 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.579
 This is the common language between 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.449
 all the computers that integrate the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.070
 Internet 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.079
 This question is very interesting to 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.019
 People do a quick review on people. 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.210
 the internet, people are a structure that 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.079
 interconnects different networks in the world 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.239
 all 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.379
 no matter what computer you 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.199
 use if and if it is a smartphone if it is 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.870
 computer is handheld 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.490
 no notebook computer does not matter 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.560
 no matter what windows systems 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.750
 linux does not matter 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.799
 even if they are different language 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 even if they are different architectures 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.509
 all will communicate over the internet 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.329
 because the internet is a projected network 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.090
 for the communication of all the other 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.820
 It's good and because that's possible let's go. 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.360
 there the internet was created based on 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.880
 tcp / ip protocol or everything that goes 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.430
 enter the internet everything that will 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.770
 communicate on the internet have to see 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.610
 this standard rule within this protocol 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.020
 standard of communication, ie all 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.810
 the internet services 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.360
 they can only exchange information between them 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.579
 because of ip tcp 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.799
 if it were not for tcp / ip it does not have a default 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.659
 that different networks 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.430
 could not communicate 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.119
 so windows is within the standard 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.479
 tcp / ip linux has ip tcp support 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.570
 The tablets that you use iphones are the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.160
 others and the other species of 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.220
 smartphones are all within the standard 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.050
 tcp / ip internet browsers 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.129
 e-mail programs 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.280
 logical that tcp ip it is not formed by 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.580
 but by several protocols all these 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.200
 pro 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.760
 what we are seeing in class 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.990
 today http rtp.pt the ppi and map 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.080
 everything is within this ip tcp standard 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.020
 That's why our question she asks is 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.730
 What is the protocol that has the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.480
 form of communication between all 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.630
 networks 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.270
 or our response is tcp ip 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.320
 he was not specific about access to 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.570
 pages 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.390
 he was not specific on transfer 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.870
 File He Was Not Specific Shipping 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.260
 then our response is tcp / ip 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.900
 because he spoke generally so 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.860
 It's good, then let's go to the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.350
 next question the issue of number 5 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:18.700
 https protocol we have already learned 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:21.160
 which is the most http sl or pls 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.340
 we know it is encryption in the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.709
 communication from http he wants to know what 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.050
 that's the question a simple question 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.610
 checks with parent before address 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.910
 accessed nothing to see 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.450
 use encryption is our answer ok 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.459
 good 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.610
 scan the sack for viruses 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.080
 nothing to see this antivirus just works 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.540
 inside an intranet there is no internet 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.290
 uses the same services and the same 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.739
 protocols on the internet, or you can use 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.610
 http can use https but https is not only 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.190
 used on internet, this has nothing to do 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.900
 prevents the use of espoo fin that later 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.790
 Let's talk what it is when you are. 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.600
 talking about information security 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.910
 has nothing to do with this option either 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.910
 then our answer is the letter b
