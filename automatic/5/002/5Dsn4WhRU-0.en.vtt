00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:13.759
 We continue with a second part of what was the harvest party of the 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.099
 rice because one of the private companies also presented a new 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.899
 technology and machinery option for producers of this item 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 in honor of ntra 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.599
 the national festival of rice harvest was used by the company 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.819
 July are met 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:38.379
 to show new technologies for this item is about the combine 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.570
 automotive 95 70 st 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.889
 efe of Brazilian origin that guarantees a higher quality of grains 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:48.650
 with low loss rates 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.740
 now the main one to the past is 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.800
 the cancellation of the liberal no more intact without 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.679
 citing years 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.580
 knees especially far 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.240
 in relation to the already known vaccines 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.670
 by farmers 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.890
 this new option that offers majors in castilla and león césar antón winds 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 they change the union operation 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.010
 easier to open up to pay 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.490
 i in the same way the operation there unpleasant 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.900
 visual in the matba marking 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 if the machine was 100% if everything is working properly 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.870
 ccoo is losing the sixth gold will be an operator at the beginning a lot 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.830
 times 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.920
 look at the machine and undeniably this matter 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 why 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.870
 is going from a technology will be all mechanical leverages 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.610
 what digital 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.800
 but now the one that that person is operating previously to a 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.500
 ono training 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 days after a few weeks people do not want to talk anymore 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.640
 of a team that has for example 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.109
 air conditioner 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.860
 allows you to work much more works 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.740
 on the autopilot 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.930
 allows you to work more extended hours also with the help of the gps 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.170
 who the harvest map also what are we giving the performance 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.880
 my homework per hectare 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 gil the other tool that facilitates 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.049
 labor facilities 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.870
 Decent work capacity 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.120
 of the speed of the harvest and the variety of rice but the agility of the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.620
 same offers the same result of two conventional equipment reducing costs
