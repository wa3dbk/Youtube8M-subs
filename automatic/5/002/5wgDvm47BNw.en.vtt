00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
there's the forks right there I might

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
there's the forks right there I might
take<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.470> video<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> sunlight

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
take a video of it out in the sunlight
and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> ghost<00:01:20.549> didn't

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and then kind of like the ghost didn't

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.240 
and then kind of like the ghost didn't
specialized<00:01:21.570> underneath<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
specialized underneath and then the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.270 
specialized underneath and then the
specialize<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:24.140> it's<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> tennspeed

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
specialize here it's got the tennspeed

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:38.240 
specialize here it's got the tennspeed
Tigra<00:01:27.650> transmission<00:01:28.650> back<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:36.979> which<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Tigra transmission back here which I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
Tigra transmission back here which I
guess<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> sport<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.329> 9-speed<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.990> don't

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
guess the sport was of 9-speed I don't

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.179 
guess the sport was of 9-speed I don't
really<00:01:40.259> there's<00:01:40.560> too<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:40.829> too<00:01:41.100> many

really there's too much too many

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.950 
really there's too much too many
differences<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> than<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> transmission

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
differences of it than the transmission

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
differences of it than the transmission
and<00:01:43.110> maybe<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> color<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> few<00:01:44.549> other

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and maybe the color and just a few other

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.880 
and maybe the color and just a few other
minor<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.840> minor<00:01:46.079> things<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.619> you
