00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.000
 well 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.740
 today we end up with a tutorial 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.540
 to be able to make an oils 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.920
 Perfect capillaries for our hair 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.500
 afro it's very simple to do 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.470
 I selected four vegetable oils 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.040
 who are complaining of nutrients that are 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.760
 super good at it's going to feed your hair 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.500
 perfectly it'll smell good it'll be 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.890
 brilliant so 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.380
 so here I like using this 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.350
 oil right after having 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.200
 applied my moisturizer on hair 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.500
 wet because it allows me to 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.080
 trap hydration in my hair and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.170
 I also sometimes use this oil 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.200
 when I feel that my hair is a 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.300
 not very dull and on dry hair 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.399
 I apply a little oil for them 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.890
 make it a little brighter and so 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.890
 So here we go directly to the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.490
 manufacturing this oil do not hesitate 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.289
 to tell me what you think 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.929
 if you use other oils say 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.500
 me why and so ben here is more 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.500
 late next week 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:47.300
 so I'm going to use a bottle in 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 aluminum 250 km and we see start 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.110
 by the grape seed oil I like 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.479
 well this oil because not only 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.179
 it is not expensive but it is also 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.030
 filled with nutrients what will me 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.670
 to feed and repair my 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.420
 deep hair she is also 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.220
 rich in omega 6 that will help trap 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.610
 the hydration of my hair so we 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.060
 will put six tablespoons in the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.060
 preparation 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.860
 a way has now passed to oil of 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.090
 macadamia so this oil to the rich 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.480
 in omega 9 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.320
 it has nourishing properties and 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.420
 softener and it also protects 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.870
 hair against uv radiation from 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.020
 Sun 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.300
 and finally she has a great smell of 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.250
 hazelnut 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.470
 I will add 5 tablespoons 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.470
 of macadamia oil in my preparation 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.110
 we will now go to the oil of 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.300
 passion fruit so this oil is 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.400
 regenerates and nourishes dry hair 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.410
 without the sandstone that is because it has a 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.920
 fine and dry texture 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.920
 she also has a sublime exotic smell 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.220
 we will add 2 tablespoons 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.220
 of passion fire oil 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.310
 now kikwit city so this 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.290
 oil it is rich in omega 3 and 6 and 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.540
 so it's you she is able to 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.660
 penetrate inside the fiber 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.600
 capillary to be able to repair and 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.800
 nourish deeply she also calms 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.200
 irritations of the scalp 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:44.270
 so I will also add 2 spoons to 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.860
 couy oil soup we'll go to 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.340
 the bitter almond essential oil so 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.330
 I'm going to add just a few drops 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.540
 a dozen drops of bitter almond 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.720
 to give a slight sweet smell to my 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.720
 preparation 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.990
 and we will finish with vitamin e which 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.330
 is an antioxidant and it will allow me 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.900
 to avoid the rancidity of my oil and 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:20.510
 to be able to keep it longer 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:26.540
 and so I'm going to add 0 5 ml of 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:32.630
