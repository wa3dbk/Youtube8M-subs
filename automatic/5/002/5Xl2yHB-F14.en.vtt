00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
actually been putting myself through a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
actually been putting myself through a
lot<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.149> pressure<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.989> don't<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.530> can

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
lot of pressure and I don't think I can

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
lot of pressure and I don't think I can
do<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.460> school<00:00:42.059> starts<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.260> be

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
do that when school starts so I will be

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
do that when school starts so I will be
just<00:00:43.890> doing<00:00:44.190> videos<00:00:44.700> whenever<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.870> or

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
just doing videos whenever I can or

whenever I don't know whenever I can I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
whenever I don't know whenever I can I
guess<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.660> they<00:00:51.660> will<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:51.989> will<00:00:52.020> become

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
guess and they will they will become

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
guess and they will they will become
better<00:00:52.710> videos<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> will

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
