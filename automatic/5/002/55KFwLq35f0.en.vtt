00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
so I remember when I was going down the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.270 
so I remember when I was going down the
German<00:00:55.870> line<00:00:56.020> I<00:00:56.050> was<00:00:56.320> never<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.680> very<00:00:57.040> big<00:00:57.250> fan

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
German line I was never a very big fan

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.440 
German line I was never a very big fan
of<00:00:57.550> 3k<00:00:58.150> 360<00:00:58.870> 1m<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.800> mean<00:01:00.430> it's<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.970> fantastic

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
of 3k 360 1m I mean it's a fantastic

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.580 
of 3k 360 1m I mean it's a fantastic
time<00:01:01.600> it's<00:01:01.780> got<00:01:01.900> a<00:01:01.930> good<00:01:02.110> arm<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.440> good

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
time it's got a good arm a good

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.890 
time it's got a good arm a good
protection<00:01:02.920> they've<00:01:03.850> gets<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.210> fantastical

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
protection they've gets a fantastical

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.930 
protection they've gets a fantastical
but<00:01:05.019> I<00:01:05.170> think<00:01:05.379> it<00:01:05.470> was<00:01:05.560> just<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.670> overall

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
but I think it was just the the overall

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.609 
but I think it was just the the overall
speed<00:01:07.210> maneuverability<00:01:07.990> but<00:01:08.140> i<00:01:08.290> tell<00:01:08.530> if

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
speed maneuverability but i tell if

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.760 
speed maneuverability but i tell if

so<00:02:18.140> judging<00:02:19.069> by<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.220> map<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.970> speed<00:02:20.270> that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
so judging by the map but the speed that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.000 
so judging by the map but the speed that
the<00:02:20.660> best<00:02:20.959> captures<00:02:21.379> ticket<00:02:21.650> number<00:02:21.950> two

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
the best captures ticket number two

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.860 
the best captures ticket number two
looks<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.550> they've<00:02:22.940> actually<00:02:23.090> got<00:02:23.330> quite<00:02:23.510> a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
looks like they've actually got quite a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.369 
looks like they've actually got quite a
few<00:02:24.319> people<00:02:24.800> on<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.280> left-hand<00:02:25.670> planet<00:02:26.379> so

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
few people on that left-hand planet so

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.140 
few people on that left-hand planet so
this<00:02:27.830> could<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.730> over<00:02:29.000> fairly<00:02:29.599> quickly<00:02:30.050> if

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
this could be over fairly quickly if

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.650 
this could be over fairly quickly if
these<00:02:32.150> guys<00:02:32.480> aren't<00:02:32.840> careful

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
these guys aren't careful

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.140 
these guys aren't careful
so<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.380> cements<00:02:36.070> pretty<00:02:36.310> much<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> favor

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
so it cements pretty much in the favor

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.420 
so it cements pretty much in the favor
