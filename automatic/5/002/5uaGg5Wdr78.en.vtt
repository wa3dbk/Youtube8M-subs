which we recast at about 60 pounds and
greets<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> side<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> foundry<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
greets the side of the foundry as you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
greets the side of the foundry as you
know<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.460> had<00:01:44.670> our<00:01:44.820> friends<00:01:45.180> down<00:01:45.299> at

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
know and then we had our friends down at

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.319 
know and then we had our friends down at
I<00:01:45.860> enterprises<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> initial

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
I enterprises actually do the initial

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
I enterprises actually do the initial
bore<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.229> had<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> nice<00:01:49.619> round<00:01:49.920> bore

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
bore to know we had a nice round bore

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.510 
bore to know we had a nice round bore
and<00:01:50.780> then<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.930> honed<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.369> what

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and then we honed it up and this is what

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.120 
and then we honed it up and this is what
it<00:01:53.610> looks<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.439> prior<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.710> being<00:01:55.860> assembled

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it looks like prior to being assembled

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.469 
it looks like prior to being assembled
into<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> engine<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:58.500> did<00:01:58.680> use<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.180> wide<00:02:00.180> pack

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
into the engine we did use the wide pack

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.240 
into the engine we did use the wide pack
foam<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.110> little<00:02:01.380> lower<00:02:01.619> cost<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.159> we

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
foam on this little lower cost but we

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429 
foam on this little lower cost but we
still<00:02:02.399> got<00:02:02.579> good<00:02:02.790> good<00:02:03.329> metal-poor<00:02:03.899> in

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
still got good good metal-poor in

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.800 
still got good good metal-poor in
addition<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.219> also<00:02:05.399> did<00:02:05.850> recaps<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
addition that we also did recaps the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
addition that we also did recaps the
piston<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.439> aluminum<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.759> there's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
piston and aluminum you can see there's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
piston and aluminum you can see there's
a<00:02:09.000> hole<00:02:09.179> down<00:02:09.390> there<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.780> increase<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.379> help

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
a hole down there to increase the help

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.410 
a hole down there to increase the help
increase<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.009> surface<00:02:11.250> area<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.760> cast<00:02:12.060> both

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
increase the surface area we cast both

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.770 
increase the surface area we cast both
with<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.750> hole

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
with the hole

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.380 
with the hole
and<00:02:13.900> without<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.950> whole<00:02:15.130> solid<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.910> see<00:02:16.120> which

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and without the whole solid to see which

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.940 
and without the whole solid to see which
one<00:02:16.630> we<00:02:16.750> get<00:02:16.870> better<00:02:17.110> performance<00:02:17.380> out<00:02:17.890> of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
one we get better performance out of

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.160 
one we get better performance out of
right<00:02:18.220> now<00:02:18.400> we're<00:02:18.610> using<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.660> hole<00:02:19.930> in

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
right now we're using the the hole in

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.290 
right now we're using the the hole in
the<00:02:20.260> trial<00:02:20.530> test<00:02:20.830> will<00:02:21.550> swap<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.970> other<00:02:22.120> one

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
the trial test will swap the other one

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.390 
the trial test will swap the other one
out<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.930> while<00:02:23.850> here<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.300> see<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.709> the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
out in a while here you can see the the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.090 
out in a while here you can see the the
piston<00:02:27.940> excuse<00:02:28.900> me<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.140> coal<00:02:29.350> cylinder<00:02:29.890> here

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
piston excuse me the coal cylinder here

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.670 
piston excuse me the coal cylinder here
and<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.300> displacer<00:02:32.140> pipe<00:02:32.410> is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and then they the displacer pipe is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.530 
and then they the displacer pipe is
attached<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.580> just<00:02:34.120> show<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.390> little

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
attached to it just show you a little

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.210 
attached to it just show you a little
bit<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.350> home<00:02:35.530> there's<00:02:35.800> actually<00:02:36.190> a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
bit of the the home there's actually a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.280 
bit of the the home there's actually a
reflection<00:02:36.880> there<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:38.230> our

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
reflection there on that on our

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.830 
reflection there on that on our
displacer<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.220> added<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.580> small<00:02:39.850> bearing<00:02:40.360> for

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
displacer we added a small bearing for

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.260 
displacer we added a small bearing for
it<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.050> help<00:02:41.230> ride<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.800> ride<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
it to help ride the ride on in the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.850 
it to help ride the ride on in the
cylinder<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.930> reduces<00:02:44.440> some<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.770> the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
cylinder and this reduces some of the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.370 
cylinder and this reduces some of the
frictional<00:02:45.310> pull<00:02:45.580> on<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.750> displacer

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
frictional pull on that the displacer

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.229 
frictional pull on that the displacer
itself<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:48.040> made<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.580> three<00:02:48.640> components

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
itself is made up of three components

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.170 
itself is made up of three components
it's<00:02:50.140> made<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.620> aluminum<00:02:51.310> sheet<00:02:51.640> metal<00:02:52.030> that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
it's made of aluminum sheet metal that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.850 
it's made of aluminum sheet metal that
actually<00:02:52.510> goes<00:02:52.660> into<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.959> hot<00:02:53.170> end<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.739> then

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
actually goes into the hot end and then

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.900 
actually goes into the hot end and then
there's<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.130> fiber<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.940> foam<00:02:55.750> glass

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
there's a fiber and foam glass

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.160 
there's a fiber and foam glass
midsection<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:58.540> there's<00:02:59.080> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
midsection and then there's a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.400 
midsection and then there's a
lightweight<00:02:59.709> foam<00:03:00.160> cold<00:03:01.090> section<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:01.780> each

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
lightweight foam cold section on each

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.530 
lightweight foam cold section on each
end<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.010> displaces<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.730> nipple<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.330> help

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
end of this displaces a nipple to help

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.180 
end of this displaces a nipple to help
increase<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.989> surface<00:03:05.350> area<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.950> into

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
increase the surface area going into

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.160 
increase the surface area going into
both<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.400> hot<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.880> cold<00:03:07.080> addition<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
both the hot and cold addition the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.990 
both the hot and cold addition the
displacer<00:03:08.830> we<00:03:08.950> did<00:03:09.100> some<00:03:09.280> work<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.700> piston

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
displacer we did some work on the piston

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.410 
displacer we did some work on the piston
rings<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.709> was<00:03:11.890> kind<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.220> key<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:13.300> had

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
rings and this was kind of key is we had

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.960 
rings and this was kind of key is we had
to<00:03:13.540> create<00:03:13.930> an<00:03:14.050> undercut<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.860> then<00:03:15.430> dome<00:03:15.730> the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
to create an undercut and then dome the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.090 
to create an undercut and then dome the
top<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.569> we<00:03:16.690> get<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> good<00:03:17.140> sealing<00:03:17.620> surface

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
top so we get a good sealing surface

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.740 
top so we get a good sealing surface
with<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> equipment<00:03:18.610> using<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.329> develop

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
with the equipment using to develop

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.140 
with the equipment using to develop
those<00:03:19.900> particular<00:03:20.350> rings<00:03:20.850> here<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.090> just

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
those particular rings here you can just

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.509 
those particular rings here you can just
see<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> engine<00:03:22.900> assembled<00:03:23.410> we<00:03:23.829> added<00:03:24.280> that

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
see the engine assembled we added that

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.490 
see the engine assembled we added that
we've<00:03:24.670> got<00:03:24.850> two<00:03:25.000> temperature<00:03:25.510> probes<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:26.140> here

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
we've got two temperature probes in here

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.800 
we've got two temperature probes in here
in<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.769> simplified<00:03:27.430> temperature<00:03:28.390> reading

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
in the simplified temperature reading

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.009 
in the simplified temperature reading
okay<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.739> what's<00:03:30.220> left<00:03:30.549> on<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.880> agenda<00:03:31.209> we<00:03:31.870> do

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
okay so what's left on the agenda we do

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.900 
okay so what's left on the agenda we do
want<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.290> take<00:03:32.410> another<00:03:32.650> another<00:03:33.310> cut<00:03:33.670> at<00:03:33.880> the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
want to take another another cut at the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.100 
want to take another another cut at the

can get our speed up to spec we should

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.520 
can get our speed up to spec we should
have<00:03:51.790> some<00:03:51.970> updates<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.930> little<00:03:53.230> coming<00:03:53.470> a
