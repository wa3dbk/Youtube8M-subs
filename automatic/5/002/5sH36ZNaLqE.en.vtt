the video I think is just gonna be me
solving<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.600> if<00:02:19.380> you're<00:02:19.590> bored<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.140> can

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
solving it so if you're bored you can

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.300 
solving it so if you're bored you can
just<00:02:23.570> get<00:02:24.570> through<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:27.050> again<00:02:28.160> find<00:02:29.160> that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
just get through that so again find that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:41.930 
just get through that so again find that
-<00:02:29.610> hole<00:02:39.470> kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> mixes<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.100> up<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:41.760> you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
- hole kind of mixes it up and then you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.140 
- hole kind of mixes it up and then you
want<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.270> do<00:02:42.480> some<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:43.550> manual<00:02:44.550> or<00:02:44.940> what<00:02:45.120> I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
want to do some just manual or what I

call manual arranging here there's the
gap<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.230> bolt<00:02:52.520> whatever<00:02:53.520> I'm<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.700> gonna

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
gap so the bolt whatever I'm not gonna

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.780 
gap so the bolt whatever I'm not gonna
mix<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.420> up<00:02:54.510> all<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.720> way<00:02:55.340> just<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.520> like<00:02:56.760> a

really not so good scramble which it

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.030 
really not so good scramble which it
would<00:03:03.660> be<00:03:03.810> probably<00:03:04.200> easy<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.950> see<00:03:07.950> how

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
