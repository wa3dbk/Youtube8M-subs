it's an ongoing reward system which to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.499 
it's an ongoing reward system which to
me<00:02:08.190> makes<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.729> much<00:02:08.910> better<00:02:08.970> because

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
me makes it that much better because

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
me makes it that much better because
pretty<00:02:10.080> much<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.470> seems<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> win-win

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
pretty much it seems like a win-win

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.950 
pretty much it seems like a win-win
situation<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.030> everyone<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
situation for everyone and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.750 
situation for everyone and
looking<00:02:13.170> down<00:02:13.380> here<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:13.950> tells<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.490> how<00:02:14.730> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
looking down here this tells you how to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.700 
looking down here this tells you how to
earn<00:02:15.060> points<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:15.990> must<00:02:16.350> use<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
earn points so you must use the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.650 
earn points so you must use the
application<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:17.520> at<00:02:17.610> least<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:18.060> minute<00:02:18.240> you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
application for at least one minute you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.990 
application for at least one minute you
also<00:02:18.840> cannot<00:02:19.410> switch<00:02:19.740> networks<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.790> for

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
also cannot switch networks so for

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.730 
also cannot switch networks so for
example<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.810> can't<00:02:22.110> switch<00:02:22.410> from<00:02:22.590> your

quick math with you if you for example

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.180 
quick math with you if you for example
won<00:04:38.910> at<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.090> $50<00:04:39.570> Amazon<00:04:40.110> gift<00:04:40.410> card<00:04:40.680> then<00:04:41.010> you

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
won at a $50 Amazon gift card then you

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.740 
won at a $50 Amazon gift card then you
would<00:04:41.340> need<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.639> make<00:04:41.669> thirty<00:04:42.180> thousand

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
would need to make thirty thousand

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.870 
would need to make thirty thousand
points<00:04:43.110> because<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.740> can<00:04:43.979> pretty<00:04:44.190> much<00:04:44.280> get<00:04:44.729> a

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
points because you can pretty much get a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.480 
points because you can pretty much get a
dollar<00:04:45.449> for<00:04:45.840> 600<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:46.770> if<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.070> make<00:04:47.220> thirty

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
dollar for 600 so if you make thirty

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.969 
dollar for 600 so if you make thirty
thousand<00:04:47.970> points<00:04:48.240> that's<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.510> $50<00:04:49.110> Amazon<00:04:49.380> gift

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979
