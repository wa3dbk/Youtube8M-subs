00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and I thought it was great because

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.709 
and I thought it was great because
obviously<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.500> internet<00:00:49.890> meme<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.719> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
obviously the internet meme is the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
obviously the internet meme is the
second<00:00:52.140> item<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.010> picked<00:00:53.399> up

it's just this plain green long-sleeved
top<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.920> I<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.879> three<00:01:00.210> pound

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
top and I think this was three pound

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.290 
top and I think this was three pound
fifty<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.859> long<00:01:02.430> sleeved<00:01:02.940> plain

fifty and it's just long sleeved plain

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.469 
fifty and it's just long sleeved plain
kaki<00:01:04.080> t-shirt<00:01:04.700> and<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.909> yeah<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.270> only

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
kaki t-shirt and so yeah that was only

three pound fifty which i think is an

really moisturizing and really nice
texture<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.200> I<00:04:02.230> really<00:04:02.590> really<00:04:02.680> like<00:04:02.950> this

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.630 

so<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.510> final<00:04:08.900> thing<00:04:09.050> I<00:04:09.319> picked<00:04:09.500> up<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:10.280> two

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
so the final thing I picked up is two

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.030 
so the final thing I picked up is two
boxes<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.510> primal<00:04:12.050> Ark<00:04:12.170> natural<00:04:12.769> lashes

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
boxes of the primal Ark natural lashes

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.790 
boxes of the primal Ark natural lashes
and<00:04:13.550> these<00:04:13.940> are<00:04:14.120> only<00:04:14.269> one<00:04:14.660> pound<00:04:15.080> each<00:04:15.440> which

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
and these are only one pound each which

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.520 
and these are only one pound each which
i<00:04:15.980> think<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.430> amazing<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.440> thought

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
i think is amazing and I just thought

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.199 
i think is amazing and I just thought
needs<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.859> be<00:04:18.950> really<00:04:19.250> really<00:04:19.340> useful<00:04:19.489> for

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
needs to be really really useful for

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.230 
needs to be really really useful for
doing<00:04:20.510> kind<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.989> more<00:04:21.739> dramatic<00:04:22.520> makeup<00:04:22.970> looks

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
doing kind of more dramatic makeup looks

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.940 
doing kind of more dramatic makeup looks
and<00:04:23.480> just<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:23.990> practicing<00:04:24.530> with<00:04:24.710> false

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
and just for practicing with false

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.460 
and just for practicing with false
eyelashes<00:04:25.490> because<00:04:25.700> I'm<00:04:26.060> not<00:04:26.270> really<00:04:27.200> that

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
eyelashes because I'm not really that

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.350 
eyelashes because I'm not really that
used<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.919> them<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.490> really<00:04:28.760> want<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.030> Wesen

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
used to them and I really want to Wesen

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.640 
used to them and I really want to Wesen
for<00:04:29.540> problems<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.020> thought<00:04:30.200> I'd<00:04:30.320> try<00:04:30.530> these

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
for problems so I thought I'd try these

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.860 
for problems so I thought I'd try these
up<00:04:30.919> first<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.550> see<00:04:31.669> if<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.880> can<00:04:32.060> master<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.600> and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
up first and see if I can master it and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.420 
up first and see if I can master it and
then<00:04:33.350> I<00:04:33.620> can<00:04:33.830> move<00:04:34.010> on<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.190> some<00:04:34.400> more

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
then I can move on to some more

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.129 
then I can move on to some more
expensive<00:04:34.850> ones<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.479> just<00:04:35.720> thought<00:04:35.870> four

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
expensive ones but I just thought four

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.830 
expensive ones but I just thought four
pound<00:04:36.889> each<00:04:37.250> these<00:04:37.639> were<00:04:37.820> really<00:04:38.240> really<00:04:38.630> good

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
pound each these were really really good

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.840 
pound each these were really really good
buy<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.440> was<00:04:42.560> everything<00:04:43.460> that<00:04:43.490> was<00:04:43.639> in

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
buy that it was everything that was in

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.719 
buy that it was everything that was in
local<00:04:44.240> my<00:04:44.360> back<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.770> really<00:04:46.370> hope<00:04:46.520> you've

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729
