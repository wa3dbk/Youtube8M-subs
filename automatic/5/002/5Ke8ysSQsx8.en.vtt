00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.410
 we started with the tutorial the second 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.830
 tutorial of this bottle 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.129
 we already changed yarn now what 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.259
 let's do let's do 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.259
 46 half points 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.539
 and let's start right here 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.570
 doing our first half point already 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.680
 the time we're going to go hiding our 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.230
 stamen 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.230
 one here I'm going to cut a little 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.640
 one 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.260
 two 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.899
 3 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:56.330
 4 and so on until you have 46 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:01.260
 half points this is round number 6 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:06.180
 from the top of our routine 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.700
 I already have my 46 half points and should have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.890
 have stayed in this way the part 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.940
 upside down is by the inside 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.170
 and the right part is on the part of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.500
 outside now pay attention let's 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.500
 do 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:33.930
 a half point extended in this way 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.780
 I already made my 46 half points now I'm going to 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.750
 do 1 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.410
 I have extended 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.660
 let's do this we put here our 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.710
 hook as if we were to make a medium 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.400
 point we take out 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.540
 and here we load our hook and we do 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.290
 a loop and now we are going to close it 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.290
 this form 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.250
 this is an extended half point 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.369
 after having made our point 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.340
 our half point extended now not 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.950
 let's close 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.459
 nor are we going to spin our tissue we're going to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.430
 continue weaving in this direction and let's 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.879
 to make seven half points of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.440
 extended in the same way as 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.950
 the one that I just taught you 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.830
 let's take here the first one that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.370
 we have on this side that was the first 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.310
 what we did 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:42.099
 and we are going to do as if we were going to do 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:46.530
 half point we load we take out and here 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.530
 we will do here we close it 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.380
 well we will do 7 we have the first 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:00.110
 we go back to the next point 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.160
 we take out and close 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.160
 we carry 2 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.180
 3 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.849
 4 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.280
 5 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.500
 6 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.280
 and 7 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.990
 after having done our seven 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:51.980
 means extended points now we will do 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.870
 33 half points in the following 33 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:00.900
 points 1 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:04.610
 2 and so on until you have your 33 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.610
 average normal points 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:15.520
 after we finished our 33 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:18.790
 half points we will do seven again 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.329
 means extended points of it 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.800
 way that I showed you 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.340
 we take out 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:32.250
 here we take out another house 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.250
 and we close and we already have one 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.139
 two 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.539
 3 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.669
 4 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.340
 5 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.980
 7 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:14.189
 already our fabrics 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:16.619
 and seven half extended points either 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.559
 let's slide or let's turn 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:22.439
 our fabric what we have to do 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:27.029
 now is that we are going to do in the turn 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:29.760
 number eight let's weave 47 media 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:31.800
 points like this 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.550
 here is one 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.550
 everyone 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.150
 3 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:45.370
 4 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:49.110
 5 and so on until you have your 47 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.110
 half points
