00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello welcome to the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.799
 youtube channel today i would like once 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.210
 The most important thing is how to explain 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.929
 In the rain, many beginners have that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.180
 problem the death of the fingers hurt that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.260
 force the say I do not know how that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.880
 then goes then does not sound right and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 it is simply because of that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.730
 is explained incorrectly and I explain 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.520
 now exactly how to do a parea 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.370
 could easy and easy attacks and how 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.879
 you can practice that so you do not fight 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.680
 gets more in hand, whatever 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.870
 again wrong is explained when turning 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 You have to explain the finger here 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.690
 above it over all six strings 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.570
 and must with the thumb with the thumb 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.670
 press against it and of course the deaf 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.129
 köster against the fingers crystals zig 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.170
 then I am completely tense 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.320
 I can not move anything here 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.519
 I'm totally tense 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 besides, with certainty I will then 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.159
 play the fight against tree because it 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.700
 that's just wrong when you look at yourself 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.720
 look at a chord then you take yes 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 even with the coffee here already times in 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.439
 the case I take only f major I have yes 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 here already the poor one seized 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.970
 this would have the gesture that means mine 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.880
 finger my barré finger must be this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.750
 Times can not move anymore because of the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.640
 play already 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.030
 That means what else do I need 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.630
 need the first page the sixth the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.250
 deep and the high the haz.de his team 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.380
 I have to grab and now I do 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.530
 namely my main barré index finger 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.979
 crooked and I press it now 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.090
 that one sees that and I grab 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:02.320
 namely with the bar finger only here 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.960
 the front page and here and here 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.020
 the high leisure I need that 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.989
 means I make the finger slightly crooked 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.930
 and my pressure points are only here 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.540
 and here and here but no case 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.160
 all the finger and then I need 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.720
 but no more pressure because if the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.470
 finger stupidity is curved 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.700
 then I have these three sides which I 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.390
 grips and the other sound of 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.360
 alone 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:36.230
 and as a trick do that with f major 10 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 back there fits the e major and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.390
 concentrate on the fact that you only have the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.069
 points that you actually need picks 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.379
 I hope that helped a bit 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.269
 and in the future , a barcode will become easy 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.879
 and easy to play for you and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.680
