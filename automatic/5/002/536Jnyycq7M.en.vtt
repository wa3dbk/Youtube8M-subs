like in a given driving context assume

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
like in a given driving context assume
you<00:01:10.350> wake<00:01:10.590> up<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> morning<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.820> you

you wake up in the morning right so you

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.910 
you wake up in the morning right so you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
be an office in nine o'clock right and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
be an office in nine o'clock right and
we<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.250> basically<00:01:17.759> integrate<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
we can basically integrate the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
we can basically integrate the
information<00:01:19.430> services<00:01:20.430> which<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.729> related

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
information services which are related

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
information services which are related
to<00:01:21.270> driving<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> information<00:01:22.740> services

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to driving to the information services

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.780 
to driving to the information services
related<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.360> lifestyle<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.110> whole<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
related to your lifestyle in whole and

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
related to your lifestyle in whole and
for<00:01:26.790> example<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.600> would<00:01:27.780> alarm<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
for example when you would alarm in you

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.920 
for example when you would alarm in you
usually<00:01:28.950> put<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> certain<00:01:29.700> time<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.450> but

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
usually put in a certain time right but

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210 
usually put in a certain time right but
the<00:01:31.049> traffic<00:01:31.229> conditions<00:01:31.860> might<00:01:32.009> be

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the traffic conditions might be

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
the traffic conditions might be
different<00:01:32.670> sometimes<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.570> takes<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.960> an<00:01:34.110> hour

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
different sometimes it takes you an hour

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.230 
different sometimes it takes you an hour
sometimes<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.159> might<00:01:35.400> take<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.759> hour<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
sometimes it might take you hour and a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.980 
sometimes it might take you hour and a
half<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.439> work<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.000> leverage

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
half to get to work so we can leverage

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950 
half to get to work so we can leverage
the<00:01:40.909> navigation<00:01:41.909> systems<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.720> any

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.050 
have in a week or design for the vehicle
and<00:01:48.170> create<00:01:49.170> adjustable<00:01:50.070> alarm<00:01:50.340> clock<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> for

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and create adjustable alarm clock so for

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
and create adjustable alarm clock so for

example it can wake you up based on

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
example it can wake you up based on
traffic<00:01:53.220> conditions<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:54.090> projected<00:01:54.689> traffic
