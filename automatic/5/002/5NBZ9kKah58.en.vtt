00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
them pretty much every other day and so

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.970 
them pretty much every other day and so
if<00:00:34.410> she<00:00:34.559> saw<00:00:35.059> my<00:00:36.059> job<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:37.170> curling<00:00:37.559> hair<00:00:37.710> she'd

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
probably be very disappointed because

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.350 
probably be very disappointed because
her<00:00:40.140> jar<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.739> structured<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.790> might<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
her jar so structured but might get the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819 
her jar so structured but might get the
job<00:00:42.540> done<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:42.989> might<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.290> look<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> best

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
job done they might not look the best

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.889 
job done they might not look the best
because<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.520> much<00:00:44.760> hair<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.450> roll<00:00:45.629> as

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
did here just like so so we could get

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.130 
did here just like so so we could get
the<00:02:49.580> back<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:50.180> win<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:50.660> gonna<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:51.020> the

the back to win then I'm gonna do the
sides<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:52.010> its<00:02:52.730> really<00:02:52.970> simple<00:02:53.209> you're<00:02:53.540> just

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
sides and its really simple you're just

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.880 
sides and its really simple you're just
gonna<00:02:53.840> roll<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.530> clip<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.320> I'm

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
gonna roll and clip just like that I'm

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.590 
gonna roll and clip just like that I'm
going<00:02:58.160> backwards<00:02:58.550> now<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.940> then<00:02:59.090> I'm<00:02:59.209> now<00:02:59.390> i'm

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
going backwards now and then I'm now i'm

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.300 
going backwards now and then I'm now i'm
using<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.020> really<00:03:00.470> really<00:03:00.739> really<00:03:01.040> small

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
hair a lot of volume two so i'm just

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.460

taking<00:03:35.150> them<00:03:35.239> down<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.630> as<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.049> see<00:03:36.080> like

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
taking them down and as you can see like

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.830 
taking them down and as you can see like
as<00:03:36.830> i<00:03:37.070> get<00:03:37.220> smaller<00:03:37.549> with<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.910> group<00:03:38.209> with<00:03:38.660> the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
as i get smaller with the group with the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.949 
as i get smaller with the group with the
rollers<00:03:39.549> they<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:40.790> kind<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.150> get<00:03:41.360> more<00:03:41.840> and

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
rollers they just kind of get more and

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.170 
rollers they just kind of get more and
more<00:03:42.019> curly<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:43.489> if<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:43.700> want<00:03:43.880> even<00:03:44.000> more

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
more curly so if you want even more

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.000 
more curly so if you want even more
curly<00:03:44.720> hair<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.019> would<00:03:45.170> suggest<00:03:45.320> using<00:03:45.739> the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
curly hair I would suggest using the

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.310 
curly hair I would suggest using the
smallest<00:03:46.340> ones<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:47.540> again<00:03:47.780> my<00:03:47.959> hair<00:03:48.170> is

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
smallest ones but again my hair is

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.350 
smallest ones but again my hair is
really<00:03:48.650> long<00:03:48.769> so<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.310> kind<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.579> ways<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:50.090> curls

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
really long so it kind of ways the curls

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360 
really long so it kind of ways the curls
down<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.810> lot<00:03:51.049> if<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.350> have<00:03:51.470> shorter<00:03:51.829> hair<00:03:51.860> this

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
down a lot if you have shorter hair this

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.970 
down a lot if you have shorter hair this
definitely<00:03:52.970> will<00:03:53.209> turn<00:03:53.420> out<00:03:53.540> more

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
definitely will turn out more

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.910 
definitely will turn out more
but<00:03:54.819> isn't<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.180> very<00:03:55.390> natural<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:56.200> curly<00:03:56.769> look

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
but isn't a very natural just curly look

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.170 
but isn't a very natural just curly look
and<00:03:57.159> let<00:03:57.310> me<00:03:57.400> know<00:03:57.430> what<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.760> guys<00:03:57.879> think
