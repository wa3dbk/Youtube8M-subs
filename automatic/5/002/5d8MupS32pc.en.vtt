00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 ah 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.639
 I think what makes you beautiful is your 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.559
 personality 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.690
 it's that authentic that you're yourself 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.560
 then this also defines you and you 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.930
 makes you look pretty but beautiful is a weapon of 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.640
 double edged not many people are going to 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.289
 wanting that's why you're going to open up a lot 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.390
 doors and also many people by 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.980
 that you will hear the disadvantage more 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.260
 great to be beautiful 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 that people judge you before they meet you 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.489
 Sometimes you see very pretty girls 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.710
 but without security and they lose the joke 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.320
 no and you see one that maybe is not so 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.270
 pretty but it's so sure that everything 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.220
 the world the turn sees and personality and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.230
 everything is the most important thing among 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.580
 look for beauty, you find it and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.830
 it is not treated as a stereotype this 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.660
 of physical characteristics but of your 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.140
 ability to see it and then when 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.870
 you feel beautiful other people what 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 appreciate and I think that people put you as 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.489
 attention if you do not have a person 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.990
 defined you can be very pretty very 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.899
 beautiful but if you do not have it 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.970
 you do not transmit it then a council of 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.340
 beauty craving for exercise 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.790
 and eat healthy you can eat everything 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.200
 little you do not have to deprive yourself of anything 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.630
 but obviously obviously everything with measure and 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.280
 get plenty of exercise is the main thing 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.810
 make up well at night is what 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.730
 better than you can do because if all 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.920
 with makeup I swear it is to finish 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.260
 with the face undone then that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.770
 always like a super tip that I always 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.000
 I have used and that has always served me 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 it's always going to be sexier 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.530
 dead cheerful natural laugh that the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.170
 act I'm going through with the face of turkeys 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.610
 cereal then that's better with eyebrow 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.280
 beautiful that wisdom that that ability 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.710
 to light things up to make them 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.070
 beautiful to be creative the hair is very 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.220
 important in one in a woman because it is 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.860
 as what catches the most attention in a 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.410
 attire where you have if you have 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.869
 care your hair can raise you a lot 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.850
 sew the face or the attire what you bring 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.740
 I think that sleeping is the best tips of 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.170
 beauty, if one day you do not sleep well 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.959

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.840
 as creams 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.410
 always try to take care and already products 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.000
 organic for the hair are great 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.330
 always sit up straight and smile 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.849

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.730
 super actress is a lady who does not have

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.230
