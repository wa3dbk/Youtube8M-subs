00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.679

 container and that we are going to add 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.439
 half a liter of milk 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:38.330
 the fact is that I tell them not to 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.460
 I wanted to give the recipe that is changing 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.190

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.860

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.550
 Butter 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.050

 but from what is flavor to butter 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.090

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.370

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.860

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.840
 mantecado that is the name very well since 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 that we then incorporate the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.270
 ingredients 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.670
 strain not 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.569
 as is 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.989
 there it goes 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.139

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.920
 Astonished that he remained as he carries his cinnamon and 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:10.889
 all that seems like nothing else with 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.329
 wanting to give him a little drink there but we 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.629
 let's wait for the list to be ready 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.329
 snow and explain where we are 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.760
 emptying in the container where it goes to 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.959
 be a delegate that it has to be the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:29.389
 vessel is some way to zero 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.889
 stainless and good claveros 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:36.629
 Contrasting vessels called tina 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:38.930

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.910
 vanilla and vanilla 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.060
 with the promoter 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.430
 of this little bit because it's very strong and 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.730
 notice that when I was a child it happened 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.730
 with liquor or herron rum 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.250

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.770
 if you do not want to try 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.890
 and if we do not add another little bit because 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.140
 a little bit sweeter 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.650
