00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
it a bit more difficult I mean for the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.710 
it a bit more difficult I mean for the
most<00:02:04.190> part<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.549> track<00:02:04.759> was<00:02:04.880> quite<00:02:05.119> grappling

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
most part the track was quite grappling

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.270 
most part the track was quite grappling
gritty<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.409> it's<00:02:06.560> all<00:02:06.649> right<00:02:06.830> but<00:02:07.039> then<00:02:07.130> that's

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
gritty so it's all right but then that's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
gritty so it's all right but then that's
what<00:02:07.460> made<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.670> hard<00:02:07.970> because<00:02:08.090> you've

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
what made it hard because you've

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.910 
what made it hard because you've
switched<00:02:08.630> from<00:02:08.810> like<00:02:09.020> somewhere<00:02:09.739> that's

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
switched from like somewhere that's

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.410 
switched from like somewhere that's
gravely<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.489> quite<00:02:10.729> Griffey<00:02:11.120> for<00:02:11.300> just

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
gravely and quite Griffey for just

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.150 
gravely and quite Griffey for just
someone<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.750> was<00:02:11.930> really<00:02:12.440> slipping<00:02:12.980> with

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
someone that was really slipping with

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:24.760 
someone that was really slipping with
soy<00:02:13.459> leader<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.600> what<00:02:14.780> was<00:02:14.989> trippy
