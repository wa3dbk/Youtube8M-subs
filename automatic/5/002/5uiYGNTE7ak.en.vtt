00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 a technical person also seeks then 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.519
 let's talk show I want gameplay 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.870
 new on crash star is what goes 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.460
 point out that I'm going to show the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.650
 settings we're running 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.640
 tie breaks resolution 4k fx a very high and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.920
 on here 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.420
 very high, it's all good to remember the following 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.740
 Dude, I put that Andre Breton 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.390
 EMSA to put times 700 times in the case 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.279
 eight because man is a sincere 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.880
 Different fall gives a bit of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.790
 front swing but I do not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.890
 I can put old difference in self 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.440
 I could not look to see a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.600
 It would be better not to be good to take 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.309
 fills in to see any difference from a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.739
 to the other, then I just want to show 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.660
 allows one is not in the area and this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.350
 Usually benchmarking dodo almost 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.449
 three because that machine zero and there not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.609
 it was not to our bosom and we have to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.489
 do that half aerobic part again 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.250
 hour and already friday is already in the north 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.280
 although it is past the time of the night there 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.320
 games here already few want 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.930
 required to make 20 marks of this 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 machine that will have to do the test 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.110
 so I really just want to show 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.630
 for you quickly to a matter of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.549
 a little performance is out there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.680
 rain that was better to do but I'm going 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.200
 show a little personal goes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.590
 improve booking the beginning 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.329
 so leave grandpa playing here because 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 It happens the next time we go. 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.460
 do some complete benchmarks is 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.380
 today is friday i do not know that this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.600
 video but today is friday 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 this weekend one of the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.000
 store employees is our machine 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.680
 although I will not tell you who I am, I will not go 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.600
 speak nothing suffered 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.689
 But then man I'm taking the machine 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.520
 Back home and I'll do several tests. 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.170
 with her there are several tests even then 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:08.390
 How is it the will? 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:08.390
 that there was a punch in the mouth 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.269
 to escape from there 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.830
 the guys are open so telco 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.290
 gabriel who will remember the following face 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.330
 already in 4 horses are four times 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.520
 more definition than full hd 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.220
 the game becomes extremely heavy but the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.990
 strike is using too much video memory 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.590
 I do not always want memory usage 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.450
 video represents reality is expensive and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.080
 Sometimes roses sometimes do not suit 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.400
 causing more memory and is having little 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.290
 performance resulted in a 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 cybersource understand what to say that already 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.830
 oscillated a lot and has games that use a lot 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.260
 little my god the guys called on the subway 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.690
 a truck metric called the maximum 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.050
 armor practice napoli dropped 51 so far 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.220
 minimum will be a boot is essential 8 x caio 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:11.970
 of 30 the aid said that in ms to fall of 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:15.150
 30 Frames vaio x ai ai ai 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.570
 bogota 4 old face will carry cases 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.200
 disclose dozens of m3 in 4k that 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.670
 channel 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.640
 so you can stay very easy 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.610
 As for that, it's already missing 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.040
 commands actually until today Jorge was doing 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.600
 time that it was not at all claudinéia that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.680
 treated me like a helicopter had 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.010
 nobody 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.890
 This is what I do in the most 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.890
 steltz then neither I nor I see the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.180
 helicopters standing there for 46 to 46 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:49.100
 front 8 x avaí is for sure the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.100
 face with formalin 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.360
 the barrel see the barrel - fall than the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.160
 locations 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.610
 It's worth remembering that I want four 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.340
 cars at all is well used for 4 km 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.900
 and then it just comes in and out 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.900
 max kley for this 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:21.480
 the ball then since the fight since in 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.210
 April were fine tuning is to see I want I can 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.240
 tell you the following every four fall 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.160
 is crazy is crazy really nice guy 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.380
 in this case the country is being a game 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.660
 It's using very little memory, I'm going. 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.760
 other tests in that area that the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.960
 finally makes 20 brands and then 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.370
 You can rest easy about that. 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.680
 what do we want to spend here for you? 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.100
 well it 's a first impression so 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.990
 say of our machine there and nothing in the 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.150
 days in the same week that 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.490
 this coming week 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
 this week you could not even be 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.680
 being followed 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.210
 but if you have already seen it on the channel 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.310
 or appearing in the next days 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.100
 comparisons of the difference of one with 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.340
 two two shelves and so on 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.470
 then face to you so the channel to 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.840
 see all your key differences that 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.790
 it 's worth what's not worth it so it's 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.800
 well it is recommended that you sign the 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.930
 channel to see various comparisons of 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.960
 a plate for two from two to three and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.400
 from three to four and so on 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.290
 no more than January 4 to 6 nef no 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.140
 I will speak well but calls home took 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.750
 a scare but this is where I wanted 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.970
 just give a peek to get people off 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.919
 You need to go home now. 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.300
 I 'm sorry, this video was made a 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.190
 little in the race I hope it gave to 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.790
 have a sense of performance but also 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.169
 we will do tests at the locations of 20 more 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.640
 standard on staff 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.410
 thank you for you want to watch one 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.410
 A kiss on your heart was worth it.
