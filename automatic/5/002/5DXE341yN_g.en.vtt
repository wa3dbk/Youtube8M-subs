00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.450
 oh everyone welcome to us 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.010
 2015 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.890
 and today i'm going to be your knowledge and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.619
 He blundered at my petroleum fire 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.940
 also the from an experiment from and in the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.940
 blood drop going to trabants 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 this is the petroleum fire in question 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 eldik does not heal and goes with it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.949
 assemble was that the flame did not hear but 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 So a part of it burns some 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.629
 i did i was marketeer nice and economical 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.970
 warm this night one sees with 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.920
 video this on a camera can see one 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.900
 huge smoke development yes you can 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.390
 actually see it 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.280
 but as a result after a few hours 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.170
 against chain I still make the decision 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.030
 to come and look at love and the whole 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.080
 Cells inside was the black 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.979
 so now i go for the manual 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.810
 I turn it just above the ice 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.880
 where the week is located 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.110
 and I will have fewer problems and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 they keep still retaining all the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.660
 heat 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.940
 glove push the school friends on 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.400
 places if you do so is the rent 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.720
 is very limited and of course higher and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.640
 set higher than it is more soot 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 you also spend much more time developing 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.220
 the port 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.240
 so for the time being here on it and opportunity and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.250
 I hope it will be a good hope 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.440
 while i'm filling jars at the bottom and too 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 transplanters got in here already exclusively 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.290
 glad my wife and the idea to go on 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.940
 has walked 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.220
 while on the black sea 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.370
 inside all rinse me off a lot 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.370
 pleasure 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.410
 to me in the world you and where him in 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.940
 instead of spraying the garden 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.940
 sprayed inside of the cells 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.880
 a few days ago we had one 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.740
 purchased a trillium heater in the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.960
 temperature in the scene which increase 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.440
 but due to incorrect use we had 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.830
 ankle 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 and huge amounts of smoke in the conservatory and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.520
 together the windows get stuck with as 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.960
 followed a black side where we do not and 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.030
 could watch 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.150
 Tom is now busy cleaning everything up 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.150
 to make 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.770
 and as you may want to work 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.180
 and I do everything in handy through the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.300
 traffic accident 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.459
 about 16 years ago I can do my left one 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.800
 arm not use then I go sometimes you have 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.940
 A goal is to make it appear with it 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.660
 to make 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.640
 I actually make creatures in the bag 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.370
 once at the bottom 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.610
 climbing team of just finally got it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.290
 shelf baby handle 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.410
 so affectionate holder except me 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.790
 it just i don't do these jars 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.550
 completely full 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:22.620
 I would put that little plant on it and then I fill it 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:25.370
 all with fresh earth for deserts and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.370
 color is what to 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.160
 and I make sure that this is not the plants 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.010
 second other move so there I have 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.830
 not yet what one is through each 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.890
 a magnet to be smarter than still in it 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:46.420
 to take and so click your maintenance 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.000
 board and take and I 'm quiet 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.230
 drive you see the roots very much 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.230
 want to go down 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.480
 think you do in wedges 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.720
 but a very long one but think it will 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.070
 scruples in such that or half crown 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.650
 and 2 cut 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.420
 stand roots and I can go very deeply 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.890
 have an online week racing memories 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.040
 so for next year 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.290
 but meanwhile I belong 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.000
 already did and rolled plastic tray 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.340
 but pillars 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.890
 once that I am not constantly with the bag 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.590
 has to moan and in large bushes 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.690
 and calves 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.110
 my wife is happy here let you move 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.020
 look and this year I want them with this 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.510
 babies and congo tell that i am the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.560
 kegs are tastier and also much 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:49.900
 Healthier 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:52.480
 complex and like so and the day is out 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.150
 why this year the first offer top 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.280
 from a key and I like learning or 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.980
 follow where you go through the year 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.460
 see how they grow up the only thing 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.100
 what I have to do is apply a label 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.320
 and then i 'm ready for today 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.280
 In the meantime it has become evening here 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.570
 in waregem 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.810
 and I'm going to put a lock on it 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.610
 my fire is burning nicely for 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.070
 the night 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.770
 luckily I read the instructions 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.420
 You can tell by certain beans that they are 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.830
 actually tentacles on clamped arms 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.249
 making clamps 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.049
 along the 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.049
 acts that I will tense 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.079
 hopefully they here us a tasty one 

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:41.589
 meal 

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:41.589
 until the next
