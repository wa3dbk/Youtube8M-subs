00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.219 
regardless of what blue exercises you're
doing<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:19.119> tend<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.450> hit<00:01:19.630> your<00:01:19.750> quads<00:01:20.050> your

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
doing you tend to hit your quads your

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.559 
doing you tend to hit your quads your
hamstrings<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.610> really<00:01:22.270> don't<00:01:22.390> need<00:01:22.509> any

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
hamstrings and I really don't need any

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.630 
hamstrings and I really don't need any
more<00:01:22.840> muscle<00:01:23.170> there<00:01:23.319> so<00:01:23.649> I<00:01:23.920> have<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.250> be<00:01:24.399> very

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
more muscle there so I have to be very

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.669 
more muscle there so I have to be very
careful<00:01:25.149> not<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.360> train<00:01:25.720> too<00:01:25.959> heavy<00:01:26.200> with

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
careful not to train too heavy with

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.469 
careful not to train too heavy with
boots<00:01:26.979> but<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.550> also<00:01:27.700> don't<00:01:27.850> want<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.119> Train<00:01:28.300> too

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
boots but I also don't want to Train too

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.820 
boots but I also don't want to Train too
light<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:28.750> want<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.110> make<00:01:29.259> sure<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.619> tone

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
light I want to make sure to tone

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.320 
light I want to make sure to tone
everything<00:01:30.459> and<00:01:30.819> keep<00:01:31.630> them<00:01:31.869> growing<00:01:32.110> so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.550 

I<00:01:38.370> trained<00:01:39.370> pretty<00:01:39.640> fast<00:01:40.180> for<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.170> couple<00:01:41.500> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
I trained pretty fast for a couple of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.380 
I trained pretty fast for a couple of
reasons<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.760> keep<00:01:42.850> my<00:01:43.000> heart<00:01:43.180> rate<00:01:43.240> up

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
reasons I like to keep my heart rate up

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.780 
reasons I like to keep my heart rate up
I<00:01:43.750> like<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.350> sweat<00:01:44.770> if<00:01:45.010> I<00:01:45.100> don't<00:01:45.280> sweat<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.520> feel

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
I like to sweat if I don't sweat I feel

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.140 
I like to sweat if I don't sweat I feel
as<00:01:45.910> if<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.210> didn't<00:01:46.450> work<00:01:46.630> out<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.190> also<00:01:48.190> what

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
as if I didn't work out and also what

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.810 
as if I didn't work out and also what
I've<00:01:49.300> found<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:50.110> training<00:01:51.010> faster<00:01:51.520> just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
I've found is training faster just

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.180 
I've found is training faster just
shapes<00:01:52.570> your<00:01:52.720> muscles<00:01:53.080> prettier<00:01:53.410> I<00:01:53.590> do<00:01:53.680> bikini

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
shapes your muscles prettier I do bikini

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.130 
shapes your muscles prettier I do bikini
I<00:01:54.280> compete<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.670> bikini<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:55.390> our<00:01:55.810> muscles

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
I compete in bikini and so our muscles

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.260 
I compete in bikini and so our muscles
have<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.350> be<00:01:56.440> long<00:01:56.740> lean<00:01:57.310> pretty<00:01:57.580> muscle<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.120> I

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
have to be long lean pretty muscle and I

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.180 
have to be long lean pretty muscle and I
feel<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.690> training<00:01:59.080> fast<00:01:59.410> helps<00:01:59.950> with<00:02:00.070> that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
feel that training fast helps with that

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.910 
feel that training fast helps with that
I<00:02:02.190> run<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.220> lot<00:02:03.580> um<00:02:03.940> just<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.630> keep<00:02:04.810> my<00:02:04.990> legs<00:02:05.230> down

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
I run a lot um just to keep my legs down

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.620 
I run a lot um just to keep my legs down
so<00:02:07.020> cardio-wise<00:02:08.020> um<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.820> do<00:02:10.060> once<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.540> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
so cardio-wise um I like to do once in a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.290 
so cardio-wise um I like to do once in a
while<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.350> do<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.710> stepper<00:02:12.300> making

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
while I like to do the stepper making

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.000 
while I like to do the stepper making
sure<00:02:13.450> I'm<00:02:13.570> pushing<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:14.020> my<00:02:14.200> heels<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.950> I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
sure I'm pushing with my heels so I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.670 
sure I'm pushing with my heels so I
don't<00:02:15.400> hit<00:02:15.580> my<00:02:15.610> quads<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.380> that's<00:02:17.380> another

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
don't hit my quads and that's another

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.160 
don't hit my quads and that's another
reason<00:02:17.890> why<00:02:18.190> when<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.490> train<00:02:19.060> blues<00:02:19.480> after

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
reason why when I train blues after

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.890 
reason why when I train blues after
really<00:02:20.470> focus<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.340> hitting<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.360> muscle

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
really focus on hitting that muscle

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.380 
really focus on hitting that muscle
because<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:24.580> move<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.910> very<00:02:25.090> easily

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
because I can move it very easily

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.080 
because I can move it very easily
because<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.110> run<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:26.530> much

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:44.150 

I<00:02:41.420> like<00:02:42.420> doing<00:02:42.900> hyperextensions<00:02:43.890> that's<00:02:44.069> the

hamstrings<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.220> little<00:02:47.280> bit<00:02:47.580> you'll<00:02:48.120> feel<00:02:48.390> it

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
hamstrings a little bit you'll feel it

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.449
