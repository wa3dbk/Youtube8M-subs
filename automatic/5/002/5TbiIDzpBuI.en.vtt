00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
like i said before i'm in the middle of

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:07.310 
like i said before i'm in the middle of
a<00:03:58.080> move<00:03:59.209> so<00:04:05.060> yeah<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.180> it's<00:04:06.690> kind<00:04:07.260> of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
obviously you can see that like when you

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.490 
obviously you can see that like when you
take<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.240> head<00:04:12.390> off<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.780> ball<00:04:12.959> comes<00:04:13.290> with

take the head off the ball comes with

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.080 
take the head off the ball comes with
the<00:04:13.650> head<00:04:14.150> rather<00:04:15.150> than<00:04:16.700> rather<00:04:17.700> than<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
the head rather than rather than the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.140 
the head rather than rather than the
other<00:04:18.239> way<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:20.130> know<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.370> doesn't

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
other way you know it doesn't

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.430 
other way you know it doesn't
stay<00:04:23.150> on<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:23.600> there's<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.780> hole<00:04:23.990> in<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.290> head

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
stay on and there's a hole in the head

stay on and there's a hole in the head
like<00:04:24.650> legends<00:04:25.419> this<00:04:26.419> one<00:04:26.720> is<00:04:29.800> more<00:04:30.800> the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
like legends this one is more the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.480 
like legends this one is more the
opposite<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.740> if<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.889> get<00:04:34.010> his<00:04:34.130> ear<00:04:34.460> and

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
opposite and if you get his ear and

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.350 
opposite and if you get his ear and
there<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:35.180> kind<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:36.280> his<00:04:37.280> head<00:04:37.550> sits<00:04:37.940> kind<00:04:38.240> of

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
crooked in it you can see there's a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.470 
crooked in it you can see there's a
whole<00:04:43.100> back<00:04:43.340> here<00:04:43.669> for<00:04:43.880> whereas<00:04:44.180> here<00:04:44.330> would

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
whole back here for whereas here would

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.110 
whole back here for whereas here would
go<00:04:44.660> or<00:04:45.010> I'm<00:04:46.010> sure<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.340> could<00:04:46.460> push<00:04:46.700> it<00:04:46.850> up<00:04:46.970> in

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
go or I'm sure you could push it up in

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.580 
go or I'm sure you could push it up in
this<00:04:47.270> bump<00:04:49.570> maybe<00:04:50.570> I'll<00:04:50.750> do<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.410> then

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
this bump maybe I'll do that and then

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.070 
this bump maybe I'll do that and then
you<00:04:51.740> can<00:04:51.919> see<00:04:52.300> his<00:04:53.300> face<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.720> lot<00:04:54.080> better<00:04:56.080> pull

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
you can see his face a lot better pull

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.340 
you can see his face a lot better pull
that<00:04:57.590> down<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:59.060> then<00:04:59.120> maybe<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.720> can<00:04:59.840> see<00:05:00.200> his
