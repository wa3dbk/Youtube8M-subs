quid<00:00:18.359> delivery<00:00:18.900> took<00:00:19.109> about<00:00:19.289> 10<00:00:19.560> days<00:00:19.710> which

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
quid delivery took about 10 days which

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.400 
quid delivery took about 10 days which
is<00:00:20.160> quite<00:00:20.369> good<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> classified

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
is quite good because in the classified

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.140 
is quite good because in the classified
ad<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.769> said<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.100> take<00:00:23.279> about<00:00:23.369> 3<00:00:24.000> weeks

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
ad it said it can take about 3 weeks

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.910 
ad it said it can take about 3 weeks
because<00:00:24.720> apparently<00:00:25.170> they<00:00:25.350> come<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:25.650> China

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
because apparently they come from China

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.890 
because apparently they come from China
anyway<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> reason<00:00:27.330> why<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> bought<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.779> is

so first comparison I'll show you my

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.250 
so first comparison I'll show you my
original<00:01:00.660> pegs<00:01:01.520> which<00:01:02.520> would<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:03.260> into

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
original pegs which would be going into

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
original pegs which would be going into
the<00:01:04.350> hole<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> okay<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.000> obviously<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the hole like that okay so obviously you

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.850 
the hole like that okay so obviously you
can<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.570> there's<00:01:07.080> rubber<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.770> they're

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
can see there's rubber on it and they're

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.789 
can see there's rubber on it and they're
quite<00:01:08.070> bigger<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> obviously<00:01:10.560> they're

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
quite bigger and obviously they're

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.850 
quite bigger and obviously they're
heavier<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.460> three<00:01:11.610> times<00:01:11.790> heavier<00:01:12.860> but

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
heavier like three times heavier but

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130 
heavier like three times heavier but
those<00:01:14.189> new<00:01:14.430> ones<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> four

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
those new ones will be going up to four

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.690 
those new ones will be going up to four
centimeters<00:01:16.470> down<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.689> also<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> original

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
centimeters down and also the original

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
centimeters down and also the original
foot<00:01:21.060> back<00:01:21.240> stays<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.869> position<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
foot back stays in the same position and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.530 
foot back stays in the same position and
only<00:01:22.530> moves<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> lot

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
only moves like this so that's not a lot

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.960 
only moves like this so that's not a lot
of<00:01:24.570> movement<00:01:24.840> whereas<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.950> Shinobi<00:01:26.369> ones<00:01:26.549> go

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
of movement whereas the Shinobi ones go

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.660 
of movement whereas the Shinobi ones go
up<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.860> actually<00:01:29.040> move<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
up to here so you can actually move it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
up to here so you can actually move it
during<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> ride<00:01:30.299> giving<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.200> feet<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.799> bit

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
during the ride giving your feet a bit

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
during the ride giving your feet a bit
of<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> rest<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> can

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
of a rest as well like you know you can

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.880 
of a rest as well like you know you can
change<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> position<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.380> retreat<00:01:34.619> from<00:01:34.799> that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
change the position of retreat from that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.929 
change the position of retreat from that
to<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.840> which<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.500> quite<00:01:37.680> cool<00:01:37.939> they're

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
to that which is also quite cool they're

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.760 
to that which is also quite cool they're
very<00:01:39.060> small<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.540> light<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.590> weight

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
very small very light so it's a weight

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.380 
very small very light so it's a weight
saving<00:01:40.950> thing<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> sports<00:01:42.030> bike<00:01:42.150> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
saving thing so for a sports bike it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
saving thing so for a sports bike it's
great<00:01:42.540> isn't<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.829> doesn't<00:01:44.009> really

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
great isn't it I know it doesn't really

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
great isn't it I know it doesn't really
matter<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.970> only<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.299> issue<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
matter because it's only an issue of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.160 
matter because it's only an issue of
grams<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.860> lighter

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
grams but you know it's lighter

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.410 
grams but you know it's lighter
it<00:01:48.710> is<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:48.830> very<00:01:49.009> good<00:01:49.130> quality<00:01:49.280> product<00:01:49.820> finish

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it is a very good quality product finish

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.679 
it is a very good quality product finish
is<00:01:50.509> great<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.290> can<00:01:51.710> have<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:52.180> choice<00:01:53.180> of<00:01:53.299> colors

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
is great you can have a choice of colors

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.179 
is great you can have a choice of colors
I<00:01:53.930> went<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.259> black<00:01:54.439> because<00:01:54.710> my<00:01:54.830> bike<00:01:55.040> is

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
I went for black because my bike is

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.120 
I went for black because my bike is
black<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.840> mounting<00:01:57.380> there<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.040> an

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
black the mounting there is an

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.170 
black the mounting there is an
instruction<00:01:58.310> for<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:58.850> but<00:01:59.000> they<00:01:59.090> don't

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
instruction for it but they don't

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.999 
instruction for it but they don't
actually<00:01:59.390> even<00:01:59.630> need<00:01:59.960> it<00:01:59.990> because<00:02:00.320> I've<00:02:00.890> done

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
actually even need it because I've done

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.710 
actually even need it because I've done
it<00:02:01.159> like<00:02:01.310> instinctively<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.119> just<00:02:02.390> looked<00:02:02.600> at

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
it like instinctively I just looked at

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.570 
it like instinctively I just looked at
the<00:02:02.810> parts<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.290> know<00:02:03.439> join<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.340> all<00:02:04.460> together

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
the parts you know join it all together

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.359 
the parts you know join it all together
and<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.149> took<00:02:05.240> me<00:02:05.360> maybe<00:02:05.479> 15<00:02:05.930> minutes<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.369> to

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
and it took me maybe 15 minutes to to

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.080 
and it took me maybe 15 minutes to to
put<00:02:07.940> on<00:02:08.410> both<00:02:09.410> foot<00:02:09.649> pegs<00:02:09.860> on<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.819> can<00:02:10.940> have

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
put on both foot pegs on you can have

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.270 
put on both foot pegs on you can have
those<00:02:11.300> for<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.170> passenger<00:02:12.560> as<00:02:12.620> well<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.770> didn't

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
those for the passenger as well I didn't

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.589 
those for the passenger as well I didn't
do<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> because<00:02:14.350> my<00:02:15.350> missus<00:02:16.010> doesn't<00:02:16.340> actually

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
do it because my missus doesn't actually

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.839 
do it because my missus doesn't actually
go<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:18.200> often<00:02:18.349> on<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> bike<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.069> me<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.459> no

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
go that often on a bike with me so no

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.030 
go that often on a bike with me so no
point<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:20.930> myself<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.500> my<00:02:21.560> comfort<00:02:21.920> I've

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
point but for myself and my comfort I've

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.090 
point but for myself and my comfort I've
done<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.819> yes<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.989> 15<00:02:24.680> minutes<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.920> put<00:02:25.010> it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
done it and yes so 15 minutes to put it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.289 
done it and yes so 15 minutes to put it
on<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.900> what's<00:02:27.620> really<00:02:27.769> cool<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:29.000> obviously

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
on and what's really cool so obviously

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.180 
on and what's really cool so obviously
you<00:02:29.750> lowered<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.500> peg<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:30.830> about<00:02:30.980> 4

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
you lowered the peg for about 4

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.979 
you lowered the peg for about 4
centimeters<00:02:31.730> as<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:31.970> says<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.720> you've<00:02:32.810> got<00:02:32.930> a

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
centimeters as it says and you've got a

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.059 
centimeters as it says and you've got a
choice<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.380> can<00:02:33.440> go<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:33.799> 2<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:33.980> 1/2

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
choice you can go for 2 and 1/2

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.400 
choice you can go for 2 and 1/2
centimeters<00:02:34.480> lowering<00:02:35.480> four<00:02:35.930> centimeters

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
centimeters lowering four centimeters

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.750 
centimeters lowering four centimeters
lowering<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:36.920> even<00:02:37.100> six<00:02:37.340> centimeters

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
lowering and even six centimeters

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.160 
lowering and even six centimeters
lowering<00:02:38.120> which<00:02:38.330> wouldn't<00:02:38.660> work<00:02:38.840> for<00:02:38.870> this

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
lowering which wouldn't work for this

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.350 
lowering which wouldn't work for this
bike<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:39.530> for<00:02:39.739> cruisers<00:02:40.160> apparently<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.180> does

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
bike but for cruisers apparently it does

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.080 
bike but for cruisers apparently it does
so<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.900> went<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.380> even<00:02:42.890> median<00:02:43.250> 4<00:02:43.640> centimeters

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
so I went for even median 4 centimeters

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.240 
so I went for even median 4 centimeters
lower<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.959> actually<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.799> know<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:45.980> can

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
lower and it actually you know you can

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740 
lower and it actually you know you can
feel<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.519> difference<00:02:46.819> straightaway<00:02:47.269> it's

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
feel the difference straightaway it's

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.900 
feel the difference straightaway it's
it's<00:02:48.200> such<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> relief<00:02:48.890> especially<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.700> long

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
it's such a relief especially on long

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.380 
it's such a relief especially on long
journeys

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
journeys

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.039 
journeys
now<00:02:51.019> this<00:02:51.830> little<00:02:52.239> part<00:02:53.239> here<00:02:53.329> can<00:02:53.900> be

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
now this little part here can be

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.310 
now this little part here can be
obviously<00:02:54.470> rotated<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:56.450> part<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:56.840> well<00:02:56.959> can

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
obviously rotated that part as well can

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.360 
obviously rotated that part as well can
be<00:02:57.350> rotated<00:02:57.859> 360<00:02:58.790> degrees<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:01.010> know<00:03:01.160> if

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
be rotated 360 degrees so you know if

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.460 
be rotated 360 degrees so you know if
you<00:03:01.489> want<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.790> get<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.329> bit<00:03:02.810> towards<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
you want to get it a bit towards the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.910 
you want to get it a bit towards the
front

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
front

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.780 
front
no<00:03:04.040> problem<00:03:04.310> told<00:03:04.489> you<00:03:04.579> simply<00:03:04.910> unscrew<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
no problem told you simply unscrew the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.880 
no problem told you simply unscrew the
bolt<00:03:08.299> here<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:08.750> then<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.320> can<00:03:09.470> adjust<00:03:09.769> it

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
bolt here and then you can adjust it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.520 
bolt here and then you can adjust it
very<00:03:10.549> simple<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.560> would<00:03:12.560> say<00:03:12.920> even<00:03:13.760> ingenious

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
very simple I would say even ingenious

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.289 
very simple I would say even ingenious
it's<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:15.739> great<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.609> only<00:03:16.880> one<00:03:17.000> problem

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
it's that great the only one problem

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.180 
it's that great the only one problem
with<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.769> original<00:03:19.220> foot<00:03:19.459> peg<00:03:20.079> as<00:03:21.190> you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
with it is the original foot peg as you

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.650 
with it is the original foot peg as you
can<00:03:22.370> see<00:03:22.609> would<00:03:23.299> be<00:03:23.480> ending

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
can see would be ending

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.610 
can see would be ending
over<00:03:25.230> here<00:03:25.490> whereas<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.700> one<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.660> slightly

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
over here whereas that one and slightly

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.070 
over here whereas that one and slightly
further<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.150> outer<00:03:30.330> side<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.840> bike

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
further to the outer side of the bike

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.030 
further to the outer side of the bike
which<00:03:31.950> means<00:03:32.660> if<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.810> got<00:03:34.020> used<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
which means if you got used to the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.030 
which means if you got used to the
original<00:03:35.460> foot<00:03:35.640> bags<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:37.080> will<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> bit

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
original foot bags you will have a bit

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.970 
original foot bags you will have a bit
of<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.190> problem<00:03:38.370> with<00:03:38.700> using<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.710> foot<00:03:40.710> brake

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
of a problem with using the foot brake

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.220 
of a problem with using the foot brake
and<00:03:41.190> changing<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> gears<00:03:42.330> because<00:03:42.660> if<00:03:42.990> you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
and changing the gears because if you

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.890 
and changing the gears because if you
know<00:03:43.350> both<00:03:43.590> things<00:03:43.890> are<00:03:44.010> actually<00:03:44.160> slightly

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
know both things are actually slightly

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.890 
know both things are actually slightly
towards<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:47.030> sides<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.360> bike<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.750> know

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
towards the sides of the bike you know

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.290 
towards the sides of the bike you know
the<00:03:48.990> outer<00:03:49.140> side<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.590> bike<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:51.120> was

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
the outer side of the bike it was

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.060 
the outer side of the bike it was
initiated<00:03:51.630> beginning<00:03:52.140> for<00:03:52.320> me<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.710> within

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
initiated beginning for me but within

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.830 
initiated beginning for me but within
maybe<00:03:53.520> two<00:03:53.760> or<00:03:53.850> three<00:03:54.030> days<00:03:54.210> my<00:03:54.420> goodness<00:03:54.720> do

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
maybe two or three days my goodness do

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.050 
maybe two or three days my goodness do
it<00:03:54.930> again<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:55.380> now<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:56.220> standard<00:03:56.640> foot<00:03:56.820> packs

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it again so now the standard foot packs

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.450 
it again so now the standard foot packs
I<00:03:57.210> presume<00:03:57.570> would<00:03:57.720> be<00:03:57.840> weird<00:03:58.080> for<00:03:58.200> me<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.280> in

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
I presume would be weird for me so in

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.880 
I presume would be weird for me so in
general<00:03:59.580> yes<00:04:00.390> it's<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.990> good<00:04:01.140> product<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.830> would

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
general yes it's a good product I would

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.440
