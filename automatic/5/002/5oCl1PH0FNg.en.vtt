00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
hollow rock position so here's what

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.430 
hollow rock position so here's what
we're<00:00:45.239> gonna<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.510> we're<00:00:45.899> gonna<00:00:45.960> establish

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
we're gonna do we're gonna establish

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
we're gonna do we're gonna establish
that<00:00:46.590> hollow<00:00:46.829> rock<00:00:47.039> position<00:00:47.489> first<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
that hollow rock position first and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.590 
that hollow rock position first and
foremost<00:00:48.960> what<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.449> the

foremost what we do is we get on the
ground<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.050> need<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> establish<00:00:52.469> that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
ground and you need to establish that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
ground and you need to establish that
