00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello everyone oh well here and in the central 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.450
 Russia finally finally came 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 spring as you can guess from 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.060
 video titles will be dedicated to 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.100
 membrane clothes 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.750
 Today in the review of the route jacket Draft 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.180
 here is a Russian company rafting 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.740
 The first thing to start with is the membrane. 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.689
 in a nutshell for those viewers 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.490
 who does not know what is and how is it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.199
 the membrane is working is such a fabric 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 which does not allow moisture outside 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.489
 get inside but allows 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 moisture that has accumulated inside 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.340
 freely evaporate out into 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.620
 that's what its main lies 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.989
 advantage is precisely why membrane 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.730
 clothes so durable won their place 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 in the market of sports and tourist type 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.450
 Rovkov membranes are now produced 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.860
 quite a large number and each 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.600
 the manufacturer seeks to assure that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.000
 it is his membrane itself 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.550
 waterproof most moisture excreting 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.010
 and the most breathable and if you dig the internet 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.480
 you can stumble upon a huge amount 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 customized laboratory tests 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.350
 invented by advertisers abbreviations and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.810
 other bullshit and in which very little 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.549
 objectivity is the only way something 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.890
 find out really buy it and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.380
 check in this case this three-layer 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.479
 patented event material which 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.420
 was developed and produced in Japan and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 possessing all the same characteristics 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 as competitors it stands out 1 very 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.020
 original and really useful 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 feature this material unlike 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
 other membranes can be washed about what 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.079
 says this here is a hole and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.329
 you can wash without special 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.759
 powders without fear of ruining 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.950
 membrane properties as it would be the case 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.259
 with all known gardex membranes by 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.600
 water resistance of this jacket can be 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.470
 don't worry she is absolutely absolutely 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.880
 absolutely absolutely hydrophobic to me in 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.310
 wet her in no way 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.869
 but I was able to breathe 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.869
 I'll tell you later and more 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.469
 if you have to be with us we should note that 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.479
 the manufacturer borrowed some 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.299
 its design features so 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.859
 say lawmakers and genre but i think 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.850
 then a huge plus because from the point 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.099
 tourism view 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.470
 this jacket is thought out to the smallest detail as you 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.629
 can see all the seams taped on the zipper 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.000
 protected by valves that will save you not 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.890
 only from the rain but from the strong wind on 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.780
 shoulders and other wear 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.580
 ground added a special material 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.410
 which has all the same 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.930
 and that the properties of the membrane but it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.180
 piece of abrasion cuffs on the sleeves 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.010
 has quite a large power reserve and even 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.950
 on my not very voluminous wrist 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.390
 fit pretty tight there girl in 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.340
 buttoned up closes 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.230
 chin added soft and cuddly 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.019
 to touch the material that will save your 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.700
 skin from contact with the clasp and winter does not 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.890
 allow vapor from breathing to condense 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.629
 zip into ice sleeves 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.879
 anatomical arranged so when 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.190
 raising arms and bending lower back 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.840
 the edge of the jacket almost never bully 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.760
 on the lower contour passes 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.560
 shuddering gum so if you 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.250
 will pedal on a bike or 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.440
 sit down 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.819
 for example relax by the fire your back 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.829
 in no way blows 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.709
 there are two armpits 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.420
 vented zippered openings and even 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.280
 function to perform two mesh pockets 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.620
 on the chest in which, moreover, is very 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.730
 convenient because hands and gloves can be dried 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.739
 body diploma 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.389
 As for the size, as far as I am 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.069
 understood the manufacturer of their 3 and they all 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.930
 pretty versatile but since 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.030
 jacket without insulation I advise you 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.609
 take the size of the stock in the winter you can 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.650
 was to wear a warm sweater or sweater 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.019
 by the way in temperature manufacturer 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.849
 declares this jacket like all seasons but i 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.430
 I think she has an upper temperature limit 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.829
 plus 15 because warmer weather in 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.380
 it doesnâ€™t make any sense in the winter if 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.750
 give good thermal underwear and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.880
 for example a Polartek sweater, you can 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.769
 feel comfortable and in minus 16 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.419
 well now if you haven't fallen asleep yet 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.639
 boredom go to the most interesting 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.950
 it is logical to assume that the potential 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.810
 buyers of this jacket imply and 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.680
 using under some kind of physical 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.639
 loads 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.950
 whether it be tourism distant pedestrian crossings 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.199
 cycling and things like that so I 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.910
 I think that the best test is the best 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.519
 checking real properties 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.370
 this jacket will be back distance 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.620
 standard 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.349
 not more than three kilometers as you can 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.629
 see quite warm weather outside 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.090
 almost no wind on me good 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.290
 sports underwear so for cleanliness 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.190
 experiment can not worry 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.019
 understand 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.750
 Many will now think that this idea 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.460
 quite subjective because 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.160
 each person's individual 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.500
 parameters under the gowns and perception 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.870
 temperature comfort but come to the store 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.210
 touch as you open pockets 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.440
 can almost every one of you and myself and here 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.510
 run in this jacket a couple 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.639
 kilometers you hardly anyone will allow 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:53.500
 until you buy and of course 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:55.840
 let's go well then I caught my breath and is ready 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.360
 sum up the membrane copes with 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.270
 his task on a solid top five with all 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.750
 such problem areas as armpits and bottom 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.699
 backs 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.280
 moisture has time to evaporate to the top 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.590
 layer it means that the technology works 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.900
 jackets cope with its task 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.400
 jackets are comfortable and do not hamper movement 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.639
 therefore suitable for all kinds 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.870
 activity and now let's talk about the cons 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.970
 would like to have this jacket 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.940
 unfasten the hood but as far as I know 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.560
 similar item already implemented by others 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.570
 jackets from the same manufacturer 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.210
 I would also like to have more 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.389
 colors and at least one camouflage 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.550
 but I think their absence is due to 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.680
 that on a similar fabric is very difficult 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.500
 apply paint to someone 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.840
 high price and really almost 10,000 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.440
 rubles but if you look at 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.419
 competitors 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.460
 precisely in terms of characteristics and take into account 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.099
 specifics of pricing for 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.330
 foreign brands in russia then jacket from 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.669
 words seem most profitable 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.479
 acquiring your segment plan 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.940
 price quality 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.410
 so if you want to get the whole 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.330
 functional membrane clothes 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.060
 but do not want to overpay for the brand 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.400
 buy will not regret and if this video 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.050
 it was interesting and useful for you to share it 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.300
 with friends subscribe to the channel 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.960
 there are still a lot of videos ahead 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.960
 tourism and sport 

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:19.229
 nothing like everything was recorded normally 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:19.229
 it turned out fine
