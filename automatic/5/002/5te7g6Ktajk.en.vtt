00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.759
 Ohio friends of well-groomed animation 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.069
 entertainment from japan it's me again 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.990
 Your Lord xf and I bring back today 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.269
 an anime review 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.910
 that's number 10 and today 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.109
 go and in anime brand nike i have to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.279
 say it again three to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.170
 four weeks ago that I have the anime 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.720
 I looked sick because I got sick and then 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.570
 I did not have time anymore 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.420
 review to make the review sorry 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 and also what's the matter animated to say it 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.050
 Unfortunately this is an anime only jobs 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.940
 There is no German translation 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.950
 However, I have to say I have it 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 actually also in order and the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.350
 quality so the voice quality the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.149
 in sync with her already knows that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.450
 The voices are also pleasant 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.780
 japanese to the stagles there are stops 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.289
 a season with according to after 25 minutes 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.340
 Great arrangement the second season is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.890
 planned for winter 2014 or fourth 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 quarter of 2014 but some follow it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.130
 are already outside and here 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.330
 now at the beginning of 2014 so there you can 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.890
 also a bit on one 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840
 a bit of input will follow a few more 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 looking forward 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.570
 then we come to the genre assignment 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.060
 and yes, I would do it all this way 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.170
 mainly to school fantasy genre 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 assign 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 but in any case still ekici and 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.030
 sometimes you think you are real 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.310
 that there was still an etui here or that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.409
 partly too much like me 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.810
 i am actually a friend but that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.240
 was too mush that is definitely 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 another action anime and yes anyway 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.030
 little comedy is always 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.950
 and that's good 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.060
 basically except the exaggerated 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.770
 lg and now I'll tell you all about it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.189
 little bit about the story 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.380
 is about the young schÃ¼lertag aero and 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.630
 He is currently changing to a new school 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.549
 and this school used to be a pure one 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.960
 Girls' school and why do you change as 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.610
 boy to a school that used to be one 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.040
 pure girls school was clear if 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.540
 no one on which one but he is 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.520
 also changes because there is an old one 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.330
 childhood girlfriend a girlfriend dating 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.020
 togo is harmony and that is 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.470
 also feed 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.000
 The student discipline kumite it a few 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.910
 Special features of the school are that 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.070
 each school has a so-called mark 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.800
 element of a combat weapon skill 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.240
 That's what fighting can do 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.470
 namely no normal school because there 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.860
 they all have something special 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.400
 skills but tactical brands seems 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.390
 to be indefinite for now 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.970
 Of course, it gives you this 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 brands also conflict but these 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.370
 Conflicts are always regulated 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.870
 battles are solved and these and these become 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.050
 under the supervision of the disciplinary committee 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.210
 held 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.880
 and when it does not fight, it does not set 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.810
 the supervision of the disciplinary committee 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.420
 be held 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.010
 that's the task of this committee 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.060
 to end these struggles as quickly as possible and 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.070
 as soon as possible to ensure that 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.930
 no further no further damage 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.960
 arise and how should it otherwise 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.660
 Of course , takeo comes to the committee 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.480
 but what happened also is that 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.190
 He also opened it up, of course 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.959
 harmony meets he on anyway 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.790
 the school is then he arrives 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.650
 Girl what claims his fiance too 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.300
 his and then he meets a girl that 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.750
 apparently hate him 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.580
 and anything against him and everyone 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.170
 three list virtually in their room 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.000
 a and I have to say poor poor 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.650
 guy sleep and have our attic 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.470
 three because they are always half naked 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.100
 running in the apartment the boy 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.900
 I'm really sorry for my own 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.770
 opinion of the anime he is short that 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.209
 light okay but sometimes you 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.060
 the feeling the animated a bit around 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.650
 the hot mush around and partly goes 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.870
 the story just does not progress and then 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.480
 a last two follow with so much 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.280
 story input reingekriegt better 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.820
 can chew and they have 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.440
 just totally shitty I think the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.490
 characters that were actually good 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.239
 chosen class fits invent but is 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.170
 good on the individual characters 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.700
 received 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.010
 not on everyone but on the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.840
 Most of the sign style was clean and 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.840
 a lot was found i was good well 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.060
 the synchro as I said vocally 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.700
 are the Japanese white ones 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.840
 is no word 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.840
 and now we come now 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.640
 scoring the pen 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.160
 I found that perfect without any doubt 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.890
 ten points a day if I'm not sorry 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.660
 I like the synchro the great 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.040
 Of course, Japanese has nine points 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.210
 Perfect fit almost everywhere 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.860
 the characters were good that was it 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.390
 but times were seven 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.100
 The story's points were good 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.080
 partly also well decorated at the end 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.990
 the story was good but too much 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.060
 squeezed and you have too much on 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.090
 the elements are therefore only five 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.440
 points for the story that does when 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.310
 I'm not totally lost here now 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:08.870
 have 12 22 31 and 31 divided by four 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.060
 775 points are 775 points for you 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.610
 the anime marks key in my opinion too 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.050
 a lot but still a good story story 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.210
 too bruised but otherwise was 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.920
 actually everything ok 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:24.710
 and if you 're on big tracks and a lot 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.060
 underwear and little story is the 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.620
 but then squeezed at the end then 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.420
 look at the anime in any case 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.490
 I'm out for the first time I hope you have 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.710
 it helped the anime video on 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.710
 and see you next time
