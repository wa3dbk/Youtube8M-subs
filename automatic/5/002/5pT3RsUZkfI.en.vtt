00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
was fantastic especially against the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
was fantastic especially against the
deck<00:01:53.819> like<00:01:54.060> his<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.810> he's<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.259> able<00:01:55.529> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
deck like his because he's not able to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429 
deck like his because he's not able to
deal<00:01:56.459> with<00:01:56.639> the<00:01:56.759> lotus<00:01:57.060> cobra<00:01:57.240> he's<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.289> blue

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
green obviously lacks removal and we

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.649 
green obviously lacks removal and we
have<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.840> Sun<00:02:01.079> Titan<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.529> hand<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.240> he<00:02:03.240> copies

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
have that Sun Titan in hand so he copies

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.269 
have that Sun Titan in hand so he copies
the<00:02:03.689> Cobra<00:02:04.109> because<00:02:04.409> he's<00:02:04.619> wanting<00:02:04.979> his<00:02:05.130> own

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:05.279 
the Cobra because he's wanting his own

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:09.109 
the Cobra because he's wanting his own
mana<00:02:05.869> what<00:02:06.869> his<00:02:07.020> deck<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.439> packing<00:02:07.889> is<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
mana what his deck is packing is the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
mana what his deck is packing is the
Sphinx<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.929> consecrated<00:02:10.530> sphinx<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:11.160> well<00:02:11.340> as

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
Sphinx the consecrated sphinx as well as

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.820 
Sphinx the consecrated sphinx as well as
frost<00:02:11.700> titans<00:02:12.180> which<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.140> know<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.590> huge

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
frost titans which you know can be huge

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
frost titans which you know can be huge
blowouts<00:02:14.310> especially<00:02:14.819> against<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.180> deck<00:02:15.390> with

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
blowouts especially against my deck with

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.290 
blowouts especially against my deck with
a<00:02:15.690> lack<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> removal<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.980> only<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.640> evasion

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
a lack of removal I only have evasion

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.430 
a lack of removal I only have evasion
and<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.720> try<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.960> be<00:02:19.140> quicker<00:02:19.410> than<00:02:19.530> other<00:02:19.830> decks

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
and I try to be quicker than other decks

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
and I try to be quicker than other decks
so<00:02:21.190> something<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.820> can<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.300> problem

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
so something like this can be a problem

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.220 
so something like this can be a problem
that<00:02:24.460> was<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> decent<00:02:24.940> turn<00:02:25.300> for<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.600> metamorphs

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
that was a decent turn for a metamorphs

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.820 
that was a decent turn for a metamorphs
great<00:02:26.620> as<00:02:26.860> versatile<00:02:27.430> as<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.760> saw<00:02:27.940> there<00:02:27.970> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
great as versatile as you saw there so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.650 
great as versatile as you saw there so
obviously<00:02:29.830> we<00:02:30.100> have<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> son<00:02:30.940> Titan<00:02:31.270> coming<00:02:31.540> out

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
obviously we have a son Titan coming out

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.060 
obviously we have a son Titan coming out
here<00:02:33.870> fantastic<00:02:34.870> card<00:02:35.110> even<00:02:35.410> better<00:02:35.800> with

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
here fantastic card even better with

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.920 
here fantastic card even better with
fetches<00:02:36.520> because<00:02:36.910> now<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.180> get<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> crack<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
fetches because now we get a crack to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.200 
fetches because now we get a crack to
fetch<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.410> play<00:02:38.650> fauna<00:02:38.950> which<00:02:39.280> sets<00:02:39.940> up<00:02:40.090> our

fetch and play fauna which sets up our

fetch and play fauna which sets up our
next<00:02:40.360> turn<00:02:40.660> if<00:02:40.780> something<00:02:41.020> happens<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.470> our

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
son Titan all we need is a creature and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.850 
son Titan all we need is a creature and
we'll<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.840> ton<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.200> mana<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.680> play

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
we'll have a ton of mana to play

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.320 
we'll have a ton of mana to play
whatever<00:02:48.070> we<00:02:48.250> want<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.420> what<00:02:49.900> happens<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:50.440> is

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
whatever we want so what happens here is

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.650 
whatever we want so what happens here is
he<00:02:52.710> misses<00:02:53.710> his<00:02:53.830> land<00:02:54.130> drop<00:02:54.400> which<00:02:54.660> probably

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
he misses his land drop which probably

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.170 
he misses his land drop which probably
was<00:02:56.350> would<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:56.950> been<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.430> very<00:02:58.090> difficult

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
was would have been a very difficult

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.290 
was would have been a very difficult
time<00:02:58.810> for<00:02:59.110> me<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.350> deal<00:02:59.530> with<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
time for me to deal with because it

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.360 
time for me to deal with because it
probably<00:03:01.510> would<00:03:01.780> have<00:03:01.870> resulted<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.830> sphinx

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
probably would have resulted in a sphinx

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.510 
probably would have resulted in a sphinx
or<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.580> frost<00:03:03.910> titan<00:03:04.360> but<00:03:04.740> even<00:03:05.740> then<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.010> still

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
or a frost titan but even then I still

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.460 
or a frost titan but even then I still
think<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:06.880> had<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> good<00:03:07.240> chance<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:08.020> top<00:03:08.260> deck

think we had a good chance we top deck

avenge VII and pull out the Elish Norn

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.870 
avenge VII and pull out the Elish Norn

it's<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.660> too<00:03:19.870> powerful<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.320> mean<00:03:23.770> that

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
it's just too powerful so I mean that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.530 
it's just too powerful so I mean that
that's<00:03:24.130> pretty<00:03:24.520> much<00:03:24.700> game<00:03:24.940> he's<00:03:25.180> stuck<00:03:25.420> on

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
that's pretty much game he's stuck on

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.720 
that's pretty much game he's stuck on
three<00:03:25.840> men<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.170> two<00:03:26.320> cards<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.100> there's<00:03:27.580> just

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
three men and two cards and there's just

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.460 
three men and two cards and there's just
no<00:03:27.910> way<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.090> deal<00:03:28.360> with<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.660> board<00:03:28.959> position

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
no way to deal with this board position

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.070 
no way to deal with this board position
so<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:31.090> got<00:03:31.810> me<00:03:31.840> into<00:03:32.380> round<00:03:32.650> four<00:03:32.980> and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
so that got me into round four and
