00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.910
 and how is February 14 approaching 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.880
 I thought I'm going to do a tutorial 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.440
 to teach you some very easy ideas and 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.110
 very cheap to make gifts very 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.830
 originals to the people who are going to 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.530
 give something that can be 14 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.360
 February or a birthday or a 'friend 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.980
 invisible 'gets you out of trouble 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.160
 because there are many times that you do not know what 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.879
 give away or you're afraid of not hitting 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 so if you know that person 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.059
 he likes knickknacks or chocolates 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 or things like that sweet this idea will 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.860
 serve I think 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.539
 if you think there are people who need 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.390
 this video because it makes some eyes 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.000
 shit or just because it's going to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.180
 Like sending the video and I'm going to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.180
 to be 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.220
 and we go with the video 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.430
 for the first idea we are going to need 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.460
 scissors 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.990
 zeal 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.990
 aerosol black colored 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 once the silver 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.100
 a glue gun 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.100
 luminous 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.900
 Inside two colors 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.970
 I have chosen gray partridge because I 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.650
 like slytherin but if you like another 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.840
 house of hogwarts you can take the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.460
 colors that represent it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.460
 transparent film paper 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.770
 and an empty jar in this case 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.690
 and logo harry potter I 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.110
 printed but you can trace it from 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.110
 the computer 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.330
 first calculate the length you want 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.680
 Have your scarf and cut out the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.600
 felt 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.630
 the strips of the two colors have to 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.579
 have the same width 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.579
 If you have two pieces left, stick the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.430
 and then cut into squares one of the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.430
 two colors in this case of gray 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.870
 until you have something more or less like this 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.010
 when you have all the squares 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.260
 We are going to paste them on the strip of 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.590
 felt the other color with the glue 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.180
 of the gun 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.370
 hit each and every one of the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.269
 squares until you have the scarf 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.269
 complete 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.490
 is more or less like this 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.070
 When you've done it, cut everything 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.020
 what's left and the spikes that stick out 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.370
 so that you have a much more scarf 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.370
 pretty and without so many failures 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.160
 then trim the fringes of the scarf 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.940
 they have to stay something like this 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.280
 trim after harry potter and 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.760
 They use a lot of zeal to stick it to 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.210
 Jar doubles the heat so you can 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.430
 make very small squares and paste 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.570
 up to the corners and all the details 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.570
 little ones that have the letters 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.370
 The more squares you use the better you are 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.640
 to stay later and less are you going to have to 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.640
 remove 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.849
 stuck villena the jar and fixed everything 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.350
 that you can, the closer the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.140
 jar paper better 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.940
 then use the film to cover 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.030
 the top of the boat and that is not 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.590
 between any spray that is toxic and 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.590
 let's fill the food can 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.020
 paint the whole pot of black 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.340
 until there is no part without 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.530
 cover and lid with silver spray 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.660
 sprinkle silver spray right on the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.109
 logo center very slowly with a lot 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.109
 watch out 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.720
 remove the letters and remove the remains 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.620
 of spray that you do not like with acetone 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.620
 and a stick 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.229
 it's glue on the top 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:40.229
 of the car to be able to hit the 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.229
 scarf 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.650
 the scarf arrives and makes a knot 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.600
 accommodating the way you like it and stay 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.060
 If you think that you have stayed too 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.430
 long as it is my case you can go back to 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.120
 cut it and redo the fringes that 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.120
 it costs nothing 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.250
 secure the part that is left over 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.050
 the scarf so he is not out there 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:09.460
 fluttering and glued with glue 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.740
 then you can throw your jelly beans 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.930
 and you picked these because they looked like dragees 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.580
 and ready you have the boat if you want 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.470
 make some very nice details you can 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.940
 paint the symbol of the relics of 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.250
 death 'on the cover and embroider 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.250
 letters with permanent green marker 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.949
 for the second idea you will need 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:32.669
 silver spray scissors a clean boat 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.669
 and transparent 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.050
 black spray 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.040
 large chopsticks 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.250
 zeal 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.780
 transparent film paper a marker 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.780
 permanent black 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.860
 trinkets 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.860
 and a folio 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.620
 the second idea is much easier and 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.480
 fast 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.730
 start by marking with the marker 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.560
 permanent the features of totoró 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.800
 on top of the jar with eyes nose 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.440
 mustache and gut is worth then to caló 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.050
 on top of the folio and cut it 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.440
 used a lot of zeal to stick it in the 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.440
 jar 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.470
 paint the jar all the holes in the 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.270
 jar with silver spray and do the same 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.200
 with the cap but with the color spray 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.200
 black 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 ah 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.259
 then review the features of totoró with 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.749
 a black marker that's what it is 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:37.139
 is going to see so do it very carefully 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:37.139
 so that it looks nice 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.110
 cut a piece of paper that just covers 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.129
 the eyes of totoró and paste inside 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.909
 very zealously 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:52.830
 and now you can take the jelly beans you draw 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.830
 the triangles of the gut of totoró 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.760
 it puts jelly beans by chopsticks are 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.919
 the order that you want and once you 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.440
 you have put them in the jar we have 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.120
 the perfect gift if you want to add 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.340
 a detail you can add a little 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.610
 black on top to cover the part of 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.610
 above 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.090
 this has been all if you liked this

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.560

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.990
 Y 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.720
 two
