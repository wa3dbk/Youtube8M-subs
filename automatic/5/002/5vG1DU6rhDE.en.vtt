00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
that was the most difficult thing

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.729 
that was the most difficult thing
students<00:03:19.389> tend<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:19.900> kind<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.200> take<00:03:20.440> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
students tend to just kind of take the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.819 
have to find those resources that that
one<00:03:54.910> where<00:03:55.299> one<00:03:55.540> article<00:03:55.930> says<00:03:56.109> oh<00:03:56.260> we<00:03:56.590> found

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
that you know kids can do this and then

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.569 
that you know kids can do this and then
the<00:03:58.989> other<00:03:59.169> one<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.380> like<00:03:59.500> oh<00:03:59.680> kids<00:04:00.040> can't<00:04:00.459> do

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
the other one is like oh kids can't do

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.280 
the other one is like oh kids can't do
that<00:04:00.730> but<00:04:00.940> it's<00:04:01.060> like<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.630> have<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.109> don't

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
that but it's like you have to you don't

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.750 
that but it's like you have to you don't
just<00:04:02.530> look<00:04:02.650> at<00:04:02.769> their<00:04:02.919> arguments<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.489> look<00:04:03.639> at

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
just look at their arguments you look at

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.220 
just look at their arguments you look at
the<00:04:03.880> way<00:04:04.000> they<00:04:04.120> around<00:04:04.329> their<00:04:04.510> test<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:05.049> look

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
the way they around their test you look

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.370 
the way they around their test you look
at<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.829> way<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.130> they<00:04:06.959> discuss<00:04:07.959> their<00:04:08.109> tests

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
at the way that they discuss their tests

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.470 
at the way that they discuss their tests
the<00:04:08.560> ways<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.889> they<00:04:09.069> say<00:04:09.669> what<00:04:09.940> they<00:04:10.060> found

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
the ways that they say what they found

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.720 
the ways that they say what they found
this<00:04:10.810> in<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:11.139> certain<00:04:11.319> way<00:04:11.620> or<00:04:11.650> things<00:04:12.639> like

this in a certain way or things like

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.059 
this in a certain way or things like
they<00:04:12.910> had<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.150> evaluate<00:04:13.389> not<00:04:13.900> just<00:04:14.169> what<00:04:14.919> they

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
they had to evaluate not just what they

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.710 
they had to evaluate not just what they
say<00:04:15.250> they<00:04:15.430> found<00:04:15.639> but<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.269> have<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.510> evaluate

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
say they found but you have to evaluate

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.640 
say they found but you have to evaluate
their<00:04:17.200> methods<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.859> things<00:04:18.340> like<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:19.650> lot

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
their methods and things like that a lot

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.670 
their methods and things like that a lot
more<00:04:20.799> steps<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:22.260> tend<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.289> start<00:04:23.500> writing

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
more steps I tend to start writing

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.649 
more steps I tend to start writing
papers<00:04:24.039> about<00:04:24.099> two<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.700> three<00:04:24.880> weeks<00:04:25.090> before

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
papers about two to three weeks before

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:26.620 
papers about two to three weeks before
it's

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
it's

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.140 
it's
they<00:04:26.840> do<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.320> do<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.830> very<00:04:28.190> in-depth<00:04:28.640> content

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
they do I do a very in-depth content

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.910 
they do I do a very in-depth content
analysis<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:29.930> try<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.170> gather<00:04:30.500> as<00:04:30.740> much

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
analysis I try to gather as much

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.830 
analysis I try to gather as much
research<00:04:31.310> as<00:04:31.550> much<00:04:31.700> material<00:04:32.300> as<00:04:32.390> I<00:04:32.450> can

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
research as much material as I can

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.870 
research as much material as I can
before<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.320> go<00:04:33.560> into<00:04:33.830> doing<00:04:34.460> this<00:04:34.670> paper

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
before I go into doing this paper

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.600 
before I go into doing this paper
essentially<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:35.780> helps<00:04:35.960> me<00:04:36.080> prep<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.860> second

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
essentially it helps me prep the second

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.310 
essentially it helps me prep the second
week<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:37.850> tend<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.090> start<00:04:38.300> doing<00:04:38.450> outlines<00:04:39.020> kind

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
week I tend to start doing outlines kind

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.320 
week I tend to start doing outlines kind
of<00:04:39.410> weighing<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.430> arguments<00:04:41.060> what<00:04:41.210> is

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
of weighing the arguments what is

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.940 
of weighing the arguments what is
stronger<00:04:41.750> what<00:04:41.930> is<00:04:42.050> weaker<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.650> kind<00:04:42.890> of

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
stronger what is weaker and kind of

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.980 
stronger what is weaker and kind of
getting<00:04:43.250> more<00:04:43.490> more<00:04:44.090> perspective<00:04:44.720> from<00:04:44.870> it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
getting more more perspective from it

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.050 
getting more more perspective from it
whether<00:04:45.200> it's<00:04:45.440> from<00:04:45.650> my<00:04:45.860> GSI<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.370> graduate

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
whether it's from my GSI a graduate

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.240 
whether it's from my GSI a graduate
student<00:04:47.450> instructor<00:04:47.870> or<00:04:48.080> my<00:04:48.470> professor<00:04:48.980> him

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
student instructor or my professor him

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.250 
student instructor or my professor him
or<00:04:49.430> herself<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.970> then<00:04:50.570> in<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.870> third<00:04:51.050> week

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
or herself and then in the third week

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.930 
or herself and then in the third week
that's<00:04:51.530> when<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.770> kind<00:04:51.980> of<00:04:52.010> do<00:04:52.190> like<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.400> break<00:04:52.730> up

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
that's when I kind of do like a break up

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.670 
that's when I kind of do like a break up
of<00:04:53.030> what<00:04:53.210> I'm<00:04:53.330> writing<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.990> then<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:54.230> kind<00:04:54.620> of

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
of what I'm writing and then I kind of

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.290 
of what I'm writing and then I kind of
start<00:04:54.860> synthesizing<00:04:55.040> and<00:04:55.850> just<00:04:56.030> really

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
start synthesizing and just really

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.060 
start synthesizing and just really
getting<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.720> paper<00:04:56.900> together<00:04:57.140> don't<00:04:57.860> be

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
getting the paper together don't be

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.920 
getting the paper together don't be
afraid<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.520> go<00:04:58.670> ask<00:04:58.850> for<00:04:59.120> help<00:04:59.300> because<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.780> know

afraid to go ask for help because I know
a<00:05:00.080> lot<00:05:00.410> of<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:01.010> about<00:05:01.640> doing<00:05:01.970> research<00:05:02.120> is

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
a lot of it about doing research is

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.500 
a lot of it about doing research is
you're<00:05:03.230> afraid<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.800> go<00:05:04.010> out<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.550> find<00:05:05.330> that
