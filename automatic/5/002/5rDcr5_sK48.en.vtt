00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.400

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.680
 clubs 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.930
 sochaux is five points off the podium and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 can always go up in league 1 round 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.190
 on his side a point behind the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.350
 17th and first non relegable 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.600
 the Sochaux will evolve alive 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.150
 and habran hanging colasseau and the 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.950
 scorer caceres are injured side 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.020
 Touraine Milosevic is suspended 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.480
 wide full pockets and kouakou without 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.120
 absentees sochaux is in the process 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.710
 to improve its results at 14th bonal 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.739
 home championship team this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.760
 ranking was a lot less good a little 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.880
 a little earlier in the season 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.899
 we must continue on this path for 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.280
 olivier players echouafni 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.760
 but the first opportunity and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.530
 Touraine with this magnificent strike 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 exceptional goal signed baptist 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.149
 santamaria 13th minute 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.610
 it's 1 0 for a ride outside 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.880
 third goal of the season for santa 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.880
 maria 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.439
 a surprise goal 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.840
 yohann peeled is beaten and sochaux is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.399
 led on his land 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.999
 the towers that insist with andy 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.670
 north which ends up on the ground and the 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:23.039
 red card released against lionel zuma on 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.069
 Sochaux defender is excluded at the 22nd 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:30.560
 minute turn even already to score and get 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.560
 found at eleven against ten is the ideal 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.569
 the towers that insist with this 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.219
 new attacked balloon can be worn 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.109
 the score quickly to 2 0 the strike 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.779
 it is not framed early match 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.740
 catastrophic for sochaux which is in 

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:46.319
 collapse 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.849
 at ten against eleven the visitors are in 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:53.459
 taking advantage of it even though the second 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:57.109
 goal is not scored at halftime we have 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:59.939
 is only 1 0 for rounds 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.979
 this show had won 1-0 on the field 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.700
 of rounds in the first leg with a goal 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.409
 to berenguer on penalty fousseni 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.720
 diawara had taken a red card to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.459
 the tfc 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.560
 the opposite one happens sochaux has 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.489
 taken a red and it's towers that leads 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.080
 1-0 outside 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.400
 yet the Tours have not won 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.650
 only one of their last seven 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.689
 2 points taken on the breasts 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.040
 last match it's not much better for 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:27.269
 sochaux who took a point on his 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.890
 last four games but at 10 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.599
 against 11 the Sochaux are 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.640
 surprisingly better in the second half 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.409
 with this ball back the striking 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.890
 balloon countered second chance balloon 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.430
 of life 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.409
 no success for the towers and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 Thomas Guerbert managed to equalize soon 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.430
 the return of the locker room 49th minute 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.650
 first goal of the season for guerbert 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.780
 who has long been hurt and who 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.810
 managed to score a goal that is very worth 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.810
 expensive 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.420
 vigouroux camara is beaten and turns 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.310
 to eleven against ten rats surely still 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.060
 have opportunities to pick up 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.900
 the advantage 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.150
 the Touraine inevitably attack and they 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.319
 are counter balloon recovered by the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 Sochaux with this balloon hook 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.930
 is pushed back by the second goalkeeper 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.260
 luck on this center is the recovery 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.659
 sweet inc silver the international 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.120
 Moroccan who brings the score to 2 busan to 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.269
 the 52nd minute three minutes after 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.540
 the first goal equalizer of the season 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.819
 for because I have it in three minutes 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.590
 sochaux completely reversed the match 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.389
 outnumbered 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.459
 a performance of choice for 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.260
 olive cubs echouafni can be 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.290
 proud of his players that they continue to 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.569
 sell round opportunities fails 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.389
 not to recover from this change in 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.840
 score 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:51.720
 crazy enough match and ultimately sochaux who 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.400
 played a very big part of the match at 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.419
 ten against eleven managed to win 2 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.419
 goals to 1 face to rounds
