00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
that on that tap there fill the system

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.109 
that on that tap there fill the system
if<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> top<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.939> that's

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
if I want to top it up and that's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.749

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
a bathroom a novel spins around like

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.490 
a bathroom a novel spins around like
this<00:02:42.370> see<00:02:42.610> can<00:02:42.820> I<00:02:42.880> have<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.570> little<00:02:44.380> bit

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
this see can I have a have a little bit

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.060 
this see can I have a have a little bit
of<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
of it

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:56.190 
of it
oh<00:02:51.870> yeah<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.200> lot<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:53.980> lot<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.870> tweaking<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.050> do

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
oh yeah a lot of lot of tweaking to do

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.620 
oh yeah a lot of lot of tweaking to do
but<00:02:57.010> I'm<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.520> rush<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.910> get<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.180> thing<00:02:58.450> up

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
but I'm in a rush to get this thing up

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.900 
but I'm in a rush to get this thing up
so<00:02:58.660> I've<00:02:59.380> kind<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.740> cut<00:03:00.070> corners<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.700> few

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
so I've kind of cut corners and a few

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.449 
so I've kind of cut corners and a few
things<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.360> lot<00:03:01.510> more<00:03:01.540> safety<00:03:01.959> features<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:03.280> go

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
things a lot more safety features to go

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.870 
things a lot more safety features to go
on<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:03.700> thing<00:03:04.620> I'm<00:03:05.620> not<00:03:05.830> sure<00:03:05.890> how<00:03:06.370> hot<00:03:06.670> it's

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
on this thing I'm not sure how hot it's

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.640 
on this thing I'm not sure how hot it's
all<00:03:07.060> gonna<00:03:07.209> get<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.750> gonna<00:03:07.989> be<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.170> lot<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.410> trial

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
all gonna get is gonna be a lot of trial

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.229 
all gonna get is gonna be a lot of trial
and<00:03:08.769> error<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:11.620> now<00:03:11.739> eventually<00:03:12.430> six

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
and error and for now eventually six

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.770 
and error and for now eventually six
features<00:03:13.510> I'm<00:03:14.019> gonna<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.440> put<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.890> our

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
features I'm gonna have to put on it our

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.070 
features I'm gonna have to put on it our
flow<00:03:16.780> valve<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:17.709> if<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.280> pump<00:03:18.550> fails<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.750> turns

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
flow valve so if the pump fails it turns

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.520 
flow valve so if the pump fails it turns
off<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.920> fan<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.519> shuts<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.180> damper<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.440> the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
off the fan and shuts the damper to the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.660 
off the fan and shuts the damper to the
heat<00:03:23.680> exchanger<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:25.090> opens<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.750> one<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.110> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
heat exchanger and opens the one to the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.910 
heat exchanger and opens the one to the
pizza<00:03:27.670> oven<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.780> then<00:03:28.900> directly<00:03:29.320> flows<00:03:29.650> out

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
pizza oven and then directly flows out

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.560 
pizza oven and then directly flows out
I'm<00:03:30.760> gonna<00:03:31.030> have<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.480> put<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:35.040> pipe<00:03:36.040> stat<00:03:36.570> to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
I'm gonna have to put on a pipe stat to

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.729 
I'm gonna have to put on a pipe stat to
control<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.910> temperature<00:03:40.269> of<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.080> water<00:03:41.260> I

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
control the temperature of the water I

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.229 
control the temperature of the water I
don't<00:03:42.610> want<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.820> get<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.060> above<00:03:43.860> 200<00:03:44.860> degrees

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
don't want to get it above 200 degrees

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.259 
don't want to get it above 200 degrees
so<00:03:46.840> what<00:03:47.200> I'm<00:03:47.260> gonna<00:03:47.380> have<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.620> do<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.070> get<00:03:48.850> get

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
so what I'm gonna have to do is get get

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.810 
so what I'm gonna have to do is get get
a<00:03:49.330> modulating<00:03:49.630> fan<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:51.190> get<00:03:51.370> some<00:03:51.550> kind<00:03:51.760> of

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
a modulating fan and get some kind of

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.410 
a modulating fan and get some kind of
controls<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.480> pipes<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.080> so<00:03:53.410> when<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:55.180> funn

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
controls and pipes that so when the funn

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.630 
controls and pipes that so when the funn
you<00:03:55.810> know<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.320> final<00:03:56.620> turn<00:03:56.920> itself<00:03:57.220> off<00:03:57.430> when

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
you know the final turn itself off when

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.479 
you know the final turn itself off when
it<00:03:57.760> starts<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.120> or<00:03:59.049> modulate<00:03:59.620> down<00:03:59.920> when<00:04:00.340> it

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
it starts to or modulate down when it

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.880 
it starts to or modulate down when it
starts<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:00.910> go<00:04:01.030> up<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.299> temperature<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
starts to go up the temperature of the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.310 
starts to go up the temperature of the
control<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.459> that<00:04:03.610> way<00:04:03.730> but<00:04:04.480> I'm<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:05.019> contact

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
control it that way but I'm in contact

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.280 
control it that way but I'm in contact
with<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
with a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.670 
with a
a<00:04:06.640> boiler<00:04:07.640> trap<00:04:08.209> who's<00:04:08.450> gonna<00:04:08.629> sort<00:04:08.930> up<00:04:09.079> me<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.319> a

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
a boiler trap who's gonna sort up me a a

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.679 
a boiler trap who's gonna sort up me a a
Honeywell<00:04:10.340> control<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:11.090> will<00:04:11.180> do<00:04:11.359> that<00:04:11.540> and

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
Honeywell control that will do that and

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.270 
Honeywell control that will do that and
run<00:04:12.290> some<00:04:12.560> motorized<00:04:13.069> valves<00:04:13.579> to<00:04:14.349> control<00:04:15.349> the

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
run some motorized valves to control the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.460 
run some motorized valves to control the
dampers<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:16.910> eventually<00:04:17.419> when<00:04:18.019> i<00:04:18.049> hook<00:04:18.259> this
