00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hi my name is Kevin and on behalf of

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.560 
hi my name is Kevin and on behalf of
expert<00:00:02.250> village<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:02.760> gonna<00:00:02.909> show<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.540> to

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
expert village I'm gonna show you how to

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.059 
expert village I'm gonna show you how to
properly<00:00:03.959> use<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.620> jointer

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
properly use the jointer

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.610 
properly use the jointer
to<00:00:05.460> get<00:00:05.730> wood<00:00:06.029> flat<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:06.629> face<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.379> then

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
to get wood flat on one face and then

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.049 
to get wood flat on one face and then
from<00:00:07.770> there<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:07.980> take<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.639> jointer<00:00:08.910> and

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
from there to take it to the jointer and

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.240 
from there to take it to the jointer and
have<00:00:09.330> another<00:00:09.570> side<00:00:09.809> parallel<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
have another side parallel to it in a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.400 
have another side parallel to it in a
process<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:12.090> getting<00:00:12.240> our<00:00:12.480> wood<00:00:12.690> square<00:00:13.110> and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
process of getting our wood square and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.160 
process of getting our wood square and
perpendicular<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:14.070> all<00:00:14.340> sides<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.059> we've<00:00:15.990> got

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
perpendicular on all sides so we've got

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
perpendicular on all sides so we've got
our<00:00:16.289> solid<00:00:16.740> wood<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.490> we've<00:00:17.970> determined

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
our solid wood here and we've determined

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.570 
our solid wood here and we've determined
that<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.410> want<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> joint<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.130> side<00:00:20.340> going

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that we want to joint this side going

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.050 
that we want to joint this side going
down<00:00:20.730> based<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.600> bow<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.740> wood<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
down based on the bow in the wood and so

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
down based on the bow in the wood and so
we've<00:00:24.689> got<00:00:24.810> our<00:00:24.930> jointer<00:00:25.140> set<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.769> where<00:00:25.920> we

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
we've got our jointer set to where we

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890 
we've got our jointer set to where we
don't<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.430> lot<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.699> extra<00:00:27.119> knife<00:00:27.300> exposed

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
don't have a lot of extra knife exposed

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.320 
don't have a lot of extra knife exposed
so<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.349> when<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:29.099> over<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:30.000> gonna<00:00:30.150> be

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
so that when we go over it it's gonna be

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
so that when we go over it it's gonna be
a<00:00:30.359> nice<00:00:30.630> safe<00:00:31.380> cut<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> lot<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> exposed

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
a nice safe cut not a lot of exposed

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
a nice safe cut not a lot of exposed
blades<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> when

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
blades that we can do this and when

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.229 
blades that we can do this and when
you're<00:00:35.309> pushing<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.969> jointer

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you're pushing it over the jointer

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.000 
you're pushing it over the jointer
you're<00:00:36.750> gonna<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.960> pushing<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.590> everything

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
you're gonna be pushing with everything

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470 
you're gonna be pushing with everything
on<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> bed<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.790> soon<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> get

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
on this bed but as soon as you get

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.910 
on this bed but as soon as you get
enough<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> board<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.530> side

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
enough for the board on this side

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.290 
enough for the board on this side
you<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.370> want<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> concentrate<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you really want to concentrate the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.819 
you really want to concentrate the
weight<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> pushing<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.500> side

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
weight and pushing it on this side

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
weight and pushing it on this side
because<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> where<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> board<00:00:45.750> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
because this is where the board is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
because this is where the board is
coming<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.649> new<00:00:46.800> surface<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.460> being

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
coming out the new surface is being

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
coming out the new surface is being
established<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.289> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
established and you want to go with that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010 
established and you want to go with that
and<00:00:50.010> let<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> knives<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:51.239> its<00:00:51.360> work<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> cut

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and let the knives do its work and cut

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080 
and let the knives do its work and cut
off<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.320> rest<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.640> rest<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
off the rest on the the rest of the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
off the rest on the the rest of the
board<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.860> when<00:00:55.860> you've<00:00:55.980> turn<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.250> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
board so when you've turn on this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.819 
board so when you've turn on this
machine<00:00:56.989> you'll<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> I'll<00:00:58.379> start<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.739> on

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
machine you'll see that I'll start on on

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
machine you'll see that I'll start on on
this<00:00:58.920> side<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.460> then<00:00:59.579> quickly<00:00:59.820> I'll<00:01:00.149> be

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this side and then quickly I'll be

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
this side and then quickly I'll be
pushing<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.260> concentrating<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.160> effort

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
pushing and concentrating all my effort

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
pushing and concentrating all my effort
with<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.579> hands<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.719> where<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> new

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
with my hands on this where the new

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
with my hands on this where the new
surface<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.129> being<00:01:05.369> established

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
surface is being established

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.850 
surface is being established
whenever<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.200> machine<00:01:07.619> it's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
whenever you use this machine it's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.550 
whenever you use this machine it's
really<00:01:08.130> important<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.119> able<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.560> have

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
really important to be able to have

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.469 
really important to be able to have
headphones<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> use<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.210> they're

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
headphones and to use them all they're

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
headphones and to use them all they're
not<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> loudest<00:01:12.930> machine<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> shop<00:01:13.920> over

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
not the loudest machine in the shop over

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
not the loudest machine in the shop over
time<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.820> will<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.150> damage<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.659> hearing<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
time it will do damage your hearing so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.350 
time it will do damage your hearing so
almost<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.250> every<00:01:17.549> machine<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.090> really

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
almost with every machine it's a really

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.640 
almost with every machine it's a really
good<00:01:18.479> idea<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> good<00:01:19.409> set<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
good idea to have a good set of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
good idea to have a good set of
headphones<00:01:19.740> especially<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.299> loud

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
headphones especially for very loud

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
headphones especially for very loud
machines<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.439> planer<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
machines like the planer but for this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:49.099 
machines like the planer but for this
one<00:01:24.210> very<00:01:24.630> good<00:01:24.720> idea<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> use<00:01:25.650> headphones

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.749 

okay<00:01:50.109> so<00:01:50.500> now<00:01:50.649> we've<00:01:50.920> used<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.310> jointer<00:01:51.579> we've

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
okay so now we've used the jointer we've

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.700 
okay so now we've used the jointer we've
established<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.509> flat<00:01:52.719> face<00:01:53.049> on<00:01:53.259> one<00:01:53.380> side<00:01:53.619> of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
established a flat face on one side of

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.709 
established a flat face on one side of
the<00:01:53.799> board<00:01:54.039> and<00:01:54.670> we<00:01:54.969> got<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.119> nice<00:01:55.359> piece<00:01:55.539> of

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
the board and we got a nice piece of

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:56.969 
the board and we got a nice piece of
walnut<00:01:55.869> here<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.319> we're<00:01:56.439> able<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.740> start

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
walnut here that we're able to start

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.050 
walnut here that we're able to start
seeing<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.460> grain<00:01:57.929> here<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.850> part<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:00.969> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
seeing the grain here and part of the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.399 
seeing the grain here and part of the
reason<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.569> we're<00:02:01.689> able<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.899> see<00:02:02.079> this<00:02:02.200> so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
reason that we're able to see this so

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.139 
reason that we're able to see this so
good<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.890> we<00:02:03.189> ran<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.549> board<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.939> same

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
good is we ran the board in the same

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.699 
good is we ran the board in the same
direction<00:02:04.479> as<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.990> grain<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:05.380> running<00:02:05.619> on

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
direction as the grain is running on

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.080 
direction as the grain is running on
this<00:02:05.829> board<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.250> we've<00:02:06.340> got<00:02:06.459> a<00:02:06.490> nice<00:02:06.729> smooth

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
this board and we've got a nice smooth

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.719 
this board and we've got a nice smooth
surface<00:02:07.479> with<00:02:07.929> no<00:02:07.959> tear<00:02:08.410> out<00:02:08.649> part<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.489> is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
surface with no tear out part of that is

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.880 
surface with no tear out part of that is
because<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.060> ran<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.110> same<00:02:11.319> direction<00:02:11.560> as

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
because we ran in the same direction as

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.830 
because we ran in the same direction as
the<00:02:12.040> grain<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:13.150> we've<00:02:13.269> got<00:02:13.299> a<00:02:13.420> nice<00:02:13.629> sort

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the grain and that we've got a nice sort

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.180 
the grain and that we've got a nice sort
of<00:02:13.900> sharp<00:02:14.200> knives<00:02:14.230> which<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.799> always<00:02:14.950> want<00:02:15.160> to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
of sharp knives which you always want to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.339 
of sharp knives which you always want to
use<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.489> all<00:02:15.730> machines<00:02:16.239> as<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.930> knives<00:02:17.080> get

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
use in all machines as the knives get

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.020 
use in all machines as the knives get
dull<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.739> can<00:02:17.860> become<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.130> safety<00:02:18.430> hazard<00:02:18.670> if

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
dull it can become a safety hazard if

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.910 
dull it can become a safety hazard if
you've<00:02:19.150> got<00:02:19.299> good<00:02:19.540> cutting<00:02:19.840> tools<00:02:20.560> it's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you've got good cutting tools it's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.520 
you've got good cutting tools it's
really<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.430> help<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.700> machining<00:02:22.269> and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
really going to help the machining and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.839 
really going to help the machining and
less<00:02:23.530> where<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.829> have<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.130> later<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.579> with

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
less where you have to do later on with

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.650 
less where you have to do later on with
repairing<00:02:25.480> things<00:02:26.019> like<00:02:26.260> tear<00:02:26.500> out<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.950> so

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
repairing things like tear out and so

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.970 
repairing things like tear out and so
we've<00:02:28.660> established<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.170> flat<00:02:29.380> service<00:02:29.680> and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
we've established this flat service and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.020 
we've established this flat service and
it's<00:02:30.099> important<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.459> remember<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.819> when

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
it's important to remember that when

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.100 
it's important to remember that when
you're<00:02:31.150> running<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.450> over<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.720> jointer<00:02:31.930> you

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
you're running it over the jointer you

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.809 
you're running it over the jointer you
don't<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.650> get<00:02:32.799> an<00:02:32.920> entirely<00:02:33.310> clean

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
don't have to get an entirely clean

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.000 
don't have to get an entirely clean
surface<00:02:34.299> as<00:02:34.450> we've<00:02:34.690> done<00:02:34.930> here<00:02:35.349> as<00:02:35.709> long<00:02:35.920> as

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
surface as we've done here as long as

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.979 
surface as we've done here as long as
you've<00:02:36.129> got<00:02:36.160> about<00:02:36.549> 70<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.150> 80<00:02:37.180> percent<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
you've got about 70 to 80 percent of it

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.170 
you've got about 70 to 80 percent of it
jointed<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.650> it's<00:02:39.069> sitting<00:02:39.400> flat<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.940> good

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
jointed and it's sitting flat on a good

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.360 
jointed and it's sitting flat on a good
flat<00:02:40.450> surface<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.049> we<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.410> test<00:02:41.620> out<00:02:41.860> here

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
flat surface that we can test out here

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.190 
flat surface that we can test out here
then<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.090> you've<00:02:43.299> done<00:02:43.510> your<00:02:43.660> job<00:02:43.690> and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
then you know you've done your job and

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.289 
then you know you've done your job and
it's<00:02:44.890> feeling<00:02:45.129> flat<00:02:45.519> I'm<00:02:45.760> not<00:02:45.910> getting<00:02:46.180> any

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
it's feeling flat I'm not getting any

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.150 
it's feeling flat I'm not getting any
bows<00:02:46.569> or<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.079> not<00:02:47.200> rocking<00:02:47.620> anywhere<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.069> we

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
bows or it's not rocking anywhere so we

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.460 
bows or it's not rocking anywhere so we
know<00:02:48.310> we've<00:02:48.459> done<00:02:48.489> our<00:02:48.760> job<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.900> from<00:02:50.079> here<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
know we've done our job so from here the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.229 
know we've done our job so from here the
next<00:02:50.709> step<00:02:50.889> is<00:02:51.040> we're<00:02:51.190> going<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.850> go<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
next step is we're going to do is go and

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.879 
next step is we're going to do is go and
put<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.540> through<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.870> planer<00:02:53.139> and<00:02:53.560> we're

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
put it through the planer and we're

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.160 
put it through the planer and we're
going<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.040> establish<00:02:54.639> this<00:02:55.120> side<00:02:55.450> parallel<00:02:55.959> to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
going to establish this side parallel to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.060 
going to establish this side parallel to
the<00:02:56.290> flat<00:02:56.530> side<00:02:56.829> we<00:02:57.069> have<00:02:57.340> over<00:02:57.639> here
