00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
looking one out of every one um him and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.010 
looking one out of every one um him and
thunder<00:00:20.279> Baraga<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.789> think<00:00:21.119> look<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> coolest

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
thunder Baraga I think look the coolest

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.980 
thunder Baraga I think look the coolest
but<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:22.350> him<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.800> thundered<00:00:23.699> rossion<00:00:24.180> here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
but then him and thundered rossion here

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
but then him and thundered rossion here
definitely<00:00:25.470> performed<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> best<00:00:26.310> i<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:26.789> he

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
definitely performed the best i think he

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.750 
definitely performed the best i think he
is<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.140> power<00:00:28.410> type<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.070> thunder<00:00:29.340> drazi

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
is a power type just like thunder drazi

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.519 
is a power type just like thunder drazi
on<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.210> i<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.869> i<00:00:30.900> mentioned<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.349> my

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
on and i think i mentioned this in my

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.600 
on and i think i mentioned this in my
last<00:00:31.710> review<00:00:31.890> there's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> little<00:00:32.309> piece<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
last review there's a little piece of

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.600 
last review there's a little piece of
rubber<00:00:33.290> along<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:34.950> these<00:00:35.219> bits<00:00:35.489> on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
rubber along with you know these bits on

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.819 
rubber along with you know these bits on
the<00:00:35.640> outside<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.090> offer<00:00:36.300> resistance<00:00:36.829> which

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the outside that offer resistance which

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.319 
the outside that offer resistance which
is<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> reason<00:00:38.280> their<00:00:38.579> power<00:00:38.760> types<00:00:39.090> which

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
is the reason their power types which

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.319 
is the reason their power types which
helps<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.140> strong<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.850> his

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
helps them be so strong but I think his

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.040 
helps them be so strong but I think his
power<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:44.250> completely<00:00:45.120> different<00:00:45.870> from

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
power is just completely different from

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.920 
power is just completely different from
Thunder<00:00:47.039> dras<00:00:47.250> eons<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.760> his<00:00:48.329> ability<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
Thunder dras eons but his ability to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.889 
Thunder dras eons but his ability to
fire<00:00:49.230> quickly<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:50.329> quite<00:00:51.329> difficult<00:00:51.629> because

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
fire quickly is quite difficult because

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
fire quickly is quite difficult because
there's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.469> resistance<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
there's a lot of resistance in here so

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.029 
there's a lot of resistance in here so
it's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> give<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.750> take<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.530> far<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:55.980> he

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it's a give and take as far as what he

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.580 
it's a give and take as far as what he
comes<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.440> bit

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
comes with we have the same little bit

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
comes with we have the same little bit
thundered<00:00:58.920> rossion<00:00:59.309> came<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
thundered rossion came with like you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.280 
thundered rossion came with like you
know<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.160> his<00:01:02.340> target<00:01:02.930> over<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.140> we

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
know this was his target over here we

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.410 
know this was his target over here we
have<00:01:04.320> thunder<00:01:05.220> barrage<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.150> said<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> can

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
have thunder barrage like I said you can

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.030 
have thunder barrage like I said you can
open<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.869> there's<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> marbles<00:01:07.650> inside

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
open them up there's the marbles inside

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.719 
open them up there's the marbles inside
Thunder<00:01:08.520> Baerga<00:01:08.880> um<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.490> lightning<00:01:11.490> Fionn

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
Thunder Baerga um and lightning Fionn

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.539 
Thunder Baerga um and lightning Fionn
came<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.479> these<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.680> targets<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> think

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
came with these two targets so I think

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.570 
came with these two targets so I think
maybe<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.750> they're<00:01:16.650> both<00:01:16.860> power<00:01:17.189> types

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
maybe because they're both power types

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.990 
maybe because they're both power types
maybe<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.060> came<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> same<00:01:19.670> thing<00:01:20.670> or

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
maybe they came with the same thing or

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
maybe they came with the same thing or
maybe<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.390> random<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.350> but

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
maybe it's just random I don't know but

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.020 
maybe it's just random I don't know but
anyway<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:22.890> he<00:01:23.040> comes<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> same<00:01:23.670> target

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
anyway so he comes with the same target

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.690 
anyway so he comes with the same target
same<00:01:24.210> color<00:01:24.450> same<00:01:24.689> everything<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.280> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
there's a lot a lot of resistance I mean

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.100 
there's a lot a lot of resistance I mean
for<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.940> size<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.450> thing<00:02:42.510> there's<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> lot

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
for the size of this thing there's a lot

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.750 
for the size of this thing there's a lot
of<00:02:43.140> resistance<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.070> his<00:02:44.220> little<00:02:44.400> core

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
of resistance here in his little core

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.960 
of resistance here in his little core
piece<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.140> see<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:50.700> can't

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
piece so but as you can see you can't

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.780 
piece so but as you can see you can't
fire<00:02:51.360> as<00:02:51.630> quickly<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:53.040> fastest<00:02:53.490> i<00:02:53.610> can

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
fire as quickly like the fastest i can

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.390 
fire as quickly like the fastest i can
fire<00:02:54.120> i'm<00:02:54.360> gonna<00:02:54.510> try<00:02:54.630> my<00:02:54.660> best<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:56.040> was<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
fire i'm gonna try my best that was it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.020 
fire i'm gonna try my best that was it
probably<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.830> needs<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.190> lot<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.370> force<00:02:59.730> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
probably but it needs a lot of force and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.270 
probably but it needs a lot of force and
i<00:03:00.090> definitely<00:03:00.330> because<00:03:01.290> you're<00:03:01.470> pushing<00:03:02.130> so

hard<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.670> can<00:03:03.030> lose<00:03:03.360> some<00:03:03.510> accuracy<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:05.220> like

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
hard you can lose some accuracy so like

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.880 
hard you can lose some accuracy so like
i<00:03:05.430> said<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.760> trade-off<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.990> Thunder<00:03:07.740> Leo
