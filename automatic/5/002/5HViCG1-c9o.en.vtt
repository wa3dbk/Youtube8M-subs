in pieces and they all have little balls
on<00:02:26.360> them<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.660> think<00:02:26.720> Omega<00:02:27.320> bought<00:02:27.620> figures

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
on them I think Omega bought figures

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.710 
on them I think Omega bought figures
they're<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.460> attached<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.480> his<00:02:29.690> body

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720

they're like this attached to his body
his<00:02:30.260> bottom<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:30.890> his<00:02:31.360> arms<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:34.220> should<00:02:34.400> have

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
his bottom and his arms you should have

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.280 
his bottom and his arms you should have
ended<00:02:34.670> me<00:02:34.910> first<00:02:36.550> now<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.750> table<00:02:39.080> as<00:02:39.200> I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
ended me first now I this table as I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.080 
ended me first now I this table as I
doubt<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:39.920> not<00:02:40.130> certain<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:40.490> you<00:02:40.670> can't<00:02:40.880> with

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
doubt I'm not certain if you can't with

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.340 
doubt I'm not certain if you can't with
this<00:02:41.210> yeah<00:02:41.630> he<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.900> twist<00:02:42.080> his<00:02:42.230> head<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:45.020> he

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
this yeah he can twist his head and he

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.870 
this yeah he can twist his head and he
could<00:02:45.500> also<00:02:45.650> move<00:02:45.890> his<00:02:46.070> arms<00:02:46.400> but<00:02:46.610> not<00:02:46.730> very

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
could also move his arms but not very

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.850 
could also move his arms but not very
well<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> only<00:02:48.050> real<00:02:48.140> thing<00:02:48.290> he<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.770> move

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
well so the only real thing he can move

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.400 
well so the only real thing he can move
is<00:02:49.040> his<00:02:49.190> head<00:02:49.400> but<00:02:50.300> overall<00:02:50.660> he's<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> very

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
is his head but overall he's a very

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.680 
is his head but overall he's a very
detailed<00:02:51.620> tales<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.850> par<00:02:53.090> from<00:02:53.150> his<00:02:53.330> eyes<00:02:53.480> I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
detailed tales that par from his eyes I

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.230 
detailed tales that par from his eyes I
really<00:02:53.930> don't<00:02:54.080> like<00:02:54.140> there's<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> great<00:02:55.790> thing

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
really don't like there's a great thing

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.240 
really don't like there's a great thing
in<00:02:56.390> his<00:02:56.480> ears<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.840> are<00:02:56.930> missing<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.500> that's
