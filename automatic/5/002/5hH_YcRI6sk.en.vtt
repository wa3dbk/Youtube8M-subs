does it feel to get the spotlight on
your<00:02:16.570> own<00:02:16.690> though<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.460> lot<00:02:18.460> of<00:02:18.550> pressure<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:20.410> lot

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
your own though a lot of pressure a lot

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.690 
your own though a lot of pressure a lot
of<00:02:20.680> pressure

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
of pressure

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.500 
of pressure
I<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.990> has<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.290> be<00:02:23.470> good<00:02:23.920> from<00:02:24.220> any<00:02:24.880> angle

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
I just it has to be good from any angle

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.920 
I just it has to be good from any angle
whether<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.530> be<00:02:26.650> from<00:02:26.860> high<00:02:27.130> low<00:02:27.580> side<00:02:28.180> or<00:02:28.690> like

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
whether it be from high low side or like

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.110 
whether it be from high low side or like
diagonal<00:02:29.710> yeah<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.520> trying<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:30.970> then

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
diagonal yeah and so trying it and then

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.310 
diagonal yeah and so trying it and then
at<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.390> same<00:02:31.420> time<00:02:31.600> out<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.050> make<00:02:32.170> sure<00:02:32.290> I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
at the same time out to make sure I

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.390 
at the same time out to make sure I
don't<00:02:32.410> mess<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.890> know<00:02:32.980> every<00:02:33.220> single

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
don't mess up and you know every single

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.970 
don't mess up and you know every single
stage<00:02:33.730> isn't<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:34.360> shaped<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.750> same<00:02:34.930> way<00:02:35.200> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
stage isn't like shaped the same way and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.570 
stage isn't like shaped the same way and
so<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:37.060> very<00:02:37.860> somewhat<00:02:38.860> like<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.250> guess<00:02:39.400> just

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
so it's very somewhat like I guess just

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.550 
so it's very somewhat like I guess just
off<00:02:39.730> very<00:02:39.940> easily<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:40.570> then<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:41.080> very<00:02:41.170> fun

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
off very easily but then it's very fun

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.200 
off very easily but then it's very fun
at<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.740> same<00:02:41.890> time<00:02:41.950> because<00:02:42.700> it's<00:02:42.940> another

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
at the same time because it's another

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.020 
at the same time because it's another
create<00:02:43.750> way<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.050> learn<00:02:44.710> more<00:02:45.010> about<00:02:45.310> their
