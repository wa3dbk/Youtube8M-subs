00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.080 
doing so but you might want to be a
little<00:02:22.980> bit<00:02:23.100> cautious<00:02:23.340> when<00:02:23.670> doing<00:02:23.940> this

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
little bit cautious when doing this

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.850 
little bit cautious when doing this
because<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.810> haven't<00:02:24.989> had<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> chance<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.680> test

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
because I haven't had a chance to test

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.830 
because I haven't had a chance to test
long-term<00:02:26.400> durability<00:02:26.850> now<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.480> far<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
long-term durability now as far as the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.479 
long-term durability now as far as the
padding<00:02:28.140> goes<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.680> actually<00:02:29.100> feels<00:02:29.310> very

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
padding goes it actually feels very

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.100 
padding goes it actually feels very
similar<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.970> some<00:02:30.150> sponges<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.720> I've<00:02:30.840> had<00:02:31.019> in

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
similar to some sponges that I've had in

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.780 
similar to some sponges that I've had in
the<00:02:31.170> past<00:02:31.350> used<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.799> wash<00:02:31.950> dishes<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.519> of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the past used to wash dishes and of

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.100 
the past used to wash dishes and of
course<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.150> gonna<00:02:33.269> be<00:02:33.390> more<00:02:33.540> durable<00:02:33.780> than<00:02:34.019> a

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
course it's gonna be more durable than a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.020 
course it's gonna be more durable than a
dish<00:02:34.380> sponge<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.799> trying<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.190> give<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.430> kind

of idea

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.930 
of idea
but<00:02:37.620> overall<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.010> pretty<00:02:38.220> comfortable<00:02:38.549> I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.479 
but overall it's pretty comfortable I
will<00:02:39.450> say<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> ear<00:02:40.290> padding<00:02:40.739> feels<00:02:41.250> kind

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
will say that the ear padding feels kind

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.710 
will say that the ear padding feels kind
of<00:02:41.549> tight<00:02:41.610> at<00:02:41.940> first<00:02:42.180> actually<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.570> feels

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
of tight at first actually it feels
