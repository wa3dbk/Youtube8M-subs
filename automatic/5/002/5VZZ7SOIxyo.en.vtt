I got so many other things to do but I'm
fairly<00:01:04.949> happy<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.280> how<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> looks<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.970> far

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
fairly happy with how it looks so far

I think it looks best with some fence
posts<00:01:17.130> underneath<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.820> makes<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.030> look

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
like it has that rope sort of look to it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.140

the one that I I just completed I still
plan<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:08.039> gonna<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.340> more<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
plan on I think I'm gonna do more to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.520 
plan on I think I'm gonna do more to
this<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.569> add<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.200> sand

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
this I have to you know add more sand

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.430 
this I have to you know add more sand
into<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.730> pathway<00:02:12.180> around<00:02:12.480> here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
into the the pathway around here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.470 
into the the pathway around here
but<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.860> pretty<00:02:14.040> happy<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.490> how<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:15.270> one's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
but I'm pretty happy with how this one's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.170 
but I'm pretty happy with how this one's
turned<00:02:15.690> out<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.050> far<00:02:16.080> also<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.730> okay

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
turned out so far also it's okay

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.720 
turned out so far also it's okay
the<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.080> next<00:02:19.320> one<00:02:19.560> actually<00:02:20.100> has<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> cave

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the the next one actually has a cave

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.100 
the the next one actually has a cave
inside<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.630> good<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:21.930> gonna<00:02:22.020> be

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
inside of it so it's good it's gonna be

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.900 
inside of it so it's good it's gonna be
fun<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:22.440> gonna<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.100> entire<00:02:23.370> Mesa

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
fun I'm gonna have to do the entire Mesa

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.930 
fun I'm gonna have to do the entire Mesa
and<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.440> carve<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:25.920> until<00:02:26.820> it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and then kind of carve it out until it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.530 
and then kind of carve it out until it
looks<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.810> know<00:02:27.930> how<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.620> want<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.270> but<00:02:30.270> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
looks you know how I want it but it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.710 
looks you know how I want it but it
should<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.750> alright<00:02:31.340> but<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.640> guess<00:02:33.120> now<00:02:33.690> that

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
should be alright but I guess now that

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.450 
should be alright but I guess now that
I've<00:02:33.930> said<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.290> thirteen<00:02:34.950> million<00:02:35.130> times

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
I've said but thirteen million times

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.990 
I've said but thirteen million times
this<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.330> what<00:02:37.020> I've<00:02:37.110> been<00:02:37.140> working<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.500> guys

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
this is what I've been working on guys

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.390 
this is what I've been working on guys
here<00:02:39.000> I'll<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.360> kind<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.900> fly<00:02:40.800> around<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.280> we

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
here I'll just kind of fly around so we

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.260 
here I'll just kind of fly around so we
have<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.550> nice<00:02:42.200> nighttime<00:02:43.200> shot<00:02:43.560> here<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.270> can

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
have a nice nighttime shot here you can

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.870 
have a nice nighttime shot here you can
see<00:02:45.420> everything<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.900> reasonably<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> lid

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
see everything is reasonably the lid

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.700 
see everything is reasonably the lid
there<00:02:47.880> would<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.090> little<00:02:48.690> spots<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.350> have<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
there would be little spots I have the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.230 
there would be little spots I have the
the<00:02:49.920> mobs<00:02:50.100> turned<00:02:50.370> off<00:02:50.550> obviously<00:02:51.060> because

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
the mobs turned off obviously because

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.500 
the mobs turned off obviously because
it's<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.690> creative<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.460> would<00:02:53.460> be<00:02:53.670> some

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
it's it's creative but would be some

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.180 
it's it's creative but would be some
problems<00:02:54.630> nothing<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.710> people<00:02:55.860> wouldn't

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
problems nothing that people wouldn't

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.920 
problems nothing that people wouldn't

this build in a map whenever I'm done

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.450 
this build in a map whenever I'm done
but<00:03:02.640> I'm<00:03:02.910> there's<00:03:03.270> no<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:04.500> sure<00:03:04.530> time<00:03:05.190> when
