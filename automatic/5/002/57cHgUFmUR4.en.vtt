numbers to the skylight that's the
easiest<00:00:33.630> way<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.260> locate<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.280> spot<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.469> here<00:00:37.469> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
easiest way to locate a spot and here we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.819 
easiest way to locate a spot and here we
are<00:00:37.730> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> skylight<00:00:39.420> 122<00:00:40.079> skylight

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
are this is the skylight 122 skylight

are this is the skylight 122 skylight
122<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:42.180> painted<00:00:42.629> backwards<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.660> read

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
122 we painted backwards so we can read

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.630 
122 we painted backwards so we can read
the<00:00:45.989> numbers<00:00:46.170> easier<00:00:46.770> from<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> inside

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the numbers easier from the inside

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.049 
the numbers easier from the inside
because<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.360> where<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.050> searching<00:00:49.649> star

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
because that's where the searching star

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.900 
because that's where the searching star
looking<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:51.300> downstairs<00:00:52.610> where<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.640> lake<00:00:53.879> is

looking for downstairs where the lake is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.740 
looking for downstairs where the lake is
located<00:00:55.190> then<00:00:56.629> you<00:00:57.629> locate<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.609> nearest

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
located then you locate the nearest

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.540 
located then you locate the nearest

a skylight 1:22 we step the area it's
kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.500> hard<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> find<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.280> right<00:01:14.430> here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
kind of hard to find out right here

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.499 
kind of hard to find out right here
right<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:15.960> wet<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:17.509> we

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
right now because it's all wet but we

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.719 
right now because it's all wet but we
work<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:19.710> walk<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.880> whole<00:01:21.060> area<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.460> find

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
work we walk the whole area and we find

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.679 
work we walk the whole area and we find
this<00:01:23.909> little<00:01:25.070> little<00:01:26.070> hole<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.689> that's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
this little little hole here that's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.700 
this little little hole here that's
enough<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.170> make<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> leak<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:31.530> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
enough to make a make a leak this is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
enough to make a make a leak this is
EPDM<00:01:32.430> rain<00:01:32.939> force<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.799> net<00:01:35.009> inside<00:01:35.900> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
EPDM rain force so I can net inside you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.819 
EPDM rain force so I can net inside you
can<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:39.590> reinforced<00:01:40.590> material<00:01:42.560> put<00:01:43.560> right

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
can see reinforced material put right

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.389 
can see reinforced material put right
