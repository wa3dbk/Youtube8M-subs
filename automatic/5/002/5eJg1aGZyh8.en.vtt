actually some more miniseries in between
but<00:00:44.820> suffice<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> say<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.660> did<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.559> access

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
but suffice to say I did not have access

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.190 
but suffice to say I did not have access
to<00:00:47.460> those<00:00:47.700> books<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.660> kind<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> sucks

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to those books and that kind of sucks

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
to those books and that kind of sucks
because<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.739> book<00:00:49.950> deals<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.309> characters

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
because this book deals with characters

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.170 
because this book deals with characters
introduced<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.660> those<00:00:51.930> earlier<00:00:52.320> miniseries
