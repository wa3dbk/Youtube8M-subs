 but by google you can find the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.329
 I could do it here 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.579
 It will just be a little bit more here 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.620
 which explains but I already have one 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 I just save and load scores 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.720
 have a little something here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 played and stored here that is 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.840
 I'm already here now yes I am 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.490
 I'm used to pokemon 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.270
 moving left I have just that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.100

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.799
 there are still l and grope 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:38.009
 So, actually, everything it is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:42.540
 gameboys even there we played times 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:47.369
 a little bit as it actually runs 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.829
 also totally liquid one can the the text 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.350
 speed also change so you 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.920
 can just the setting as well as on 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.079
 play games from gameboy 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.320
 to adjust 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.079
 with this month clock running here now 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.909
 game boy advance games nintendo ds 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.990
 emulators are available for android 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.090
 they are not too complicated 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.850
 if you play game boy color games 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.370
 you may want to do that however 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.490
 they need a gameboy color for that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.100
 i should get emulator here 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.750
 to the professor, give it back to him 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.750
 give funny package 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:42.030
 Let's see what it is there 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.030
 the first time 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.470
 he tells me a little bit now 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.970
 a lot of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 I'll show you again 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.660
 a little bit of the settings so 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.340
 if you are just on the settings 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.040
 go up here first lot 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.540
 and safe so you can just do that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.930
 I save game was suppose though 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.010
 overwrites the here once again 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.920
 shoes and get started 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.570
 so he is already there so they can 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.510
 then choose the same again 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.010
 or if you like the game if you 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.810
 The app can also restart 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.520
 Loading is not yet necessary 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.020
 save game yourself but can 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.210
 Save via the emulator 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.200
 that means he can at all possible 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.970
 save points 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.790
 in the game, for example, artists 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.260
 do not save in fighting 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.730
 with the emulator it just stops 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.380
 already that was loud and save.tv cheats 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.780
 you can just as the name says 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.700
 sietz must enter there on the top 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.310
 plus go 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.750
 Here you can find the name type and the ski code 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.510
 then enter then 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.170
 The chips are used naturally 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.430
 on the internet if you want 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.650
 Below are the settings 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.910
 can you for example something over 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.210
 the ipad controls everything like that 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.730
 should look like 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.640
 You can also use an example 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.990
 do sound and make up 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.200
 the volume here whether the screen 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.760
 should be in nsg mode 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.010
 they really can 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.900
 pretty much adjust but as long 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.760
 the game is running smoothly it is 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.630
 actually the main thing and it does 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.820
 definitely 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.800
 Of course they can not only pokÃ©mon 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.020
 You can play all the game boy advance 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.770
 playing here next play 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.720
 it also runs pretty smoothly 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.570
 maybe they like it too 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.810
 the gameboy plays on her smartphone 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.810
 to play and so maybe 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.960
 a bit of the old days back 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.910
 Remember that was it, too 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.490
 so far so I think the app 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.860
 actually pretty nice and useful 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.060
 if you look at the old gameboy again 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.650
 wants to play games 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.930
 the gameboy maybe not 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.550
 has more or just does not feel like it 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.700
 second device to lug 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.290
 So I like it very much that was it 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.650
 also already so many thanks for 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.830
 watch and see you next video 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.370
 become 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.889
 or they move outside on the earth 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.150
 village I think up there I would be fine 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.889
 difficult to come over 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.690
 so I just play time after 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.030
 left the two trains was already so 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.980
 one made now have two 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.950
 Used book it in the middle 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.850
 of the playing field to keep it up 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.850
 the dangers
