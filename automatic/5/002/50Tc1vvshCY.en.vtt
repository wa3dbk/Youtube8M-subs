00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
kind of annoying and the in the added

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.310 
kind of annoying and the in the added
extent<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.330> imagine<00:02:59.330> how<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.510> nutcase

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
extent is that imagine how the nutcase

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.350 
extent is that imagine how the nutcase
part<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.860> fan<00:03:01.010> base<00:03:01.160> will<00:03:01.370> react<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
part of the fan base will react to the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.780 
part of the fan base will react to the
thought<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.870> rod<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:04.130> hearing<00:03:04.610> a

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
thought that rod to the to hearing a

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.120 
thought that rod to the to hearing a
sonic<00:03:05.540> voice<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.900> actually<00:03:06.500> sounds

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
sonic voice that actually sounds

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.430 
sonic voice that actually sounds
unpleasant<00:03:07.430> because<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.450> had<00:03:08.930> no<00:03:09.080> problem

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
unpleasant because I had no problem

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.020 
unpleasant because I had no problem
taking<00:03:09.530> grip<00:03:09.920> with<00:03:10.220> Jason<00:03:10.550> Griffith<00:03:10.670> when<00:03:10.940> he

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
taking grip with Jason Griffith when he

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.430 
taking grip with Jason Griffith when he
took<00:03:11.120> over<00:03:11.300> but<00:03:12.230> uh<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:13.160> guy<00:03:13.660> real<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.959> he<00:03:15.230> is

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
took over but uh this guy real if he is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.759 
took over but uh this guy real if he is
as<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.830> he's<00:03:16.459> unless<00:03:17.330> he's<00:03:17.510> improved<00:03:17.900> which

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
as if he's unless he's improved which

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.290 
as if he's unless he's improved which
hopefully<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.519> Sonic<00:03:19.790> Colors<00:03:19.880> footage

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
hopefully the Sonic Colors footage

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.830 
hopefully the Sonic Colors footage
suggests<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.370> what<00:03:22.370> hope<00:03:22.519> essentially<00:03:23.420> it

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
suggests that what hope essentially it

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.160 
suggests that what hope essentially it
hasn't<00:03:24.680> improved<00:03:24.739> them<00:03:25.190> work<00:03:25.400> then<00:03:25.959> even<00:03:26.959> I

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
hasn't improved them work then even I

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.930 
hasn't improved them work then even I
think<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.739> voice<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> little<00:03:28.430> annoying<00:03:28.640> but

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
think the voice is a little annoying but

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.940 
think the voice is a little annoying but
I'm<00:03:29.390> not<00:03:29.630> going<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> say<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.350> I<00:03:30.380> think<00:03:30.709> that

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
I'm not going to say that I think that

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.530 
I'm not going to say that I think that
right<00:03:31.130> now<00:03:31.280> as<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> fact<00:03:31.970> because<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.360> haven't

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
right now as a fact because I haven't

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.160 
right now as a fact because I haven't
heard<00:03:32.780> him<00:03:32.989> in<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.230> game<00:03:33.440> but<00:03:34.180> point<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.420> it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
heard him in the game but point is it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.090 
heard him in the game but point is it
does<00:03:36.350> make<00:03:36.620> me<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.769> little<00:03:36.800> nervous

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
does make me a little nervous

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.710 
does make me a little nervous
particularly<00:03:37.550> how<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:37.880> fan<00:03:38.209> base<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.600> going

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
particularly how the fan base is going

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.449 
particularly how the fan base is going
to<00:03:38.810> react<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.260> because<00:03:39.350> as<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:40.100> pointed<00:03:40.370> out

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
to react to it because as I pointed out

the<00:05:20.000> sounds<00:05:20.389> of<00:05:20.479> Brian<00:05:20.750> Gemini<00:05:21.050> Jason

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
the sounds of Brian Gemini Jason

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.929 
the sounds of Brian Gemini Jason
Griffith<00:05:21.409> now<00:05:21.650> but<00:05:21.889> I<00:05:21.919> think<00:05:22.159> we<00:05:22.250> can<00:05:22.400> handle<00:05:22.580> a

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
Griffith now but I think we can handle a

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.329 
Griffith now but I think we can handle a
new<00:05:23.120> Sonny<00:05:23.360> Boy<00:05:23.539> that<00:05:24.169> still<00:05:24.439> sounds<00:05:24.650> close<00:05:25.159> to

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:25.339 
new Sonny Boy that still sounds close to

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:26.950 
new Sonny Boy that still sounds close to
there<00:05:25.460> that<00:05:25.610> still<00:05:25.969> sounds<00:05:26.180> within<00:05:26.479> that<00:05:26.719> it

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
there that still sounds within that it

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.050 
there that still sounds within that it
still<00:05:27.169> fits<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.069> criteria<00:05:28.279> for<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.729> sonic

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
still fits the criteria for a sonic

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.269 
still fits the criteria for a sonic
voice<00:05:29.210> but<00:05:29.990> just<00:05:30.139> isn't<00:05:30.409> but<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.680> can<00:05:30.919> tell<00:05:31.099> is

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279 
voice but just isn't but you can tell is

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.869 
voice but just isn't but you can tell is
not<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.699> not<00:05:32.120> an<00:05:32.240> imitation<00:05:32.449> like<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.849> like<00:05:34.849> you

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
not is not an imitation like a like you

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.760 
not is not an imitation like a like you
could<00:05:35.120> tell<00:05:35.270> like<00:05:35.539> you<00:05:35.960> can<00:05:36.080> tell<00:05:36.229> at<00:05:36.560> your

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
could tell like you can tell at your

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.980 
could tell like you can tell at your
voice<00:05:37.159> and<00:05:37.520> that<00:05:37.610> was<00:05:37.759> a<00:05:38.089> clear<00:05:38.449> imitation<00:05:38.900> of

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
voice and that was a clear imitation of

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.219 
voice and that was a clear imitation of
Jason<00:05:39.319> Griffith<00:05:39.610> so<00:05:40.610> don't<00:05:41.300> try<00:05:41.689> so<00:05:41.960> hard<00:05:41.990> to

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
Jason Griffith so don't try so hard to

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.110 
Jason Griffith so don't try so hard to
sound<00:05:42.830> like<00:05:43.189> somebody<00:05:43.550> else<00:05:43.729> that's<00:05:44.060> just

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
sound like somebody else that's just

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.059 
sound like somebody else that's just
might<00:05:44.360> be<00:05:44.569> some<00:05:44.719> advice<00:05:44.960> for<00:05:45.110> you<00:05:45.169> and<00:05:45.469> with

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
might be some advice for you and with

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.889 
might be some advice for you and with
that<00:05:46.099> that's<00:05:46.699> the<00:05:46.969> end<00:05:47.330> of<00:05:47.449> this<00:05:47.569> video

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:47.899 
that that's the end of this video

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:49.420 
that that's the end of this video
because<00:05:48.139> I<00:05:48.259> don't<00:05:48.409> want<00:05:48.529> it<00:05:48.649> I<00:05:48.830> don't<00:05:49.099> want<00:05:49.339> to

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
because I don't want it I don't want to

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.589 
because I don't want it I don't want to
have<00:05:49.520> this<00:05:49.639> going<00:05:49.789> to<00:05:49.909> five<00:05:50.089> cars<00:05:50.419> and

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
have this going to five cars and

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.020 
have this going to five cars and
hopefully<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:50.899> won't
