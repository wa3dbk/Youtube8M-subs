00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.990
 I am andrÃ© and this is the score then I don't see 2 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.099
 included with the don't know and I do not know much later a micro usb cable 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.310
 2 with buyers 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.789
 and of course the device itself 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.849
 In June I did not find them closer to the top one 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.109
 speaker girl there encounter 3com a27 in screens with the resolution of the four 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.009
 80 meters 3 20 pixels 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.000
 there encounter and the top x button and a physical buttons 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Nijman bottom find a microphone and a micro USB connection 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930
 the right side of the on and off button 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.890
 find one at the top and co a headset port 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.660
 and on the left side find a hole for a keycord fini another 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450
 for physics pimple pop 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.940
 and also a micro sd card slot 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.390
 go to the backside found there turned out three comma 2 megapixel camera with 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.190
 in addition, a pair of speaker glasses and the background you are easy to use 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.770
 remove and settle you get two colors included and yellow and one 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.660
 gray 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.700
 wout poels and then 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.079
 on the back open wifi again the battery and behind the battery is the SIM card slot 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.990
 and look at the way the management works, not just those involved but he 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.079
 turns it one more and thaws the two points 3 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.450
 so the old version 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.689
 and there than 800 megahertz a single core processor and now you would think of that 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.590
 there maybe that is not really a good combination but we see yes it does 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.649
 runs smoothly 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.319
 and of course with heavy applications and with many applications at the same time 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.380
 have to turn 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.259
 you would just encounter faltering 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.789
 but simply opened applications and then just normally uses it 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.029
 device you should not expect that they are just as fast as the top models 

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.850
 of course 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.479
 then the site of football that works does not really have many problems with it 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.469
 who lived up to the standard also samson applications which actually 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.050
 are used to the if you application to share everything via a network 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.179
 radio a task weather application 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:00.239
 the own de ket designers the animal is there it is better especially they sit 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.520
 another promise is 80 application at 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 The elderly sometimes tends to come standard with all devices 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.889
 so that are also municipalities also see the interface has been adjusted the by samsung 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.439
 of them meant that 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.319
 then you look at the screen the screen is of course one for not such 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.040
 very high resolution in this price range also not that weird but still on it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.299
 watch what the screen looks like when we play a movie 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.299
 who more movies that is a high quality 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.540
 there is also the sound that can be a fairly loud state now on such a machine 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.489
 in the future not much changed right against the speaker either 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.119
 wrong 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.429
 the picture is all good and it is of course all small days low 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:49.290
 resolution 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.909
 but it's just fine for the former use 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.909
 childhood years that you buy can still watch a great video and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.490
 and make more use of it 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.549
 we are going to call him the browser 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.799
 and see how fast the internet is 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.859
 you can be connected via wifi when we go to the game 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:13.399
 we also immediately see a small problem the keyboard is quite narrow 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:15.869
 so you should pay attention when you type 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.949
 do you know security 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.109
 and that you let van der z in 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.849
 she got rid of the single core mega sop heads 6 7 after another tough game 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.899
 Twenty to eight billion sail a year each year 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.079
 a reasonable raft is nevertheless always loaded you can start using it immediately 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.079
 not all images have been uploaded 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.759
 happen now look wheat or now there are loaded again 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.870
 we see the service 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.459
 yes also just pinch to zoom a can 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.769
 He is hooked Hudson when we go back and forth to make yes that is of course 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.479
 not so weird just look at the camera functionality 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.869
 start looking at the camera application of the and mini 2 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:55.749
 the fact that ticket could solve some of it by just because protocol 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.690
 We see that things are going reasonably smoothly 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.860
 then those 2 megapixel cameras 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.629
 find a number of settings here on the left 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.490
 among others there are choices 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.759
 can also adjust the brightness and even 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.519
 and the general extended settings 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.519
 like a movie night in this country 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.389
 yes what actually also exist existing in all others 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.930
 cameras 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.039
 big right is also turning off the closing 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.270
 after making a mistake they best got another one for playback immediately without in 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.730
 on the gallery you will be directly in the gallery 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.260
 right very wrong day from one photo to the other the flowed in 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.169
 we are also looking forward to a video 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.599
 from 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.590
 the person himself tennis court has been included meanwhile 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.590
 bit 80 pixels 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.100
 the camera emits the aex that I don't have the auto focus 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.270
 in addition, you notice if you are going to open heavy applications or several 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.710
 applications at the same time it makes the single core processor difficult 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.240
 to get 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.650
 it has the four gigabytes of internal memory which can also be expanded 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.380
 is by means of a micro sd card in addition, that is pretty fast 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.370
 normal use and finally two more suitcases 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.219
 included 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.389
 are you looking for a cheap and a simple one and by the smartphone with all 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.360
 functionalities then the samsung galaxy mini 2 is the right choice for you 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.690
 wide device then click on the left and right leg 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.800
 or go our competition pediatrician point nl or point b 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.539
 I thank for time in this review 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.409
 and see you next time
