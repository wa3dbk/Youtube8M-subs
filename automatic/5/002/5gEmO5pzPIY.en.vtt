about about Toyota I never never in my
entire<00:01:21.509> life<00:01:21.689> thought<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.530> all

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
entire life thought that when they all

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.800 
entire life thought that when they all
travel<00:01:23.009> such<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> far<00:01:24.000> distance<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> think

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
travel such a far distance but I think

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.120 
travel such a far distance but I think
it<00:01:24.990> could<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.170> haven't<00:01:25.470> done<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.950> without

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it could I haven't done this without

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
it could I haven't done this without
being<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.610> LPS<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.119> probably<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> answer<00:01:27.900> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
being at LPS and probably the answer is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.429 
being at LPS and probably the answer is
no<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.820> you're<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.119> community<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.840> LVS

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
