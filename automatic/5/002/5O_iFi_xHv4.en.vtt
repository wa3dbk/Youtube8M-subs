were<00:04:25.790> only<00:04:25.910> for<00:04:26.150> 88<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:26.900> that's<00:04:27.200> like<00:04:27.380> really

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680

just<00:04:45.530> stretch<00:04:45.830> didn't<00:04:46.190> work<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:46.790> this<00:04:46.940> has<00:04:47.120> the

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
just stretch didn't work so this has the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.580 
just stretch didn't work so this has the
bones<00:04:47.479> in<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:47.930> stuff<00:04:48.080> like<00:04:48.169> that<00:04:48.229> so<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.500> was
