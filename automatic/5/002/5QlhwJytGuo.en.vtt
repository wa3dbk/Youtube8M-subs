00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.210
 michel marty until new political order 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.730

 square in the 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.040
 and could generate 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.740
 the black tide that was the starting point was actually plural March several 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 illness made me see the wonder

 I learned how to cook. 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.900

 third child 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.090
 the old movement 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.459
 fully enclosed 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.960
 the burner bearer wins in the mine tarquini 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 catch up from end to end and that was just a blow in the last game 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 it becomes a ready-made support that I 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 there was another side that is a great incentive to always improve and let's call it 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 that we take passage to the area where the customer in the late afternoon are

 told that he quit 100 times to treat after that there would be Libya 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.890
 It's what I'm focused on that touches 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.190
 the reform he could 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.230
 besides being in contact with the guests can be at all times 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.570
 contemplating the Belgian tennis pro jelle vanendert of the project will 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.570
 Certainly 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 with the fall 4 the couple 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.749

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.369
 I was treating 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.819
 in a way yes 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.229
 who is to be congratulated by the work and to cry for the congratulations so long it is 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.229
 used in an ecological way all the way 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.529
 it was pleasurable 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:46.739
 free entrance 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.400
 this is true because in my work the process is exempt from going 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.559
 the one who earns the most
