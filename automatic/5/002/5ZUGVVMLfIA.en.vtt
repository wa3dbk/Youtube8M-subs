00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.690
 today was based on caroline eu 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.469
 I just want to come in today to do reviews 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.760
 you 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.070
 this time is crazy about you height 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.619
 nationally. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.930
 The book that he is little looks at is only from 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.849
 universe of books I had known 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.330
 he was not made by the universe and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 send the universe she left a dimension 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.010
 very fluffy was the pink baby thing more 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.770
 It's cute that they had the world to put 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.329
 and a range so simple to staff 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 during the writing I found it right up 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.120
 but look I just have the parts as soon as 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.000
 he marveled at the letters as 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.230
 here is a phase that leaves much 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 time was the author's 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.550
 this book here I finished reading a lot 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.039
 very fast 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.690
 It's very fluent reading, it 's very good. 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.000
 reminded me of those juvenile novels 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.860
 so it's really worth knowing the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 author 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.549
 here we are presented to the lithium radio and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.530
 hate that they are the one chose to speak history 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.189
 in the garden is the same international 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.840
 okay here 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.259
 in the story she at these times at last 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.939
 that she is fascinated by music she is 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.579
 fascinated she loves to sing she has a 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.250
 Wonderful voice and souza many times 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.509
 presented to the songs she sings 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.450
 and daniel he is the owner of after 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.340
 dark that is a bar where he works but 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.399
 the villain does not work as a vocalist at 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
 singer, she works with the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.479
 Pub 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.759
 this is because the design was 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.880
 created along with the July to GM lost 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.689
 their parents when in a very new accident 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.670
 and the neighbors ended up creating her and the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.969
 neighbors had aa jo that the river has 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.160
 then they were raised as brothers but 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.979
 Obviously they were not blood brothers. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.650
 in July she felt 11 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.750
 action by dn is what the dn by her but 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.640
 due to some facts he thought that 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.549
 it would be totally wrong to develop with 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.099
 that he considered a sister and brother 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.220
 also he then moves away and becomes 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.019
 Brother has macho and without grace 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.299
 to be careful that he had left the space 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.099
 which gives then she does not he does not want 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.410
 she continues to try that he has this 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.030
 prejudice he thinks she is very 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.610
 beautiful did not want anyone to be 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.849
 take advantage of her but due to carelessness 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.700
 Since she was singing we gave you a 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.790
 night he is not working and does 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.200
 the biggest hit what the dark bomb 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:55.190
 due to this initiative of jully 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.609
 to sing then imagine you there singing 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.120
 look for people to be very nice 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:03.890
 band marvelous men o'mine under 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.730
 the people but says they will find it 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.030
 in this book 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.250
 and there you are reading there and tutti motif monte 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.129
 to continue reading because it is very 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.590
 as I said 'it's their romance. 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.680
 begins to blossom after this 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.290
 imagine singing joint initiative is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.299
 many happy moments but julie is not 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.209
 It's all personal and it's not just julie. 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.609
 pain and the dna who wished it involved 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.430
 with the guy that there are still people know who 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.160
 It's during the history gives some tips 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.480
 hands we can not rush 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.180
 because I think there's a second book 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.200
 I'm not sure you're not sure. 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.829
 Anyway, we have to do it. 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.220
 Let's say sister of Julina's brother. 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.349
 creation and we have Jorge who is the best 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.239
 July friend that he is 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.099
 I think I arrived is relevant but also 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.980
 he is gay is the most functional thing 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:03.590
 That friend, that friend knows he is. 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.569
 for a lifetime it's george it's a lot 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.819
 I think the most jorge man than 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.769
 Most of the characters in the book 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.109
 he's funny and make a joke a lot 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.599
 very funny, it reminds me so much of mine 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.409
 friend but I'm not going to say one anyway 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.130
 it is worth checking the book of 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:21.200
 author 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.460
 It's always going to get you by the heart. 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.620
 of race 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.460
 It's there for the negatives, it 's like 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.580
 any book or some 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.350
 immature situations between the characters 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.420
 very immature but I believe it is 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.370
 because it is a novel that is understood 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.700
 that even the older characters 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.980
 suggests that the youth novel 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.770
 so I have some immature scenes 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.200
 but overall the book will convince what is 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.410
 very good and national authors have to 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.600
 to make room for reading on the shelf 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.490
 Of you I was only then thank you for 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.280
 I hope you like the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.210
 Rest crazy about yourself and thanks for 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.210
 dancing to
