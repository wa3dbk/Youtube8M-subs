00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.330
 but ended the ptb which was mostly 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.699
 positive 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.019
 talking fast hard guy released 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 I think I'm much better today. 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.469
 also quiet of the best good condition 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.510
 but he excluded boxing not only from kissing 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.200
 so I started choosing the package, come on. 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.420
 speak league justice movie week 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 the site super well informed batman on 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.750
 film commission 5 on the table 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 this week a batman on film site that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.219
 on a generally well-informed site 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 he did not say that the order would be with 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.800
 fear of investing in a film in the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.289
 justice person invest six million 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.960
 global box office promising him 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.960
 had symptoms of the time she is afraid of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.860
 make a movie in the movie market but 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 finally 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.610
 in addition to ending the possibility of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.540
 the characters in the movie with Batman and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:27.509
 superman and character look there because I 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.750
 I'm superman batman wonder woman are 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.530
 icons as it is to divide so much time of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.810
 screen and created know how and adolescence by 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.590
 example the truce dog will be i 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.750
 distributing the waiting time without 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.790
 to favor one or the other knows is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.070
 complicated I also think that this term 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.190
 is a ring of our family and until 2015 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.990
 it's been a long enough time to do 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.610
 a really good good movie that gave the day 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.960
 when it was struggling with is federal 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.850
 well advanced in the league for 2020 until then 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.229
 she could be doing a restart of the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.510
 Batman at the cinema 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.950
 lacking is strengthening this franchise 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.900
 superman that is starting now and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090
 introduce other characters plus one 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.000
 example of what the brand did with the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.880
 opinion the order is to invest heavily in 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.430
 superman on time and depending on the return 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.400
 who now leads woods there yes they will 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.170
 Think about the future of being a cinema looks 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.180
 I really wanted to see the end of the league that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.950
 Do not you want to think that I think 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.530
 complicated low malaysia power none 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.480
 fighting for I know there are ninja the problems 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.890
 but I like very hard in the league 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.920
 But there's no way we're doing. 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.790
 is today nor make the movie stella the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.560
 calm 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.320
 If you go to the studio to start 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.660
 your head a bit fertile from the link 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.330
 Then I prefer the little blueberry to 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.239
 seal to 2020 and 2040 or I do not know there in the year 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.800
 2000 that our mpb but that they adin 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.080
 but who does something well done by understanding 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.480
 who do things only because the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.690
 Rand is giving himself time, I'm the hero. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.630
 in quick movies is that the goal that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.930
 defeated this week I watched myself stay 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.090
 very happy to be there I thought the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.970
 episode that will be agitated to happen more 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.940
 thing in the end won nothing both brothers 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.920
 arranged to fight until the end in the arena and 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.450
 then I was a candidate and added a point 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 high was the moment the website was laughing at the idea 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.140
 of which was the pressure of our glory 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.610
 Darling, she appeared there as if 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.370
 It was now the bathroom at the time of 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.709
 prison the currency and I confess that I 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.870
 I had a crap that I expected even though 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.370
 finish an estate but a twitter 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.130
 Interesting person that this episode 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.380
 will not happen in the season scored 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.530
 audience record in the lyrics 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.170
 he had listened to millions 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.060
 watching viewers comes 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.560
 showing that neither good nor not even 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.990
 It was the pocket is for who now 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.200

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.690
 pop rangel these changes 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.540
