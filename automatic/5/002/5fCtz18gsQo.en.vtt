00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
after next Monday so that's that one's a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.429 
after next Monday so that's that one's a
little<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:07.619> further<00:01:07.860> away<00:01:07.950> um<00:01:09.439> another

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
little bit further away um another

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
little bit further away um another
question<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.310> people<00:01:11.460> had<00:01:11.729> about<00:01:11.939> patreon

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
question that people had about patreon

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.739 
question that people had about patreon
was<00:01:12.719> if<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.979> donate<00:01:14.579> more<00:01:14.880> money<00:01:14.909> does<00:01:15.539> that

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
was if you donate more money does that

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.289 
was if you donate more money does that
mean<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.490> chances<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:17.999> win

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
mean that you get more chances to win

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.469 
mean that you get more chances to win
and<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:19.499> might<00:01:20.249> I<00:01:20.429> might<00:01:20.490> try<00:01:20.999> it<00:01:21.060> something

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and I might I might try it something

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.910 
and I might I might try it something
like<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:21.990> future<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.619> right

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
like that in the future but for right

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.760 
like that in the future but for right
now<00:01:23.100> um<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:25.049> donate<00:01:25.439> anything

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
now um it's just if you donate anything

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580 
now um it's just if you donate anything
at<00:01:26.039> all<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.429> you<00:01:26.609> have<00:01:26.819> an<00:01:26.969> equal<00:01:27.420> chance<00:01:27.590> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
at all then you have an equal chance so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.910 
at all then you have an equal chance so
at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.639> moment<00:01:29.819> there's<00:01:30.270> 10<00:01:30.749> people<00:01:30.920> donated

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
at the moment there's 10 people donated

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.120 
at the moment there's 10 people donated
so<00:01:32.520> 10<00:01:33.060> people<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.929> one<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.560> those<00:01:34.709> 10

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
so 10 people one of one of those 10

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.359 
so 10 people one of one of those 10
people<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.819> going<00:01:36.359> to<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.569> the<00:01:36.840> UM<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.889> combo

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
people is going to get the UM the combo

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.569 
people is going to get the UM the combo
and<00:01:38.630> uh<00:01:39.630> that's<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.709> interesting<00:01:41.369> or

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and uh that's that's interesting or

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.519 
and uh that's that's interesting or
presumably<00:01:42.389> it<00:01:42.659> will<00:01:42.749> be<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.139> than<00:01:43.170> 10

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529 
presumably it will be more than 10

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:47.989 
presumably it will be more than 10
people<00:01:43.740> by<00:01:43.979> by<00:01:44.369> next<00:01:45.329> week<00:01:45.920> but<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.130> far<00:01:47.429> the

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
people by by next week but so far the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.870 
people by by next week but so far the
odds<00:01:48.179> are<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.869> ten<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.279> that's<00:01:50.549> like

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
odds are one in ten so that's like

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.300 
odds are one in ten so that's like
amazing<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.529> odds<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.889> getting<00:01:52.919> an

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
amazing because the odds of getting an

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.870 
amazing because the odds of getting an
unusual<00:01:53.969> is<00:01:54.209> like<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.409> 100<00:01:56.099> the<00:01:56.549> odds<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
unusual is like one in 100 the odds of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.389 
unusual is like one in 100 the odds of
getting<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.270> Australia<00:01:58.020> ms<00:01:58.289> like<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.889> 100

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
getting in Australia ms like one in 100

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.730 
getting in Australia ms like one in 100
