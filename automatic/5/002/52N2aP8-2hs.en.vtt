00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.130
 commandment you will not steal you have stolen something 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.850
 even if it's not once but you just 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.280

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.610

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.229
 you call someone who steals a thief 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.070

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.170
 adultery that's easy I've never cheated 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.190
 to my wife 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.190
 Hi handsome 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.009
 today, babe 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 Jesus said that if you see a woman with 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.720
 wish you have committed adultery with her in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.020
 your heart 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.300
 if one more you will not use the name of the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.190
 Lord your god in vain have you ever 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.600
 used the name of god without respect 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.479
 oh god trip 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.540
 That Mr. Good Don is called Blasphemy 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.170
 God has given you life and everything that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.710
 you have and you have not dragged by 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.009
 Don soils have admitted that you are good 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.500
 liar a thief a blasphemer and a 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.289
 adulterous of heart and they are only four of 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 the ten commandments yes yes I am not 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.270
 perfect indeed is worse than that 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 suppose we put a chip in your 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.680
 brain and that is taxing all your 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.510
 thoughts for a whole week and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
 then we put them on a screen 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.830
 giant so all your friends and 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.989
 relatives would see them would not be 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.940
 shameful the bible says that god knows 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.940
 everything including the thoughts 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.770
 secrets of your heart 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.640
 the moment 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.860
 compared to other people I am holy 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.840
 It is very true but the standard is the law 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.840
 of god and not other people 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.959
 also if he only sins five times 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.150
 day in a year will be 1825 sins if 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.120
 you reach 70 years 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.150
 you will have broken the law of God more than 127 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.220
 a thousand times 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.079
 you will have to account for every sin 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.079
 on the day of judgment that the bible 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.500
 says everyone will give accounts to god of himself 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.500
 same 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.770
 God will truly forgive me 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.350
 let's try that in court I know that I 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.670
 step breaking the law but good not 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.010
 could pass it to me this time only a judge 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.180
 corrupt would accept that a good judge 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.340
 I would say justice demands that you pay for 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.920
 your crimes 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.380
 God is not a corrupt judge he is a judge 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.380
 holy and just hate sin 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.180
 Jesus warned that on the day of judgment 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.030
 God will just take everyone who 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.819
 have sinned against him and will be thrown into 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.999
 a terrible place called hell 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.520
 and then how can someone go to 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:53.800
 sky there is only one way 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.290
 God loves the world so much that he sent his 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.290
 son jesus to live a perfect life 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.110
 after Jesus offered to take the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.410
 punishment of guilty sinners was 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.510
 whipped beaten and nailed to a cross 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.880
 died for your sins so that 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.760
 justice could be satisfied and so 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.950
 you will be released after jesus se 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.169
 rose from the grave and overcame death 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.870
 with good you can not make a living 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.000
 eternal is a gift from God for all 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.300
 those who humble themselves and come to Jesus 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.390
 He will forgive you and will give you a 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.420
 heart with new wishes the bible says 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.150
 if someone is in Christ is a new 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.810
 creature then stop living for you 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.030
 same 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.650
 turn your back on your sins and come to 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.290
 Jesus 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.720
 then read your bible and obey what 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.150
 leas find a church that will help you 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.710
