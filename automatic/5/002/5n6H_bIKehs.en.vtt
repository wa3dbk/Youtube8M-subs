 looking for teammates for dota 2 dota dr 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.130

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 hi with you and dilling and this is new 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.179
 release of reports from the bottom can far 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700
 fly projectile released tower 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.140
 being at the base of the enemy as playing 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.450
 for the war for denit yourself with 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 dome answers all these questions you 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 learn today's release of the report 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 from the bottom of a nice view 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.239
 we are the hero of the first feil stanislav people 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 Vitka he saved from zombies is played 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.010
 armed he saves the steppe from the pursuer 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 the clover distinguishes the armlet and dies from 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 lightning seriously as it happened at all 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.110
 and what kind of a cunning mug we have left 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.820
 below 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.230
 let's look at this tricky face 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 in slow motion 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 he just stands and peacefully farm creeps 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.409
 we have warner and runs past weak and he 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.090
 quietly dying of lightning which 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.820
 bounced off the mushrooms so far from 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 only zeus in give it to them wet but 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.939
 The second file begins with the fact that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 sinking slowly sneaking up on his 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.140
 the victims here are a sniper yet his pen 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.270
 starts to cast ults turns on 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.680
 the tower and seriously the horse at all happened 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.720
 but in order to figure it out 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 let's see a little replay with 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.870
 from a different angle and here it is all at once 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.540
 rest 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.430
 everything was clear his theme was wing and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.990
 far from the most direct abusive but it is still 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.130
 okay at least on king himself in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.550
 this moment was not ult bloodseeker'a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.050
 do you want something good in this moment 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.330
 but here it all starts with the fact that 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.460
 and oh and leshrac decide to go and pro 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.020
 pusha t you're not on the midpoint but the moment they are 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.130
 chosen not the most successful because 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.110
 at that very moment 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.820
 creeps sleep a little but how do you know 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 explosions and then small ones widely beat 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.900
 random target within a certain radius but 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.760
 This means that the majority of the explosion took 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.650
 on themselves creeps they towers end up there 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.180
 push he somehow was not very successful but if 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.950
 You think that I took this file because 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.230
 that they simply could not push the towers 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.360
 then you know me badly the thing is 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.400
 that when he returned to the base to 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.860
 the last one flew through it 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.200
 projectile from the very t3i now thanks 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.060
 the miracle of installation and slow motion 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.660
 you can see that last one 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.740
 projectile 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.570
 here he is no it is not he here you saw him 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.130
 there from the tower flew his danish come 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.960
 such on barefoot already discuss your 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.700
 union affairs there how they go into it 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.980
 sunday walk with their wives and 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.020
 then a projectile flies into it with 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.060
 the other end of the card here is this unexpected 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.070
 It seems like a lounger with my wife 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.630
 one and those 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.310
 but here we have a deduction decided to quit 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.959
 the jungle albeit pretty well farm and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.370
 stumbles upon a shaker decide to come back 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.770
 back but it's late to threesome 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 begin to drive began to rub the joker 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.610
 will he go but he rub the onions on 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.950
 no and puts the dome 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.410
 under which dies from the ball of satyr and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.730
 it seemed question 1 cube but let's 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.590
 take a look at all this a little under the other 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.760
 angle first check it out yes how much 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.739
 much he will be here now 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.690
 dodge one after the other 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.569
 passed two such good became still here 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.519
 rivers hello on him and when to 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.650
 you that it's all over he puts the dome and 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.540
 dying from satire so here if he didn't 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.760
 put bought then it would kill someone from 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.159
 opponents and so he kind of connected himself 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.139
 yourself using creep well chronosphere 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.819
 but the chronosphere is from to be breathed at the end 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.579
 ends him in the tavern another 30 seconds 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.170
 sit he could not use it but 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.420
 here is a file with mine without any sarcasm 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.159
 favorite manus he can 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.930
 pull off five and using them cook 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.250
 all of them cut here somehow in this 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.989
 the moment he could not pull 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.909
 You do not know anyone even once 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.620
 hard to blame him for this and now we 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.480
 see slow motion you can 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.669
 make sure that if he gave rp there where 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.319
 he ran and they fuck you pooja he could 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.180
 would pull off three and after that also 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.040
 people to roll their towers aside 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.930
 if you think this is the funny thing 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.319
 this moment you're wrong thing 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.969
 funny this is this well here actually 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.949
 everything and I hope you enjoyed it
