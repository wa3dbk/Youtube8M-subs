00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
of get an accurate measure I actually

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.440 
of get an accurate measure I actually
didn't<00:04:18.459> need<00:04:18.609> your<00:04:18.760> mate<00:04:18.910> here<00:04:19.150> because<00:04:19.390> I

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
didn't need your mate here because I

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.479 
didn't need your mate here because I

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
didn't know really like we're to start

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.340 
didn't know really like we're to start
it<00:04:21.609> from<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.300> wanted<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.660> get<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.900> accurate

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
it from and I wanted to get it accurate

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.680 
it from and I wanted to get it accurate
so<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.950> thought<00:04:24.430> wearing<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.790> same<00:04:25.000> thing<00:04:25.330> and

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
so I thought wearing the same thing and

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.060 
so I thought wearing the same thing and
just<00:04:25.720> kind<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.229> holding<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.620> down<00:04:26.830> and

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
just kind of holding it down and

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.560 
just kind of holding it down and
comparing<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.550> with<00:04:27.580> pictures<00:04:27.910> might<00:04:28.390> be<00:04:28.479> the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
comparing it with pictures might be the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:54.959 
comparing it with pictures might be the
best<00:04:28.720> way

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.989 

and<00:04:55.969> this<00:04:56.599> is<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.650> results<00:04:58.219> so<00:04:58.430> my<00:04:58.550> hair<00:04:58.759> comes
