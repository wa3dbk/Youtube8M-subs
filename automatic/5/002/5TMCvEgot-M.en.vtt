00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:03.860
 hello friends we're still here in the studio 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.270
 and you can let us do a microphone test 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.980
 because we want to find a good microphone a couple of good microphones 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.389
 to record with 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.389
 we have several options that we are going to be today 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.099
 we have the ground and bad 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.320
 of capacitor 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.810
 which is one of our favorites 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.279
 let's try also 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 the classic 57 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 the sms find seven of ciu 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.740
 57 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.140
 the goal 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.790
 and to finish 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.860
 let's try 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.490
 the tp52 which is also a special microphone 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.570
 for bass frequencies for affected bobos down 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.460
 the current processors harder to see how to respond 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.680
 clear and profound in terms of 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.220
 for 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.160
 range of frequencies and warmth the sound 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.070
 as we know the cost microphones are much more expensive warm and 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.110
 brilliant that one all dynamic balls and celebrated the polar pattern by 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.710
 example what 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.360
 which is the one that defines 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.430
 the area what your microphone is picking up can be 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.980
 let's say more open 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.880
 in a polar cardio pattern and is more closed in a cybele case 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.960
 Everybody has 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.620
 as 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.720
 as common 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.660
 it is off the axis 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.060
 and that will allow us to collect the same 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.730
 the same pointed uu very similar 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.880
 with about 4 weapons 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.679
 we go 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.520
 adapt with the shots 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.770
 at once 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.020
 of 50 r 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 which is one of those that I like the particular 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.200
 It has a very good reference for other 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 let's occupy it with work 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.980
 the illness 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.280
 in her 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.740
 the soul to the body 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.510
 they need 51 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.840
 try to preserve its essence 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.789
 it is essential primitive accuracy 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.189
 a minimum of one 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.969
 independent 1 jun 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:20.019
 we have not expected melchor rosemary and zintan not only the entire nation 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.969
 munilla mumbrú who has 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:31.230
 indicate for example the same month of 2009 m is new 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.120
 do not 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.170
 we do not see any case an important budget as good of the one of the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.759
 257 both the pp and the cement 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.759
 Muñoz does not pose any pressure 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.910
 mumbrú 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.910
 a cum 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.919
 do not 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.919
 do not 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.589
 min 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.559
 world 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.389
 the town is 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.649
 we capture end 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:28.909
 there is no sign brunel downer meets some thugs the monkeys 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.569
 less than a year 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.859
 1 - barcelona will not be accepted 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
 manning will not make concessions 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.329
 in malibu 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.490
 a Venezuelan 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.270
 the national coach does not learn the most sensitive organ 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.659
 núñez 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.669
 on the scoreboard and he got the goal 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.839
 the first times in less than half a century 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.939
 I love getting into the one of the 52 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.589
 nothing else 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.649
 muñoz cano 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:14.189
 but Argentina works together with the media hide San Lorenzo for 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.120
 buy products never everyone juan kills cause 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.409
 - as bruni 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.080
 the modules for the next season although it is not as sensitive as the pact 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.259
 current prime minister gordon brown condemned this last Friday a 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.499
 known as the extended abbreviated 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:35.649
 the huge delay of the larvae of operation 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.689
 good taste in portland 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.909
 it was also to make him more eager to eat on the other hand too 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.150
 the problem now this time a hit the inflation rate in 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.389
 germany in 2009 according to the government we trusted in summer all 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.180
 corners in a statement 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.430
 has a dozen 50 and 100 ml fades 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:08.189
 one of the objectives of the UN Millennium 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.539
 a goal and life in the media 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.539
 but but if the entities can not 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.139
 everything is a little 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.259
 a tour cut out the means 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.039
 you're in an Islamic micro, well, you have to give it 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.039
 considerable profits 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.990
 Well, it's that these people have to take care of it apart from the polar pattern 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.830
 sources that showed that it has to be 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.830
 I have placed the microphone there 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.099
 taking care of you 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.150
 nlg 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.430
 of the instrument 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.229
 passing the beta 57 we have to play a first time 1-1 min to tax the 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.610
 products do not meet long 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.400
 one 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.800
 prob 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:09.289
 an advisory group in vigo has left us in the province roo
