00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
they have from the factory now a lot of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.510 
they have from the factory now a lot of
times<00:00:51.960> those<00:00:52.230> things<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:53.100> welded

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
times those things are actually welded

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.639 
times those things are actually welded
in<00:00:53.640> place<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.690> customer<00:00:55.170> doesn't<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
in place and the customer doesn't get a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.340 
in place and the customer doesn't get a
chance<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.280> see<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.350> elongated

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
chance to see it because it's elongated

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
chance to see it because it's elongated
and<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.980> feel<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> two<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.940> half

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and they feel that it's a two and a half

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
and they feel that it's a two and a half
inch<00:01:00.420> straight<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.960> straight<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
inch straight in straight out but the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.390 
inch straight in straight out but the
problem<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.539> once<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.350> take<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
problem is is that once you do take that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.240 
problem is is that once you do take that
apart<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> cut<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> open<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.470> reveals

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
apart and cut it open it reveals

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
apart and cut it open it reveals
something<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:09.090> becomes<00:01:09.540> very<00:01:10.020> very

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
something that becomes very very

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.550 
something that becomes very very
surprising<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> people<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.049> this

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
surprising to a lot of people in this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
surprising to a lot of people in this
particular<00:01:14.100> case<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> c5<00:01:15.090> Corvette<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
particular case on a c5 Corvette you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
particular case on a c5 Corvette you
have<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> restriction<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.549> 5/8<00:01:18.000> inch<00:01:18.030> hole<00:01:18.509> on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
have a restriction of a 5/8 inch hole on

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.950 
have a restriction of a 5/8 inch hole on
each<00:01:18.900> side<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.490> causes<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.450> when

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
each side now what this causes is when

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.240 
each side now what this causes is when
you<00:01:22.140> put<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.880> free-flowing<00:01:23.880> exhaust<00:01:24.180> system<00:01:25.020> on

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
you put a free-flowing exhaust system on

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.399 
you put a free-flowing exhaust system on
you're<00:01:26.250> allowing<00:01:26.790> more<00:01:27.060> air<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.080> through

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you're allowing more air to get through

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
you're allowing more air to get through
more<00:01:28.710> exhaust<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.729> through<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.270> section

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
more exhaust to get through that section

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.530 
more exhaust to get through that section
and<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.860> actually<00:01:32.100> getting<00:01:32.579> caught<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.299> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and it is actually getting caught up in

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.700 
and it is actually getting caught up in
those<00:01:34.409> two<00:01:34.740> 5/8<00:01:35.340> inch<00:01:35.610> holes<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.530> should<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
those two 5/8 inch holes so should you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.370 
those two 5/8 inch holes so should you
have<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.310> manual<00:01:38.970> transmission<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.990> instance

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
have a manual transmission for instance

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
have a manual transmission for instance
and<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:41.280> shifting<00:01:41.970> or<00:01:42.150> you're

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and you're down shifting or you're

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
and you're down shifting or you're
breaking<00:01:42.750> erratically<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.619> tend<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> get

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
breaking erratically you tend to get

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.429 
breaking erratically you tend to get
more<00:01:44.520> popping<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.780> call<00:01:46.020> trail

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
more popping or what we call trail

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.010 
more popping or what we call trail

sound<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.220> downshift<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:51.119> break

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.260 
sound when you downshift or break
erratically<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.619> reason<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
erratically the reason for that is this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.109 
erratically the reason for that is this
and<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.290> what<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.649> try<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.880> try<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and so what we try to do is we try to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.719 
and so what we try to do is we try to
explain<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> people<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.890> advantageous

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
explain to people that it's advantageous

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.830 
explain to people that it's advantageous
for<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.659> open<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:02.040> flow<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.880> allow<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
for you to open up that flow and allow a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929 
for you to open up that flow and allow a
straighter<00:02:04.380> flow<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.920> exhaust<00:02:05.070> back<00:02:05.700> off

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
straighter flow of exhaust back off

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.059 
straighter flow of exhaust back off
those<00:02:06.390> catalytic<00:02:07.079> converters<00:02:07.590> by

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
those catalytic converters by

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.300 
those catalytic converters by
incorporating<00:02:08.550> an<00:02:09.239> x-pipe<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.039> take

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
incorporating an x-pipe and you can take

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.430 
incorporating an x-pipe and you can take
that<00:02:11.550> same<00:02:11.940> advantage<00:02:12.480> into

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that same advantage into

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.730 
that same advantage into
other<00:02:13.560> h-pipe<00:02:14.430> x-pipe<00:02:15.420> assemblies<00:02:16.320> down<00:02:16.590> the
