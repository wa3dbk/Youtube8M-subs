00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.820

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.289

 Well, it's not much, but I'm telling you 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.790
 This is for beginners 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.450
 when you buy a seed on the black market and you want to plant it first 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.940
 What you should do is give the seed to one of your kids but make sure that the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.500
 Chavo League won the swim competition 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.950
 otherwise it will only take the seed leave it on the floor and not stop 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.000
 nothing with him 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.880
 the second is for those who want to find things to put them in the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.550

 in the chaos gardens you can find things to put the kids in the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.860
 head you just have to choose a complex rouge note I think that should have it 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.120
 on the nail and it roars must have them pigna irs if they ask themselves why 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.430
 they serve they only serve to dig in the earth 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 they go to any garden they dig and they will find it and take it on time but 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.710
 will be worth 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.310
 in the normal garden and the celestial against the pumpkins and in the dark only 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.040
 you will find skulls 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.210
 the third is to find rare animals 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.840

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 found in a rare animal but they must take the things they contain 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.470
 is the key past the animals and the weird animal 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.629
 note the animals and the weak kids are separated by team 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.789
 this is the last one I know 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.159
 for those who want to unlock the other two gardens 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.040

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.289
 will unlock any of the two
