00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.959
 everybody knows kids and welcome 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.940
 today to this batman gameplay 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.410
 arkham origins one of the video games that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.450
 more than I expected this year 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.800
 indeed you have already discovered it in a 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.380
 previous video in which I said that 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.719
 batman was a game I wanted to play 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.310
 play since I've always lost myself 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.289
 previous titles and this time not 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.029
 I would have made the same mistake 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 and since I'm playing because I don't 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.949
 try a little gameplay and this 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.230
 Channel I like to be prince 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 variety variety in short I show you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.769
 all I play what I do 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.380
 like it and so here we are with a 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.730
 quiet batman gameplay 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.500
 now then with weak beats 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.050
 view a little more about that game 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 but in my opinion it also deserved a bit of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.960
 space this very serious video game 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 of a board games it seems to me dc comics 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 something goes well what are due the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.149
 our fast gameplay where it is addressed 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.770
 the first boss was not very difficult not 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 it wasn't even that easy because I lost 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.050
 two or three times wife or cut those 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.910
 moments however what to say up about batman 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.880
 I'm happy to have it this year 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.280
 tried to have it available with 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 in my estimate library to be able to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.570
 play when voted will be one of those 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 video games that being offline will be 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.040
 perfect for filling those voids I will have 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 in some of my days because 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.810
 empty in my days you know often 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.299
 I am in the condition in which I go 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 adopt a video on youtube and or the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.340
 busy band I can't play online 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.409
 and I need a game like 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.119
 this to go maybe to play 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.680
 quietly of launched then I could 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.930
 do or other more productive things than 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.540
 as my mother often suggests to me 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.570
 but why should he study though 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.189
 in short, from the boys to study to 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.750
 braida torto ie always makes me laugh 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.970
 when he tells me no actually right 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 however batman I like a nice play 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.899
 there is a nice game is not a play a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.430
 nice game and me 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.620
 therefore point I want to advise you 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.570
 here if among the 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.840
 all god they will come out if you had some 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.220
 I recommend this space 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.990
 version you are seeing of on this one 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.640
 perfect image and represents 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.210
 perfectly what i wanted to tell you is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.180
 a PC version and see the footprints 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.940
 for example on the snow you see the snow that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.330
 falls you see the smoke here is this here 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.610
 possible thanks to physics you know notch 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.260
 amd there is envy are good both 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.470
 video cards is not what I'm saying 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.370
 you have to buy that one though 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.170
 peculiarity of the nvidia cards is 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.530
 precisely the presence of the physics that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.450
 lets you save on some 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.370
 video games a little more for examples 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.810
 his sucking assassin creed I remember 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 if you walked in the snow there was if 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.310
 he went to make these footprints 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.980
 quite the same thing here 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.170
 here we see on batman batman act pits 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.850
 one of the video games for which me se 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.190
 a person asks me at least an example of 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.500
 physics i tell him batman batman and it is 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.990
 really the perfect example and therefore it 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.670
 also spends two words as mentioned above 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.880
 physics the footprints 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.010
 snow falling things that if deactivated 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.510
 physics or not using a card 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.370
 in purple they are not there 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.840
 having said this guys we will play 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.180
 great even with the card 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.180
 pizzighettone that I sell, that is I gods 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.100
 boys experiencing the pizzighettone card 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.070
 90 pizzighettone and 90 video card with i 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.209
 controcazzi however 5,000 euros taste well 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.860
 well so not the compact well I would say 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.180
 I know this video is a bit short 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.100
 guys I find I definitely do n't know 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.860
 not even what else to tell you sub ato but 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.050
 because a nice game 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.670
 very nice fights because 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.960
 however they are not easy I am 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.760
 playing and difficult and it's happening to me 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.650
 to die because I'm a saw 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.050
 for this perhaps it can also be the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.570
 explanation but it's nice because anyway 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.120
 in combat the enemies will continue 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.280
 what attacks you is not that they wait for that 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.390
 you make your comfortable and violent 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.740
 to you one at a time there are 45 enemies 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.630
 these 45 years can also 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.280
 sticking together and sometimes if not 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.459
 you have the right times 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.470
 die die die pressed and then a 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.570
 beautiful game was in a nutshell 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.940
 batman black mask batman stops 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.980
 black batman mask wins all happy 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.080
 and just happy 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.820
 in essence it is this perfect then 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.500
 guys i think this set after this 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.810
 video I hope you enjoyed a video 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.550
 very quiet with you I like 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.010
 as usual they are tied 90 if he had 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.790
 posted this video down there or a 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.220
 pollicino up click it lasciatene 1
