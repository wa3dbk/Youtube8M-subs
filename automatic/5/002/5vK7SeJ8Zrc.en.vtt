31<00:02:13.830> works<00:02:14.040> good<00:02:14.280> too<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.450> knife

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
31 works good too but if it's a knife

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.350 
31 works good too but if it's a knife
you're<00:02:15.930> going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.110> use<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.710> chop<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.580> food<00:02:17.940> or

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
whatnot I would recommend like mineral

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
whatnot I would recommend like mineral
oil<00:02:20.430> something<00:02:21.210> like<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:22.940> three<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
oil something like that but three and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.300 
oil something like that but three and
one<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.360> good<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.780> lubricate<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.530> cleans<00:02:26.010> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
one is good to lubricate it cleans it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.060 
one is good to lubricate it cleans it
prevents<00:02:26.850> rust<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.900> three<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.740> rim

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
