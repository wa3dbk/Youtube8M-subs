 luck there is always the messti site 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.240

 let's go for the 25000 pack 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.090
 guys we cross our fingers 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:37.580
 go go go go to the app basics 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.260
 84.2 general it's already not bad it's 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.549
 already not bad we will not complain we have 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.350
 also sirigu very good guardian 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.970
 frankly a very very strong on fifa 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.460
 ultimate team damage plus it costs 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.140
 nothing at all honestly I you 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.510
 advise to buy it and also there are 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.490
 who are a little mocked at me or who 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.869
 told me yeah you're igniting for nothing 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.700
 in your paws with no luck and everything 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.720
 nanani nanana I think that's where they 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.000
 do not understand that he does not necessarily know 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 the players with a high price that are 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.820
 good in the game and also players 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.320
 which cost 1000 credits which are very 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.180
 very good and that's why I say 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.100
 we have good players and it's a 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.239
 player who at 86 2 general they will me 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.000
 credit it can be a very good 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.220
 player and a player they use who 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 at 84 2 general like neymar and mailly se 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.580
 sells very expensive but it's also a good 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.100
 player I think some of the most 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.300
 the most mature will have understood this and 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.380
 then here is 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.750
 I hope everyone will understand 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.560
 henceforth I say as a parent 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.570
 good that when I say that is a good 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.620
 player is not necessarily worth it 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.510
 expensive but it is that it is good in the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.560
 game and if there is a very expensive cri player 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.300
 that I have in the pale in this case 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.760
 I say very dear players that I had 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.800
 finally, you'll understand why we're going 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.470
 directly continue with the mega pack 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.690
 mega pack to 35,000 credit that 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.070
 elements there are thirty elements forgiveness 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.810
 happened I was wrong I 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.520
 confused with the pack at 50000 so 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.180
 thirty elements guys go this is 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.630
 party we cross our fingers at the cabaye 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.500
 psg these means already frozen of sanctis 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.460
 as contracts are here you go on 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.900
 has no time to open the packs 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.650
 consumables since at the end we 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.530

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.050
 boots bac the bar and the very good 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.570
 cavailles player or in fact we are more 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.590
 duplicate than anything else so 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.700
 now you've seen we do not have in 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.690
 shadow and blades of consumables 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.540

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.209
