Marcy<00:01:10.439> said<00:01:10.770> her<00:01:11.189> she<00:01:11.850> really<00:01:12.119> got<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> idea

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
Marcy said her she really got the idea

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
Marcy said her she really got the idea
she<00:01:12.810> came<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> me<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.320> said<00:01:13.409> could<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> print

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
she came to me and said could you print

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.359 
she came to me and said could you print
photographs<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.240> fabric<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.009> said<00:01:17.189> well

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
photographs on fabric and I said well

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
photographs on fabric and I said well
I'm<00:01:17.549> sure<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.960> know<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:19.170> good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'm sure you can I don't know how good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.679 
I'm sure you can I don't know how good
they<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.759> worth<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> try

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
they would be but it's worth a try

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
they would be but it's worth a try
so<00:01:22.229> when<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.530> first<00:01:22.740> did<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.400> no

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so when we first did this there was no

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.899 
so when we first did this there was no
thought<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.830> product<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.430> realized

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
thought really of a product we realized

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.020 
thought really of a product we realized
that<00:01:27.030> there<00:01:27.390> are<00:01:27.420> lots<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.310> places<00:01:29.310> where<00:01:29.790> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that there are lots of places where it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.039 
that there are lots of places where it
could<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.600> very<00:01:31.229> valuable<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:33.049> hospital

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
could be very valuable and hospital
