braid<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.170> my<00:00:10.530> girls<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.190> love<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.059> dog

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.910 
braid on my girls I love this dog
because<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.750> relatively<00:00:13.200> quick<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.740> do

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
because it's relatively quick to do

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.680 
because it's relatively quick to do
because<00:00:14.429> there's<00:00:14.610> not<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.790> many<00:00:15.030> braids<00:00:15.420> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
because there's not that many braids and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.170 
because there's not that many braids and
it<00:00:16.590> lasts<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.190> while<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.640> last<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
it lasts for a while it can last up to a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.230 
it lasts for a while it can last up to a
couple<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> weeks<00:00:18.750> which<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.289> perfect<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.760> I

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
couple of weeks which is perfect so I

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.480 
couple of weeks which is perfect so I

soon<00:01:08.670> god<00:01:09.119> bless

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.700 

I've<00:01:34.060> learned<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.450> avoid<00:01:34.600> manipulating<00:01:35.560> my

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
I've learned to avoid manipulating my

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.800 
I've learned to avoid manipulating my
oldest<00:01:36.100> daughter's<00:01:36.430> hair<00:01:36.729> while<00:01:36.940> bone<00:01:37.150> dry

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
oldest daughter's hair while bone dry

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.870 
oldest daughter's hair while bone dry
so<00:01:38.290> I'm<00:01:38.409> lightly<00:01:38.890> misting<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.460> with<00:01:39.640> water

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
so I'm lightly misting it with water

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.930 
so I'm lightly misting it with water
this<00:01:40.810> makes<00:01:41.140> her<00:01:41.290> hair<00:01:41.500> pliable<00:01:42.190> less<00:01:42.610> likely

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
this makes her hair pliable less likely

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.080 
this makes her hair pliable less likely
to<00:01:43.090> break<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.659> loosens<00:01:44.200> tangles<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:45.090> then

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
to break and loosens tangles I then

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.660 
to break and loosens tangles I then
finger<00:01:46.570> part<00:01:46.840> her<00:01:47.050> hair<00:01:47.080> before<00:01:47.710> using<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.369> comb

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
finger part her hair before using a comb

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.490 
finger part her hair before using a comb
so<00:01:48.940> to<00:01:49.000> avoid<00:01:49.360> snagging<00:01:51.659> her<00:01:52.659> has<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.259> come

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
so to avoid snagging her has just come

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.590 
so to avoid snagging her has just come
out<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.710> an<00:01:54.009> African<00:01:54.490> threaded<00:01:54.820> style<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:55.420> it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
out of an African threaded style so it's

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.899 
out of an African threaded style so it's
stretched<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.290> dry<00:01:56.590> but<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.400> style<00:01:57.580> can<00:01:57.790> be

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
stretched and dry but this style can be

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.320 
stretched and dry but this style can be
done<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.330> wet<00:01:58.600> or<00:01:58.780> dry<00:01:58.900> hair<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.940> style<00:02:04.210> is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
done on wet or dry hair this style is

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.170 
done on wet or dry hair this style is
extremely<00:02:04.990> flexible<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.460> part<00:02:06.910> how

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
extremely flexible so you can part how

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.660 
extremely flexible so you can part how
you<00:02:07.240> choose<00:02:07.750> being<00:02:08.560> careful<00:02:09.100> not<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.310> go<00:02:09.610> too

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
you choose being careful not to go too

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.570 
you choose being careful not to go too
small<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.929> avoid<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.410> braid<00:02:11.650> coiling<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.370> and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
small to avoid the braid coiling up and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.479 
small to avoid the braid coiling up and
around<00:02:13.060> itself<00:02:13.480> I'm<00:02:14.380> going<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.860> part<00:02:15.160> her<00:02:15.250> hair

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
around itself I'm going to part her hair

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.990 
around itself I'm going to part her hair
into<00:02:16.030> four<00:02:16.540> horizontal<00:02:16.810> sections<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:18.040> separate

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
into four horizontal sections I separate

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.060 
into four horizontal sections I separate
the<00:02:19.120> front<00:02:19.390> section<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.050> tie<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.470> rest<00:02:20.860> out

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
the front section and tie the rest out

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.259 
the front section and tie the rest out
