00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 here 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.549
 Y 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.980
 very good everyone here you robot 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.170
 android and the other day uploaded a video 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.390
 how to make a hiding place in a book 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.570
 then a subscriber asked me if I could 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.970
 do it in mÃ¡laga then I have 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:27.410
 done as you see this is pulled 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.680
 and it's uncovered and here we have the boats 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.079
 with our money inside for is very 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.180
 very simple to do then I thought that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.600
 it would be much more difficult and good for 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.309
 close the placement attachments 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.970
 it costs a little more to close but it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.430
 look for the point and close 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.010
 and you do not notice anything at all so 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.540
 let's move on to construction well the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.460
 first step you will have to make will be 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.200
 get our can 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.120
 to put it on what we will do 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120
 spin this vale 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.840
 and we'll look at what part this 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.840
 for 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.620
 it is calculated worth more in the case where 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.230
 goes and now what we will do is with a 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.000
 needle and a hammer 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.000
 and we will tap 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.070
 ok is the little hole is there 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.150
 Now what we have to do will be 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.280
 with a glass go throwing the liquid and so 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.230
 during the whole time I when nobody 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.290
 has taken out all bus 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.780
 well we have this we have already emptied 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.370
 what we will do is plug the hole like this 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.310
 is not to be noticed later with a knife 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.990
 sharp what we will do will be going 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.080
 around here doing pressure but we 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.610
 you like it like that until a good time until 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.060
 that you notice that this stage is going to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.770
 lift well once we have it is already 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.769
 cut off fix 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.040
 for what we will do is take a boat 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.800
 in this case I have picked herbs 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.300
 Provencal when you species that enters 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.190
 pretty good just that you have to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.190
 cut it well that I up here up 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.280
 and this does not work for us because it does not 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.080
 good to close or to put the plug 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.760
 and production 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.730
 then what we have to do will be 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.910
 cut something like that you see this part below 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.910
 and cut it because I'm going to do it 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.569
 and we have it all 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.359
 this now would have to be secured and for 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.569
 to ensure what we will do will be to take a 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.569
 sheet 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.109
 I lose 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.680
 sometimes we are not sad but good 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.860
 bending them like this constructively until 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.740
 get something like that you can give it a 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.490
 return with dry and now what we will do 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.360
 will be to catch this center where 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.670
 we want 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.670
 go placing this like this 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.540
 and then with the help of scissors 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.600
 what we are going to do is go putting it 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.180
 until the point 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.580
 because that way everything will be tighter and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.390
 it will not move which is the intention of the 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.360
 paper that I will be placing several 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.100
 leaves and now we have already put several 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.200
 leaves and we have placed it so that it does not 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.110
 move what we will do to make it look good 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.670
 which is what I have done here then 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.550
 this is optional I have put here 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.340
 white plasticine you 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.739
 you can put anything else 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.739
 Let's see the plasticine I have here 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.949
 and the only thing I've done has been doing 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:26.120
 so I remove a roll and placing it by 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:30.949
 this part I'm going to do 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.690
 we have already put the the plasticine is 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.550
 there in depth of what seen in his can 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.710
 it seems very good but good what 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.960
 we will do will catch our glue and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.380
 in this case I am going to use this one that is 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.830
 a universal glue a bit strange 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.830
 but good 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.270
 you just have to put it all 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.520
 this part 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.370
 and then let it dry and what 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.970
 We will open a voucher once the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.580
 glue and you have put the lid what 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.050
 you will have to do is to apply pressure 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.810
 because that way it will stay better stuck me 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.770
 I'm going to hit it, I'm going to get it right and a 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.220
 Once our lid is dry 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.730
 the only thing left to do is the stem 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.460
 is that this costs to fit in 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.460
 roll to open and roll to close 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.419
 and good simply if you liked 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:31.550
 give a like comment favorites 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.249
 just tell them that if you have 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.039
 any recommendation is simply 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:39.349
 tell me how this is coolest us 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.139
 love because like that color of the ebro 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.699
 If you want to recommend something to me 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.649
 handicraft because it's actually the 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.199
 I did for a boy I think I already said it to 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.999
 principle I think I leave it in the 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:54.289
 previous video and said if I could do it 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:55.490
 today I tried to do it and well this 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.300
 is what has come out I hope you like it 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.639
 and it is and good in this I what I have 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.370
 fact has also been put of our 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.720
 part so that it does not take off and be more 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.330
 sure good 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.310
 simply that if you liked to give 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.310
 like and good come this roll
