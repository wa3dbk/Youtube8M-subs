COF<00:01:19.490> idea<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:20.000> what's<00:01:20.510> coming<00:01:20.750> up<00:01:20.930> that

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
COF idea of what's coming up that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.950 
COF idea of what's coming up that
temperature<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.070> about<00:01:22.790> 20<00:01:23.450> degrees<00:01:23.750> out

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
temperature is about 20 degrees out

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.510 
temperature is about 20 degrees out
today<00:01:24.729> so<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.450> gets<00:01:26.690> pretty<00:01:26.750> hot<00:01:26.960> in<00:01:27.170> there

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
today so it gets pretty hot in there

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.340 
today so it gets pretty hot in there
when<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.610> comes<00:01:28.790> out<00:01:28.970> as<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.180> furnace<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.930> is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
when it comes out as a furnace it is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.969 
when it comes out as a furnace it is
roughly<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.369> consistency<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.270> honey<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.740> they

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
roughly the consistency of honey so they

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.609 
roughly the consistency of honey so they
can<00:01:34.190> drip<00:01:35.090> at<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.390> top<00:01:35.600> on<00:01:35.930> like<00:01:36.380> they<00:01:36.560> were

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
can drip at the top on like they were

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.499 
can drip at the top on like they were
doing<00:01:37.040> what<00:01:37.250> was<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.550> question<00:01:37.700> Simon's<00:01:38.240> here

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
doing what was the question Simon's here

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.990 
doing what was the question Simon's here
the<00:01:39.380> attachment<00:01:40.100> point<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.670> width<00:01:40.850> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the attachment point for the width and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.640 
the attachment point for the width and
you'll<00:01:41.210> notice<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.780> little<00:01:42.200> bit<00:01:42.410> like<00:01:42.560> a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
you'll notice a little bit like a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.100 
you'll notice a little bit like a
Hershey<00:01:42.979> kiss<00:01:43.009> that's<00:01:44.000> because<00:01:44.390> they<00:01:44.570> flipped

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
Hershey kiss that's because they flipped

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.539 
Hershey kiss that's because they flipped
it<00:01:45.259> on<00:01:45.350> top<00:01:45.619> of<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.830> ball<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.340> folded<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:47.090> over

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.569 

so<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.570> orange<00:01:51.469> color<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.159> crystals

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
so the orange color of the crystals

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.910 
so the orange color of the crystals
because<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.240> really<00:01:53.539> hot<00:01:53.780> rather<00:01:54.439> than<00:01:54.770> that

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
because it's really hot rather than that

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.910 
because it's really hot rather than that
it<00:01:55.039> actually<00:01:55.429> contains<00:01:55.939> any<00:01:56.390> coloring<00:01:57.020> kind

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
it actually contains any coloring kind

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.140 
it actually contains any coloring kind
of<00:01:58.039> like<00:01:58.219> lava<00:01:58.520> coming<00:01:59.270> out<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.630> volcano

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.930 

they<00:02:02.810> they<00:02:03.530> take<00:02:03.740> out<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.950> small<00:02:04.160> gather<00:02:04.580> on<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
they they take out a small gather on the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.990 
they they take out a small gather on the
end<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.150> one<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.390> these<00:02:05.480> blowing<00:02:05.930> iron

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.760 

things<00:02:10.510> are<00:02:10.690> about<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:11.050> go<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.230> break<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.680> you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
things are about to go on break so you

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.050 
things are about to go on break so you
can't<00:02:11.950> really<00:02:12.100> see<00:02:12.340> what<00:02:12.490> they're<00:02:12.610> doing<00:02:12.850> but

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
can't really see what they're doing but

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.340 
can't really see what they're doing but
if<00:02:13.210> you'll<00:02:13.360> notice<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.930> back<00:02:14.080> there

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
if you'll notice in the back there

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.580 
if you'll notice in the back there
there's<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:15.010> rise<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.060> ends<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.750> long<00:02:17.110> irons

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
train they have to keep turning it so

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.600 
train they have to keep turning it so
