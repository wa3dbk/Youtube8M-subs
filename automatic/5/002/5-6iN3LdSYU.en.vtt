00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so now I'll talk about a number of

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.999 
so now I'll talk about a number of
considerations<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:04.110> ways<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.620> go<00:00:04.799> about

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
considerations and ways I go about

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.360 
considerations and ways I go about
planning<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.640> body<00:00:05.850> wings<00:00:07.010> basically<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
planning the body wings basically the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.250 
planning the body wings basically the
shape<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.940> good<00:00:09.120> ergonomic<00:00:09.719> guitar<00:00:10.050> has<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
shape of a good ergonomic guitar has a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.220 
shape of a good ergonomic guitar has a
lot<00:00:10.500> lot<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.460> do<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.179> how<00:00:12.360> Leo<00:00:12.599> fender<00:00:12.870> came

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
lot lot to do with how Leo fender came

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.320 
lot lot to do with how Leo fender came
up<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> early<00:00:14.160> 50s<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:14.940> he

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
up with it in the early 50s because he

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.040 
up with it in the early 50s because he
got<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.719> really<00:00:15.870> right<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.779> if

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
got it really right and so what what if

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.740 
got it really right and so what what if
you<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.130> too<00:00:20.340> far<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> silhouette<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you get too far out of the silhouette of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290 
you get too far out of the silhouette of
what<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> good<00:00:22.800> guitar<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.400> from<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.850> balance

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
what a good guitar is from a balance

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
what a good guitar is from a balance
from<00:00:24.539> putting<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.109> over<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.529> knee<00:00:25.710> from

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
from putting it over your knee from

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.230 
from putting it over your knee from
where<00:00:26.250> your<00:00:26.400> hands<00:00:26.820> go

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
where your hands go

where your hands go
guitar<00:00:27.660> players<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.710> it

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
guitar players are not going to like it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
guitar players are not going to like it
because<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.699> comfortable<00:00:30.150> guitar<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
because it's not a comfortable guitar to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.600 
because it's not a comfortable guitar to
hold<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.650> you're<00:00:31.830> always<00:00:31.980> trying<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
hold but you're always trying as a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.580 
hold but you're always trying as a
designer<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.420> make<00:00:33.450> something<00:00:33.989> look<00:00:34.110> unique

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
designer to make something look unique

designer to make something look unique
as<00:00:34.890> well<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> how<00:00:37.710> I've<00:00:37.890> chosen<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.520> do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
as well and and so how I've chosen to do

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.389 
as well and and so how I've chosen to do
it<00:00:38.700> I'll<00:00:39.180> illustrate<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> ways<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.710> can

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it I'll illustrate one of the ways I can

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.510 
it I'll illustrate one of the ways I can
take<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> board<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.620> heart<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.250> SAP

take a board this is a heart and SAP

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.990 
take a board this is a heart and SAP
cocobolo<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.780> got<00:00:45.989> extreme<00:00:46.730> contrast<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
cocobolo that's got extreme contrast in

cocobolo that's got extreme contrast in
the<00:00:48.120> patterning<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.980> I'll<00:00:49.980> take<00:00:50.190> another

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the patterning and I'll take another

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
the patterning and I'll take another
another<00:00:51.000> board<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.789> I<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.820> take<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
another board over here and I can take a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.310 
another board over here and I can take a
couple<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.780> silhouettes<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> use<00:00:55.920> often

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
couple of silhouettes that I use often

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
couple of silhouettes that I use often
that<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.680> basic<00:00:59.100> body<00:00:59.340> shape<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.600> can

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that are my basic body shape and I can

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.729 
that are my basic body shape and I can
set<00:01:01.079> them<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.270> all<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> sudden<00:01:03.710> your<00:01:04.710> mind

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
set them up and all a sudden your mind

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
set them up and all a sudden your mind
does<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> whole<00:01:05.489> different<00:01:05.850> thing<00:01:05.909> yes<00:01:06.540> it's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
does a whole different thing yes it's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.780 
does a whole different thing yes it's
still<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> leo<00:01:07.590> fender<00:01:07.890> shape<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
still the leo fender shape but it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
still the leo fender shape but it
doesn't<00:01:09.060> feel<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.590> are<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
doesn't feel like that at all you are so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.390 
doesn't feel like that at all you are so
aware<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> flow<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> grain

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
aware of the the flow in in the grain

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
aware of the the flow in in the grain
pattern<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.380> becomes<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.920> very

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
pattern that that it becomes a very

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.359 
pattern that that it becomes a very
different<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> unique<00:01:17.880> instrument<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.369> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
different and unique instrument and and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.550 
different and unique instrument and and
so<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> always<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.320> when

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
so I always go for that and when when

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
so I always go for that and when when
I'm<00:01:22.650> working<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> player<00:01:23.630> oftentimes<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
I'm working with a player oftentimes I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.149 
I'm working with a player oftentimes I
don't<00:01:24.990> meet<00:01:25.170> people<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.830> over<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
don't meet people there over the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.940 
don't meet people there over the
internet<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.820> will<00:01:27.060> take<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.689> mean<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.740> see

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
internet I will take I mean you can see

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.230 
internet I will take I mean you can see
that<00:01:28.979> set<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.850> could<00:01:30.270> slide<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.840> wood<00:01:31.140> down

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
that set up I could slide this wood down

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.920 
that set up I could slide this wood down
lower<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:34.670> come<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> very<00:01:36.360> different

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
lower and come up with a very different

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.660 
lower and come up with a very different
looking<00:01:38.540> setup<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.890> I'll<00:01:41.009> go<00:01:41.189> through<00:01:41.220> many

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
looking setup so I'll go through many

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.690 
looking setup so I'll go through many
different<00:01:41.939> kinds<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.600> setups<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:44.460> show

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
different kinds of setups to show

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
different kinds of setups to show
especially<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> pattern<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.770> where

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
especially on a pattern like this where

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.880 
especially on a pattern like this where
there's<00:01:47.369> strong<00:01:47.700> contrasts<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> wood<00:01:48.890> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
there's strong contrasts in the wood to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.460 
there's strong contrasts in the wood to
so<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.430> somebody<00:01:50.640> has<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> choice<00:01:51.329> as<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> how

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so that somebody has a choice as to how

are<00:02:12.480> four<00:02:12.810> orders

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
are four orders

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.559

that<00:02:14.010> I've<00:02:14.130> gone<00:02:14.310> through<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.730> process<00:02:15.000> with

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
that I've gone through this process with

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.520 
and cut out the the left and right wing
so<00:02:20.400> that's<00:02:20.640> that's<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.569> talking<00:02:22.050> about<00:02:22.260> the

so that's that's just talking about the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.309 
so that's that's just talking about the
tops<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.840> again<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.170> next<00:02:25.830> my<00:02:26.160> body

brow than maybe you know what to do with

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.620 
brow than maybe you know what to do with
but<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.280> couldn't<00:03:11.580> play<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:12.120> beautiful

music<00:03:12.989> with<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.200> bass<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.880> nice

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
music with that bass so this is a nice

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.039 
music with that bass so this is a nice
mellowing<00:03:15.840> wood<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:17.420> I've<00:03:18.420> got<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.780> growl

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
mellowing wood and I've got the growl

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.710 
mellowing wood and I've got the growl
and<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.579> maple<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.060> top<00:03:21.359> adds

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
and then the maple on top adds

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.050 
and then the maple on top adds
brightness<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:23.040> particular<00:03:23.220> base<00:03:23.790> is

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
brightness so this particular base is

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.970 
brightness so this particular base is
going<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> be<00:03:24.359> one<00:03:25.290> that's<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> cover

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
going to be one that's going to cover

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.180 
going to be one that's going to cover
the<00:03:26.190> whole<00:03:26.220> spectrum<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:27.030> tone<00:03:27.950> from<00:03:28.950> very

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the whole spectrum of tone from very

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.690 
the whole spectrum of tone from very
bright<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.819> very<00:03:30.060> low<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.870> very<00:03:31.079> mellow<00:03:31.700> so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
bright to very low to very mellow so

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.880 
bright to very low to very mellow so
I've<00:03:33.030> got<00:03:33.420> these<00:03:33.660> I'm<00:03:34.049> going<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.380> glue<00:03:34.650> them

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
I've got these I'm going to glue them

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.030 
I've got these I'm going to glue them
together<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.579> we're<00:03:35.730> going<00:03:35.819> to<00:03:35.880> jump<00:03:36.150> ahead

together so we're going to jump ahead

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.490 
together so we're going to jump ahead
here<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.220> another<00:03:38.850> one<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.540> now<00:03:40.230> all

controls<00:03:50.130> are<00:03:50.910> going<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.209> go<00:03:51.389> I<00:03:51.420> have<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.690> nice

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
controls are going to go I have a nice

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.110 
controls are going to go I have a nice
arc<00:03:52.290> here<00:03:52.739> where<00:03:53.459> I'm<00:03:53.579> going<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.819> put<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
arc here where I'm going to put the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.379 
arc here where I'm going to put the
knobs<00:03:54.380> six<00:03:55.380> knobs

once<00:03:57.389> again<00:03:57.569> I'm<00:03:57.870> referring<00:03:58.019> right<00:03:58.530> back<00:03:58.739> to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
once again I'm referring right back to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.259 
once again I'm referring right back to
my<00:03:59.040> drawing<00:03:59.370> and<00:04:00.980> as<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.280> see<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:03.000> all

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
my drawing and as you can see it's all

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.099 
my drawing and as you can see it's all
just<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.870> squared<00:04:04.440> shape<00:04:04.769> at<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.190> point<00:04:06.109> so

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
just a squared shape at this point so

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.349 
just a squared shape at this point so
the<00:04:07.260> next<00:04:07.470> thing<00:04:07.709> I'm<00:04:07.829> going<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.040> do<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.609> round

the next thing I'm going to do is round

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.000 
the next thing I'm going to do is round
and<00:04:09.810> shape<00:04:10.530> shape<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.400> wings<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:12.709> by<00:04:13.709> magic

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
and shape shape the wings and by magic

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.550 
and shape shape the wings and by magic
it<00:04:14.370> turned<00:04:14.579> into<00:04:14.790> walnut<00:04:15.380> because<00:04:16.380> that's

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
it turned into walnut because that's

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.490 
it turned into walnut because that's
what<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.010> show<00:04:17.340> next<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.079> all

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
what I have to show next but this is all

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.050 
what I have to show next but this is all
been<00:04:20.489> shaped<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:21.329> bandsaw<00:04:22.289> with<00:04:23.099> my<00:04:23.430> rasps

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
been shaped with bandsaw with my rasps

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.420 
been shaped with bandsaw with my rasps
and<00:04:24.300> with<00:04:24.599> multiple<00:04:25.200> passes<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.860> finer<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
and with multiple passes on finer and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.499 
and with multiple passes on finer and
finer

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
finer

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.550 
finer
so<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:29.330> so<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.479> I<00:04:30.509> have<00:04:30.750> all<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> contours

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
so that so that I have all the contours

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.600 
so that so that I have all the contours
that<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.830> want<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:34.320> I've<00:04:34.979> done<00:04:35.280> all<00:04:35.550> of

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
that I want and and I've done all of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.490 
that I want and and I've done all of
this<00:04:35.910> before<00:04:36.360> gluing<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.870> on<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.289> neck

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
this before gluing it on to the neck

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.400 
this before gluing it on to the neck
because<00:04:37.770> again<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.310> can<00:04:38.639> get<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.120> all<00:04:39.479> of<00:04:40.080> the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
because again I can get to all of the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.480 
because again I can get to all of the
all<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:41.370> shape<00:04:41.729> this<00:04:41.970> way<00:04:42.240> easily<00:04:43.490> this

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
all of the shape this way easily this

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.370 
all of the shape this way easily this
happens<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.090> be<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.240> six<00:04:45.570> string<00:04:45.840> neck<00:04:46.139> we're

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
happens to be a six string neck we're

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.320 
happens to be a six string neck we're
not<00:04:46.500> going<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.710> worry<00:04:46.889> about<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:48.090> for

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
not going to worry about that but for

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.050 
not going to worry about that but for
the<00:04:48.479> sake<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:48.930> illustration<00:04:49.580> here's<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.669> shaped

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
the sake of illustration here's a shaped

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.480 
the sake of illustration here's a shaped
neck<00:04:51.630> that's<00:04:51.990> gone<00:04:52.650> as<00:04:52.860> far<00:04:53.070> as<00:04:53.190> I'm<00:04:53.310> going<00:04:53.430> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
neck that's gone as far as I'm going to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.670 
neck that's gone as far as I'm going to
take<00:04:53.729> it<00:04:53.970> before<00:04:54.330> gluing<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.050> together<00:04:55.229> I've

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
take it before gluing it together I've

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.719 
take it before gluing it together I've
got<00:04:56.340> my<00:04:56.520> wings<00:04:56.759> I<00:04:57.470> can<00:04:58.470> set<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:58.949> down<00:04:59.250> on<00:04:59.310> my

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
got my wings I can set this down on my

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.520 
got my wings I can set this down on my
pattern<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:02.030> basically<00:05:03.030> there's<00:05:03.449> there's<00:05:04.289> my

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
pattern and basically there's there's my

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.370 
pattern and basically there's there's my
body<00:05:04.800> shape<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.490> that's<00:05:06.270> always<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.780> magic

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
body shape and that's always a magic

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.230 
body shape and that's always a magic
point<00:05:07.650> when<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.949> glue<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.699> body<00:05:08.910> wings

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
point when you glue the body wings

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.510 
point when you glue the body wings
finally<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> neck<00:05:10.169> for<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.130> first<00:05:11.310> time

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
finally to the neck for the first time

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.159 
finally to the neck for the first time
you<00:05:11.669> can<00:05:11.820> really<00:05:12.060> believe<00:05:12.210> oh<00:05:12.570> it's<00:05:12.780> not<00:05:12.900> just

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
you can really believe oh it's not just

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.140 
you can really believe oh it's not just
components<00:05:13.830> I'm<00:05:13.949> actually<00:05:14.160> making<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.760> guitar

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
components I'm actually making a guitar

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.320 
components I'm actually making a guitar
here<00:05:15.590> but<00:05:16.590> let<00:05:16.919> me<00:05:17.039> flip<00:05:17.340> this<00:05:17.550> over<00:05:17.820> and<00:05:18.060> show

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
here but let me flip this over and show

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.260 
here but let me flip this over and show
to<00:05:19.199> show<00:05:19.349> you<00:05:19.410> something<00:05:19.949> that's<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.430> critical

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
to show you something that's a critical

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.100 
to show you something that's a critical
thing<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:22.860> is<00:05:23.070> when<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.610> shape<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.300> neck

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
thing and that is when I shape the neck

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.370 
thing and that is when I shape the neck
I<00:05:25.139> can<00:05:25.620> only<00:05:25.710> shape<00:05:26.099> it<00:05:26.280> up<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:26.880> far<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.449> same

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
I can only shape it up so far and same

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.469 
I can only shape it up so far and same
with<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.680> wings<00:05:28.919> there's<00:05:29.880> going<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.240> be<00:05:30.330> a

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
with the wings there's going to be a

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.850 
with the wings there's going to be a
transition<00:05:30.960> that<00:05:31.770> will<00:05:32.310> happen<00:05:32.580> right<00:05:33.270> here

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
transition that will happen right here

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.260 
transition that will happen right here
because<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.039> one<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.520> real<00:05:35.789> beauties<00:05:36.240> of

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
because the one of the real beauties of

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.000 
because the one of the real beauties of
a<00:05:36.510> neck<00:05:36.720> through<00:05:36.990> bass<00:05:37.260> is<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.740> you<00:05:37.830> don't

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
a neck through bass is that you don't

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.700 
a neck through bass is that you don't
need<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.250> heel<00:05:38.699> here<00:05:39.120> there's<00:05:39.510> no<00:05:39.720> you<00:05:40.530> don't

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
need a heel here there's no you don't

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.560 
need a heel here there's no you don't
have<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:40.979> area<00:05:41.190> like<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.520> bolt<00:05:41.849> on<00:05:42.060> where<00:05:42.389> the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
have that area like a bolt on where the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.800 
have that area like a bolt on where the
bolts<00:05:42.870> have<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.460> to<00:05:44.460> go<00:05:44.639> here<00:05:44.970> so<00:05:45.539> when<00:05:45.780> you

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
bolts have to to go here so when you

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.710 
bolts have to to go here so when you
come<00:05:45.930> up<00:05:46.260> to<00:05:46.289> the<00:05:46.500> 24th<00:05:47.010> fret<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:47.669> can<00:05:48.360> really

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
come up to the 24th fret I can really

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.000 
come up to the 24th fret I can really
shape<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:50.580> body<00:05:50.849> very<00:05:51.599> deeply<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:52.949> that<00:05:53.220> I

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
shape the the body very deeply so that I

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.129 
shape the the body very deeply so that I
there's<00:05:56.010> there's<00:05:56.370> no<00:05:56.669> you<00:05:57.180> as<00:05:57.599> you<00:05:57.750> go<00:05:57.900> up<00:05:57.960> the

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
there's there's no you as you go up the

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.110 
there's there's no you as you go up the
neck<00:05:58.349> and<00:05:58.380> you're<00:05:58.650> up<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:58.949> 24th<00:05:59.460> fret<00:05:59.760> your

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
neck and you're up to the 24th fret your

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.560 
neck and you're up to the 24th fret your
hand<00:06:00.389> doesn't<00:06:00.659> bump<00:06:01.380> into<00:06:01.860> this<00:06:02.550> heel<00:06:03.000> so

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
hand doesn't bump into this heel so

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.170 
hand doesn't bump into this heel so
after<00:06:03.870> this<00:06:03.990> is<00:06:04.050> glued<00:06:04.470> together<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:05.190> draw<00:06:05.880> a

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
after this is glued together I draw a

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.500 
after this is glued together I draw a
line<00:06:06.750> and<00:06:07.080> I<00:06:07.199> do<00:06:07.260> a<00:06:07.380> lot<00:06:07.680> more<00:06:07.710> work<00:06:08.389> taking<00:06:09.389> off

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
line and I do a lot more work taking off

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.219 
line and I do a lot more work taking off
a<00:06:09.539> lot<00:06:09.810> more<00:06:09.840> material<00:06:10.560> in<00:06:10.770> this<00:06:10.919> area<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:12.229> let

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
a lot more material in this area and let

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.850 
a lot more material in this area and let
me<00:06:13.289> go<00:06:13.440> grab<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:14.010> base<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:14.729> I'll<00:06:15.060> show<00:06:15.780> you<00:06:15.860> what

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
me go grab a base and I'll show you what

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.490 
me go grab a base and I'll show you what
that<00:06:17.039> transition<00:06:17.520> looks<00:06:17.880> like<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:18.300> say<00:06:18.539> this

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
that transition looks like to say this

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.770 
that transition looks like to say this
particular<00:06:20.130> base<00:06:20.340> is<00:06:20.639> at<00:06:20.789> a<00:06:20.820> point<00:06:21.060> where<00:06:21.419> all

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
particular base is at a point where all

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.870 
particular base is at a point where all
glued<00:06:22.710> together<00:06:22.919> and<00:06:23.930> on<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.199> back<00:06:25.440> I<00:06:25.880> have

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
glued together and on the back I have

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.689 
glued together and on the back I have
drawn<00:06:27.659> a<00:06:27.690> a<00:06:28.050> pencil<00:06:28.590> line<00:06:28.770> around<00:06:29.099> here<00:06:29.520> and

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
drawn a a pencil line around here and

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.879 
drawn a a pencil line around here and
then<00:06:29.849> I've<00:06:30.000> really<00:06:30.449> scalloped<00:06:31.080> you<00:06:31.530> can<00:06:31.680> see

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
then I've really scalloped you can see

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.779 
then I've really scalloped you can see
there's<00:06:32.159> no<00:06:32.340> chunk<00:06:33.000> right<00:06:33.360> there<00:06:33.419> I've<00:06:34.139> really

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 
there's no chunk right there I've really

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.279 
there's no chunk right there I've really
pulled<00:06:35.789> away<00:06:35.940> a<00:06:36.090> lot<00:06:36.360> of<00:06:36.389> material<00:06:36.960> on<00:06:37.110> these

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
pulled away a lot of material on these

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.190 
pulled away a lot of material on these
wings<00:06:37.590> as<00:06:37.919> well<00:06:37.950> and

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
wings as well and

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.260 
wings as well and
and<00:06:39.380> pulled<00:06:40.040> it<00:06:40.160> back<00:06:40.340> so<00:06:40.640> that<00:06:40.790> it's<00:06:40.940> a<00:06:41.030> very

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
and pulled it back so that it's a very

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.100 
and pulled it back so that it's a very
smooth<00:06:41.750> transition<00:06:42.410> into<00:06:43.220> the<00:06:44.090> into<00:06:44.810> the<00:06:44.900> body

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
smooth transition into the into the body

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.830 
smooth transition into the into the body
of<00:06:45.230> the<00:06:45.320> guitar<00:06:45.520> so<00:06:46.520> now<00:06:46.700> when<00:06:47.060> I<00:06:47.090> when<00:06:47.510> I<00:06:47.540> go<00:06:47.780> to

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
of the guitar so now when I when I go to

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.430 
of the guitar so now when I when I go to
play<00:06:48.520> here's<00:06:49.520> the<00:06:49.700> 24th<00:06:50.240> fret<00:06:50.540> I<00:06:50.780> can<00:06:51.080> go<00:06:51.230> right

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
play here's the 24th fret I can go right

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.820 
play here's the 24th fret I can go right
up<00:06:51.620> to<00:06:51.770> the<00:06:51.860> top<00:06:52.040> very<00:06:52.340> cleanly<00:06:52.760> and<00:06:53.060> easily<00:06:53.830> my

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
up to the top very cleanly and easily my

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.510 
up to the top very cleanly and easily my
thumb<00:06:55.130> just<00:06:55.430> glides<00:06:55.790> right<00:06:55.970> along<00:06:56.390> and<00:06:57.520> it

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
thumb just glides right along and it

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.580 
thumb just glides right along and it
really<00:06:58.820> it<00:06:59.150> feels<00:06:59.420> seamless<00:07:00.020> there's<00:07:00.350> no

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
really it feels seamless there's no

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.560 
really it feels seamless there's no
there's<00:07:01.220> no<00:07:01.310> problem<00:07:01.760> going<00:07:01.940> up<00:07:02.090> high<00:07:02.300> on<00:07:02.330> the

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
there's no problem going up high on the

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.970 
there's no problem going up high on the
neck<00:07:03.370> another<00:07:04.370> thing<00:07:04.700> that<00:07:04.850> I<00:07:04.880> do<00:07:05.030> also<00:07:05.710> is<00:07:06.710> I

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
but for the most part I use really

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.070 
but for the most part I use really
beautiful<00:07:24.410> woods<00:07:25.220> and<00:07:25.640> people<00:07:26.480> don't<00:07:26.810> want<00:07:26.990> to

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490 
mess with the grain pattern you just

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.640 
mess with the grain pattern you just
rather<00:07:28.970> have<00:07:29.210> it<00:07:29.330> be<00:07:29.360> a<00:07:29.510> clean<00:07:29.930> surface<00:07:30.200> and

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650 
rather have it be a clean surface and

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.530 
rather have it be a clean surface and
all<00:07:31.370> your<00:07:31.610> reference<00:07:32.060> is<00:07:32.240> on<00:07:32.270> the<00:07:32.540> edge<00:07:32.660> anyway
