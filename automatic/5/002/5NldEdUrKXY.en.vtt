maybe this won't be your favorite

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.979 
maybe this won't be your favorite
because<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.609> think<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.209> when<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.600> flavor<00:03:45.840> of

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
because I think that when the flavor of

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.110 
because I think that when the flavor of
this<00:03:46.109> is<00:03:46.230> at<00:03:46.350> its<00:03:46.470> best<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.160> texture<00:03:47.790> becomes

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
this is at its best the texture becomes

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.440 
this is at its best the texture becomes
slightly<00:03:48.390> melting<00:03:49.820> some<00:03:50.820> people<00:03:51.030> would<00:03:51.150> call

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
slightly melting some people would call

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.180 
slightly melting some people would call
it<00:03:51.600> soft<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.530> really<00:03:52.799> an<00:03:52.859> apple<00:03:53.070> that

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
it soft it's not really an apple that

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.560 
it soft it's not really an apple that
goes<00:03:53.310> soft<00:03:53.640> but<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.850> does<00:03:53.940> develop<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.329> slightly

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
goes soft but it does develop a slightly

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.789 
goes soft but it does develop a slightly
melting<00:03:55.170> firm<00:03:56.010> rather<00:03:56.700> than<00:03:56.880> hard<00:03:57.180> texture<00:03:58.019> so

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
melting firm rather than hard texture so

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.920 
melting firm rather than hard texture so
