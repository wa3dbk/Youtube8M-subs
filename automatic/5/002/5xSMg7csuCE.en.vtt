00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
bath so in this case we we did the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.399 
bath so in this case we we did the
store-bought<00:01:16.790> canned<00:01:17.790> asparagus<00:01:18.180> tips<00:01:18.869> so

store-bought canned asparagus tips so

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
store-bought canned asparagus tips so
this<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.799> our<00:01:19.950> first<00:01:20.189> step<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:26.150> right<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this is our first step and right here I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:40.170 
this is our first step and right here I
have<00:01:28.560> added<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.220> cup<00:01:30.049> of<00:01:31.049> asparagus

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.730 

I'm<00:01:41.180> gonna<00:01:41.660> give<00:01:41.900> this<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.170> nice<00:01:42.350> whisk<00:01:44.680> now<00:01:45.680> we

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
I'm gonna give this a nice whisk now we

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.219 
I'm gonna give this a nice whisk now we
can<00:01:46.070> turn<00:01:46.670> our<00:01:46.910> heat<00:01:47.360> down<00:01:47.420> really<00:01:47.990> low<00:01:48.200> on

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
can turn our heat down really low on

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.890 
can turn our heat down really low on
this<00:01:48.760> because<00:01:49.760> our<00:01:50.090> cream<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.479> already

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
this because our cream is already

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.450 
this because our cream is already
reduced<00:01:51.260> down<00:01:53.619> at<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.710> same<00:01:54.950> time<00:01:55.250> we're

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
reduced down at the same time we're

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.600 
reduced down at the same time we're
gonna<00:01:55.550> shut<00:01:55.910> our<00:01:56.030> grits<00:01:56.330> off<00:01:56.570> as<00:01:56.780> well<00:02:00.610> next

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
gonna shut our grits off as well next

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.800 
gonna shut our grits off as well next
we're<00:02:01.729> going<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.910> be<00:02:02.000> adding<00:02:02.210> our<00:02:02.479> cherry
