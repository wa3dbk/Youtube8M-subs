because the things you're fighting or
between<00:00:39.739> levels<00:00:40.250> 0<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:41.480> 6<00:00:42.379> pretty<00:00:42.860> much

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
between levels 0 and 6 pretty much

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.340 
between levels 0 and 6 pretty much
there's<00:00:43.670> like<00:00:44.180> one<00:00:44.449> or<00:00:44.600> two<00:00:44.629> that's<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.260> level

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
there's like one or two that's a level

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.860 
there's like one or two that's a level
11<00:00:45.890> it'll<00:00:46.370> be<00:00:46.489> like<00:00:46.729> the<00:00:46.760> Mantid<00:00:47.330> queen<00:00:47.659> or

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
11 it'll be like the Mantid queen or

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.060 
11 it'll be like the Mantid queen or
whatever<00:00:47.960> but<00:00:48.400> all<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.210> monk<00:00:51.070> with

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
whatever but all it is is a monk with

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.420 
whatever but all it is is a monk with
very<00:00:52.670> terrible<00:00:53.210> self-healing<00:00:53.750> so<00:00:54.500> it'll<00:00:55.280> go

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
very terrible self-healing so it'll go

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.930 
very terrible self-healing so it'll go
down<00:00:55.510> pretty<00:00:56.510> easily<00:00:56.949> like<00:00:57.949> even<00:00:58.309> if<00:00:58.640> all<00:00:58.790> you

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
down pretty easily like even if all you

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.719 
down pretty easily like even if all you
do<00:00:59.089> is<00:00:59.199> chunk<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.290> spear<00:01:00.559> at<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.769> in<00:01:01.010> my<00:01:01.159> case<00:01:01.460> or

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
do is chunk a spear at it in my case or

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.360 
do is chunk a spear at it in my case or
auto<00:01:02.420> attack<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:03.110> with<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.350> sword<00:01:03.680> or<00:01:03.860> something

auto attack it with a sword or something

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.130 
auto attack it with a sword or something
uh<00:01:05.440> but<00:01:06.440> bringing<00:01:07.010> skills<00:01:07.659> definitely<00:01:08.659> speeds

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
uh but bringing skills definitely speeds

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.920 
uh but bringing skills definitely speeds
up<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.440> forms<00:01:09.830> surprise<00:01:10.400> surprise<00:01:10.750> who<00:01:11.750> would

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
up the forms surprise surprise who would

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.450 
up the forms surprise surprise who would
have<00:01:11.990> thought<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.290> if<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:12.650> have<00:01:12.799> skills<00:01:13.220> on

have thought that if you have skills on

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.890 
have thought that if you have skills on
your<00:01:13.610> skill<00:01:13.880> bar<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.299> would<00:01:14.450> make<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.750> go

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
your skill bar it would make it go

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.520 
your skill bar it would make it go
faster<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.530> game-changing

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
faster this is a game-changing

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.859 
faster this is a game-changing

bring skills on your skill bar uh maybe
11<00:01:25.490> self-heal<00:01:26.090> skill<00:01:26.799> just<00:01:27.799> in<00:01:27.920> case<00:01:28.039> you<00:01:28.189> can

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
11 self-heal skill just in case you can

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.469 
11 self-heal skill just in case you can
do<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.520> bind<00:01:28.909> because<00:01:29.270> uh<00:01:30.850> well<00:01:31.850> occasionally

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
do a bind because uh well occasionally

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.319 
do a bind because uh well occasionally
groups<00:01:33.200> drop<00:01:33.590> down<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.280> you'll<00:01:34.549> over<00:01:34.850> aggro

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
groups drop down and you'll over aggro

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.730 
groups drop down and you'll over aggro
and<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:36.259> not<00:01:36.409> like<00:01:36.530> you'll<00:01:36.770> die<00:01:37.179> but<00:01:38.740> having

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
a self heal around doesn't cut down on

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.499 
a self heal around doesn't cut down on
the<00:01:43.009> time<00:01:43.039> between<00:01:43.399> waiting<00:01:44.060> between<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
the time between waiting between the

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
run through a little bit faster the

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.660 
run through a little bit faster the
entire<00:02:06.319> run<00:02:06.590> by<00:02:06.770> itself<00:02:07.069> even<00:02:07.399> if<00:02:07.549> you're

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
entire run by itself even if you're

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.059 
entire run by itself even if you're
doing<00:02:07.999> as<00:02:08.210> slow<00:02:08.509> as<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.720> farm<00:02:09.020> as<00:02:09.200> me<00:02:09.440> using<00:02:09.950> my

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
doing as slow as a farm as me using my

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.930 
doing as slow as a farm as me using my
paragon<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.850> like<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:12.280> four-minute<00:02:13.280> farm<00:02:13.610> at

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
paragon is like a four-minute farm at

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.530 
paragon is like a four-minute farm at
most<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:16.430> not<00:02:16.520> really<00:02:16.760> anything<00:02:16.880> oh<00:02:17.180> look

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
most so it's not really anything oh look

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.970 
most so it's not really anything oh look
