00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.389
Hi, we're here at Presqu'ile Provincial Park
and I'm with Dave, and we're in the marsh.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.900
Things are going to get a little mucky. But
very cool...

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.650
So here we are at the Presqu'ile marsh and
this is one of the coolest spots, and some

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.699
would say the coolest spot, at Presqu'ile.
Yeah, it looks great! And not only is it just

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.859
a beautiful place to walk through, it's full
of really cool creatures. And I thought since

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.010
we're dressed for the occasion, we'd go in
with our nets. Yeah, this is yours. How come

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.300
I get -why do I get a little pink one? Well,
you're a rookie, I didn't want you to hurt

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.620
yourself or anything.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.239
Now of course you don't have to wade in the
water to enjoy our marsh. We do have an 800-metre

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
boardwalk that goes through the marsh so people
can come and experience it without getting

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.050
their feet wet. But sometimes it's fun with
the kids and the adults just to see what you

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.329
can find when you scoop through the water.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.750
One of the best things about the park of course
is our bird migration. Easily in the spring

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.790
we'll see well over 100 species --probably
close to 200 species of birds will be coming

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.880
through here. So 100 different species? So
this is like a birder's paradise here. Easy,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.290
easy. You can see 100 different species in
a day some days. So yeah, it's a birders paradise.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
And people come in May, people come all year
around to see birds, because different times

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.930
of year, different birds, but May is my personal
favourite time of the year because that's

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.150
when the birds are in their breeding plumage,
they're at their brightest colours. Yeah,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.890
beautiful oranges and yellows. Yep, almost
as good as a warbler, almost as good as a

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.259
warbler. Be careful what I might attract here.
You never know.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.090
Kaw, kaw, kaw! Was that good? Absolutely.
I'm surprised we're not being mobbed right

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.090
now actually.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.130
One of the cool things about Presqu'ile is
we actually have a program here to look after

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.561
the park and re-forest it. This was all naturally
forested, and during European settlement it

00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:05.560
was all cleared. So these fields are actually
non-native habitats. So by having our own

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.509
nursery, we can help to bring some of these
fields back. So a reforestation of old farmland?

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.849
That's exactly right -- a reforestation of
old farmland. And we use all native species

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.370
that we, as I said, the seeds that are collected
right here in the park.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.340
And it's cool because we have a lot of people
that do it. It's not just staff that do this.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.510
We get a lot of school groups come in and
other volunteers. And anybody that's interested

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.890
can get ahold of us and we'll get a working
group together, get out and plant trees where

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.730
they need to be planted.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.230
Well Doug, we've seen a lot of cool things
in the park. Very cool. But this might be

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.690
the coolest. This is the Presqu'ile lighthouse.
Built in 1840, it's the second oldest, continuously

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.691
operating lighthouse on the Great Lakes. Wow.
And it's the only lighthouse found in a provincial

00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:53.691
park.

00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:56.794
And there were lots and lots of shipwrecks
in this area -- well over 100 shipwrecks within

00:02:56.794 --> 00:03:02.230
about a 30/40 year period. Wow. There was
a lot of loss of life, and they finally got

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.690
this lighthouse built. And it's an icon for
the park and an icon for the town. And there

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.379
it is, the Presqu'ile lighthouse.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:18.750
Okay Dave, we finally got one in nice and
straight. Fabulous job. Great job eh? Yep,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.079
let's go. We're outta here. Let's go.
