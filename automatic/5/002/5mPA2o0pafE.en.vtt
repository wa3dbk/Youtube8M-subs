00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
now with the m14 this is really not a

now with the m14 this is really not a
wise<00:02:15.410> choice<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:16.070> weapons<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.610> use<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:17.030> any<00:02:17.930> map

wise choice of weapons to use on any map

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.010 
wise choice of weapons to use on any map
as<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.560> matter<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> fact<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.450> map<00:02:20.630> said<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
as a matter of fact it's the map said it

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.990 
as a matter of fact it's the map said it
does<00:02:21.260> well<00:02:21.530> on<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:22.010> something<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.760> like

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
does well on is something like this like

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.970 
does well on is something like this like
grid<00:02:23.270> where<00:02:23.510> there<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> good<00:02:24.440> amount<00:02:24.500> of

long-range<00:02:25.580> window<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.180> window<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:27.500> know

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
long-range window to window you know

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.920 
long-range window to window you know
cross<00:02:27.920> mapped<00:02:28.190> across<00:02:28.490> map<00:02:28.790> combat<00:02:29.270> where

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
cross mapped across map combat where

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.410 
cross mapped across map combat where
this<00:02:30.200> uh<00:02:30.260> now<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:30.950> jump<00:02:31.850> into<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.060> theater<00:02:32.300> mode

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
thought it was pretty funny but ok so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.350 
thought it was pretty funny but ok so
the<00:02:44.720> m14<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.530> really<00:02:45.830> only<00:02:45.980> good<00:02:46.340> on<00:02:46.370> maps

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
the m14 is really only good on maps

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.400 
the m14 is really only good on maps
where<00:02:47.600> there's<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.870> good<00:02:48.050> amount<00:02:48.200> of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
where there's a good amount of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.170 
where there's a good amount of
long-range<00:02:48.860> combat<00:02:49.220> because<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
long-range combat because it is like a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.960 
long-range combat because it is like a
22<00:02:50.870> 23<00:02:51.110> shot<00:02:51.380> kill<00:02:51.650> from<00:02:51.950> all<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.850> way<00:02:52.940> across

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
22 23 shot kill from all the way across

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.270 
22 23 shot kill from all the way across
the<00:02:53.420> map<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:54.050> very<00:02:54.080> powerful<00:02:54.650> weapon

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
the map so it's a very powerful weapon

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.850 
the map so it's a very powerful weapon
but<00:02:55.900> obviously<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.170> semi-automatic

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
but obviously it's a semi-automatic

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.950 
but obviously it's a semi-automatic
one-shot<00:02:58.430> weapon<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.030> accuracy<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.660> not

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
one-shot weapon and the accuracy is not

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.350 
one-shot weapon and the accuracy is not
very<00:03:00.230> good<00:03:00.290> which<00:03:00.680> kind<00:03:01.550> of<00:03:01.640> what<00:03:01.730> makes<00:03:02.210> it

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
very good which kind of what makes it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.000 
very good which kind of what makes it
lack<00:03:02.600> as<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.900> gun<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:03.290> you'll<00:03:03.440> see<00:03:03.620> right<00:03:03.770> there

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
lack as a gun but you'll see right there

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.220 
lack as a gun but you'll see right there

I had a nice a two shot from across the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.740 
I had a nice a two shot from across the
map<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> situation<00:03:08.030> where<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
map and this is a situation where the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.520 
map and this is a situation where the
m14<00:03:09.230> actually<00:03:09.620> does<00:03:09.830> do<00:03:10.130> very<00:03:10.370> well<00:03:11.530> basically

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.020 
together because you got to cut the
video<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.470> you<00:05:26.530> got<00:05:26.680> up<00:05:26.860> put<00:05:27.190> put<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:27.850> video

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
video and you got up put put that video

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.400 
video and you got up put put that video
and<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.330> gotta<00:05:28.510> record<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:28.960> in<00:05:29.050> theater<00:05:29.290> mode

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
and you gotta record it in theater mode

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.100 
and you gotta record it in theater mode
make<00:05:29.650> sure<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:29.890> get<00:05:30.040> it<00:05:30.160> set<00:05:30.400> up<00:05:30.430> right<00:05:30.760> and

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
make sure you get it set up right and

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.900 
make sure you get it set up right and
stuff<00:05:32.110> like<00:05:32.260> that<00:05:32.320> so<00:05:32.800> at<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.520> end<00:05:33.550> here<00:05:33.820> in

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
stuff like that so at the end here in

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.300 
stuff like that so at the end here in
this<00:05:34.030> game<00:05:34.210> play<00:05:34.890> they<00:05:35.890> all<00:05:36.010> started

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
this game play they all started

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.180 
this game play they all started
basically<00:05:36.520> rushing<00:05:37.090> in<00:05:37.210> here<00:05:37.240> and<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.800> had<00:05:38.950> to

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
basically rushing in here and I had to

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.550 
basically rushing in here and I had to
switch<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.790> famas<00:05:40.210> because<00:05:40.630> then<00:05:40.870> 14<00:05:41.290> in<00:05:41.440> this

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
switch the famas because then 14 in this

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.070 
switch the famas because then 14 in this
situation<00:05:41.860> would<00:05:42.250> just<00:05:42.520> get<00:05:42.940> me<00:05:43.090> killed<00:05:43.300> so<00:05:44.050> I

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
situation would just get me killed so I

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.900 
situation would just get me killed so I
decided<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:44.860> would<00:05:44.980> pick<00:05:45.250> up<00:05:45.340> this<00:05:45.520> famas

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
decided that I would pick up this famas

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.850 
decided that I would pick up this famas
with<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.270> cog<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:46.780> start<00:05:47.110> picking<00:05:47.410> them<00:05:47.530> up<00:05:47.650> as

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
with a cog and start picking them up as

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.010 
with a cog and start picking them up as
they<00:05:48.070> came<00:05:48.250> since<00:05:48.610> they<00:05:48.790> seem<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.480> be<00:05:49.630> feeding

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
they came since they seem to be feeding

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
they came since they seem to be feeding
in<00:05:50.140> here<00:05:50.380> from<00:05:50.650> my<00:05:51.120> motion<00:05:52.120> sensor<00:05:52.510> now<00:05:53.260> motion

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
in here from my motion sensor now motion

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.450 
in here from my motion sensor now motion
sensor<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:54.750> by<00:05:55.750> far<00:05:56.050> my<00:05:56.110> favorite<00:05:56.530> like<00:05:57.220> last

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
sensor is by far my favorite like last

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.700 
sensor is by far my favorite like last
equipment<00:05:58.000> slot<00:05:58.240> I<00:05:58.480> would<00:05:59.020> prefer<00:05:59.050> this<00:05:59.500> over

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
equipment slot I would prefer this over

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.160 
equipment slot I would prefer this over
claymore<00:06:00.340> every<00:06:00.820> single<00:06:01.090> day<00:06:01.240> and<00:06:01.510> that's

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
claymore every single day and that's

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.140 
claymore every single day and that's
just<00:06:02.260> because<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.890> motion<00:06:03.220> sensor<00:06:03.520> lasts<00:06:04.030> you

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
just because the motion sensor lasts you

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.230 
just because the motion sensor lasts you
more<00:06:04.360> than<00:06:04.540> once<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.020> it<00:06:06.010> I<00:06:06.040> in<00:06:06.460> my<00:06:06.730> opinion<00:06:07.060> it

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
more than once and it I in my opinion it

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.760 
more than once and it I in my opinion it
helps<00:06:07.450> you<00:06:07.540> in<00:06:07.690> gunfights<00:06:08.080> better<00:06:08.350> a<00:06:08.440> lot<00:06:08.650> of

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
helps you in gunfights better a lot of

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.530 
helps you in gunfights better a lot of
people<00:06:09.010> will<00:06:09.070> run<00:06:09.370> flak<00:06:09.670> jacket<00:06:10.120> depending<00:06:10.450> on

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
people will run flak jacket depending on

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.390 
people will run flak jacket depending on
what<00:06:10.780> game<00:06:11.020> mode<00:06:11.260> you're<00:06:11.440> playing<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:11.980> I

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
what game mode you're playing and I

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.950 
what game mode you're playing and I
really<00:06:12.610> think<00:06:12.790> that<00:06:12.880> motion<00:06:13.330> sensor<00:06:13.660> is<00:06:13.780> just

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
really think that motion sensor is just

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.750 
really think that motion sensor is just
an<00:06:14.140> all<00:06:14.560> around<00:06:14.590> better<00:06:14.980> thing<00:06:15.250> to<00:06:15.280> use<00:06:15.520> in<00:06:15.700> a

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
an all around better thing to use in a

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.300 
an all around better thing to use in a
claymore<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:17.140> that's<00:06:17.740> about<00:06:17.890> it<00:06:18.010> for<00:06:18.130> this

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
claymore so that's about it for this

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.220 
claymore so that's about it for this
game<00:06:18.490> play<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:19.240> final<00:06:19.390> score<00:06:19.630> isn't<00:06:19.990> too

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
game play the final score isn't too

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.670 
game play the final score isn't too
impressive<00:06:20.880> but<00:06:21.880> it<00:06:22.030> is<00:06:22.200> 23<00:06:23.200> kill<00:06:23.380> death<00:06:23.560> ratio

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
impressive but it is 23 kill death ratio

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.370 
impressive but it is 23 kill death ratio
it's<00:06:24.190> just<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.430> 23<00:06:24.910> and<00:06:25.030> one<00:06:25.180> and<00:06:25.930> I<00:06:25.960> think<00:06:26.170> I<00:06:26.230> did

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
it's just a 23 and one and I think I did

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.720 
it's just a 23 and one and I think I did
a<00:06:26.410> good<00:06:26.620> job<00:06:26.680> showing<00:06:27.070> you<00:06:27.280> guys<00:06:27.310> how<00:06:27.460> to

really use them 14 and that's kind of

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.720 
really use them 14 and that's kind of
