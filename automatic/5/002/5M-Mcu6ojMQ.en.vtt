the difference from the more expensive
models<00:00:49.510> is<00:00:49.750> not<00:00:50.080> just<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.620> hardware<00:00:51.430> but<00:00:52.300> this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
models is not just the hardware but this

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.780 
models is not just the hardware but this
one's<00:00:52.900> also<00:00:53.520> Wayne<00:00:54.520> were<00:00:54.900> not<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.340> hip<00:00:57.340> styled

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
still got the old

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
still got the old
he<00:01:02.609> were<00:01:02.730> designed<00:01:03.089> from<00:01:03.269> Samsung<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
he were designed from Samsung that you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.710 
he were designed from Samsung that you
know<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> other<00:01:04.619> n<00:01:05.009> f-150<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:05.970> NB<00:01:06.509> 30

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
know from the other n f-150 and NB 30

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.490 
know from the other n f-150 and NB 30
models<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.290> example<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:09.150> f<00:01:09.360> 2<00:01:09.390> 10<00:01:09.780> has<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
models for example and f 2 10 has a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.490 
models for example and f 2 10 has a
island-style<00:01:11.280> keyboard<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
island-style keyboard so that's one of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.859 
island-style keyboard so that's one of
the<00:01:13.649> main<00:01:13.830> differences<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.420> trackpad<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the main differences the trackpad is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
the main differences the trackpad is
nicely<00:01:16.229> separated<00:01:16.530> from<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> rest<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.399> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
nicely separated from the rest of the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
nicely separated from the rest of the
device<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.630> probably<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:19.049> these

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
device and you probably know these

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.410 
device and you probably know these
buttons<00:01:19.530> down<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> looks

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
buttons down here so it kind of looks

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.830 
buttons down here so it kind of looks
like<00:01:21.509> an<00:01:21.899> end<00:01:22.049> 50<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.740> 150<00:01:23.039> in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> new<00:01:24.360> shark

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
like an end 50 and 150 in the new shark

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.360 
like an end 50 and 150 in the new shark
style<00:01:25.350> design

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
style design

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.850

and<00:01:27.640> yeah<00:01:28.510> let's<00:01:28.900> take<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.140> look<00:01:29.380> at<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.620> device

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
and yeah let's take a look at the device

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.070 
and yeah let's take a look at the device
itself<00:01:30.070> we're<00:01:30.940> gonna<00:01:31.090> turn<00:01:31.300> it<00:01:31.360> on<00:01:31.570> per<00:01:31.780> second

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
check out the hardware for you this

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.900 
check out the hardware for you this
one's<00:02:07.420> got<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.690> 48<00:02:08.140> for<00:02:08.470> our<00:02:08.649> battery<00:02:09.100> this<00:02:09.730> is

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
one's got a 48 for our battery this is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.690 
one's got a 48 for our battery this is
in<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> spec<00:02:10.330> sheet<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:12.220> that's<00:02:12.430> probably

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
in the spec sheet so that's probably

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.760 
in the spec sheet so that's probably
going<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> last<00:02:13.180> about<00:02:13.360> eight<00:02:13.630> hours<00:02:13.840> at<00:02:14.380> atmos

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
going to last about eight hours at atmos

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.080 
going to last about eight hours at atmos
this<00:02:17.770> looks<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.430> 250<00:02:19.420> gig<00:02:19.990> hard<00:02:20.320> drive

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
this looks like the 250 gig hard drive

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
this looks like the 250 gig hard drive
although<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.330> part<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.500> not<00:02:23.710> yet

although one part of is it is not yet
formatted<00:02:24.570> two<00:02:25.570> gigs<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.960> memory<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.440> this

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
formatted two gigs of memory in this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.700 
formatted two gigs of memory in this
case<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:27.790> not<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.240> faster<00:02:28.750> single<00:02:29.440> core

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710
