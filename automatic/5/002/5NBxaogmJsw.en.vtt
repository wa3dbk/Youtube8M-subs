00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.420
 a small video tutorial on how 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.460
 change the predefined programs in 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.279
 windows 8 in our case we are going to 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.550
 change the predefined viewer program 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.380

 as many of you will already know 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.700
 when we click on an image like this 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.190
 that we have in the predefined desktop 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.190
 mind windows 8 opens this image 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.859
 from your windows 8 viewer 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 if we wanted to change the mode 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.519

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.799
