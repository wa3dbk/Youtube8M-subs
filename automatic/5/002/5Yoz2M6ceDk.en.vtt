00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.830 
our big last and final scenario or we
try<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.400> put<00:02:57.670> everything<00:02:57.940> together<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.720> it's

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
try to put everything together so it's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930 
try to put everything together so it's
really<00:02:58.960> important<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.470> we<00:02:59.860> do<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.310> kind<00:03:00.820> of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
really important that we do this kind of

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.310 
really important that we do this kind of
tie<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.120> together<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:01.750> everybody's<00:03:02.140> kind<00:03:02.290> of

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
tie it together so everybody's kind of

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.740 
tie it together so everybody's kind of
practice<00:03:02.860> because<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:04.030> likelihood<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
practice because the likelihood of it

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.940 
practice because the likelihood of it
happening<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:05.230> actually<00:03:05.410> pretty<00:03:05.830> real<00:03:10.950> you

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
happening is actually pretty real you

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.860 
happening is actually pretty real you
train<00:03:12.250> because<00:03:12.730> when<00:03:12.940> something<00:03:13.330> serious

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
train because when something serious

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.720 
train because when something serious
goes<00:03:14.110> down<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.680> mountains<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.550> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
goes down in the mountains it is the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.820 
goes down in the mountains it is the
most<00:03:15.940> horrific<00:03:16.090> feeling<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:16.990> the<00:03:17.110> world<00:03:17.140> and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
most horrific feeling in the world and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.010 
most horrific feeling in the world and
it's<00:03:18.340> something<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:18.970> expect<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.690> all<00:03:19.840> the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
it's something I expect to all the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.930 
it's something I expect to all the
people<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> mountains<00:03:20.950> with<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.430> always

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
people in the mountains with to always

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.440 
people in the mountains with to always
be<00:03:22.150> evolving<00:03:23.020> and<00:03:23.260> just<00:03:23.560> retuning<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.300> we

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
be evolving and just retuning and so we

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:48.110 
be evolving and just retuning and so we
were<00:03:25.570> down

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.180
