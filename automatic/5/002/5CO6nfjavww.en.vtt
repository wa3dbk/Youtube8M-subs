know the end result is it really makes a
superior<00:01:46.079> product<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> time<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
superior product if you take the time to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
superior product if you take the time to
do<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> slip<00:01:48.390> stitching<00:01:48.840> rather<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.290> just

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
do the slip stitching rather than just

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.270 
do the slip stitching rather than just
sewing<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:51.149> looks<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.509> much<00:01:51.659> better<00:01:52.280> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
sewing it on it looks so much better the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.760 
sewing it on it looks so much better the
only<00:01:53.460> mistake<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.479> had<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:55.079> was

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
only mistake I really had with these was

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.010 
only mistake I really had with these was
with<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> fly<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.880> still<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.750> sure

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
with the fly I'm still not really sure

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.719 
with the fly I'm still not really sure
what<00:01:58.259> happened<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.770> them<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.250> look<00:01:59.460> fine

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
what happened with them they look fine

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
what happened with them they look fine
from<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.219> had<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.530> kind<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> iron<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
from here but I had to kind of iron it

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.059 
from here but I had to kind of iron it
at<00:02:05.310> an<00:02:05.460> angle<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
at an angle because it they actually it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.210 
at an angle because it they actually it
comes<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.580> further<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.390> than<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.690> does<00:02:09.720> here

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
comes out further here than it does here

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
comes out further here than it does here
something<00:02:11.220> happened<00:02:11.610> when<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> put<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
something happened when I put the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
really proud with how it came out I

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.490 
really proud with how it came out I
think<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.070> looks<00:03:26.220> spectacular<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.810> inside<00:03:28.260> is

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
think it looks spectacular the inside is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.120 
think it looks spectacular the inside is
lined<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.630> kind<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.870> awkward<00:03:34.050> but<00:03:34.740> also

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
lined this is kind of awkward but also

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.460 
lined this is kind of awkward but also
down<00:03:35.340> here<00:03:35.370> along<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.480> bottom<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.260> lining

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
down here along the bottom of the lining

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.240 
down here along the bottom of the lining
is<00:03:37.800> more<00:03:38.430> slip<00:03:38.730> stitching<00:03:39.210> and<00:03:40.010> again<00:03:41.010> I

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
is more slip stitching and again I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.710 
is more slip stitching and again I
thought<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.580> was<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> pain<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.300> rear<00:03:42.480> to

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
thought this was a pain in the rear to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.840 
thought this was a pain in the rear to
do<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.710> when<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.010> were<00:03:44.130> at<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.400> Renaissance

wavy<00:03:58.440> gravy<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.430> looked<00:03:59.610> horrible<00:03:59.910> I

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
wavy gravy and it looked horrible I

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.430 
wavy gravy and it looked horrible I

call it so I think mine turned out a lot
better<00:04:08.990> one<00:04:09.990> of<00:04:10.140> the

better one of the

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.539 
better one of the
difficult<00:04:11.560> areas<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:12.280> think<00:04:12.450> was<00:04:13.799> this<00:04:14.799> section

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
difficult areas I think was this section

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.080 
difficult areas I think was this section
here<00:04:15.909> where<00:04:16.949> there's<00:04:17.949> a<00:04:18.009> seam<00:04:18.340> right<00:04:18.759> here<00:04:18.820> and

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
here where there's a seam right here and

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.860 
here where there's a seam right here and
with<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.210> lining

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
with the lining

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.650 
with the lining
you<00:04:23.050> have<00:04:23.259> to<00:04:23.530> kind<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.190> stitch<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.539> have

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
you have to kind of stitch it you have

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.260 
you have to kind of stitch it you have
to<00:04:25.780> like<00:04:25.900> turn<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.380> lining<00:04:26.830> inside<00:04:27.520> out<00:04:27.970> and

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
to like turn the lining inside out and

and<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:35.380> didn't<00:04:35.710> really<00:04:35.949> meet<00:04:36.190> up<00:04:36.340> quite<00:04:36.699> right

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
and it didn't really meet up quite right

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.990 
and it didn't really meet up quite right
there's<00:04:37.240> kind<00:04:37.509> of<00:04:37.539> like<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.720> little<00:04:38.080> bit<00:04:38.199> of<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.380> I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
there's kind of like a little bit of a I

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.520 
there's kind of like a little bit of a I
don't<00:04:40.000> know<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.270> tuck<00:04:40.630> right<00:04:40.930> there<00:04:41.139> but<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.500> mean

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
don't know a tuck right there but I mean

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.439 
don't know a tuck right there but I mean
nobody's<00:04:41.979> gonna<00:04:42.130> see<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.639> nobody<00:04:43.000> notices

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.749 
nobody's gonna see that nobody notices
but<00:04:44.199> overall<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.889> think<00:04:45.009> this<00:04:45.310> turned<00:04:45.610> out

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
but overall I think this turned out

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.510 
but overall I think this turned out
excellent<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.630> has<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:46.990> really<00:04:47.320> nice<00:04:47.740> authentic

the yoke in here and in this area right

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.930 
the yoke in here and in this area right
here<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.910> was<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.060> little<00:05:58.300> bit<00:05:58.449> weird<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.550> it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
here it was a little bit weird but it

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.580 
here it was a little bit weird but it
turned<00:06:01.240> out<00:06:01.360> good<00:06:01.600> although<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:01.900> can<00:06:02.110> see<00:06:02.139> that

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
turned out good although I can see that

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.230 
turned out good although I can see that
now<00:06:02.949> that<00:06:03.130> it's<00:06:03.250> been<00:06:03.370> through<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.669> wash<00:06:03.880> I

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
now that it's been through the wash I

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.240 
now that it's been through the wash I
probably<00:06:05.050> should<00:06:05.350> have<00:06:05.380> hand-stitched<00:06:05.979> it<00:06:06.190> a

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
probably should have hand-stitched it a

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.320 
probably should have hand-stitched it a
little<00:06:06.400> bit<00:06:06.550> more<00:06:06.699> because<00:06:06.940> it's<00:06:07.090> kind<00:06:07.300> of

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
little bit more because it's kind of

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.580 
little bit more because it's kind of
coming<00:06:07.630> apart<00:06:07.960> but<00:06:08.919> I<00:06:09.400> can<00:06:09.880> do<00:06:10.000> that<00:06:10.150> it's<00:06:10.270> more

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
coming apart but I can do that it's more

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.499 
coming apart but I can do that it's more
