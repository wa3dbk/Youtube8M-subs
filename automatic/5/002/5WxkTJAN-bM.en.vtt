00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.130
 servus people alexej cape of hearts 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.170
 to be allowed to come on the canal today 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.360
 bit over the ea server gravel and 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.010
 worked for many popular multiplayer in 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.910
 names will not be mentioned battlefield 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.090
 2 421 42 and pierre de wit 19 42 as well 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.800
 crysis and crysis 2 before everyone here 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.629
 upset what they turn off the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.260
 but of course that depends on the games 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.400
 when shutdown on 31 may together this 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.570
 server for most servers this 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.540
 games become more about games 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.280
 hosted and that make one of the dense ones 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.570
 week by biggest server on again 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.820
 world does not have to do so now 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.110
 we'll see how things are going on 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.280
 short to the gameplay behind and that is 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.559
 a little battlefield 2 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.970
 jalal abad singleplayer so against bot 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.829
 two of the multiplayer was for me 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.640
 relative and yes I would say 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.580
 unplayable 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.780
 but okay i was relatively late because of that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.970
 first found by the whole of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.979
 Pampers were kicked because of participating 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.229
 stupid mistakes somehow in the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.600
 I had to install it first 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.399
 1004 error messages and solutions 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.570
 and problem is it finally ran and 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.270
 then I was on and 30 for example 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.720
 man can server mortar and spam to the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.090
 die 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.260
 It was just fun, which I did 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.650
 with his shit , that's you 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.880
 the eternal radio 42 decide 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.430
 can not turn off the on 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.320
 multiplayer server so annoying that me 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.490
 get the pure puke so here have 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.170
 I just go for a bit of zinc 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.790
 played lead there it was not so 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.229
 you know how that sounds I 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.229
 my short excerpt for you 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:07.610
 gehts grad still waiting times but that's 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:10.400
 Alone this vbs is out of sack 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.080
 yes everything was fine and good but from Monday 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.460
 Otherwise at least to a minimum 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.770
 reduce because so many books 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.300
 wrong on the whole really 20 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.660
 partly with each other there is animal 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.180
 on the bag 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.280
 but now back to the server 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.050
 shutter and so I have one 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.740
 news from gamestar it was like in june 2014 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.630
 So after the 1 0 38 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.880
 there are many older games from her 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.640
 taken offline from the portfolio 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.950
 It is about a total of 50 titles in the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.120
 your online support this month 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.910
 I will quote here 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.680
 a little something from gamestar.de to 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.000
 example values ​​4 2 crysis 2 as I said 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 So we have here for example in the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.860
 Beds titles would be 21 42 for pc and mac 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.420
 extension of the emergency power and secret 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.070
 weapons of what you included 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.900
 betty 2 for pc extension special 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.080
 forces included which two modern 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.760
 combat for ps 221 42 for pc and mac no 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.360
 fun strike expectation included 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.250
 have benefited for pc eg command 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.140
 Conquer 3 Tiberium what we after having 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.510
 while red alert 3 general 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.700
 that would be all there is crysis and crysis 2 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.410
 for the pc is very much a pity if 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.390
 then I have to say because they are 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.510
 They are not that bad and they are not 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.470
 keep running and now outside 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.480
 portfolios if he is still battle of and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.950
 to call metal of two as far as I am concerned 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.340
 they are white 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.110
 no parts in the game just the new values 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.650
 made by economics as by lucasarts 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.330
 and led by two for example 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.670
 but a top party support offered such 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.200
 The look is not quite 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.030
 so clear 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.310
 it will probably be over there 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.300
 Software Game Rangers want to run there 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.860
 I do not inform myself that way 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.360
 because that's always a bit of arg 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.880
 is complicated and I want you 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.910
 inform briefly and with tutorial 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.040
 how exactly this continues older needs 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.590
 for speed for example pro student cover 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.650
 for nintendo ds are also in the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.450
 multiplayer off takes place relatively 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.709
 No matter, but there are quite a lot 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.200
 play for example also old fifa 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.940
 soccer parts for the nds or so 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.530
 Generally your pc does not have that much 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.360
 but then the well-known title was 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.530
 I find a bit of a shame with violence 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:22.100
 electronic arts has one on their side 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.940
 update to the titles went out games 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.729
 to be hosted at 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.560
 and it looks like that , of course 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.770
 here as a reason the shutdown of 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.410
 call gamespy and since then known 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.120
 is the alternative to be developed 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.700
 to keep these games running so well 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.710
 far I know cot company 2 too 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.460
 So under these criteria will be there 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.320
 probably a bit too 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.510
 rumgebastelt that that runs again 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.789
 Of course I hope that there of course 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.380
 a good solution is found and what 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.660
 I would very well imagine 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.620
 the whole deficit I even 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.419
 very welcome to the battlelog relocated 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.250
 Of course, that's a big changeover 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.229
 the architectures so because of in 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.180
 Game server browser to a browser 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.470
 based server browser and common 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.210
 the structure of the battle ax somehow 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.699
 I agree with that 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.560
 that's really great 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.940
 is going to be another driver i would 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.169
 It is very welcome when you are completely 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.000
 just times server can share 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.510
 in this player even still somehow 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.400
 architecture which therefore of itself a 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.850
 experienced server architecture as update 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.770
 would 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.590
 and I think that then we too many 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.430
 players would come back first of all 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.710
 I think that's a pity 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.270
 that one extra for the old title 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.979
 account somehow does not need to 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.570
 his origin account at least with me 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.620
 so what else could one do then? 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.639
 alongside umstieg I find very great 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.470
 resist and be as good as there is 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.090
 there are no exact messages 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.500
 at least at the time of this recording 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.979
 I will, of course, if there 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.280
 something important gives you what do you call something 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.650
 important on the foliage up to date 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.389
 that's exactly what I am now 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.520
 out at this point is still writing times 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.960
 your opinion in the comments is me 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.150
 you are also interested in which areas 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.900
 we play the one of these 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.490
 shutdown 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.009
 I play you the list 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.400
 gamestar.de is the description in 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.930
 an overview i am now out 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.889
 this one and hope that there is one 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.900
 very good solution for this title 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.090
 I am found I'm calling out 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.000
 Until next time your alex disgust before 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.660
 I am happy about everyone 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.660
 Comment until then
