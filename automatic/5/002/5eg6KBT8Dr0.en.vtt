let's<00:00:11.940> tie<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.240> figure<00:00:12.540> eight<00:00:12.870> knot<00:00:13.429> but<00:00:14.429> before

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
let's tie a figure eight knot but before

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.430 
let's tie a figure eight knot but before
we<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.150> we're<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> need<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> start

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
we do that we're going to need to start

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.500 
we do that we're going to need to start
by<00:00:16.949> learning<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.400> new<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.760> term<00:00:18.060> called<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
by learning a new not term called the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.980 
by learning a new not term called the
overhand<00:00:19.140> turn<00:00:20.090> if<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.300> take<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.720> bitter<00:00:21.869> end

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
overhand turn if I take the bitter end

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.590 
overhand turn if I take the bitter end
of<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.380> line<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.920> make<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> closed<00:00:23.850> loop<00:00:24.060> over

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
of the line and make a closed loop over

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
of the line and make a closed loop over
the<00:00:24.720> standing<00:00:25.170> part<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> line<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.279> creates

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the standing part of the line it creates

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.810 
the standing part of the line it creates
an<00:00:27.180> overhand<00:00:27.660> turn<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.099> see<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.550> closed

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
an overhand turn you can see the closed

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.120 
an overhand turn you can see the closed
loop<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.619> what<00:00:31.619> makes<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.040> an

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
loop right here what makes it an

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889 
loop right here what makes it an
overhand<00:00:32.550> turn<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> bitter<00:00:33.780> end

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
overhand turn is that the bitter end

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.860 
overhand turn is that the bitter end
goes<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.760> standing<00:00:36.210> part<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> line

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
goes over the standing part of the line

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.619 
goes over the standing part of the line
that<00:00:37.649> makes<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> overhand<00:00:38.910> turn<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> our

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
that makes it the overhand turn and our

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.510 
that makes it the overhand turn and our
figure<00:00:40.050> eight<00:00:40.230> knot<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> start<00:00:41.309> with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
figure eight knot is going to start with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.910 
figure eight knot is going to start with
this<00:00:41.640> overhand<00:00:42.149> turn<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:43.260> several<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> our

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
this overhand turn as are several of our

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.250 
this overhand turn as are several of our
other<00:00:44.129> knots<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:45.149> let's<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> again<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
other knots so let's do that again I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
other knots so let's do that again I
take<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> bitter<00:00:47.129> end<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
take the bitter end and I have the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.619 
take the bitter end and I have the
standing<00:00:48.660> part<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.160> closed<00:00:50.700> loop<00:00:50.940> over

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
standing part I make a closed loop over

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
standing part I make a closed loop over
the<00:00:51.780> standing<00:00:52.199> part<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> complete<00:00:53.520> our

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the standing part now to complete our

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.729 
the standing part now to complete our
figure<00:00:54.270> eight<00:00:54.449> knot<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> go

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
figure eight knot I'm going to go

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.189 
figure eight knot I'm going to go
underneath<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.610> standing<00:00:57.030> part<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.750> bring

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
underneath the standing part then bring

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.040 
underneath the standing part then bring
the<00:00:58.500> bitter<00:00:58.680> end<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.730> put<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> back<00:01:00.690> into

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the bitter end up and put it back into

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.920 
the bitter end up and put it back into
the<00:01:01.320> loop<00:01:01.940> finally<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.090> complete<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> figure

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the loop finally to complete the figure

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
the loop finally to complete the figure
eight<00:01:04.140> knot<00:01:04.170> I'll<00:01:04.650> pull<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> standing<00:01:05.820> part

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
eight knot I'll pull the standing part

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
eight knot I'll pull the standing part
and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.570> bitter<00:01:06.720> end<00:01:06.810> together<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.040> can

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and the bitter end together and you can

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
and the bitter end together and you can
see<00:01:08.430> I've<00:01:08.610> created<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.150> stopper<00:01:09.720> knot<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
see I've created a stopper knot in the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.859 
see I've created a stopper knot in the
shape<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:10.770> eight<00:01:11.060> let's<00:01:12.060> take<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> look<00:01:12.720> at

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
shape of an eight let's take a look at

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
shape of an eight let's take a look at
how<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.260> works<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.770> practice<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
how this works in practice I'm going to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
how this works in practice I'm going to
bring<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.479> cleat<00:01:15.840> over<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> tie

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
bring my cleat over and I'm going to tie

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.340 
bring my cleat over and I'm going to tie
a<00:01:17.220> figure<00:01:17.520> eight<00:01:17.850> knot<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:19.110> line

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
a figure eight knot so that my line

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
a figure eight knot so that my line
doesn't<00:01:19.650> run<00:01:19.920> back<00:01:20.130> through<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.549> cleat<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
doesn't run back through the cleat I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.770 
doesn't run back through the cleat I
start<00:01:22.100> by<00:01:23.100> making<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.729> overhand<00:01:24.240> turn<00:01:24.540> I'll

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
start by making my overhand turn I'll

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
start by making my overhand turn I'll
then<00:01:25.710> bring<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> bitter<00:01:26.430> end<00:01:26.520> through<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
then bring the bitter end through and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.590 
then bring the bitter end through and
back<00:01:28.170> through<00:01:28.799> my<00:01:28.860> look<00:01:29.220> there's<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.210> figure

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
back through my look there's my figure

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.569 
back through my look there's my figure
eight<00:01:30.780> knot<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.590> pull<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> knot<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
eight knot and if I pull the knot you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
eight knot and if I pull the knot you
notice<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.150> does<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.810> back<00:01:33.990> through<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
notice it does not go back through the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.130 
notice it does not go back through the
cleat<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.220> you'll<00:01:35.430> notice<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.119> keeps<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
cleat so you'll notice this keeps the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
cleat so you'll notice this keeps the
line<00:01:37.380> from<00:01:37.680> running<00:01:37.979> through<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> cleat<00:01:38.670> now

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
line from running through the cleat now

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
line from running through the cleat now
one<00:01:40.079> thing<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.439> remember<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.729> don't

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
one thing to remember is that I don't

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
one thing to remember is that I don't
want<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.720> figure<00:01:43.079> eight<00:01:43.200> knot<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> very

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
want my figure eight knot at the very

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
want my figure eight knot at the very
end<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.369> line<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> have

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
end of the line because I want to have

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
end of the line because I want to have
some<00:01:46.079> line<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> pull<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> through<00:01:47.250> this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
some line there to pull it through this

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.300 
some line there to pull it through this
is<00:01:48.329> pretty<00:01:48.600> easy<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:49.740> because

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
is pretty easy to do right now because

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.060 
is pretty easy to do right now because
the<00:01:50.670> line<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.270> loaded<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.259> had<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.770> line

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the line is not loaded but had this line

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.090 
the line is not loaded but had this line
been<00:01:53.369> tied<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.090> sale<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.020> had<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> been<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
been tied to a sale and had it been a

it<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.000> pull<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.200> what<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.219> is

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
it to pull it so what I'm going to do is

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
it to pull it so what I'm going to do is
not<00:02:03.570> time<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> figure<00:02:04.469> eight<00:02:04.680> knot<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.100> end

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
not time I figure eight knot at the end

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.550 
not time I figure eight knot at the end
line<00:02:05.760> but<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.270> least<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.659> hand<00:02:07.020> holds<00:02:07.409> worth

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
line but get at least a hand holds worth

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.550 
line but get at least a hand holds worth
of<00:02:07.740> line<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.910> I'm<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.780> make<00:02:10.080> my

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
of line then I'm going to make my

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.370 
of line then I'm going to make my
overhand<00:02:11.160> turn<00:02:11.930> one<00:02:12.930> hand<00:02:13.230> hold<00:02:13.530> up<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.040> line

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
overhand turn one hand hold up the line

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.190 
overhand turn one hand hold up the line
so<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.060> line<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.300> loaded<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:18.990> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so that when the line is loaded up I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.140 
so that when the line is loaded up I
have<00:02:19.440> something<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.860> hold<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.790> pull<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
have something to hold on to to pull the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.240 
have something to hold on to to pull the
line<00:02:21.330> through<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.770> trick<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
line through that's the trick to a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.790 
line through that's the trick to a
figure<00:02:23.580> eight<00:02:23.760> knot
