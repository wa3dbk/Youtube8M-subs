00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.410
 these three bright stars the belt of Orion 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.800
 two star speaker team his shoulders 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
 with two stars customers legs 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.160
 below the display 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
 I already suspect a small side effect with the naked eye 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.730
 with a telescope Siekmann 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.449
 that is a glowing gas cloud 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.449
 she is excited by these bright stars to shine 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.890
 and now it will be interesting for us 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 in very many gas clouds, dark molecular clouds are hidden in them 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.310
 Dark clouds can be seen with an infrared telescope 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.410
 and what we see there 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.090
 is something very special 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
 it is the birthplace of stars 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880
 here new stars are threatened 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.410
 that is not yet the number of dead 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.270
 Like all of them, the clouds of molecular hydrogen are the densest 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.860
 and coldest 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.860
 in these regions the title gained one percent 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.189
 the children gathered it is 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.160
 where the cold ones wanted 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.920
 under their own weight together 2 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 an impulse from the outside is enough 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.190
 in the meeting begins 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.130
 if a supernova study in Berlin the dark-skinned 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.249
 So far he sees wanting to happen so that it collapses 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.250
 and then there is no stopping 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.960
 deep inside the cloud 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.109
 the cores get bigger and bigger and show more and more together 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.440
 everything is getting warmer 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.530
 at the beginning 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.020
 only a few hundred degrees 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.270
 that's for a star 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.010
 Witzigmann lukewarm though 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.600
 warm enough for an infrared telescope and this so-called photo Stefan Menne 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.780
 to see through the clouds 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.640
 bit by bit 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.070
 The colorful stars then heat themselves several millions of degrees and cheers 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.900
 after all 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.750
 ignites nuclear fusion 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.809
 and a new star 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.529
 a self-luminous should
