00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.050
 sometimes trying in my search for 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.730

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.440

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.420
 disconnecting players much better 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.940
 that they disconnect that the internet is 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.290
 all of them go to me, it's worth a 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.150
 victory is a victory 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.850
 this was not playing as a team because 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.400
 if I'm not going to have to coordinate there with 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.260

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.920

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.920

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.880
 what is it sometimes they are taking me out 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.880
 advantage because I do not know what it is 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.730
 change the puppy that rich 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.370
 the days of effort 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 the bonus 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.819
 I think they will not kill me because I 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.410
 I'm going off the map and I'm coming back 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.360

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.240

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.190
 wasting time 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.630
 oh how handsome they put you names that already 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.100
 I have not played much of the month and I 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.180
 I'm surprised by the dumbest things in the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.460
 world in universe 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.280
 to see this word 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.680
 good good that I'm going to catch this that is 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.270
 an oven 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.460
 and it is that it was that I had hanging 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.350
 I heard a sound please leave me in 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.780
 peace as a click appears on a 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.780
 cricket cricket 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.200
 you need the stone stones of good 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.830
 As you can see a cricket takes away 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.530
 about nothing 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.620
 for the balls 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.850
 or it 's getting night shift that 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.540
 have to make these radios and I want 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.560
 do 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.560
 pim pam pam pam pam 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.620
 and bad reputation remembers some little thing 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.830
 some little thing I remember I just have to 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.830
 yes 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.920
 this for me how many people are left 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.750
 people want to sing you're left 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.650
 and all this shows that I have to 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.910
 Exit to outside because 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.910
 if I have that and for outside 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.490
 it says I have to go out 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.490
 and the word of that is to say 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.330
 is that it is lasting a lot this does not 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.210
 I expected to last maybe so much 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.180
 I do not know, you two will see what 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.990
 leaving only damn oysters 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.960
 this comes very fast so that 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.670
 I was taking much longer this wine 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.670
 but it came as if it were superman 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.689
 it seems a same bolt is coming that I 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:15.360
 has to be learned is a technique 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.429
 better is some trick tell me in the 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.430
 comments that it's like wine so fast 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:22.310
 the semi 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.840

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.840
