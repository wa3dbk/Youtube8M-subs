00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:05.970
 A chair 

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:07.874
 It is still a chair 

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.436
 Even when there is nobody 

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:14.859
 Sitting there 

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:19.610
 But a chair 

00:00:20.123 --> 00:00:21.429
 It's not a house. 

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:22.914
 It is a house 

00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.618
 Not a home 

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.894
 When there is no one there 

00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:29.755
 To hold you 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.807
 And nobody there 

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:33.963
 To give you a kiss 

00:00:34.553 --> 00:00:36.629
 Good night 

00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:41.008
 -I love you dear. Come on. 'Time and again' 

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:43.426
 I call your name 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.561
 And suddenly your face 

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:48.631
 Pops up 

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:50.864
 But it's just 

00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:54.017
 A crazy game 

00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:56.390
 When it ends 

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.323
 Ends in tears 

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:02.670
 Dear 

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:04.553
 'Have a heart' - My God! 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.329
 'Do not let a mistake' - That woman ... 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.297
 Keep us apart 

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:15.581
 I'm not destined 

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:17.415
 To live alone 

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:21.464
 Transform my home 

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:23.303
 In a home 

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:25.361
 Please be 

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:27.244
 There yet 

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:29.223
 In love 

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:33.311
 By me 

00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:42.630
 That's how it's done! 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.458
 Lillie, I'll start by saying ... 

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:03.938
 Without even singing, 

00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:07.203
 Just standing on this stage, you look like a superstar. 

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:14.211
 I'm honored to be on the bench in front of you. 

00:02:17.444 --> 00:02:24.202
 Lillie, thank you so much for giving us all this. 

00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:26.807
 You left me speechless. 

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:29.213
 You are a goddess. 

00:02:33.103 --> 00:02:35.832
 Lillie, I just love you, and ... 

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.526
 Really. 

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:39.101
 Thank you, Simon. 

00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:44.481
 You never know what it will be like with Kelly, but if she moves you to the next stage ... 

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:50.996
 I think this competition can be very exciting, 

00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:54.006
 Because competitions need great voices, 

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:56.563
 Competitions need stars 

00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:59.107
 And you have X Factor, my dear. 

00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:12.708
 You have to know, with your whole being, how special you are. 

00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:18.178
 Just to listen, to hear you, 

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:21.311
 Someone like you telling me these things ... 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.165
 I waited my whole life just for these words. 

00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:27.501
 Okay, Kelly. Thank you. 

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:31.649
 If Lillie stays, one of the four will go home. 

00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:34.644
 What is your decision? 

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.088
 You are among my 4 finalists. 

00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:52.285
 Congratulations, Lillie. 

00:03:52.654 --> 00:03:55.063
 You are one of Kelly's 4 finalists. 

00:03:55.231 --> 00:04:00.411
 But, this means that one of them must be replaced. 

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:04.450
 Kelly, who will you send home? 

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:07.695
 The James Kenney? 

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.430
 Lorie Moore? 

00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:13.386
 Jeff Gutt? 

00:04:15.313 --> 00:04:16.920
 Or Rachel Potter? 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:19.822
 I trust my instincts ... 

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:23.410
 And the candidate I'm sending home tonight 

00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:33.587
 The candidate I will replace is Lorie Moore. 

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:44.958
 Lorie Moore came so close ... 

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:49.828
 Well in the end, 

00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:53.215
 Lillie McCloud got a chair. 

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:54.962
 Come here, Lorie. 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.794
 Rachel's freaking out. She's so happy.
