00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
all righty well everything is now

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.500 
all righty well everything is now
completely<00:00:06.210> installed<00:00:06.840> the<00:00:07.740> tank<00:00:08.150> all<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
completely installed the tank all the

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.310 
completely installed the tank all the
lines<00:00:10.280> solenoid<00:00:11.280> all<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.700> electrical<00:00:12.320> so

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
lines solenoid all the electrical so

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.890 
lines solenoid all the electrical so
this<00:00:14.010> will<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.370> my<00:00:14.580> very<00:00:14.940> first<00:00:15.090> test<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.870> just

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this will be my very first test I just

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.279 
this will be my very first test I just
had<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> tank<00:00:16.710> filled<00:00:16.949> today<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:19.140> going

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
had the tank filled today so I'm going

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
had the tank filled today so I'm going
to<00:00:19.320> open<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> bottle<00:00:20.210> make<00:00:21.210> sure<00:00:21.390> there's<00:00:21.600> no

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
to open the bottle make sure there's no

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.939 
to open the bottle make sure there's no
leaks<00:00:21.990> anywhere<00:00:24.320> in<00:00:25.320> any<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.770> lines<00:00:25.980> so

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
leaks anywhere in any of the lines so

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:45.690 
leaks anywhere in any of the lines so
here<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.039> go

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:01:06.679 

right

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.950 

all<00:01:07.689> right<00:01:07.869> we<00:01:07.990> do<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.380> leak<00:01:08.799> so<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.840> are

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
all right we do have a leak so we are

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.359 
all right we do have a leak so we are
going<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.200> go<00:01:11.289> ahead<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.649> cut<00:01:11.829> that<00:01:11.860> bottle

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
going to go ahead and cut that bottle

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.270 
going to go ahead and cut that bottle
off<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.840> we<00:01:13.899> do<00:01:14.110> have<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> leak<00:01:14.649> coming<00:01:14.890> from<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
off so we do have a leak coming from the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:24.870 
off so we do have a leak coming from the
top<00:01:21.899> see<00:01:22.899> that's<00:01:23.170> why<00:01:23.740> we<00:01:23.770> inspect<00:01:24.610> everything

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
top see that's why we inspect everything

00:01:24.880 --> 00:02:07.160 
top see that's why we inspect everything
before<00:01:25.299> we<00:01:25.329> just<00:01:26.020> go<00:01:26.500> ahead

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.640 

like<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.380> solenoids<00:02:09.039> better<00:02:09.310> or<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.000> off

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
like that solenoids better or that off

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.930 
like that solenoids better or that off
sitting<00:02:11.650> might<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.160> be<00:02:12.280> screwed<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:12.850> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
sitting might not be screwed in all the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:36.420 
sitting might not be screwed in all the
way<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.960> just<00:02:20.080> gonna<00:02:20.200> free<00:02:35.220> that's<00:02:36.220> why

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
way it's just gonna free that's why

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.460 
way it's just gonna free that's why
we<00:02:36.580> install<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> purge<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:40.330> right<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.320> know

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
we install a purge all right so we know

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.260 
we install a purge all right so we know
you<00:02:41.620> got<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.800> small<00:02:42.220> leak<00:02:42.489> here

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
you got a small leak here

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.640 
you got a small leak here
I<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:44.440> exactly<00:02:44.800> where<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:46.530> we<00:02:47.530> know

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
I know exactly where it is and we know

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.520 
I know exactly where it is and we know
my<00:02:47.770> purge<00:02:48.040> works<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.610> that's<00:02:48.790> good<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.530> really

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
my purge works so that's good so really

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.330 
my purge works so that's good so really
now<00:02:50.680> all<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:50.920> have<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.220> do<00:02:51.340> now<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:53.130> take<00:02:54.130> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
now all I have to do now is take that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.600 
now all I have to do now is take that
line<00:02:54.640> off<00:02:54.940> there<00:02:55.330> right<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:57.040> there's<00:02:57.520> a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
line off there right here there's a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.580 
line off there right here there's a
little<00:02:57.850> piece<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> bottom<00:02:58.600> but<00:02:59.500> I'm

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
whole lot of nitrous by doing that but

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.979 
whole lot of nitrous by doing that but
we'll<00:03:13.330> find<00:03:13.540> out<00:03:15.150> see<00:03:16.150> how<00:03:16.239> cold<00:03:16.600> everything

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
we'll find out see how cold everything

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.720 
we'll find out see how cold everything
get<00:03:17.230> down<00:03:17.410> here

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.290 

everything<00:03:23.730> seems<00:03:24.300> looking<00:03:24.750> right<00:03:26.300> smell

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
everything seems looking right smell

that<00:03:27.420> funny<00:03:27.660> gift<00:03:29.330> already<00:03:30.330> there<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.970> know

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that funny gift already there so I know

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.199 
that funny gift already there so I know
I<00:03:33.150> need<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.510> do<00:03:33.690> now<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.530> after<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.209> once

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
I need to do now and after that once

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.730 
I need to do now and after that once
it's<00:03:36.390> all<00:03:36.540> hooked<00:03:36.780> up<00:03:36.930> make<00:03:37.230> sure<00:03:37.380> there's<00:03:37.590> no

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
it's all hooked up make sure there's no

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.309 
it's all hooked up make sure there's no
more<00:03:37.890> leaks<00:03:38.510> there's<00:03:39.510> no<00:03:39.660> fuel<00:03:39.930> leaks<00:03:40.140> so

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
more leaks there's no fuel leaks so

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.530 
more leaks there's no fuel leaks so
that's<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> good<00:03:40.739> thing<00:03:41.420> tested<00:03:42.420> that

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
that's the good thing tested that

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.390 
that's the good thing tested that
already<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.730> get<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:44.910> leak<00:03:45.239> fixed<00:03:46.220> we'll<00:03:47.220> do

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
already so get that leak fixed we'll do

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.959 
already so get that leak fixed we'll do
a<00:03:47.430> few<00:03:47.670> test<00:03:47.910> runs<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.330> we'll<00:03:48.600> be<00:03:48.690> good<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.870> go
