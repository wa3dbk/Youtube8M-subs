00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
little bit too much at the end when we

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.210 
little bit too much at the end when we
could<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.290> stayed<00:01:28.380> tight<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> kept

a<00:02:13.030> lot<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.210> energy<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.920> hopefully<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.040> can

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
a lot of energy so hopefully we can

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.340 
a lot of energy so hopefully we can
figure<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.550> out<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.880> start<00:02:16.750> playing<00:02:16.960> better<00:02:17.080> a
