00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.000
 and I think that they are almost all going to us 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.100
 it turns out that everyone wants to leave 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.050
 in the greetings of the chorizada it turns out and 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.150
 well basically also when I 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.030
 connect I do not know why I did not appear 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.060
 chair image that normally appears 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.479
 of what has been the announcement of the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.090
 new list and instead it appeared to me 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.940
 that was what they had announced 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.860
 of the new halo 2 anniversary and I do not know what 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.530
 then nothing else is a appeared but 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.390
 was a recruit this really I do not know what 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.369
 hell happened since because I'm with another 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.070
 profile as you know my habitat account is 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.250
 bathed of x is law 60 x but soon it will 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.680
 to be back and to see let's start 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.390
 the carreritas I have not played the lazio that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.149
 you do not see many wonder slayer key 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 that every judge is this because basically 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.229
 is to play the first game of the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.380
 new playlists that are taking out 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.119
 the boys of 343 industries and good 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.369
 Many of the subscribers notify me 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.840
 facebook by twitter and inclusive 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.399
 the channel per message when there is a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.420
 new list because they like to be 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.920
 send greetings 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.110
 now 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.090
 surely there are many that I lacked 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.270
 but this video I'm recording 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.050
 just the same day that I recorded the ad 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.000
 that he was not at my house so 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.130
 that those who sent it afterwards were 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.290
 lost health and llos to send it 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.560
 later not but let's start let's 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.870
 see how many runs I go through it 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.520
 Once it's located, I do not know if it was in a 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.250
 milk flowers but it was silly 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 because according to me I was winning or going in 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.150
 second or something like that when the end passes 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.340
 gave me and left me in last and easy to 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.540
 what nonsense is this 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.540
 again garbage 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.260
 I had never seen you this map 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 no fuckin 'this guy is fucking very 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.360
 emotive city 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.069
 and also if you go ahead and say 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.959
 it's much better because nobody is going 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.780
 Fucking like this you're staying as it is 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.049
 back or something they all start to fuck you 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.549
 they all start to bother you and it's a lot 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.450
 harder here goes the first this 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.829
 trash 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.079
 this was improved because the one that I 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.780
 I had played was always a few little runs 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.909
 all doubts on the map of Valhalla and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.079
 Well, I did not have a joke because the map 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.659
 of going to let everybody 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.750
 we know and do not have what 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.870
 new things 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:38.680
 and this one yes they have given me according to me so it goes to 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:41.319
 know the dark and fuck no 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.250
 so you are going to see and in the end I do not know what happened 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:50.189
 and I mega your ally then you are able 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.189
 that they do the same thing 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.970
 do not see is that this one is very strange 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.319
 because I wear another type totally 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.390
 other than garbage 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.209
 I do not know 15 the first one I do not know if the one 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.010
 fell forward there be very slow and more 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.650
 okay last that guy and he does not move 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.280
 but there is a new room 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.280
 dt 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.990
 to this turn 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.800
 It's silly 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.669
 it was where I repeat myself 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.720
 but see I think that guy's not alone 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.720
 I know what the fuck 15a 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.930
 but it fell from up there 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.030
 so if it is winning, it is a 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.030
 foolishness because I do not know how he did it 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.169
 before these playlists are for 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.970
 two when you're sick of playing nothing more 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.480
 those rubbish that's not killing and killing 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.130
 and kill second I do not know who 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.370
 damn it was the first one I think if it was 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.280
 the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.580
 rossi if the rojito gives me this in the area 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.260
 he's a recruit and he was the last one I do not know if 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.320
 the third I do not understand good we were 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.350
 equal 800 points against miller at 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.419
 first good was very fast from 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.580
 really this mode was it was very very 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.660
 fast I do not know how much you sell 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.660
 lace and those garbage 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.880
 thousand 363 are not very few seconds 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.220
 little but for the time it was quite 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.890
 well so we were in second our 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.750

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:45.990
 a fuck here such matters 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.510
