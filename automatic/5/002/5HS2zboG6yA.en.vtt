so stand up you're high as I can chalk

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.619 
so stand up you're high as I can chalk
bag<00:00:09.889> out<00:00:10.100> of<00:00:10.129> the<00:00:10.190> way<00:00:10.370> I'm<00:00:11.299> going<00:00:11.450> to<00:00:11.540> go<00:00:11.690> in

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
bag out of the way I'm going to go in

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.490 
bag out of the way I'm going to go in
okay<00:00:14.629> here<00:00:14.809> I'll<00:00:14.900> show<00:00:15.110> you<00:00:15.170> a<00:00:15.260> little<00:00:15.350> bit

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
okay here I'll show you a little bit

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.120 
okay here I'll show you a little bit
about<00:00:15.650> jamming

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
about jamming

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.620 
about jamming
believe<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:19.250> or<00:00:19.340> not<00:00:19.430> there<00:00:19.820> are<00:00:19.970> variations

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
believe it or not there are variations

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.900 
believe it or not there are variations
in<00:00:21.109> this<00:00:21.320> crack<00:00:21.589> obviously<00:00:22.460> right<00:00:22.699> there

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
in this crack obviously right there

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.060 
in this crack obviously right there
there's<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.210> good<00:00:23.359> hand<00:00:23.630> Jam<00:00:23.900> but<00:00:24.650> definitely

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
there's a good hand Jam but definitely

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.519 
there's a good hand Jam but definitely
the<00:00:25.310> crack<00:00:25.580> opens<00:00:26.089> up<00:00:26.269> there's<00:00:26.539> a<00:00:26.599> little<00:00:26.779> tiny

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
the crack opens up there's a little tiny

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.429 
the crack opens up there's a little tiny
pod<00:00:27.949> but<00:00:28.789> any<00:00:29.089> of<00:00:29.300> these<00:00:29.449> little<00:00:29.929> tiny

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
pod but any of these little tiny

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.900 
pod but any of these little tiny
fluctuations<00:00:30.949> of<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:32.390> crack<00:00:32.660> make<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.910> pretty

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
fluctuations of the crack make a pretty

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.700 
fluctuations of the crack make a pretty
good<00:00:35.150> difference<00:00:35.630> you<00:00:35.810> know<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.410> bigger

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
good difference you know and the bigger

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.900 
good difference you know and the bigger
they<00:00:36.920> are<00:00:36.950> of<00:00:37.190> course<00:00:37.370> they're<00:00:37.580> going<00:00:37.700> to<00:00:37.760> make

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
they are of course they're going to make

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.180 
they are of course they're going to make
more<00:00:38.090> of<00:00:38.150> a<00:00:38.330> difference<00:00:38.360> but<00:00:38.980> just<00:00:39.980> this

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
more of a difference but just this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.240 
more of a difference but just this
little<00:00:40.520> tiny<00:00:41.590> variation<00:00:42.590> on<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:42.860> edge

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
little tiny variation on this edge

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.850 
little tiny variation on this edge
that's<00:00:44.150> like<00:00:44.360> this<00:00:44.540> it's<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.230> little<00:00:45.530> bit<00:00:45.680> wider

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
that's like this it's a little bit wider

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.830 
that's like this it's a little bit wider
there<00:00:46.220> so<00:00:46.670> I'm<00:00:46.730> going<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:46.940> try<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.240> put<00:00:47.450> my<00:00:47.570> foot

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
there so I'm going to try to put my foot

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.360 
there so I'm going to try to put my foot
there<00:00:47.870> or<00:00:48.230> I'm<00:00:48.380> going<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.530> try<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.740> put<00:00:48.980> my<00:00:49.100> hand

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
there or I'm going to try to put my hand

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.850 
there or I'm going to try to put my hand
in<00:00:49.550> especially<00:00:50.270> if<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.840> cracks<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.560> little<00:00:51.770> bit

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
in especially if it cracks a little bit

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.040 
in especially if it cracks a little bit
small<00:00:52.250> for<00:00:52.280> my<00:00:52.640> hands<00:00:53.060> okay<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.000> look<00:00:56.810> for

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
small for my hands okay so you look for

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
small for my hands okay so you look for
the<00:00:57.140> variations<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:59.260> utilize<00:01:00.260> them<00:01:00.590> however

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
the variations and utilize them however

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.400 
the variations and utilize them however
you<00:01:01.580> feel<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.180> need<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.510> like<00:01:02.690> like<00:01:03.110> right

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
you feel you need it like like right

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.560 
you feel you need it like like right
here<00:01:03.800> it's<00:01:04.009> a<00:01:04.100> little<00:01:04.129> bit<00:01:04.430> flared<00:01:05.030> out<00:01:05.269> here

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
here it's a little bit flared out here

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.959 
here it's a little bit flared out here
so<00:01:05.990> I'm<00:01:06.080> probably<00:01:06.439> going<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.979> use<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.549> for<00:01:07.850> my

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
so I'm probably going to use that for my

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.029 
so I'm probably going to use that for my
first<00:01:08.299> foothold<00:01:08.929> because<00:01:09.409> I<00:01:09.530> can<00:01:09.649> get<00:01:09.799> my<00:01:09.979> toe

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
first foothold because I can get my toe

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.489 
first foothold because I can get my toe
in<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:11.179> further<00:01:11.509> right

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
in it further right

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.969 
in it further right
so<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.130> look<00:01:13.460> at<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.759> crack<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.570> look<00:01:15.439> up<00:01:15.649> here

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
so you look at the crack I look up here

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.459 
so you look at the crack I look up here
and<00:01:16.219> I<00:01:16.280> go<00:01:16.460> okay<00:01:16.850> there's<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.600> good<00:01:17.869> hand<00:01:18.200> jam

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
and I go okay there's a good hand jam

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.649 
and I go okay there's a good hand jam
right<00:01:18.799> there<00:01:18.880> there's<00:01:19.880> another<00:01:20.210> little

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
right there there's another little

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.249 
right there there's another little
opening<00:01:21.619> just<00:01:22.399> above<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:23.630> know<00:01:23.749> so<00:01:24.049> you're

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
opening just above it you know so you're

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.550 
opening just above it you know so you're
going<00:01:24.469> to<00:01:24.499> go<00:01:24.679> maybe<00:01:25.159> one<00:01:25.700> two<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.689> then

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
going to go maybe one two and then

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.349 
going to go maybe one two and then
eventually<00:01:28.130> you're<00:01:28.429> gonna<00:01:28.490> get<00:01:28.640> your<00:01:28.789> feet<00:01:29.119> up

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
eventually you're gonna get your feet up

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.120 
eventually you're gonna get your feet up
in<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.659> thing<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.140> that's<00:01:30.649> going<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.009> be<00:01:31.100> a

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
in the thing and that's going to be a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.120 
in the thing and that's going to be a
very<00:01:31.549> secure<00:01:32.299> spot<00:01:32.689> of<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.929> crack<00:01:33.139> more<00:01:33.770> so

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
very secure spot of the crack more so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.429 
very secure spot of the crack more so
than<00:01:34.609> a<00:01:34.639> few<00:01:34.969> feet<00:01:35.179> higher<00:01:35.509> works<00:01:36.139> very

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
than a few feet higher works very

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.889 
than a few feet higher works very
parallel<00:01:36.979> okay<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.389> other<00:01:38.420> things<00:01:38.749> you're

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
parallel okay the other things you're

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.539 
parallel okay the other things you're
looking<00:01:39.020> for<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.530> okay<00:01:40.189> there's<00:01:40.399> some

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
looking for is okay there's some

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.520 
looking for is okay there's some
footholds<00:01:41.119> out<00:01:41.270> here<00:01:41.539> well<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:41.840> got<00:01:42.109> this<00:01:42.289> one

footholds out here well I got this one

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.730 
footholds out here well I got this one
here<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.609> this<00:01:43.850> one<00:01:44.119> here<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:45.409> wall

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
here that this one here this wall

up in here and you look ahead and try to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.609 
up in here and you look ahead and try to
figure<00:01:52.280> out<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:53.299> climbing<00:01:53.959> is<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.200> best<00:01:54.439> you

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
figure out the climbing is the best you

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.679 
figure out the climbing is the best you
can<00:01:54.889> before<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:55.819> ever<00:01:55.909> leave<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.270> ground

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
can before you ever leave the ground

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.669 
can before you ever leave the ground
there<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:57.469> go<00:01:57.619> okay<00:01:57.770> there's<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.609> anchor

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
there you go okay there's the anchor

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.069 
there you go okay there's the anchor
it's<00:02:00.679> not<00:02:01.039> even<00:02:01.279> half<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.609> rope<00:02:01.880> okay<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.840> can

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
it's not even half a rope okay so I can

that happens a lot right especially on

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.140 
that happens a lot right especially on
long<00:03:05.840> runs<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.320> if<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.310> start<00:03:07.580> climbing<00:03:07.850> in

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
the rope doesn't go probably not on the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.170 
the rope doesn't go probably not on the
way<00:03:12.310> we<00:03:13.310> won't<00:03:13.459> have<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.989> okay<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.769> I<00:03:16.220> look<00:03:16.850> at<00:03:17.000> I

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
way we won't have it okay so I look at I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.970 
way we won't have it okay so I look at I
figure<00:03:17.660> out<00:03:17.810> what<00:03:18.019> I'm<00:03:18.140> going<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.320> try<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.620> do

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
figure out what I'm going to try to do

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
and I'll reach out go into the crack

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.449 
and I'll reach out go into the crack
like<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.709> with<00:03:25.370> my<00:03:25.579> thumb<00:03:26.360> out<00:03:26.620> my<00:03:27.620> fingers

like this with my thumb out my fingers
pointed<00:03:28.850> up<00:03:29.049> I'll<00:03:30.049> work<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.890> into<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.280> little

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
pointed up I'll work it into that little

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.650 
pointed up I'll work it into that little
pocket<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.329> then<00:03:32.690> I'll<00:03:32.920> rotate<00:03:33.920> my<00:03:34.160> hand<00:03:34.660> so

pocket and then I'll rotate my hand so
that<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.620> deep<00:03:37.040> into<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.489> crack<00:03:37.820> as

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
that I can it is deep into the crack as

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.800 
that I can it is deep into the crack as
I<00:03:38.660> can<00:03:39.049> into<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.070> pocket<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.850> then<00:03:41.600> I'll

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
I can into that pocket and then I'll

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.740 
I can into that pocket and then I'll
start<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.200> make<00:03:42.530> my<00:03:42.769> jam<00:03:43.570> okay

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750

and so now what I'm doing inside the

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.539 
and so now what I'm doing inside the
crack<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:48.290> I'm<00:03:48.470> doing<00:03:48.680> two<00:03:48.829> things<00:03:48.860> I'm

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549

with<00:04:00.110> them<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:01.209> makes<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.390> bigger<00:04:02.540> right<00:04:02.870> and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
with them it makes it bigger right and

with them it makes it bigger right and
when<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:03.829> go<00:04:04.040> like<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.790> makes<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.150> bigger

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
when I go like that it makes it bigger

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.830 
when I go like that it makes it bigger

here's<00:05:19.940> another<00:05:20.620> general<00:05:21.620> rule<00:05:21.919> of<00:05:21.949> thumb

here's another general rule of thumb

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.719 
here's another general rule of thumb
because<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.930> corner<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.710> I'm<00:05:25.400> going

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
because this is a corner and I'm going

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.070 
because this is a corner and I'm going
on<00:05:26.710> right<00:05:27.710> side<00:05:28.099> in<00:05:28.400> in<00:05:28.699> other<00:05:28.880> words<00:05:29.120> my<00:05:29.779> right

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
on right side in in other words my right

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.959 
on right side in in other words my right
hip<00:05:30.319> is<00:05:30.529> against<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.009> wall<00:05:31.219> okay

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
hip is against the wall okay

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.510 
hip is against the wall okay
and<00:05:32.210> also<00:05:33.139> I'm<00:05:33.889> leading<00:05:34.639> with<00:05:34.849> my<00:05:34.969> right<00:05:35.449> hand
