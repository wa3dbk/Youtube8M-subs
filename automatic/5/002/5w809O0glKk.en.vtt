00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.259
 hi how are you all I was long ago 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.920
 time that a video on the 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.920
 greenhouse 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 well, good 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.869
 here there is 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.039
 I already have my nfc system and I have a while 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.019
 I started it 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.999
 and well I inhabit this appointment is giving 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.650
 the last ones according to the plants already 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.330
 I almost have the plants to renew 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.230
 and how can you see these are good 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.010
 lettuce 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.010
 and indentations 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.120
 and this example taught them the root 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.079
 these are the roots 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.900
 that's the one it 's a cap that I put for 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.010
 the maximum level of the instructional the 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.879
 height 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.390
 from a 20 liter bucket where is 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.409
 the bomb and are oxygenated stones hours 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.409
 of aquarium 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.829
 these are the italian girls i'm carving 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.810
 they are if flat last is the same because 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.950
 it is starting to open too much already 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.630
 they are there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.170
 let's say getting bitter a little bit because 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.560
 is a little more already they are happening 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.700
 here is another bleeding 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.700
 lettuce dried apricots 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.450
 and what else can he teach in this was the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.119
 system in 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.090
 and vertical tubes I had good 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.250
 results 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.909
 for vacation bar issues everything 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.569
 that was neglected, I would say 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.729
 pretty and good here were the 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.560
 cilantro scouts and good still follows 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.190
 we cut because it 's the club fighting the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.290
 same quantity and quality 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.290
 and in which I'm going to work an extreme 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.380
 and good here is also the tomatoes 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 in some bags there are states in these 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.230
 areas that are two rows there are only 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.670
 a tomato plant and here that is a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:22.560
 single row which are bags of 40 by 40 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.960
 There are 2 tomatoes per bag. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.240
 that are already 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.400
 flourishing 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.400
 quite large flowers 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.300
 quite big can not see here 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.300
 others 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.540
 and this 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.720
 I have symptoms of different varieties 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.720
 tomato and tomato 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.380
 the cherry and the tomato ball here as 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.900
 can see something that I recommend is 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.720
 a practice that must be carried out 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.740
 is cut 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.740
 the children 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.830
 or rather axial 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.190
 that come out of the 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.040
 you can make them come out between a sheet 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.709
 and the main stem 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.180
 and this helps because it did not develop 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:22.299
 I work another workshop producer and we 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.010
 ensures that it can be a fruit of greater 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.010
 larger quality 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.599
 and good here other advances as it is 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.090
 Swiss chard that will go for the cultivation 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.370
 vertical and for a camera that I have 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.099
 outside the greenhouse 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.730
 I have a chulito apple tree that is in 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.989
 plastic bag 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.569
 one is a bed on the floor that is 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.420
 wood lined with black plastic 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.780
 thick and as a substrate 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.230
 a mixture of gravel when watching well 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.200
 to record records like those used in 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.040
 construction material and coconut fiber 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.560
 and above a pearlite layer for 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.760
 that improves the rooting in the era 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.950
 early of the seedling 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.599
 I also have all these plants but 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.389
 Well, they are just starting to 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.389
 develop practically from cucumber 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.009
 tomatillo 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.830
 and here I have some strawberries this flower is already 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.430
 politicized is growing little by little and 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.830
 the others, well, it still does not look great 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.500
 progress here there is a 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.070
 this one flower production stem 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.169
 flower this there is also one and here there is 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.180
 another is total I think it's tomatillo 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.499
 first floor that looked practically 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.889
 alone the others in a 40 x 40 bag 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:05:02.479
 which has three strawberry plants 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.479
 is already producing stolons 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.000
 and little by little they are appearing a bit 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.000
 the roots 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.319
 this one 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.039
 are two plants are giving stolons and 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:22.810
 here you are already seeing a little bit that 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.810
 is coming out in this I do not think 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.670
 and here is 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.900
 until the spur 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.680
 a little spinach 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.680
 and some lettuces 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.039
 Italians in seedlings and horacio 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.590
 germ in the biodegradable foam for 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.910
 subsequently do the transplant and 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.810
 well I already have tomatitos 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.810
 mature 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.130
 they approach know 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:04.210
 the irrigation is not only partial yet 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:08.560
 I have not completed it is by means of a 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.210
 plastic pipe with drippers no 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.270
 I was necessarily behind but I 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.930
 it helps a little regular this the amount 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.930
 by plants 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.940
 and they are connected with a pump 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.490
 external fish tank 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:29.919
 and well here for example I have rosemary 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.919
 I do not know this saab I parsley 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.680
 but I think 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:38.490
 and well this would be everything and good as 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:43.050
 can see in the fp system I have the 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:45.960
 hose feed the system a 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:49.040
 drain is in this case for this this 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:55.190
 pipe and well this everyone has their 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:58.190
 your exits on this side is divided to 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.190
 feed 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.130
 every 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.350
 in each pipe and well then that would be 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.969
 everything already had a lot of time that did not go up 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.639
 but you can have time 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:14.219
 and to be able to climb the climb more 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:16.229
 videos and good are already some 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:19.379
 tell you that it is very important too 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:23.429
 tutorial the tomatoes to have a 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:27.700
 good workspace to make 

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:32.080
 Euro pruning of axial 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:36.400
 of the leaves that little by little then they go 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.400
 is doing this would be all this that 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.949
 that have very very good very good 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.960
 crops of italy is in this 

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:46.479
 spring since there are already some plants that 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.419
 they are ready to harvest and good 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:53.250
 I hope that everything is all together 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.250
 well and we'll see each other for the next
