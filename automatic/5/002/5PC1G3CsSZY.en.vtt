actually<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.630> YouTube<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.409> something<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.890> had

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
actually on YouTube or something I had

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.679 
actually on YouTube or something I had
to<00:01:11.430> research<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> myself<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.540> bit

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to research it myself a little bit

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
to research it myself a little bit
because<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.970> learn<00:01:15.210> these

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
because I you know I would learn these

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
because I you know I would learn these
rhythms<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.560> gigs<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
rhythms on gigs and not really know

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.039 
rhythms on gigs and not really know
where<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.210> came<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.900> very

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
where they came from but it's very

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.350 
where they came from but it's very
important<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> history<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> music

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
important to know the history of music

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.850

especially jazz if you're studying it or

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.760 
especially jazz if you're studying it or
any<00:01:23.159> other<00:01:23.369> style<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:25.049> Charleston<00:01:25.500> sounded

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
any other style the Charleston sounded

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
any other style the Charleston sounded
like<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:46.579> it<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> dance<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
like this it was a dance that's the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.679 
like this it was a dance that's the
Charleston<00:01:49.619> basically<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.180> actually

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
Charleston basically and it was actually

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:01.100 
Charleston basically and it was actually
much<00:01:51.810> faster<00:01:51.869> than<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:59.210> that<00:02:00.210> rhythm<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.899> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
much faster than that that rhythm was so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.880 
much faster than that that rhythm was so
common<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.890> Amy<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.299> common<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.719> jazz<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
common and Amy is so common in jazz that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.370 
common and Amy is so common in jazz that
I<00:02:04.950> didn't<00:02:05.460> realize<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
I didn't realize it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
I didn't realize it
some<00:02:07.380> songs<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> slower<00:02:08.610> Charleston

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
some songs have a slower Charleston

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.080 
some songs have a slower Charleston
rhythm<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.649> killer<00:02:10.950> Joe

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
rhythm like killer Joe

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.449 
rhythm like killer Joe
okay<00:02:13.930> now<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.800> rhythm<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:16.090> actually<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
okay now that rhythm is actually a

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.320 
okay now that rhythm is actually a
dotted<00:02:18.459> quarter<00:02:18.790> note<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.560> an<00:02:20.560> eighth<00:02:20.739> note

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
dotted quarter note and an eighth note

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.059 
dotted quarter note and an eighth note
that<00:02:22.330> I'm<00:02:22.450> doing<00:02:22.660> now<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> Charleston

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
that I'm doing now the Charleston

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.790 
that I'm doing now the Charleston
actually<00:02:24.370> was<00:02:24.550> two<00:02:24.940> dotted<00:02:25.410> quarter<00:02:26.410> notes<00:02:26.590> in

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
actually was two dotted quarter notes in

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.210 
actually was two dotted quarter notes in
a<00:02:27.069> row<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.580> quarter<00:02:28.569> note<00:02:28.690> at<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> end<00:02:29.220> so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
a row and a quarter note at the end so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.890 
a row and a quarter note at the end so
that's<00:02:30.819> slightly<00:02:31.090> different<00:02:31.360> than<00:02:31.630> what<00:02:31.690> we

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
that's slightly different than what we

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.390 
that's slightly different than what we
have<00:02:32.110> here<00:02:32.380> but<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:32.739> basically<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.220> same

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
have here but it's basically the same

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:44.190 
have here but it's basically the same
rhythm<00:02:33.640> they<00:02:34.480> would<00:02:34.630> go<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.959> really

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
rhythm they would go that's a really

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.890 
rhythm they would go that's a really
heavy<00:02:44.349> rhythm<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.769> be<00:02:44.860> playing<00:02:45.100> rhythmically

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
heavy rhythm to be playing rhythmically

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.830 
heavy rhythm to be playing rhythmically
in<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.080> group<00:02:47.319> okay<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.790> that's<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> basic

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
in a group okay so that's the basic

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.949 
in a group okay so that's the basic
Charleston<00:02:50.410> groove<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.450> use<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.720> killer

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
Charleston groove that we use on killer

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.780 
Joe so let's play like this if you look
on<00:02:56.140> your<00:02:56.290> music<00:02:57.420> such<00:02:58.420> as<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.599> seat<00:02:58.840> 13<00:02:59.290> which<00:02:59.530> is

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
on your music such as a seat 13 which is

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.660 

what<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.380> tend<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.799> do<00:03:08.980> with<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.310> rhythm<00:03:09.459> I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
what I tend to do with that rhythm I

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:18.060 
what I tend to do with that rhythm I
said<00:03:09.849> to<00:03:10.420> downstrokes<00:03:16.230> how<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.769> could<00:03:17.890> do<00:03:17.980> it
