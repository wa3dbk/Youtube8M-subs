volkswagen GTI now it makes power like

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.830 
volkswagen GTI now it makes power like
the<00:02:21.680> mazdaspeed3<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.060> much<00:02:23.450> more

one<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.260> main<00:02:27.470> ways<00:02:27.830> for<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.400> achieve<00:02:28.730> that

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
one of the main ways for to achieve that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.630 
one of the main ways for to achieve that
balance<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.600> by<00:02:30.260> integrating<00:02:31.130> both<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
balance is by integrating both the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.430 
balance is by integrating both the
torque<00:02:32.180> vectoring<00:02:32.540> control<00:02:32.600> system<00:02:33.320> that

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
torque vectoring control system that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.530 
torque vectoring control system that
they<00:02:33.500> use<00:02:33.650> even<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.040> regular<00:02:34.400> focus<00:02:34.820> with

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
they use even in the regular focus with

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.080 
they use even in the regular focus with
a<00:02:35.750> new<00:02:36.200> electric<00:02:36.830> power<00:02:37.040> steering<00:02:37.220> system<00:02:37.730> so

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
a new electric power steering system so
