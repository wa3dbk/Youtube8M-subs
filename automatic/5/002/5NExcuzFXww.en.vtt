things together better and this is some

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.230 
things together better and this is some
tips<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:17.779> been<00:00:18.779> using<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.800> several<00:00:20.070> years<00:00:20.490> it's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
tips I been using for several years it's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.679 
tips I been using for several years it's
first<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> all<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.949> need<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
first of all you need to know how to

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.540 
first of all you need to know how to
rotate<00:00:25.439> your<00:00:25.560> plates<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.099> course<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
rotate your plates and of course you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.359 
rotate your plates and of course you
already<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.119> using<00:00:27.930> egret<00:00:28.680> rotate<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
already know that using egret rotate the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.970 
already know that using egret rotate the
plate<00:00:29.689> but<00:00:30.689> holding<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.199> shift<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.769> same

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
plate but holding down shift at the same

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
plate but holding down shift at the same
time<00:00:32.570> makes<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> rotate<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:35.300> 45<00:00:36.300> degrees<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
time makes it a rotate in 45 degrees and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.290 
time makes it a rotate in 45 degrees and
like<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> grid<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.430> makes<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.239> much

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
like a grid and this makes it so much

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
like a grid and this makes it so much
easier<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.020> work<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.969> can

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
easier to work with and this way you can

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.190 
easier to work with and this way you can
align<00:00:42.450> things<00:00:43.020> much<00:00:43.829> easier<00:00:44.539> as<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.899> here

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
align things much easier as you see here

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.729 
align things much easier as you see here
it's<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.129> easier<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.140> rotate<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.200> yes

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it's much easier as I rotate it yes

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's much easier as I rotate it yes
so<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.700> put<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> I'm

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
so I'm gonna put it like this and I'm

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.939 
so I'm gonna put it like this and I'm
going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> show<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> place<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
going to show you how to place on it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.720 
going to show you how to place on it
second<00:00:53.789> tip<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.149> when<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.690> put<00:00:54.989> things<00:00:55.860> on

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
second tip is when you put things on

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.799 
second tip is when you put things on
other<00:00:57.300> things<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.039> weld

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
other things you know when you use weld

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.590 
other things you know when you use weld
easy<00:01:00.809> world<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:02.550> click<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:06.360> won't

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
easy world and you click it on you won't

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.170 
easy world and you click it on you won't
have<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.140> grid<00:01:07.560> anymore<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.700> will<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.970> very

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
have that grid anymore it will be very

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
have that grid anymore it will be very
hard<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.479> each<00:01:09.750> online<00:01:10.820> try

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.330 

I<00:01:15.230> did<00:01:15.830> pretty<00:01:16.040> good<00:01:16.160> but<00:01:17.590> as<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:18.950> see<00:01:19.160> this

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
I did pretty good but as you see this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.010 
I did pretty good but as you see this
it's<00:01:19.700> actually<00:01:20.450> not<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.900> line<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.340> therefore<00:01:23.090> we

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
it's actually not a line so therefore we

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.370 
it's actually not a line so therefore we
use<00:01:24.260> another<00:01:25.190> tool<00:01:25.550> called<00:01:25.960> precision<00:01:26.960> in

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
use another tool called precision in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.540 
use another tool called precision in
GMAT<00:01:28.160> 12<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:28.640> called<00:01:28.850> easy<00:01:29.090> position<00:01:30.400> if<00:01:31.400> you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
GMAT 12 it's called easy position if you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.170 
GMAT 12 it's called easy position if you
recognize<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.890> tool<00:01:34.960> makes<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.290> um

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
recognize it and this tool makes you um

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.300 
recognize it and this tool makes you um
having<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.479> lot<00:01:38.870> of<00:01:38.990> options<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.770> how<00:01:39.920> what<00:01:40.160> you

center of the rotation so you press in
this<00:01:53.509> side<00:01:53.750> here<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.170> rotator<00:01:55.040> that's<00:01:55.280> going

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
this side here and rotator that's going

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.620 
this side here and rotator that's going
to<00:01:55.580> be<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.759> center<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:57.340> third<00:01:58.340> tip<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.790> when

to be the center and third tip is when
you<00:01:59.780> are<00:01:59.960> building<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.800> need<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.100> get<00:02:01.280> smart

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
you are building you need to get smart

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.630 
you are building you need to get smart
snap<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:02.720> smart<00:02:03.080> snap<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:04.160> can<00:02:04.190> see<00:02:04.520> I'm

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
snap this smart snap you can see I'm

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.450 
snap this smart snap you can see I'm
using<00:02:04.850> right<00:02:05.119> here<00:02:05.300> then<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.530> just<00:02:07.100> makes<00:02:07.310> this

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
using right here then it just makes this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.050 
using right here then it just makes this
grid<00:02:07.790> on<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.540> easier<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:10.060> to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
grid on it so it's easier to like to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.979 
grid on it so it's easier to like to
find<00:02:11.360> their<00:02:12.110> middle<00:02:12.560> or<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.970> specific<00:02:14.720> side

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
find their middle or and a specific side

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.650 
find their middle or and a specific side
on<00:02:15.200> prop<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:16.610> way<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.000> want<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.510> be

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
on prop this way if I want this to be

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.810 
on prop this way if I want this to be
just<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.410> middle<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.280> other<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.610> can

just in the middle of this other I can
just<00:02:19.970> present<00:02:20.330> wood<00:02:20.660> precision<00:02:21.320> place<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.070> on

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
just present wood precision place it on

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.350 
just present wood precision place it on
the<00:02:22.280> other<00:02:24.070> using<00:02:25.070> smart<00:02:25.340> snap<00:02:25.549> how<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.730> like

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
the other using smart snap how I like

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.190 
the other using smart snap how I like
how<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.750> target<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.769> middle<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.310> present<00:02:28.940> II

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
how I target the middle is present II

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.289 
how I target the middle is present II
when<00:02:30.200> I'm<00:02:30.290> pressing<00:02:30.680> II<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.730> will<00:02:31.880> find<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
when I'm pressing II it will find the

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.070 
when I'm pressing II it will find the
nearest<00:02:34.239> grid<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.660> light<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:37.250> apply<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.090> if

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
nearest grid to light to apply on and if

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.570 
nearest grid to light to apply on and if
you<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.350> move<00:02:39.530> your<00:02:39.620> mouse<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.070> nearby<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
you just move your mouse and nearby the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.520 
you just move your mouse and nearby the
middle<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.390> press<00:02:41.600> E<00:02:41.810> you'll<00:02:42.080> find<00:02:42.410> it

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
middle and you press E you'll find it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.670 
middle and you press E you'll find it
and<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.400> when<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:43.670> place<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.360> other

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and so when you place it on the other

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.910 
and so when you place it on the other
yes

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
yes

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.810 
yes
so<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.880> reason<00:02:47.150> why<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.390> use<00:02:47.570> position<00:02:48.410> is

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
so the reason why you use position is

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.030 
so the reason why you use position is
when<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.060> are<00:02:50.239> using<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.989> will<00:02:51.830> have<00:02:52.010> a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
when you are using it you will have a

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.670 
when you are using it you will have a
lot<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.310> options<00:02:52.610> such<00:02:53.540> as<00:02:53.570> removing<00:02:54.260> moving

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
lot of options such as removing moving

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.970 
lot of options such as removing moving
and<00:02:54.830> such<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.280> also<00:02:55.880> when<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.959> desire<00:02:57.799> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
and such and also when you a desire to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.530 
and such and also when you a desire to
place<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:59.720> can<00:03:00.019> decide<00:03:00.860> how<00:03:01.580> much<00:03:02.030> amount

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
place it you can decide how much amount

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.259 
place it you can decide how much amount
of<00:03:02.780> space<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.860> be<00:03:04.010> between<00:03:04.519> these

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
of space there is to be between these

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.150 
of space there is to be between these
two<00:03:05.330> um<00:03:06.850> props<00:03:07.850> snap<00:03:08.600> distance<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.260> will

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
two um props snap distance you will

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.110 
two um props snap distance you will
let's<00:03:10.340> check<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.910> 222<00:03:12.130> let's<00:03:13.130> see<00:03:13.340> there<00:03:14.060> are

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
let's check it 222 let's see there are

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.520 
let's check it 222 let's see there are
some<00:03:14.209> people<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.690> server<00:03:14.930> who<00:03:15.110> s<00:03:15.290> one

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
some people in the server who s one

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.350 
some people in the server who s one
thing<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.100> it's<00:03:16.250> starting<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:16.970> be<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> little

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
thing so it's starting to be a little

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.220 
thing so it's starting to be a little
egg

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230

Asha's<00:03:19.260> as<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.400> see<00:03:20.670> there<00:03:20.940> else<00:03:21.120> there<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.660> a

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
Asha's as you see there else there is a

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.680 
Asha's as you see there else there is a
distance<00:03:22.830> between<00:03:22.920> them<00:03:23.430> now<00:03:23.610> well<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.480> don't

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
distance between them now well I don't

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.120 
distance between them now well I don't
know<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.340> alone<00:03:26.340> remove<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.880> again<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:28.130> set

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
know that alone remove it again and set

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.720 
know that alone remove it again and set
it<00:03:29.250> back<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.430> zero<00:03:29.880> because<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:31.110> makes<00:03:31.320> them

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
it back to zero because that makes them

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.190 
it back to zero because that makes them
much<00:03:32.730> better<00:03:32.880> just<00:03:34.250> yes<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.090> when<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.050> are

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
much better just yes so when you are

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.670 
much better just yes so when you are
building<00:03:37.350> I'm<00:03:40.310> use<00:03:41.310> move<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:43.260> thing

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
building I'm use move and the thing

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.350 
building I'm use move and the thing
about<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.160> tool<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.209> this

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
about this tool is that you have this

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.250 
about this tool is that you have this
rotation<00:03:46.260> snap<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.430> when<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.670> put<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.260> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
rotation snap so when you put it on it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.600 
rotation snap so when you put it on it
will<00:03:49.410> snap<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.640> rotation<00:03:51.180> which<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.610> right

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
will snap to a rotation which is right

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.740 
will snap to a rotation which is right
now<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.410> default<00:03:55.410> set<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.010> 15<00:03:56.520> I<00:03:56.760> can<00:03:57.480> change

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
now and default set to 15 I can change

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.229 
now and default set to 15 I can change
it<00:03:58.020> see<00:03:58.560> if<00:03:58.800> I<00:03:58.950> change<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.340> 45<00:04:02.239> you

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
it see if I change it to 45 you

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.470 
it see if I change it to 45 you
just<00:04:03.480> redo<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:04.020> if<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.040> change<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> 45<00:04:05.820> it

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
just redo this if I change the 45 it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.440 
just redo this if I change the 45 it
will<00:04:06.660> rotate<00:04:07.560> 45<00:04:08.010> degrees<00:04:08.580> each<00:04:08.790> time<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.239> move

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
will rotate 45 degrees each time I move

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.650 
will rotate 45 degrees each time I move
my<00:04:09.600> mouse<00:04:10.100> which<00:04:11.100> is<00:04:11.130> cool<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.330> very

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
the thing is when you're building um

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.730 
the thing is when you're building um
this<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:23.550> first<00:05:23.910> place<00:05:24.720> you're<00:05:25.140> clicking<00:05:25.470> on

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
this the first place you're clicking on

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.790 
this the first place you're clicking on
is<00:05:26.010> going<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.460> be<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:27.600> place<00:05:27.840> it's<00:05:28.530> going<00:05:28.740> to

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
is going to be the place it's going to

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280 
is going to be the place it's going to
be<00:05:28.890> targeted<00:05:29.580> or<00:05:29.730> placed<00:05:30.390> on<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.900> new<00:05:31.080> plate

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290
