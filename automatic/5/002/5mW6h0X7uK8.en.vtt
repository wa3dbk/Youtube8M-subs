tinker Meister here in a laboratory well
as<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.540> know<00:00:06.750> if<00:00:07.020> you've<00:00:07.200> been<00:00:07.350> watching<00:00:07.500> the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
as you know if you've been watching the

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.259 
as you know if you've been watching the
other<00:00:07.830> videos<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.429> have<00:00:08.460> been<00:00:08.849> doing<00:00:09.120> some

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
other videos we have been doing some

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.419 
other videos we have been doing some
experiments<00:00:09.960> regarding<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.679> oil<00:00:10.889> spill<00:00:11.309> in

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
experiments regarding the oil spill in

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.839 
experiments regarding the oil spill in
the<00:00:11.460> Gulf<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.910> Mexico<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.500> my

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
the Gulf of Mexico and this is my

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.340 
the Gulf of Mexico and this is my
simulated<00:00:14.849> Gulf<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> fish<00:00:15.719> tank<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
simulated Gulf this is a fish tank and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.269 
simulated Gulf this is a fish tank and
obviously<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:16.800> you're<00:00:16.920> doing<00:00:17.100> this

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
obviously if you're doing this

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.980 
obviously if you're doing this
experiments<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.000> home<00:00:18.029> make<00:00:18.420> sure<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.720> use<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
experiments at home make sure you use a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.529 
experiments at home make sure you use a
bowl<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:20.670> were<00:00:20.760> actually<00:00:20.939> gonna<00:00:21.210> need

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bowl and what were actually gonna need

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
bowl and what were actually gonna need
for<00:00:21.750> our<00:00:21.900> next<00:00:22.320> experiments<00:00:23.160> because<00:00:23.970> we're

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
for our next experiments because we're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
for our next experiments because we're
actually<00:00:24.300> looking<00:00:24.869> at<00:00:24.990> how<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.439> affects

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
actually looking at how it affects

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.310 
actually looking at how it affects
wildlife<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> especially<00:00:26.970> Birds<00:00:27.510> you're

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
wildlife and especially Birds you're

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.779 
wildlife and especially Birds you're
going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> need<00:00:28.650> some<00:00:28.859> bird<00:00:29.099> feathers<00:00:29.519> maybe

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
going to need some bird feathers maybe

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.160 
going to need some bird feathers maybe
you<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.060> go<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.510> walk<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.900> mom<00:00:31.050> or

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
you can go out for a walk with mom or

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.900 
you can go out for a walk with mom or
dad<00:00:31.320> somewhere<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.859> find<00:00:32.070> them<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.759> could

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
dad somewhere and find them or you could

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.670 
dad somewhere and find them or you could
even<00:00:33.000> maybe<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.809> from<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.110> pet<00:00:34.410> shop

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
even maybe get some from a pet shop

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.889 
even maybe get some from a pet shop
maybe<00:00:35.520> three<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:35.880> four<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.270> those<00:00:36.420> feathers

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
maybe three or four of those feathers

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
maybe three or four of those feathers
and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.530> obviously<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.219> oil<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:39.059> course

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and then obviously out oil of course

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
and then obviously out oil of course
we're<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.450> using<00:00:39.930> real<00:00:40.290> crude<00:00:40.739> oil<00:00:41.100> we're

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
we're not using real crude oil we're

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
we're not using real crude oil we're
actually<00:00:42.059> using<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:42.600> simulated<00:00:43.440> oil<00:00:43.649> which

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
actually using our simulated oil which

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.430 
actually using our simulated oil which
is<00:00:44.040> made<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.550> cooking<00:00:44.940> oil<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.360> cocoa<00:00:45.989> but

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
is made up of cooking oil and cocoa but

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.290 
is made up of cooking oil and cocoa but
it<00:00:46.530> certainly<00:00:46.860> looks<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.820> real<00:00:48.000> stuff

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it certainly looks like the real stuff

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.170 
it certainly looks like the real stuff
indeed<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:49.649> you're<00:00:49.829> also<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> need<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
indeed what you're also going to need is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.779 
indeed what you're also going to need is
actually<00:00:51.809> three<00:00:52.199> bowls<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:53.550> bowls

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
actually three bowls out of these bowls

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.959 
actually three bowls out of these bowls
we<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.180> our<00:00:54.719> first<00:00:55.050> Bowl<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.559> cold<00:00:56.309> water<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
we have our first Bowl is cold water and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.330 
we have our first Bowl is cold water and
then<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.899> our<00:00:58.440> second<00:00:58.890> Bowl<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.160> hot

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
then we have our second Bowl it's hot

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
then we have our second Bowl it's hot
water<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.879> too<00:01:00.059> hot<00:01:00.329> similar<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
water not too hot similar to what you

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
water not too hot similar to what you
would<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.500> wash<00:01:01.949> dishes<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.090> then

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
would actually wash dishes in and then

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.230 
would actually wash dishes in and then
our<00:01:03.449> third<00:01:03.750> Bowl<00:01:04.049> has<00:01:04.350> hot<00:01:04.979> water<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.880> same<00:01:06.060> as

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
our third Bowl has hot water the same as

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359 
our third Bowl has hot water the same as
the<00:01:06.330> second<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> also<00:01:07.530> has<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:07.950> dish

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the second one but it also has some dish

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
the second one but it also has some dish
detergent<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.600> well<00:01:10.080> now<00:01:10.770> obviously

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
detergent in there as well now obviously

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.640 
detergent in there as well now obviously
the<00:01:11.580> oil<00:01:11.820> does<00:01:12.240> affect<00:01:12.630> birds<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> birds

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the oil does affect birds when the birds

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
the oil does affect birds when the birds
get<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> oil<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:15.030> happens<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
get into the oil actually happens a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
get into the oil actually happens a
number<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> different<00:01:16.170> ways<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.189> can

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
number of different ways and as you can

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.160 
number of different ways and as you can
see<00:01:17.400> what's<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:18.000> happen<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.960> I'm

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
going to start dipping our feathers into

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.450 
going to start dipping our feathers into
the<00:01:21.210> oil<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.439> happens

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the oil and see what happens

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.950 
the oil and see what happens

oh my and if you actually look at that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
oh my and if you actually look at that
look<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.500> oil<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.040> coated<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> feather

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
look the oil is coated on the feather

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
look the oil is coated on the feather
I'm<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.509> master<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.229> actually<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.280> I'm

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I'm a master me actually and what I'm

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
I'm a master me actually and what I'm
gonna<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.790> I'm<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.060> dip<00:01:33.390> our<00:01:33.630> three

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
gonna do is I'm gonna dip our three

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
gonna do is I'm gonna dip our three
feathers<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> reason<00:01:36.360> why<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
feathers in here now the reason why this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.130 
feathers in here now the reason why this
actually<00:01:37.229> affects<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> birds<00:01:38.509> is<00:01:39.509> because

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
actually affects the birds is because

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.859 
actually affects the birds is because
the<00:01:40.409> feathers<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.759> oil<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.750> over

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the feathers when they get oil all over

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
the feathers when they get oil all over
them<00:01:43.110> you'll<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.290> actually<00:01:43.829> start<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
them you'll see actually start to get a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.249 
them you'll see actually start to get a
lot<00:01:44.640> heavier<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.299> actually<00:01:45.659> mats<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
lot heavier and this actually mats the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
lot heavier and this actually mats the
feathers<00:01:46.649> together<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:48.030> birds

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
feathers together now what birds

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
feathers together now what birds
automatically<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.740> preen<00:01:50.189> which

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
automatically do is they preen which

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
automatically do is they preen which
means<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:50.850> clean<00:01:51.299> themselves<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.439> do

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
means they clean themselves and they do

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560 
means they clean themselves and they do
this<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.100> beak<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.970> actually<00:01:54.119> clean

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this with a beak they actually clean

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
this with a beak they actually clean
their<00:01:54.780> feathers<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:55.740> fluff

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
their feathers and they actually fluff

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490 
their feathers and they actually fluff
them<00:01:56.579> off<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.210> acts<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.689> an<00:01:57.810> insulator

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
them off because it acts as an insulator

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.709 
them off because it acts as an insulator
they<00:01:58.829> put<00:01:58.979> air<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.460> between<00:01:59.579> there<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
they put air in between there and that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.990 
they put air in between there and that
actually<00:02:01.110> keeps<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.590> birds<00:02:01.829> warm<00:02:02.280> what

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
actually keeps the birds warm what

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.780 
actually keeps the birds warm what
actually<00:02:03.450> happens<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.439> oil<00:02:05.369> gets<00:02:05.640> on

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
actually happens when the oil gets on

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.639 
actually happens when the oil gets on
the<00:02:05.939> feathers<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> makes<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.840> very<00:02:07.020> difficult

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the feathers it makes it very difficult

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
the feathers it makes it very difficult
to<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.819> feathers

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
to do that and because the feathers

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
to do that and because the feathers
actually<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:10.020> Matty

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
actually get Matty

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.330 
actually get Matty
because<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.450> oil<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:13.410> actually<00:02:14.040> causes

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
because of the oil this actually causes

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.460 
because of the oil this actually causes
their<00:02:14.700> bodies<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.210> be<00:02:15.330> less<00:02:15.540> insulating<00:02:16.350> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
their bodies to be less insulating it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.410 
their bodies to be less insulating it
actually<00:02:16.800> causes<00:02:17.090> hypothermia<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:21.300> of

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
actually causes hypothermia and of

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.850 
actually causes hypothermia and of
course<00:02:21.600> what<00:02:21.780> happens<00:02:21.960> then<00:02:22.410> with<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> birds

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
course what happens then with the birds

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.500 
course what happens then with the birds
because<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.370> also<00:02:23.520> have<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.000> feathers<00:02:24.390> it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
because they also have this feathers it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.720 
because they also have this feathers it
causes<00:02:24.840> buoyancy<00:02:25.440> issues<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.340> why

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
causes buoyancy issues and this is why

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.090 
causes buoyancy issues and this is why
quite<00:02:27.150> often<00:02:27.390> you'll<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.780> oil<00:02:28.200> coated<00:02:28.860> birds

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
quite often you'll see oil coated birds

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.460 
quite often you'll see oil coated birds
actually<00:02:29.480> Beach<00:02:30.480> themselves<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.230> you'll<00:02:31.320> see

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
actually Beach themselves and you'll see

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.350 
actually Beach themselves and you'll see
them<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> beach<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.790> obviously<00:02:33.180> if

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
them up on the beach now obviously if

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
them up on the beach now obviously if
you<00:02:33.540> do<00:02:33.840> see<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> bird<00:02:34.350> like<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.890> want<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
you do see a bird like that you want to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.530 
you do see a bird like that you want to
make<00:02:35.220> sure<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.550> very<00:02:35.730> careful<00:02:35.910> certainly

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
make sure you be very careful certainly

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.090 
make sure you be very careful certainly
don't<00:02:36.810> touch<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.260> because<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.530> bird<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.860> very

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
don't touch it because the bird is very

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.180 
don't touch it because the bird is very
very<00:02:38.510> stressed<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> speak<00:02:40.260> what<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
very stressed out so to speak what you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.010 
very stressed out so to speak what you
need<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.460> do<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.760> speak<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.390> an<00:02:42.480> adult<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.960> an

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
need to do is speak to an adult and an

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.720 
need to do is speak to an adult and an
adult<00:02:43.320> can<00:02:43.500> call<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.920> nearest<00:02:44.190> authorities

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
adult can call the nearest authorities

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.310 
adult can call the nearest authorities
and<00:02:44.910> they'll<00:02:45.000> be<00:02:45.120> able<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.390> take<00:02:45.630> care<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:45.990> that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
and they'll be able to take care of that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.140 
and they'll be able to take care of that
and<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.100> they<00:02:47.220> actually<00:02:47.460> do<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:48.000> they'll

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
and what they actually do is they'll

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150 
and what they actually do is they'll
come<00:02:48.360> down<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.780> pick<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.140> bird<00:02:49.320> up<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.740> then

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
come down and pick the bird up and then

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.880 
come down and pick the bird up and then
actually<00:02:50.730> clean<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:52.710> we're

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
actually clean it so this is what we're

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
actually clean it so this is what we're
going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.100> do<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.520> have<00:02:53.730> our<00:02:53.940> three<00:02:54.690> feathers

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
going to do we have our three feathers

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.040 
going to do we have our three feathers
here<00:02:55.470> obviously<00:02:55.700> coated<00:02:56.700> very<00:02:56.970> much<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
here obviously coated very much in the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.690 
here obviously coated very much in the
oil<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.860> what<00:02:59.040> we're<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.550> we're

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
oil and what we're going to do is we're

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.940 
oil and what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.880> take<00:03:00.120> out<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.300> bowl<00:03:00.630> number<00:03:00.870> one<00:03:01.290> now

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
going to take out a bowl number one now

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.790 
going to take out a bowl number one now
bowl<00:03:02.280> number<00:03:02.580> one<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.940> cold<00:03:03.480> water<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.680> this

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
bowl number one is cold water and this

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.350 
bowl number one is cold water and this
is<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> type<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.340> water<00:03:05.460> obviously<00:03:05.730> you'd<00:03:06.030> find

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
is a type of water obviously you'd find

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.750 
is a type of water obviously you'd find
in<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.570> ocean<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.340> let's<00:03:08.340> see<00:03:08.490> if<00:03:08.520> it

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
in the ocean and let's see if it

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.580 
in the ocean and let's see if it
actually<00:03:09.090> cleans<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> oil<00:03:10.170> from<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
actually cleans up the oil from the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.090 
actually cleans up the oil from the
feather

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
feather

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.750 
feather
let's<00:03:11.370> dip<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.910> here<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.250> see<00:03:14.430> some<00:03:14.730> of

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
let's dip it in here and you see some of

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.790 
let's dip it in here and you see some of
the<00:03:14.970> oil<00:03:15.210> is<00:03:15.420> coming<00:03:15.450> off<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.140> not<00:03:16.290> very<00:03:16.530> much

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
the oil is coming off but not very much

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.160 
the oil is coming off but not very much
of<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.250> all<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.420> we're<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> get<00:03:22.020> rid

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
of it at all so we're going to get rid

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.250 
of it at all so we're going to get rid
of<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.380> not<00:03:22.890> very<00:03:23.160> successful<00:03:23.990> now<00:03:24.990> here<00:03:25.230> I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
of that not very successful now here I

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.480 
of that not very successful now here I
have<00:03:25.380> our<00:03:25.590> hot<00:03:26.010> water<00:03:26.280> as<00:03:26.580> well<00:03:28.010> try<00:03:29.010> another

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
have our hot water as well try another

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.950 
have our hot water as well try another
feather<00:03:29.790> right<00:03:30.090> here<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:33.600> we're<00:03:34.230> going<00:03:34.470> to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
feather right here and we're going to

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.060 
feather right here and we're going to
wash<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:36.990> off<00:03:37.290> see<00:03:37.500> it's<00:03:37.650> still<00:03:37.890> not<00:03:38.010> very

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
wash it off see it's still not very

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.070 
wash it off see it's still not very
clean<00:03:38.670> some<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> oils<00:03:39.420> coming<00:03:39.780> off<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
clean some of the oils coming off the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.170 
clean some of the oils coming off the
surface<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.890> actual<00:03:41.310> oil<00:03:41.520> that's<00:03:41.880> deep

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
surface but the actual oil that's deep

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.140 
surface but the actual oil that's deep
down<00:03:42.450> into<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> feather<00:03:43.290> isn't<00:03:44.130> coming<00:03:45.030> off

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
down into the feather isn't coming off

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.040 
down into the feather isn't coming off
at<00:03:45.330> all<00:03:45.950> place<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.190> one<00:03:47.340> there<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.930> then

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
at all place that one there and then

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.860 
at all place that one there and then
we're<00:03:49.170> going<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.350> try<00:03:49.650> our<00:03:49.890> final<00:03:50.730> Bowl<00:03:50.940> and

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
we're going to try our final Bowl and

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170 
we're going to try our final Bowl and
our<00:03:52.020> final<00:03:52.500> Bowl<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.860> what<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.250> experts<00:03:53.910> do

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
our final Bowl is what the experts do

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.720 
our final Bowl is what the experts do
actually<00:03:54.780> use<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> little<00:03:55.290> bit<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.500> dish<00:03:55.680> soap

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
actually use a little bit of dish soap

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.180 
actually use a little bit of dish soap
again<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> water<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.480> it's<00:03:58.140> hot<00:03:58.380> like<00:03:58.620> you

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
again the water is it's hot like you

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.280 
again the water is it's hot like you
would<00:03:59.340> wash<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.610> dishes<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.300> not<00:04:00.540> too<00:04:00.780> hot<00:04:01.020> and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
would wash the dishes in not too hot and

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.020 
would wash the dishes in not too hot and
then<00:04:01.980> what<00:04:02.130> we're<00:04:02.250> gonna<00:04:02.340> do<00:04:02.520> is<00:04:02.610> gonna<00:04:02.790> take

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
then what we're gonna do is gonna take

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.970 
then what we're gonna do is gonna take
our<00:04:03.180> feather<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.050> we're<00:04:04.200> gonna<00:04:04.290> put<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.770> in

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
our feather and we're gonna put it in

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.880 
our feather and we're gonna put it in
and<00:04:05.160> see<00:04:05.190> what<00:04:05.610> happens<00:04:06.210> here<00:04:06.540> now<00:04:06.720> as<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.740> can

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
and see what happens here now as you can

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.410 
and see what happens here now as you can
see<00:04:08.130> straight<00:04:08.370> away<00:04:08.490> without<00:04:08.820> me<00:04:09.120> not<00:04:09.300> even

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
see straight away without me not even

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.780 
see straight away without me not even
washing<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.080> feather<00:04:10.320> too<00:04:10.560> much<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.550> fact

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
washing the feather too much is the fact

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.000 
washing the feather too much is the fact
that<00:04:11.880> majority<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> oil<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:13.170> fact<00:04:13.470> look<00:04:13.770> at

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
that majority of the oil in fact look at

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.610 
that majority of the oil in fact look at
that<00:04:14.400> isn't<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.330> amazing<00:04:15.720> see<00:04:16.230> how<00:04:16.380> much

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
that isn't that amazing see how much

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.690 
that isn't that amazing see how much
cleaner<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:17.400> feather<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:19.489> give<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.520> a<00:04:20.669> good

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
cleaner this feather is give it a good

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.440 
cleaner this feather is give it a good
wash<00:04:21.830> there<00:04:22.830> we<00:04:22.980> go<00:04:23.220> now<00:04:23.430> if<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.640> compare<00:04:23.880> that

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
wash there we go now if you compare that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.170 
wash there we go now if you compare that
the<00:04:24.660> others<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.140> we<00:04:25.290> have<00:04:25.320> here<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.880> if<00:04:27.030> you

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
the others that we have here and if you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.690 
the others that we have here and if you
do<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.510> experiment<00:04:27.960> at<00:04:28.440> home<00:04:28.500> which<00:04:29.490> would

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
do this experiment at home which would

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.490 
do this experiment at home which would
you<00:04:29.880> rather<00:04:30.090> wash<00:04:30.480> birds<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:31.020> which<00:04:31.320> do<00:04:31.440> you

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
you rather wash birds in which do you

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.250 
you rather wash birds in which do you
think<00:04:31.890> would<00:04:32.070> be<00:04:32.100> most<00:04:32.580> successful<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:34.110> what

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
think would be most successful so what

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.140 
think would be most successful so what
I'm<00:04:34.380> going<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.620> do<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.920> go<00:04:35.250> ahead<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.520> clean<00:04:36.000> up

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
I'm going to do is go ahead and clean up

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.620 
I'm going to do is go ahead and clean up
our<00:04:36.330> other<00:04:36.570> feathers<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:39.180> if<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.420> could

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
our other feathers and if you could

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.020 
our other feathers and if you could
imagine<00:04:39.660> when<00:04:40.590> these<00:04:40.800> feathers<00:04:41.610> are<00:04:41.730> actually

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
imagine when these feathers are actually

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.880 
imagine when these feathers are actually
coated<00:04:42.480> or<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.690> talked<00:04:42.960> about<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.410> matting

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
coated or I talked about the matting

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.710 
coated or I talked about the matting
best<00:04:44.520> way<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.700> describe<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.390> is<00:04:45.480> if<00:04:45.630> you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
best way to describe it is if you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.660 
best way to describe it is if you
imagine<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.710> roof<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.310> your<00:04:47.340> house<00:04:47.640> for

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
imagine the the roof of your house for

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.790 
imagine the the roof of your house for
example<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.660> know<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.840> have<00:04:49.110> shingles<00:04:49.440> on

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
example you know you have shingles on

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.290 
example you know you have shingles on
there<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.100> what<00:04:50.250> actually<00:04:50.460> happens<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.180> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
there and what actually happens is the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.180 
there and what actually happens is the
shingles<00:04:51.720> are<00:04:51.870> laid<00:04:52.140> over<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.710> top<00:04:52.920> of<00:04:52.950> each

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
shingles are laid over the top of each

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.340 
shingles are laid over the top of each
other<00:04:53.400> like<00:04:53.640> this<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.360> actually<00:04:54.930> stops<00:04:55.230> the

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
other like this this actually stops the

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.870 
other like this this actually stops the
water<00:04:55.590> from<00:04:55.860> getting<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.400> house<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.820> it

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
water from getting in the house and it

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.210 
water from getting in the house and it
causes<00:04:57.090> it<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.420> run<00:04:57.600> off<00:04:57.780> very<00:04:58.500> much<00:04:58.590> like<00:04:59.040> it

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
causes it to run off very much like it

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.160 
causes it to run off very much like it
is<00:04:59.340> with<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.610> birds<00:04:59.820> feathers<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.840> when<00:05:01.020> the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
is with the birds feathers so when the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.870 
is with the birds feathers so when the
shingles<00:05:01.710> if<00:05:01.860> you're<00:05:02.010> on<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.310> house<00:05:02.460> started

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
shingles if you're on the house started

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.400 
shingles if you're on the house started
getting<00:05:03.150> misaligned<00:05:03.690> or<00:05:03.870> things<00:05:04.080> like<00:05:04.170> that

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
getting misaligned or things like that

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.050 
getting misaligned or things like that
it<00:05:04.620> would<00:05:04.740> actually<00:05:05.130> cause<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.550> roof<00:05:05.730> to<00:05:05.940> leak

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
it would actually cause the roof to leak

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.120 
it would actually cause the roof to leak
and<00:05:06.600> that's<00:05:06.750> exactly<00:05:07.170> what<00:05:07.500> happens<00:05:07.890> to<00:05:08.040> the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
and that's exactly what happens to the

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.330 
and that's exactly what happens to the
birds<00:05:08.510> that's<00:05:09.510> about<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.170> for<00:05:10.380> today<00:05:10.440> all<00:05:11.310> I

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340
