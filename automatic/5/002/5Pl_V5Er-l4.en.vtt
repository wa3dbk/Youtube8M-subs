00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
that much of a difference when I'm

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.770 
that much of a difference when I'm
playing<00:03:31.800> xbox<00:03:32.220> they<00:03:32.520> easily<00:03:32.850> fit<00:03:33.450> underneath

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
problem with them sitting behind the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.230 
problem with them sitting behind the
headset<00:03:37.890> which<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> know<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.850> primary

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
headset which is you know the primary

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.360 
headset which is you know the primary
goal<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> Gunners<00:03:40.200> was<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.590> they<00:03:40.800> wear<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
goal with the Gunners was so they wear a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.490 
goal with the Gunners was so they wear a
streamlined<00:03:42.050> but<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.080> can't<00:03:43.320> tell<00:03:43.440> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
streamlined but I can't tell a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.160 
streamlined but I can't tell a
difference<00:03:43.890> like<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.570> if<00:03:45.570> anything<00:03:45.960> I<00:03:46.050> feel

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
difference like I if anything I feel

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.480 
difference like I if anything I feel
like<00:03:46.290> my<00:03:46.410> headset<00:03:46.770> it's<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.220> bit<00:03:47.310> better

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
like my headset it's a little bit better

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.590 
like my headset it's a little bit better
than<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.730> did<00:03:47.880> before<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:50.610> only<00:03:51.000> negative

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
than I did before but the only negative

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.210 
than I did before but the only negative
that<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.810> have<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.260> Tiffany<00:03:52.680> does<00:03:52.830> not<00:03:53.040> have

that I have and Tiffany does not have
this<00:03:53.340> problem<00:03:53.400> when<00:03:53.730> she<00:03:53.850> wears<00:03:53.970> them<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.240> that

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
this problem when she wears them is that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.970 
this problem when she wears them is that
when<00:03:54.870> you're<00:03:54.990> wearing<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.260> headset<00:03:55.560> they<00:03:55.770> kind

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.160 
you kind of have to pull them back a
little<00:03:59.340> bit<00:03:59.490> it's<00:03:59.910> literally<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.750> only
