 class is good for you I went back 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:19.070
 I'm always in agreement 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:25.050
 three hello hello home 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:28.050
 today in oujda with me gay like 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.080
 that and we are at home at shuttle is it 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.690
 install a giant pyramid 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.420
 iron block with its block to the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.190
 on it he screwed speed 2 so it's 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.879
 why do we go fast like crazy 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 yeah there's even gold blocks even if it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.450
 had spent blocks doing the fieec 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 of their four young men what crazy 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.680
 these English this English way horns and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.449
 that's not why we came to do 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.800
 a two-voice video there we have some 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.520
 very important thing tell you he 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 wants to let you do the advertised 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.710
 so that's how there was a lot of 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 queries 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.070
 well are you figuring that the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.500
 applications if for open servers 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 so that means that in the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.400
 next few weeks we will see a 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.130
 open googledocs form and you 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.330
 you can send your applications 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.330
 to join a server studies 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:39.220
 or the slugz the ups so the connectors 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.560
 are open from when you 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.530
 to this video until last Thursday 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.260
 a holiday launched Thursday, November 8 but 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.780
 you see appear on the form 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.750
 so everything will be explained there it will take 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.240
 we will have to make a short video of 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.770
 presentation our demonstrations a little 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.460
 see what you do how you 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.930
 make your video quality all that same 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.440
 if after who was at the start either 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.760
 discriminating evening 100% so you the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.010
 will do its own doing a little text 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.510
 of francs for motivation 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.230
 sorry to say why you want 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.630
 join red hood and there is still 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.570
 some prerequisites to join the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.540
 server you must have already 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.860
 reality realized by donate an adventure 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:36.670
 follow up or 20 videos on his kraft hand 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:38.950
 because wanda explains to him pascal I 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.350
 was the case of people we recruited then 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.510
 that they had never made a video and 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.830
 they never did anything and we had to 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.080
 wines say aurevoir politely without 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.150
 space eyes we will keep nice but good 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.650
 a morning misdemeanor if you have it's not 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.140
 the settlement because in fact this is what 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.420
 that I wanted to say is that he 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.130
 should you be able to publish at 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.760
 month a video a week for that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.489
 a little bit more 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.319
 during the holidays a video so yes 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.819
 otherwise I thought there is not necessarily 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.379
 minecraft if you have other series 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.569
 it can be other things but he 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.590
 should also be quite active on red 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.170
 bull 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.819
 if you can not be published too much 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.909
 a video if you are active on earth 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.079
 has not yet aligned the goal anyway 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:29.329
 redwood is really about making 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:31.819
 generals so I think about just about everything 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.489
 after server level there is no 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.170
 really of regulation it's a little it 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.290
 just have to behave 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.970
 did not everyone ruin 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.849
 everyone's experience that's it 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.430
 really basic rules so 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:55.329
 just do not make people shit 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:57.409
 simple the actor is a regulation 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.150
 we are still able to fire you 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.920
 if you ever really are cons 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.940
 after we are not tyrants anyway 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.859
 and priori if you apply 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.769
 do you have enough 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.150
 my little body obviously needs to be motivated 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.919
 you want to play a priori not 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.230
 worry you there recruiters 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:22.290
 Regulation I hope 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.390
 so that's pretty much everything so do not 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.580
 do not neglect the city with two slots in 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.080
 the motivation text because that 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.030
 either points only mainly on 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.200
 that you will be judged if only 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.290
 on this fact so there should not 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.450
 neglect if you want to play so the 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.550
 link to the form will be in the 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.140
 description of our videos 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.720
 he will also be on the red site 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.800
 bull so redwood shoot minecraft point 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.050
 com and for more information all 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.060
 everything is explained in the form I 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:04.140
 think that this little clear fee I 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:06.060
 you've added author and Banon yes 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.960
 it's important but here we are 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.370
 found stuck 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.750
 finally that during the holidays so that 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.680
 you have plenty of time well 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.100
 tweaking your videos so it's not a 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.260
 race 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.660
 first come not 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.730
 first choose so take your time 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.490
 and do something good 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.530
 he was about two weeks old so 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.490
 if you return at the last moment 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.040
 as long as you go in the tran 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.410
 we're not going to daddy you wanted 6 side street 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:38.400
 sees the bomb kiss everyone 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:42.450
 kisses aubeterre jewelry steven no it's 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.440
 disgusting in fact was that the track 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.440
 goodbye
