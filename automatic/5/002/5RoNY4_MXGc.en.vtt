00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.800
 dates barista coria about the first client where 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.829
 find just win 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.659
 she first stage passed and atlanta and 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.810
 even a lot of effort thought 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.949
 by its positioning 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.689
 The situation fit thought out from TP 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.109
 she so what do we do next where we 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.949
 find a period and most importantly like 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:25.970
 hook on 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.340
 and so if I didn’t want to 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.009
 determine which market segment 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.439
 are you going to work 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.600
 someone like the client whatever 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.520
 entered spend time 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.140
 junior percent to meet and how 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.900
 Something values ​​and needs this very 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.330
 important gas in terms of psychology 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.780
 of sales 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.990
 your honor i 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.400
 but with different agencies 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.540
 restaurants photographer ruterford 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.060
 affiliate programs 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.930
 and it is very important to participate on 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.710
 various gas exhibitions and in Minsk first 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.960
 time you are yourself as a brand 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.420
 And think over this question and girlfriend, too, 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.370
 allocated gave exhibitions 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.580
 and think over your stand your table 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.280
 products which you more and there 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.130
 exhibit possible attempts tabachnik 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.770
 port materials flyer catalogs 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.500
 because the Kremlin owes you not only 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.369
 see 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.469
 new law on introducing the future we 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.720
 of course appeal to you 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.030
 percent pain 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.350
 so I recommend not just to communicate not 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.320
 just talking about your company who you are 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.920
 eat at home and talk about what 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 attracts 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590
 I advise you to think of this 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.300
 moment since the survey 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.200
 as part more 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.240
 the form on which you will write 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.790
 customer name telephone all contact details 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.910
 exit polls as desired needs may 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.100
 be some kind of financial newspaper 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.760
 zaman light up 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.870
 and they further this information will help 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.890
 you sell a number and for some projects 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.090
 selling services and one moment is certain 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.970
 those in which for their clients 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.390
 and the second festival can not do either 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.210
 one designer is a portfolio on 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510
 the initial stage is certainly not enough 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.190
 yourself and may not be 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.580
 and how then to make the structure 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.260
 night club this option in the garden 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.799
 office left 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.569
 boy strong and material 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.549
 let's turn to friends turn 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.560
 friends friends friends friends and for sure 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.569
 there is a couple who agree 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.939
 to work with such for the fall winter has stood 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.689
 man for example 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.869
 and you come up with the only one 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:28.269
 the project 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.529
 hara stressed Putin material yes from 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.869
 which all events will be created 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:34.730
 rao 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.849
 the advantages are obvious you have a plan 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.180
 events that have accumulated for the cold weather 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.450
 london or aside deliver all 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.650
 materials that 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.709
 five job at this event 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.929
 moreover, these tips are dollars 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.849
 when processing a portfolio they are in 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.949
 Consular Captain Photographer 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.919
 every professional time 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.769
 take care oao daaz conflict 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.590
 she is the way you can bring what 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.430
 then competition yes again for us their pairs for 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.429
 newlyweds and nii 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.269
 but provide them with some kind of service in 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.289
 a gift let's say amanda court 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.289
 photo shoots for natural gas that is 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.829
 is the same 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.459
 you are in the portfolio and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.179
 again rf yet half nobody else 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:17.729
 range of three services 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.539
 she gave him a few hundred such projects 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.789
 go you will find than girlhood 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.539
 subsequent customers 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
 34 need to continue this unconditionally class 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.289
 she is 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.689
 let it be beautiful but because I 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.340
 to him should reflect 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.239
 victims of elements accuracy in decent 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.129
 the place is about the movie which we talked about 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.680
 as well as important communication of various 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.239
 social network axa communication various blogs ooo 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.719
 but excerpts free meetings 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.629
 among potential customers 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.450
 all this is very important and there is a recession with advice 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.099
 weeks data master classes however on 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.839
 raising our level 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.129
 market or respectively 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.519
 client training 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.840
 and at the first meeting it is very important to give 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.559
 understand a son to the customer that you 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.179
 professional in his business 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.869
 and he has problems you have a solution only 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:10.709
 three know 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.619
 how to do better how to do igor 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.009
 grishunin yes then at what points can 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.009
 save forecasters 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.499
 in no case be impossible 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.379
 there are situations when instead of imposing 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:22.229
 their point of view extracts water even 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.459
 parents somehow attack this 

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.860
 happens when 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.229
 but 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.889
 parents pay for weddings 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.400
 there hang some sort of sponsorship 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.289
 support 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.909
 so this point is worth considering what 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.590
 outfits learn to ride 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.389
 not to fight back to Ukraine and 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.749
 very solid 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.029
 opinion persuade Syria 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.129
 beetles exactly 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.419
 talk about your idea of ​​exactly those 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.349
 parties for free in which she will 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.340
 the most advantageous 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.849
 oh that's why it's very important to find them 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.039
 approach to any customer is his turn 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.110
 needs 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.430
 everyone makes their own blog for us their 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.710
 friends and relatives yes 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.680
 then the idea of ​​decor nand is absolutely not 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.360
 primary fades into the background 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.939
 someone on the contrary departments for themselves 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.530
 she is 10 over the post on the project Shah Deniz 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.039
 sorry and yan gives maximum 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.539
 and the time of maximum idea is maximum money 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:22.960
 to this position 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.000
 and who wants it so quickly and cheaply and 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.690
 qualitatively in terms of perfect 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.400
 impossible i think that he will face 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.509
 a problem 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.419
 She certainly experience comes help 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.360
 Korea can work then sighted 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.529
 theater again work on their 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.169
 positioning well in front of the client 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.499
 they themselves went through it and we 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.169
 encountered such a problem and that idea 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.509
 they don't always understand themselves 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.650
 make all the projects with the press 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.030
 and unfortunately lacked such a post 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.520
 however, with the advent of got 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.840
 so it's halfway and moving on although I 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.840
 I remain a particular chance that this 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.300
 wrong approach 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.909
 and then there is something possible 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.499
 solution led 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.979
 loss of new customers 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.259
 having studied this issue the countries of toronto and 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.750
 pianist training and master classes 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.379
 plan for how 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.869
 Estonian church cost customers so 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.469
 the elements are she now 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.839
 and does not give its results 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.919
 so the solution is yourself 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.430
 the most important award is a professional in his 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.699
 business
