00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everyone this video is dedicated to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 the small tasks of preparation or 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.570
 DIY or home maintenance 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 that we can make this in particular 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.849
 which is dedicated to the topic of covering 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.470
 holes that we have in the wall of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.890
 things that we have had hanging 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.779
 pictures et cetera etcetera and the same 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.789
 for example on painted walls of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.550
 colors we can cover them with 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.380
 tapas cookies water plagues plaster 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.869
 different elements to cover 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 the holes in the wall if we cover them 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 directly with said material the same 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 It is white so we will have 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.110
 double task of first covering and then 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 have to paint the wall with color 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.120
 that it is clear that if we gave in 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.250
 white with a white plaster because many 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.250
 Sometimes we will avoid painting but good 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.160
 in this case it is not the theme the wall is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 yellow so if 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.620
 we cover initially because we will have two 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.469
 tasks a task that you can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.170
 solve or what or what can be 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.540
 simplify would be instead of performing 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.480
 mass 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.740
 with water is that we make with paint 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.610
 the same wall paint that we have 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.060
 used 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.670
 As you can see, the painting is the same as 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.840
 Therefore, we are going to organize the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.520
 dough with paint 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.890
 in this case we will use the paint 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.469
 yellow we put a little paint 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.770
 in the bowl where we are going to make the 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:38.960
 mass and I already say this way we're going to 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.040
 perform two tasks of the same run 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.040
 we put a little 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 from the field forums that we are going to use 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.270
 we base it on the painting 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.490
 so that we have one more mass 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.250
 homogeneous possible and I already say is a 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.920
 way to simplify to see just one 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.619
 thrown 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.689
 perform the task of plugging holes 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.689
 and that we stay as perfect as possible 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.890
 we knead 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.340
 because depending on the case that we have to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.910
 add a little more paint 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.910
 we add a little 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.359
 the painting the property that it has that is 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.659
 being more pasty and drier than the 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.659
 Water 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.950
 the mass is much more hardened 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.660
 more original with water the dough is left 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.570
 much more loose 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.720
 well we have our mass 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.060
 practically molded with the same 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.060
 color that the wall has 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.450
 and we are not ready to cover 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.450
 the holes 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:58.280
 and there we have it, I'm going to focus the camera 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.280
 and we see how it would look 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.849
 there we have our little holes that 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.180
 we need to cover the life of our 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:14.430
 mass and nothing is simply 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.030
 and applying a little bit of dough 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.470
 in order to plug the hole 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.370
 and leave the wall as even 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.370
 possible 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.510
 in this way at the time that it dries 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.300
 the dough that we have made in the dough 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.600
 with paint and the wall will be left 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.270
 fairly homogeneous 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.970
 and I say the most likely thing is that we 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.230
 avoid having to repaint the wall and 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.500
 that in this way we will remain 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.870
 the two such simplifies the second this 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.019
 for example this for example is quite 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.879
 useful when we do jobs in 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.280
 somewhere is not a job to 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.900
 us because we really do 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.060
 it does not matter if it takes a little longer or 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.980
 a little less when we make a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.290
 work for example for some is paisa 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.720
 or maintenance of farms or 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.750
 maintenance of hotels and others what 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.610
 matter is from a single run and leave the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.980
 task done and list not having to 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.170
 come back I say this way we would have 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.870
 treated the hole and we would not have to 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.340
 worry about when we have to return to 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.280
 repaint the wall since the same 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.190
 will be ready then nothing until this 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.020
 little advice because this trick is not 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.210
 It is a technique that painters 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.160
 they use very often is a technique 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.789
 usual and nothing for those who do not 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.199
 I knew it is always good to spread 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.900
 things that we do not know how to learn from 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.490
 others is but retains utility and that 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.550
 when you have to cover some kind of 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.890
 hole in house 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.620
 or somewhere where you are working 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.040
 besides, you know that you can 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.800
 do in this way 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.800
 and I say we can let you solve it 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.030
 a single pass the holes that 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.600
 let's have on the wall 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:07.400
 we are giving this little touches what 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.780
 and we will also leave the box like this 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.060
 that the screws will have to be given 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.440
 a pintana but good the theme of the 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.470
 holes is what mattered in this 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.180
 video because nothing always I hope that 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.820
 I have liked you to be useful 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.280
 that the most important thing and a greeting and that 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.120
 continue visiting the web and videos 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.120
 Try for yourself
