00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.610
 further explain what it is the one 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.110
 internet not because very many people 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 leave comments on photos or 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 ask each other questions drive 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.820
 answers on the internet 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.439

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.369
 Funny and people under pretty well 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.960
 grammars what sometimes yes absolutely not 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.050
 only many Africans ok I know 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.290
 but sometimes it was 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:58.390
 from logo bcs all this ok but so you have 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.040

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.840

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.130
 internet not videos internet not 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.600
 internet doesn't border on everything and it over 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.620
 meister and everything for editing the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.240
 so camera 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.190
 it may look a lot more time for me 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.710
 see what children post share the work 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.270
 say the name is so so this is very 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.370
 easy to edit and it is also possible 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.010
 pretty funny and this is it 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.460
 rising me from the vlog you later take 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.280

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.510

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.560

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.590

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.110
 king kind had kept on the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.640
 original day this could be yes but it 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.140
 actually made me nothing at all 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.700
 but nice weather everyone is with family 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.140

 That's no reason you had to be 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.080

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.580
