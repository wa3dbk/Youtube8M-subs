00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
okay so this is my friend Mason here and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.049 
okay so this is my friend Mason here and
he's<00:00:09.080> going<00:00:09.350> to<00:00:09.440> he's<00:00:09.860> volunteered<00:00:10.430> to<00:00:10.670> take<00:00:11.000> a

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
he's going to he's volunteered to take a

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.540 
he's going to he's volunteered to take a
pepper<00:00:11.330> ball<00:00:11.570> or<00:00:11.870> two<00:00:12.160> in<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.370> name<00:00:13.519> of

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
pepper ball or two in the name of

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.330 
pepper ball or two in the name of
science<00:00:14.000> to<00:00:14.720> find<00:00:15.230> out<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.590> defective<00:00:15.950> yeah

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
science to find out the defective yeah

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.179 
science to find out the defective yeah
pretty<00:00:17.060> much<00:00:17.180> how<00:00:17.540> you<00:00:18.140> just<00:00:18.349> hit<00:00:18.710> up<00:00:18.860> pace

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
pretty much how you just hit up pace

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.830 
pretty much how you just hit up pace
with<00:00:19.400> one<00:00:19.580> day<00:00:19.759> and<00:00:19.939> asked<00:00:20.150> if<00:00:20.210> anybody<00:00:20.420> wanted

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
with one day and asked if anybody wanted

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.050 
with one day and asked if anybody wanted
to<00:00:20.930> do<00:00:21.080> it<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:21.890> figured<00:00:22.550> I<00:00:22.640> would<00:00:22.669> take<00:00:22.910> the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
to do it and I figured I would take the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.729 
to do it and I figured I would take the
chance<00:00:23.270> because<00:00:23.630> I<00:00:23.930> am<00:00:24.079> interested<00:00:24.619> in

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739 
chance because I am interested in

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.979 
chance because I am interested in
non-lethal<00:00:25.189> weapons<00:00:25.700> and<00:00:25.939> being<00:00:26.450> able<00:00:26.599> to<00:00:26.750> use

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
non-lethal weapons and being able to use

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.359 
non-lethal weapons and being able to use
them<00:00:27.169> so<00:00:27.470> you<00:00:27.529> don't<00:00:27.770> have<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.009> worry<00:00:28.279> about

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
them so you don't have to worry about

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.370 
them so you don't have to worry about
harming<00:00:28.880> another<00:00:28.970> individuals<00:00:29.779> life<00:00:30.020> but<00:00:30.259> at

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
harming another individuals life but at

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.659 
harming another individuals life but at
least<00:00:30.470> protecting<00:00:31.040> yourself<00:00:31.399> individually

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
least protecting yourself individually

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.940 
least protecting yourself individually
so<00:00:32.630> that's<00:00:32.780> one<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.260> biggest<00:00:33.559> reasons<00:00:33.829> why

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
so that's one of the biggest reasons why

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.000 
so that's one of the biggest reasons why
I<00:00:34.100> went<00:00:34.309> ahead<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:34.670> volunteered<00:00:35.120> for<00:00:35.239> this

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
alright so in the name of science may be

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.180 
alright so in the name of science may be

into your chest

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.520 
into your chest
how<00:01:36.399> did<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.550> feel<00:01:36.690> well<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:37.869> definitely<00:01:38.080> was

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
how did it feel well it definitely was

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.609 
how did it feel well it definitely was
uh<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.940> was<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.119> rushing<00:01:40.660> assailant<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.470> would

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
uh if I was a rushing assailant it would

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.080 
uh if I was a rushing assailant it would
have<00:01:41.710> definitely<00:01:41.830> stopped<00:01:42.220> me<00:01:42.369> for<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.640> second

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
have definitely stopped me for a second

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.670 
have definitely stopped me for a second
unless<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.479> was<00:01:43.690> probably<00:01:43.930> on<00:01:44.140> drugs<00:01:44.500> or

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
unless I was probably on drugs or

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.930 
unless I was probably on drugs or
adrenaline<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.399> would<00:01:45.520> have<00:01:45.610> been<00:01:45.700> able<00:01:45.789> to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
adrenaline I would have been able to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.499 
adrenaline I would have been able to
just<00:01:46.149> completely<00:01:46.810> look<00:01:47.200> past<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.039> as<00:01:48.310> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
just completely look past that so as a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.389 
just completely look past that so as a
saying<00:01:49.509> for<00:01:49.720> everyday<00:01:49.990> non-lethal<00:01:50.710> use<00:01:51.190> to

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
saying for everyday non-lethal use to

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.870 
saying for everyday non-lethal use to
carry

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
carry

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.630 
carry
yes<00:01:52.539> if<00:01:53.289> you're<00:01:53.500> going<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.710> use<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.130> for<00:01:54.160> an

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
yes if you're going to use it for an

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.499 
yes if you're going to use it for an
every<00:01:55.210> everyday<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:56.020> would<00:01:56.410> probably<00:01:56.590> get<00:01:56.979> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
every everyday I would probably get a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.520 
every everyday I would probably get a
product<00:01:58.509> I<00:01:58.600> would<00:01:58.750> get<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.899> more<00:01:59.110> expensive

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
product I would get a more expensive

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.999 
product I would get a more expensive
pepper<00:02:00.190> ball<00:02:00.539> or<00:02:01.539> I<00:02:01.990> guess<00:02:02.320> that<00:02:02.530> around

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
pepper ball or I guess that around

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:03.990 
pepper ball or I guess that around
oh<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.159> course<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.490> could<00:02:03.640> have<00:02:03.670> used<00:02:03.909> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
oh of course I could have used the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.820 
oh of course I could have used the
rubber<00:02:04.210> balls<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.750> if<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.200> pepperball<00:02:05.560> hurt

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
rubber balls and if the pepperball hurt

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.679 
rubber balls and if the pepperball hurt
and<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.189> rubber<00:02:06.400> rubber<00:02:06.939> ball<00:02:07.270> will

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
and the rubber rubber ball will

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.749 
and the rubber rubber ball will
definitely<00:02:08.440> drop<00:02:08.679> somebody<00:02:08.950> I've<00:02:09.280> seen<00:02:09.549> that

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
definitely drop somebody I've seen that

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
definitely drop somebody I've seen that
before<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.209> that's<00:02:10.989> probably<00:02:11.590> one<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.799> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
before and that's probably one of the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.229 
before and that's probably one of the
biggest<00:02:12.040> things<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.370> would<00:02:12.549> use<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:12.910> understand

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
biggest things I would use on understand

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.479 
biggest things I would use on understand
let's<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.500> against<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.250> pepper

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
let's just have that against this pepper

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.250 
let's just have that against this pepper
ball<00:02:15.730> now<00:02:16.239> keep<00:02:16.510> in<00:02:16.630> mind<00:02:16.660> we<00:02:16.930> are<00:02:16.959> out<00:02:17.230> here

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
ball now keep in mind we are out here

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.050 
ball now keep in mind we are out here
with<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.709> wind<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.130> blowing<00:02:18.280> about<00:02:18.519> 20<00:02:18.910> miles

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
with the wind is blowing about 20 miles

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.300 
with the wind is blowing about 20 miles
an<00:02:19.239> hour<00:02:19.329> true<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.680> should<00:02:20.920> do<00:02:21.130> this

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
an hour true I think we should do this

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.050 
an hour true I think we should do this
another<00:02:21.670> time<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.420> indoors<00:02:23.230> closed<00:02:23.709> area<00:02:24.130> to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
another time and indoors closed area to

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.550 
another time and indoors closed area to
get<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.239> better<00:02:25.390> effect<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:26.140> see<00:02:26.320> how<00:02:26.380> that

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
get a better effect to see how that

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.020 
get a better effect to see how that
would<00:02:26.650> go<00:02:26.709> but<00:02:27.070> then<00:02:27.220> again<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.790> could<00:02:27.970> be

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
would go but then again you could be

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.180 
would go but then again you could be
outdoors<00:02:28.540> when<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.049> happens<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.829> based<00:02:30.040> on

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
outdoors when this happens so based on

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.680 
outdoors when this happens so based on
basically<00:02:30.670> experiment<00:02:31.120> we<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.390> did<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.540> think

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
basically experiment we just did I think

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.940 
basically experiment we just did I think
I<00:02:31.959> would<00:02:32.019> rather<00:02:32.200> keep<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.590> loaded<00:02:32.739> with

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
I would rather keep it loaded with

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.069 
I would rather keep it loaded with
rubber<00:02:33.190> balls<00:02:33.459> yes<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:34.180> would<00:02:34.630> definitely<00:02:34.989> do

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
rubber balls yes I would definitely do

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.870 
rubber balls yes I would definitely do
that<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> pepper<00:02:36.250> behind<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.640> rubber

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
that and if the pepper behind the rubber

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.460 
that and if the pepper behind the rubber
ball<00:02:37.090> weighs<00:02:37.360> like<00:02:37.570> three<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:37.959> four<00:02:38.110> times<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
ball weighs like three or four times the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.110 
ball weighs like three or four times the
amount<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:38.980> pepper<00:02:39.220> ball<00:02:39.459> does<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:39.970> if

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
amount that that pepper ball does so if

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.610 
amount that that pepper ball does so if
the<00:02:40.269> pit<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.660> pepperball<00:02:41.049> breezed<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.500> up

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
the pit the pepperball breezed you up

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.009 
the pit the pepperball breezed you up
like<00:02:41.769> that<00:02:42.010> then<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.360> only<00:02:43.480> imagine<00:02:43.630> what

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
like that then I can only imagine what

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.020 
like that then I can only imagine what
the<00:02:44.110> rubber<00:02:44.290> ball<00:02:44.470> would<00:02:44.650> feel<00:02:44.829> like<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.430> could

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the rubber ball would feel like I could

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.610 
the rubber ball would feel like I could
definitely<00:02:46.209> see<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.720> rubber<00:02:46.900> ball<00:02:47.140> drop<00:02:47.470> from

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
definitely see the rubber ball drop from

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.720 
definitely see the rubber ball drop from
somebody<00:02:48.010> because<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.519> have<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> good<00:02:50.489> I'd<00:02:51.489> say
