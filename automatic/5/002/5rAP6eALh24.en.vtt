there<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:38.690> on<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.260> sides<00:00:42.500> that's<00:00:43.500> doing<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
there on on the sides that's doing it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.990 
there on on the sides that's doing it
down<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> bottom<00:00:46.550> this<00:00:47.550> sides<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
down here on the bottom this sides not

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.729 
down here on the bottom this sides not
doing<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.250> basically<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
doing it on this one but basically I

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.319 
doing it on this one but basically I
started<00:00:52.739> looking<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.399> closer<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.149> see

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
started looking a little closer to see

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.459 
started looking a little closer to see
what<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.079> what's<00:00:55.530> causing<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
what was going on what's causing this I

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.670 
what was going on what's causing this I
noticed<00:00:58.469> when<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.920> first<00:00:59.899> went<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> close<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
noticed when I first went to close the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
noticed when I first went to close the
door<00:01:03.799> it<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:08.340> didn't<00:01:08.610> want<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> close<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
door it it didn't want to close all the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
door it it didn't want to close all the
way<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.430> gets<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.979> right<00:01:13.979> there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
way it gets to about right right there

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.690 
way it gets to about right right there
and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.990> resistance<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and then I get some resistance and if I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
and then I get some resistance and if I
I'll<00:01:18.060> push<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.630> you'll<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
I'll push it and you'll see it kind of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.929 
I'll push it and you'll see it kind of
bounces<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.460> doesn't<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
bounces right back it doesn't want to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.170 
bounces right back it doesn't want to
shut<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.150> ahead<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> force<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.049> shut

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
shut so I can go ahead and force it shut

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
shut so I can go ahead and force it shut
right<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.909> stays<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> went<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
right there and it stays so I went to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.700 
right there and it stays so I went to
the<00:01:35.070> check<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.810> causing<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.650> not

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the check to see what was causing it not

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.060 
the check to see what was causing it not
just<00:01:37.890> shut<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> found<00:01:39.420> was<00:01:39.890> I'm<00:01:40.890> not

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
just shut and what I found was I'm not

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.469 
just shut and what I found was I'm not
sure<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:42.060> able<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.329> see

the way closed so you'll see if you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.650 
the way closed so you'll see if you
watch<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:27.450> watch<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:29.190> hinge<00:02:30.190> here<00:02:30.519> as<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:31.420> shut

pulling away from the plexi as I as I
shut<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:32.489> basically<00:03:33.489> what's<00:03:33.700> happening<00:03:33.790> is

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.330 
shut it basically what's happening is
when<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:40.290> when<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.410> metal<00:03:41.799> bracket<00:03:42.160> here

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
when this when this metal bracket here

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.360 
when this when this metal bracket here
comes<00:03:42.670> in<00:03:42.819> contact<00:03:43.060> with<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.750> piece<00:03:44.370> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
comes in contact with this piece the

the<00:03:51.430> way<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:51.850> when<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.630> door<00:03:52.810> flexes<00:03:53.319> that's

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
the way and when the door flexes that's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.970 
the way and when the door flexes that's
what's<00:03:53.739> causing<00:03:54.269> causing<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:56.739> piece

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
what's causing causing this this piece

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.150 
what's causing causing this this piece
of<00:03:57.010> trim<00:03:57.400> here<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.910> pull<00:03:58.090> away<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:59.769> basically

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
of trim here to pull away so basically

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.589 
of trim here to pull away so basically
what<00:04:00.370> needs<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.700> happen<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:01.209> they<00:04:01.299> need<00:04:01.480> to

what needs to happen is they need to

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.559 
what needs to happen is they need to
take<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:05.040> come<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:06.130> with<00:04:06.280> some<00:04:06.459> new<00:04:06.569> pieces
