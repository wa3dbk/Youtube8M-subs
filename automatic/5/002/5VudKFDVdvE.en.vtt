all you need and then the last thing I
do<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.959> hit<00:02:10.200> web<00:02:10.770> optimized<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:13.260> click

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
do is I hit web optimized and I click

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.949 
do is I hit web optimized and I click
start

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
start

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.449 
start
now<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.290> may<00:02:16.560> take<00:02:16.799> a<00:02:17.390> minute<00:02:18.390> or<00:02:18.720> two<00:02:19.459> but

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
now this may take a minute or two but

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.780 
now this may take a minute or two but
the<00:02:20.849> point<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.530> yeah<00:02:23.069> exactly<00:02:23.310> it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the point of it is that yeah exactly it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.990 
the point of it is that yeah exactly it
turns<00:02:24.209> out<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.569> it's<00:02:24.750> exactly<00:02:25.290> two<00:02:25.409> minutes

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
turns out that it's exactly two minutes

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.229 
turns out that it's exactly two minutes
so<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.629> goes<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:28.439> lot<00:02:28.680> faster<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.790> file<00:02:30.030> is

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
so this goes a lot faster the file is

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.440 
so this goes a lot faster the file is
about<00:02:30.500> 3.5<00:02:31.500> gigs<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.849> gonna<00:02:32.970> check<00:02:33.269> it

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
about 3.5 gigs I'm just gonna check it

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.899 
about 3.5 gigs I'm just gonna check it
out<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:41.220> file<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.730> I'm

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
out it's actually the file that I'm

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.390 
out it's actually the file that I'm
editing<00:02:42.569> right<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.409> actually<00:02:45.530> 3.5<00:02:46.530> gigs

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
editing right now is actually 3.5 gigs

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.360 
editing right now is actually 3.5 gigs
now<00:02:47.730> imagine<00:02:48.000> uploading<00:02:48.810> 3.5<00:02:49.620> gigs<00:02:50.010> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
now imagine uploading 3.5 gigs to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.140 
now imagine uploading 3.5 gigs to
YouTube<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:51.209> would<00:02:51.480> take<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:52.079> while<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:53.150> also

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
YouTube it would take a while and also

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.180 
YouTube it would take a while and also
not<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.019> upload<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:55.769> then<00:02:55.980> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
not just to upload it but then to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.970 
not just to upload it but then to
process<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.909> because<00:02:57.299> YouTube<00:02:57.750> converts<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
process it because YouTube converts the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.720 
process it because YouTube converts the
files<00:02:59.250> as<00:02:59.700> well<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.889> this<00:03:01.889> goes<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> lot<00:03:02.489> faster

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
files as well so this goes a lot faster

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.010 
files as well so this goes a lot faster
I'm<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.030> speed<00:03:06.299> up<00:03:06.329> this

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
I'm going to speed up this

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.780 
I'm going to speed up this
boom<00:03:08.740> and<00:03:09.070> it's<00:03:09.400> done<00:03:10.350> now<00:03:11.350> let's<00:03:11.590> see<00:03:11.950> how

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
boom and it's done now let's see how

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.660 
boom and it's done now let's see how
well<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.150> went

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
well it went

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.690 
well it went
121<00:03:15.670> megabytes<00:03:16.600> which<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.500> pretty<00:03:18.040> freakin

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
121 megabytes which is pretty freakin

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.810 
121 megabytes which is pretty freakin
amazing<00:03:19.510> compared<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:20.950> original<00:03:21.520> file

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
amazing compared to the original file

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.070 
amazing compared to the original file
file<00:03:22.630> which<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.080> 3.5<00:03:23.830> gigs<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:25.330> we<00:03:25.570> related<00:03:25.990> a

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
file which is 3.5 gigs so we related a

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.120 
file which is 3.5 gigs so we related a
good<00:03:26.320> job<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.870> quality<00:03:28.870> might<00:03:29.170> ask<00:03:29.350> what's

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
good job and quality might ask what's

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.440 
good job and quality might ask what's
the<00:03:30.280> difference<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.820> quality<00:03:32.220> well<00:03:33.240> as<00:03:34.240> you're

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
the difference in quality well as you're

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.860 
the difference in quality well as you're
probably<00:03:34.720> gonna<00:03:35.020> find<00:03:35.350> out<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:37.420> gonna<00:03:37.600> put

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
probably gonna find out just gonna put

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.520 
probably gonna find out just gonna put
these<00:03:38.050> side-by-side<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:40.570> quality<00:03:41.230> is

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
these side-by-side the quality is

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.010 
these side-by-side the quality is
actually<00:03:42.960> pretty<00:03:43.960> much<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.920> same<00:03:46.020> sometimes

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
actually pretty much the same sometimes

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.260 
actually pretty much the same sometimes
you<00:03:47.500> get<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.710> little<00:03:47.980> bit<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.280> conversion<00:03:48.940> but

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
you get a little bit of conversion but

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.360 
you get a little bit of conversion but
I'm<00:03:49.450> telling<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.990> I<00:03:50.290> couldn't<00:03:50.770> tell<00:03:51.010> the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
I'm telling you I couldn't tell the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.320 
I'm telling you I couldn't tell the
difference<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:52.720> these<00:03:52.930> bad<00:03:53.230> boys<00:03:57.030> okay<00:03:58.030> and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
difference on these bad boys okay and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.100 
difference on these bad boys okay and
there<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.690> have<00:03:58.720> it

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
there you have it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.670 
there you have it
we've<00:04:00.010> successfully<00:04:01.110> converted<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.290> really

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
we've successfully converted a really

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.850 
we've successfully converted a really
big<00:04:02.920> file<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.910> made<00:04:04.360> it<00:04:04.510> much<00:04:04.810> smaller<00:04:05.080> so<00:04:05.710> it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
big file and made it much smaller so it

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.490 
big file and made it much smaller so it
will<00:04:06.070> make<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.760> lot<00:04:07.090> quicker<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.870> upload<00:04:08.470> to

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
will make it a lot quicker to upload to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.580 
will make it a lot quicker to upload to
