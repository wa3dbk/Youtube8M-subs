really struggle with because it is

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.869 
really struggle with because it is
something<00:00:35.989> that<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:36.289> cannot<00:00:36.680> do<00:00:37.039> using<00:00:37.730> your

previous methods in this case
dimensional<00:00:41.359> analysis<00:00:41.840> is<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.230> best<00:00:42.469> way<00:00:42.710> to

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
dimensional analysis is the best way to

dimensional analysis is the best way to
solve<00:00:43.070> these<00:00:43.370> problems<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.090> something<00:00:44.539> that

solve these problems and something that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.970 
solve these problems and something that
you<00:00:44.809> should<00:00:44.960> get<00:00:45.079> really<00:00:45.379> comfortable<00:00:45.620> with

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
you should get really comfortable with

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.799 
you should get really comfortable with
you<00:00:46.250> can<00:00:46.730> do<00:00:46.820> these<00:00:46.969> multiple<00:00:47.359> dimension

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
you can do these multiple dimension

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.330 
you can do these multiple dimension
problems<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.379> can<00:00:48.530> do<00:00:48.620> any<00:00:48.859> dimensional

problems you can do any dimensional
analysis<00:00:49.820> problem<00:00:51.039> so<00:00:52.039> let's<00:00:52.250> say<00:00:52.460> we<00:00:52.609> want<00:00:52.760> to

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
analysis problem so let's say we want to

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.450 
analysis problem so let's say we want to
know<00:00:52.910> how<00:00:53.090> many<00:00:53.149> centimeter<00:00:53.690> squares<00:00:54.079> are<00:00:54.289> in

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
know how many centimeter squares are in

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.419 
know how many centimeter squares are in
4.3<00:00:55.460> meters<00:00:56.239> squared<00:00:56.890> we're<00:00:57.890> starting<00:00:58.280> with

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
4.3 meters squared we're starting with

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.360 
4.3 meters squared we're starting with
and<00:00:58.789> looking<00:00:59.329> for<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.980> number<00:01:01.280> of

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
and looking for the number of

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.709 
and looking for the number of
centimeters<00:01:01.879> squared<00:01:02.179> that's<00:01:02.449> aren't

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
centimeters squared that's aren't

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.220 
centimeters squared that's aren't
looking<00:01:03.079> for<00:01:03.289> data<00:01:03.469> we're<00:01:04.370> given<00:01:04.910> that<00:01:05.230> there

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
looking for data we're given that there

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.490 
looking for data we're given that there
are<00:01:06.290> four<00:01:06.500> point<00:01:06.770> three<00:01:07.160> meters<00:01:07.910> squared<00:01:08.500> so

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
are four point three meters squared so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.990 
are four point three meters squared so
we<00:01:09.590> need<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.860> get<00:01:10.010> rid<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.220> meters<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:10.850> go<00:01:10.940> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
we need to get rid of meters and go to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.130 
we need to get rid of meters and go to
centimeters<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:11.660> we<00:01:11.780> don't<00:01:11.960> know<00:01:12.110> a

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
centimeters but we don't know a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.960 
centimeters but we don't know a
conversion<00:01:12.650> factor<00:01:12.890> between<00:01:13.190> meter<00:01:13.580> squared

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
conversion factor between meter squared

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.090 
conversion factor between meter squared
and<00:01:14.150> centimeters<00:01:14.450> squared<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.230> do<00:01:15.500> know<00:01:15.770> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
and centimeters squared we do know that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.650 
and centimeters squared we do know that
for<00:01:16.520> each<00:01:16.880> meter<00:01:18.010> there's<00:01:19.010> a<00:01:19.100> hundred

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
for each meter there's a hundred

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.470 
for each meter there's a hundred
centimeters<00:01:21.220> we're<00:01:22.220> going<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.610> square<00:01:23.090> that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
centimeters we're going to square that

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.060 
centimeters we're going to square that
so<00:01:26.480> it<00:01:26.750> ends<00:01:26.990> up<00:01:27.140> being<00:01:27.200> four<00:01:27.740> point<00:01:27.980> three

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
so it ends up being four point three

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.990 
so it ends up being four point three
meters<00:01:28.640> squared<00:01:28.940> is<00:01:29.240> equal<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.490> 100<00:01:31.490> squared

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
meters squared is equal to 100 squared

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.270 
meters squared is equal to 100 squared
which<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.660> ten<00:01:32.930> thousand<00:01:33.560> centimeters

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
which is ten thousand centimeters

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.820 
which is ten thousand centimeters
squared<00:01:34.580> per<00:01:34.790> one<00:01:35.660> instead<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.620> being<00:01:36.770> a

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
squared per one instead of being a

to<00:02:03.640> start<00:02:03.880> with<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.299> need<00:02:04.329> to<00:02:04.479> figure<00:02:04.719> out<00:02:04.840> the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
to start with we need to figure out the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.160 
to start with we need to figure out the
volume<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.710> centimeters<00:02:06.549> cubed<00:02:07.299> so<00:02:07.840> I'm<00:02:07.930> going

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
volume in centimeters cubed so I'm going

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.169 
volume in centimeters cubed so I'm going
to<00:02:08.259> find<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.800> volume<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.340> will<00:02:09.459> do<00:02:09.580> three<00:02:09.879> point

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
to find the volume I will do three point

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.520 
to find the volume I will do three point
four<00:02:11.790> centimeters<00:02:12.810> times<00:02:14.340> twelve<00:02:15.340> point<00:02:15.700> one

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
four centimeters times twelve point one

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.440 
four centimeters times twelve point one
centimeters<00:02:17.640> times<00:02:18.750> eight<00:02:19.750> point<00:02:20.230> six

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
centimeters times eight point six

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.180 
centimeters times eight point six
centimeters<00:02:22.860> plug<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:23.950> into<00:02:24.099> your

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
centimeters plug this into your

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:39.880 
centimeters plug this into your
calculator<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.360> get<00:02:31.560> 353<00:02:32.560> point<00:02:33.099> eight

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.420 

so<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:40.930> rectangular<00:02:41.930> box<00:02:42.200> has<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:43.210> volume<00:02:44.210> of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
so this rectangular box has a volume of

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.070 
so this rectangular box has a volume of
350<00:02:46.430> three<00:02:46.670> point<00:02:46.940> eight<00:02:47.120> centimeters<00:02:47.780> cubed

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
350 three point eight centimeters cubed

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.990 
350 three point eight centimeters cubed
and<00:02:48.620> remember<00:02:49.070> from<00:02:49.340> what<00:02:49.730> we<00:02:49.820> watched

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and remember from what we watched

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.420 
and remember from what we watched
previously<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:51.200> one<00:02:51.440> centimeter<00:02:51.920> cube<00:02:52.280> is

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
previously that one centimeter cube is

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.250 
previously that one centimeter cube is
equal<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.820> one<00:02:53.030> milliliter<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.810> if<00:02:53.870> we<00:02:53.960> wanted

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
equal to one milliliter so if we wanted

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.340 
equal to one milliliter so if we wanted
to<00:02:54.320> we<00:02:54.590> could<00:02:54.740> say<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.160> also<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:56.080> 350<00:02:57.080> three

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
to we could say this also is 350 three

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.280 
to we could say this also is 350 three
point<00:02:57.740> eight<00:02:58.750> milliliters

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
point eight milliliters

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.350 
point eight milliliters
now<00:03:00.740> what<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:00.980> questions<00:03:01.310> asking<00:03:01.730> but<00:03:02.210> that

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
now what the questions asking but that

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.300 
now what the questions asking but that
is<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> one-to-one<00:03:02.930> conversion<00:03:03.710> so<00:03:04.160> if<00:03:04.220> we

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
is a one-to-one conversion so if we

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.400 
is a one-to-one conversion so if we
wanted<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.550> say<00:03:04.790> convert<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.600> liters<00:03:05.630> we

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
wanted to say convert that to liters we

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.300 
wanted to say convert that to liters we
could<00:03:06.680> then<00:03:06.860> go<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.550> leaders<00:03:08.380> now<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:10.070> want<00:03:10.250> to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
could then go to leaders now we want to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.040 
could then go to leaders now we want to
convert<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.970> millimeters<00:03:11.480> cubed<00:03:11.810> and

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
convert this to millimeters cubed and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.460 
convert this to millimeters cubed and
meters<00:03:12.530> cubed<00:03:13.300> I'd<00:03:14.300> like<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.630> try<00:03:14.930> each<00:03:15.230> of

cubed<00:05:06.320> I<00:05:08.470> want<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.560> cancel<00:05:09.830> centimeters<00:05:11.169> go<00:05:12.169> to

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
cubed I want to cancel centimeters go to

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.150 
cubed I want to cancel centimeters go to
meters<00:05:13.120> one<00:05:14.120> meter<00:05:14.449> for<00:05:14.930> every<00:05:15.169> 100

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
meters one meter for every 100

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.260 
meters one meter for every 100
centimeters<00:05:18.130> we're<00:05:19.130> gonna<00:05:19.280> need<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.669> cube<00:05:20.060> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
centimeters we're gonna need to cube the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.340 
centimeters we're gonna need to cube the
whole<00:05:20.449> thing<00:05:21.460> so<00:05:22.460> 350<00:05:23.270> three<00:05:23.840> point<00:05:24.350> eight

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
whole thing so 350 three point eight

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.830 
whole thing so 350 three point eight
centimeters<00:05:27.350> cubed<00:05:29.680> 1<00:05:30.680> cubed<00:05:31.100> is<00:05:31.370> 1<00:05:33.310> 100<00:05:34.310> cubed

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
centimeters cubed 1 cubed is 1 100 cubed

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:43.480 
centimeters cubed 1 cubed is 1 100 cubed
is<00:05:36.460> 1<00:05:37.460> million<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.800> in<00:05:42.889> this<00:05:42.979> case<00:05:43.190> I've<00:05:43.370> been

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
is 1 million so in this case I've been

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:55.300 
is 1 million so in this case I've been
divided<00:05:43.880> by<00:05:44.150> 1<00:05:44.389> million<00:05:49.720> and<00:05:50.720> I<00:05:50.840> would<00:05:51.050> get

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.690 

meters<00:05:56.300> cubed<00:05:56.860> point<00:05:57.860> zero<00:05:58.250> zero<00:05:58.730> zero<00:05:58.850> three

five<00:06:01.700> three<00:06:02.180> eight<00:06:03.580> meters<00:06:04.840> cube<00:06:06.130> this<00:06:07.130> is<00:06:07.310> a

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
five three eight meters cube this is a

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.250 
five three eight meters cube this is a
decimal<00:06:07.669> place<00:06:07.940> here<00:06:08.150> so<00:06:10.690> these<00:06:11.690> conversions

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
decimal place here so these conversions

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.540 
decimal place here so these conversions
are<00:06:12.350> a<00:06:12.380> little<00:06:12.590> different<00:06:12.980> you<00:06:13.040> need<00:06:13.220> to<00:06:13.370> set

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
are a little different you need to set

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.720 
are a little different you need to set
up<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:14.240> conversion<00:06:14.630> that<00:06:15.410> you<00:06:15.650> know<00:06:15.889> between
