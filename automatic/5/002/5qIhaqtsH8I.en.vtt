00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
it's just it's really frustrating to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.910 
it's just it's really frustrating to
come<00:04:27.460> across

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
come across

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.310 
come across
and<00:04:28.010> I've<00:04:28.940> won<00:04:29.510> games<00:04:29.750> with<00:04:29.930> 90th<00:04:30.230> minute

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
and I've won games with 90th minute

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.230 
and I've won games with 90th minute
goals<00:04:30.650> I've<00:04:30.830> scored<00:04:31.340> plenty<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.790> 45th<00:04:32.180> minute

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
goals I've scored plenty of 45th minute

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.330 
goals I've scored plenty of 45th minute
goals<00:04:32.600> so<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.260> know<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.440> goes<00:04:33.590> both<00:04:33.620> ways<00:04:34.070> it's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
goals so you know it goes both ways it's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.640 
goals so you know it goes both ways it's
just<00:04:34.550> very<00:04:34.760> weird<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:35.990> I've<00:04:36.110> talked<00:04:36.320> about<00:04:36.530> it

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
just very weird and I've talked about it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.140 
just very weird and I've talked about it
before<00:04:36.740> where<00:04:37.160> once<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.490> score<00:04:37.730> a<00:04:37.760> goal<00:04:37.940> it

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
before where once you score a goal it

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.610 
before where once you score a goal it
seems<00:04:38.390> like<00:04:38.570> you're<00:04:38.720> on<00:04:38.840> your<00:04:39.020> heels<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.470> rest

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
seems like you're on your heels the rest

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.740 
seems like you're on your heels the rest
of<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.800> game<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.090> just<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.600> know

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
of the game and that you just you know

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.540 
of the game and that you just you know
you're<00:04:41.930> defending<00:04:42.290> if<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.980> get<00:04:43.100> up<00:04:43.220> two<00:04:43.400> or

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
you're defending if you get up two or

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.340 
you're defending if you get up two or
three<00:04:43.790> nil<00:04:43.970> it's<00:04:44.180> better<00:04:44.480> but<00:04:44.720> like<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:45.080> one

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
three nil it's better but like that one

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.020 
three nil it's better but like that one
nil<00:04:45.620> it's<00:04:45.830> almost<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.250> if<00:04:46.610> you're<00:04:46.790> up<00:04:46.880> one

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
nil it's almost like if you're up one

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.340 
nil it's almost like if you're up one
nila<00:04:47.240> halftime<00:04:47.570> you're<00:04:47.750> guaranteed<00:04:48.170> to<00:04:48.230> give
