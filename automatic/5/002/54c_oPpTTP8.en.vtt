00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:04.861
 Two words are often just thrown into the wind 

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.903
 and interchanged 

00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:09.693
 I think we should be in a few minutes 

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:15.243
 explain the difference between salt and sodium. 

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:16.944
 We know that both words are linked, 

00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:20.277
 but I would like to explain the exact differences between them, 

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:22.999
 and at least make some sense ... 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.186
 so often repeated numbers ... 

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.064
 how much I should give each day. 

00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:30.343
 When you say salt, I recall ... 

00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:32.230
 salt house at my home ... 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.409
 which is next to the pepper shaker. 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.999
 Dinner at any time ... 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.810
 very often I touch her. 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.632
 Sometimes I think I'm too much salt. 

00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:43.565
 Am I more than I should? 

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:47.686
 I thought about it in the context of a spoon. 

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:50.804
 If we have a spoon, say a teaspoon ... 

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:54.854
 salts. 

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.710
 Let's just take the teaspoon of salt. 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.446
 And I'll consider it. 

00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:02.776
 And I'll consider it. 

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.418
 We find that 1 teaspoon of salt ... 

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.270
 weighs approximately 6 grams. 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.140
 I'll write it here. 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.437
 So it's about 6 grams. 

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:16.276
 6 g corresponds to 6,000 mg. 

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:19.902
 So this is the weight of one teaspoon of salt. 

00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:21.078
 Now the question arises: 

00:01:21.078 --> 00:01:25.024
 How much of it is sodium? 

00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:26.112
 To answer, we know that ... 

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:31.639
 sodium chloride (NaCl) is a [table] salt. 

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.110
 From this, the salt is composed. 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.766
 If I imagine that in my salt shaker ... 

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.909
 is nothing but sodium choride ... 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.812
 Nothing else got into the salt. 

00:01:40.812 --> 00:01:44.808
 No other substances except NaCl. 

00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:48.463
 So I can assume that 6,000 g of salt ... 

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:51.104
 it will be sodium or chloride. 

00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:55.231
 Now it is "On", I will express myself clearly ... 

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.503
 the sodium part. 

00:01:57.503 --> 00:01:59.511
 And "Cl" is the chloride moiety. 

00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:01.308
 That's what it means. 

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:07.527
 And all atoms have atomic mass. 

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:11.570
 We can even consider atoms 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.021
 and sort them by size 

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:17.191
 which has the lowest and which highest weight. 

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:21.563
 Sodium weighs approximately 23 units. 

00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:24.495
 The chloride weighs around 35. 

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:27.692
 So, here's the chloride, here's the sodium. 

00:02:27.692 --> 00:02:34.106
 When we sum it up, we get 58 units. 

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:40.357
 Unit is atomic mass. 

00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:44.163
 Now that we have total atomic mass, 

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:47.445
 we can find out what part 

00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:50.024
 it occupies sodium and what part of chloride. 

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:53.637
 For the first part, which is sodium, 

00:02:53.637 --> 00:03:00.610
 I can take 23 units over 58 units (whole). 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.030
 I can strike units. 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.521
 That gives us about 40%. 

00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:09.106
 So approximately 40% by weight of salt 

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.527
 comes from the sodium part. 

00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:15.602
 The chloride part is the rest. 

00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:18.359
 So I have 35 units broken 58 units. 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.022
 That's about 60%. 

00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:23.694
 Again, the units can be deleted. 

00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:26.608
 So I know that in salt 

00:03:26.608 --> 00:03:29.358
 40% by weight is sodium 

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:31.933
 60% is chloride. 

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:36.068
 Now I have to go back to the teaspoon. 

00:03:36.068 --> 00:03:40.276
 I had 6 g (or 6,000 mg) in the teaspoon. 

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:44.112
 So in a teaspoon, I can simply multiply it 

00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:45.692
 with those numbers to get 

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.509
 how much weight comes from sodium 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.779
 and how much it comes from chloride. 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:55.172
 Sodium accounts for 40% of the 6,000. 

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:57.868
 If we multiply these two numbers, 

00:03:57.868 --> 00:04:04.672
 we get 2,400 mg of sodium. 

00:04:04.672 --> 00:04:12.141
 60% x 6,000 mg = 3,600 mg of chloride. 

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.270
 So I know that in every teaspoon 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.461
 I have 2,400 mg of sodium. 

00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.175
 I really saw it and I was looking 

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:23.028
 there are some recommendations as to how many 

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:24.938
 Sodium should be given when dieting. 

00:04:24.938 --> 00:04:27.523
 If you don't have any health issues, 

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:28.408
 in general, 

00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:40.131
 I would call it "normal". 

00:04:40.131 --> 00:04:43.606
 This is a common quantity 

00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:48.026
 and that would be for a diet with few salts. 

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:49.361
 If you are on a diet that requires little salt 

00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:50.909
 find out how much salt 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.609
 is expected to be taken. 

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:55.068
 Or how much sodium is expected to be taken. 

00:04:55.068 --> 00:04:56.855
 And the same for normal diets. 

00:04:56.855 --> 00:04:59.529
 How much salt you should take on a normal diet. 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.748
 I'll do it both from a salt perspective 

00:05:03.748 --> 00:05:06.197
 as well as the sodium perspective. 

00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:08.307
 Let's make an analysis for sodium first. 

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:09.961
 Normal Amounts You Should Take 

00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:16.297
 I'll write "per day". 

00:05:16.297 --> 00:05:23.520
 Sodium, and here we will do the salt analysis. 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.859
 Normal amount of sodium 

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:26.523
 which you should take in a day 

00:05:26.523 --> 00:05:35.279
 is about 2,300 mg. 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.356
 On a diet that requires little salt, 

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:41.041
 you should take approximately 1500 mg daily. 

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:46.190
 We now know that one teaspoon has 2400 mg. 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.907
 2,400 and 2,300 are very close. 

00:05:50.907 --> 00:05:55.363
 I will therefore assume that this means 

00:05:55.363 --> 00:06:02.673
 that I can take approximately 1 teaspoon of salt a day. 

00:06:02.673 --> 00:06:04.469
 On a low salt diet 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.356
 It is recommended that you do not enjoy more than 

00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:09.004
 about 1,500 mg of sodium. 

00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:12.856
 If one teaspoon corresponds to 2,400 mg, 

00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:18.196
 then 1,500 mg are approximately 2/3 of a teaspoon of salt. 

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:26.525
 When I look at a teaspoon of salt, 

00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:30.306
 I always remember if this is my teaspoon, 

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:30.500
 so if I'm on a regular diet, 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.195
 basically I can have one teaspoon a day. 

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:38.606
 No 1 at each meal, but 1 a day. 

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.328
 If I'm on a diet with a limited amount of salt, 

00:06:40.328 --> 00:06:43.431
 I can only fill the spoon up to 2/3. 

00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.897
 and here I must quit, 

00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:47.862
 because it's the sodium limit 

00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:49.000
 which I have recommended.
