00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.259 

last<00:00:07.290> month<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:08.010> started<00:00:08.519> working<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
last month I started working on a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.180 
last month I started working on a
separate<00:00:09.630> little<00:00:09.870> project<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.800> one<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.070> my

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
separate little project on one of my

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.280 
separate little project on one of my
little<00:00:11.460> side<00:00:11.670> things<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.840> actually<00:00:13.200> at

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
little side things and it's actually at

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.629 
little side things and it's actually at
the<00:00:13.349> point<00:00:13.559> where<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.950> want<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.219> show<00:00:14.340> something

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the point where I want to show something

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.609 
the point where I want to show something
at<00:00:15.000> QuakeCon<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> first<00:00:16.350> ever

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
at QuakeCon so this is the first ever

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.230 
at QuakeCon so this is the first ever
look<00:00:16.890> where<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.340> going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.699> actually<00:00:18.000> demo

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
look where I'm going to actually demo

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:29.179 
look where I'm going to actually demo
something<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:27.240> little<00:00:27.900> iPhone<00:00:28.349> big

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
something here so little iPhone big

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.889 
something here so little iPhone big
enormous<00:00:29.670> TV<00:00:30.300> screen<00:00:35.270> all<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:36.510> where's<00:00:36.780> my

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
enormous TV screen all right where's my

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:58.380 
enormous TV screen all right where's my
evening<00:00:37.890> table<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:40.370> which<00:00:41.370> opt<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> cable

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:18.530 

range

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.760 

okay<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:21.330> actually<00:01:22.330> thought<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.110> figured<00:01:23.650> out

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
okay so I actually thought I figured out

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.560 
okay so I actually thought I figured out
most<00:01:24.040> technically<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.730> how<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:24.880> wanted<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.450> do

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
most technically of how I wanted to do

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.600 
most technically of how I wanted to do
this<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:26.110> little<00:01:26.650> over<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.890> year<00:01:26.950> ago<00:01:27.160> when<00:01:27.520> we

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
this a little over a year ago when we

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.830 
this a little over a year ago when we
were<00:01:27.700> talking<00:01:27.880> about<00:01:28.060> doing<00:01:28.360> something<00:01:28.720> on

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
were talking about doing something on

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.550 
were talking about doing something on
the<00:01:28.960> weak<00:01:29.140> eye<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.700> when<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.210> set<00:01:31.480> out<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:32.440> go

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
the weak eye but when I set out to to go

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560 
the weak eye but when I set out to to go
ahead<00:01:32.680> if<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.670> went<00:01:33.850> really<00:01:34.120> fairly

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
ahead if this went really fairly

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.230 
ahead if this went really fairly
smoothly<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.770> here<00:01:36.010> we<00:01:36.160> have<00:01:36.370> really<00:01:36.760> all<00:01:37.000> of

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
smoothly and here we have really all of

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.730 
smoothly and here we have really all of
the<00:01:37.330> mega<00:01:37.540> textures<00:01:37.990> goodness<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.590> we're

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
the mega textures goodness that we're

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.580 
the mega textures goodness that we're
used<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.190> range<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.730> in<00:01:40.450> many<00:01:40.690> ways<00:01:40.930> this

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
used to in range and in many ways this

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.550 
used to in range and in many ways this
is<00:01:41.650> incredibly<00:01:42.520> cool<00:01:42.760> on<00:01:43.120> an<00:01:43.210> iPad<00:01:43.630> where<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
is incredibly cool on an iPad where the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.800 
is incredibly cool on an iPad where the
touch<00:01:44.800> moving<00:01:45.460> around<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.060> looking<00:01:46.330> at<00:01:46.480> it

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
touch moving around and looking at it

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.570 
touch moving around and looking at it
I've<00:01:47.110> been<00:01:47.350> severely<00:01:47.710> clever<00:01:48.070> things<00:01:48.430> to

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
I've been severely clever things to

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.730 
I've been severely clever things to
approximate<00:01:49.240> sub-pixel<00:01:49.660> precision<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
approximate sub-pixel precision on the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.010 
approximate sub-pixel precision on the
movement<00:01:51.160> and<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.970> visceral<00:01:52.420> feel<00:01:52.720> of<00:01:52.990> just

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
movement and the visceral feel of just

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.400 
movement and the visceral feel of just
kind<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.440> dragging<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> thing<00:01:54.610> around<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:55.410> very

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
kind of dragging the thing around I very

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.460 
kind of dragging the thing around I very
very<00:01:56.650> neat<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.720> running<00:01:59.020> on<00:01:59.170> an

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
very neat and this is running on an

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.219 
very neat and this is running on an
iPhone<00:01:59.979> 4<00:02:00.250> where<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.940> did<00:02:01.210> wind<00:02:01.600> up<00:02:01.720> cranking<00:02:02.140> up

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
iPhone 4 where I did wind up cranking up

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.750 
iPhone 4 where I did wind up cranking up
a<00:02:02.320> few<00:02:02.470> things<00:02:02.680> go<00:02:03.010> and<00:02:03.160> run<00:02:03.430> on<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.610> big

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
a few things go and run on the big

a few things go and run on the big
screen<00:02:04.120> here<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.930> runs<00:02:05.080> great<00:02:05.440> actually

we're in the process of pulling this
into<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:35.100> game<00:02:36.100> framework<00:02:37.350> but<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:39.610> was<00:02:39.760> one

into a game framework but this was one

into a game framework but this was one
of<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.330> one<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.480> my<00:02:40.630> great<00:02:40.900> points<00:02:41.290> where

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
of this is one of my great points where

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.410 
of this is one of my great points where
I'm<00:02:41.739> able<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.070> just<00:02:42.190> kind<00:02:42.459> of<00:02:42.519> go<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.300> do

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
I'm able to just kind of go in and do

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.660 
I'm able to just kind of go in and do
something<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:44.620> leverage<00:02:45.130> all<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.489> my
