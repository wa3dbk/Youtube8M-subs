maybe you'll notice this is a co-ed
Squad<00:00:02.790> it's<00:00:03.689> more<00:00:03.899> bit<00:00:04.049> harder<00:00:04.350> sometimes<00:00:04.560> for

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
Squad it's more bit harder sometimes for

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.639 
Squad it's more bit harder sometimes for
the<00:00:05.040> judges<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.609> evaluate<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.960> squad<00:00:07.259> with<00:00:07.529> a

the judges to evaluate the squad with a
look<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> techniques<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> make<00:00:09.179> sure

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
look at the techniques and make sure

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.970 
look at the techniques and make sure
that<00:00:09.450> even<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> co-ed<00:00:10.080> type<00:00:10.349> techniques<00:00:10.769> are

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
that even the co-ed type techniques are

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.070 
that even the co-ed type techniques are
done<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> right<00:00:11.400> way<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.880> did<00:00:12.750> notice<00:00:12.960> that

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
done the right way I did notice that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.169 
done the right way I did notice that
there<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.469> different<00:00:13.830> squads<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:15.000> old

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179

girls some with both boys and girls and
I<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:17.400> wondering<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.090> guy

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
I was wondering about that guy

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.359 
I was wondering about that guy
first<00:00:21.150> period<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.720> high<00:00:22.470> tabletop<00:00:23.100> that's<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
first period here high tabletop that's a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.130 
first period here high tabletop that's a
transition<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> big<00:00:24.420> egg<00:00:24.630> notice<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
transition to a big egg notice the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.690 
transition to a big egg notice the
effect<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> pyramid<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.340> front<00:00:32.579> flip

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
effect on the pyramid and a front flip

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.810 
effect on the pyramid and a front flip
to<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> craving<00:00:33.300> dismay

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.610 

Memphis<00:00:37.570> Catholic<00:00:37.750> really<00:00:38.140> getting<00:00:38.410> things

Memphis Catholic really getting things

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:47.310 
Memphis Catholic really getting things
off<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:38.980> good<00:00:39.129> start<00:00:39.190> here<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.930> things<00:00:47.199> I

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
off to a good start here one things I

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.259 
off to a good start here one things I
noticed<00:00:47.620> about<00:00:47.649> this<00:00:47.979> squad<00:00:48.309> is<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:48.699> they're

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
noticed about this squad is that they're

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.939 
noticed about this squad is that they're
very<00:00:49.300> straight<00:00:49.960> legged<00:00:50.260> when<00:00:50.559> you're<00:00:50.680> doing

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
very straight legged when you're doing

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.889 
very straight legged when you're doing
their<00:00:51.129> building<00:00:51.519> experiment<00:00:52.120> set<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:52.719> goes

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
their building experiment set that goes

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.630 
their building experiment set that goes
a<00:00:52.930> long<00:00:53.140> way<00:00:53.350> with<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.619> judges<00:00:54.010> it<00:00:54.460> really

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
a long way with the judges it really

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.279 
a long way with the judges it really
does<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.210> right<00:00:55.659> climbing

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
does that is the right climbing

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.289 
does that is the right climbing
technique<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.949> locks<00:00:57.250> them<00:00:57.460> into<00:00:57.610> position<00:00:58.149> is

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
technique it locks them into position is

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.950 
technique it locks them into position is
much<00:00:58.600> safer<00:01:02.789> notice<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:03.909> sharp<00:01:04.119> motions<00:01:04.390> also

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
much safer notice the sharp motions also

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.700 
much safer notice the sharp motions also
that's<00:01:05.110> very<00:01:05.379> important<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:08.170> ever-present

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
that's very important the ever-present

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
that's very important the ever-present
smiles<00:01:09.929> absolutely<00:01:10.929> showmanship

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.060 

this<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:22.929> my<00:01:23.079> favorite<00:01:23.439> part<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.740> routine

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
this is my favorite part of the routine

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.190 
this is my favorite part of the routine
is<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.369> dance<00:01:24.700> routine<00:01:25.240> because<00:01:25.659> it<00:01:25.810> really

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
is the dance routine because it really

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.779 
is the dance routine because it really
shows<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.439> synchronization<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.460> squads

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
shows a synchronization of the squads

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.789 
shows a synchronization of the squads
and<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.570> interpretation<00:01:29.259> of<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.469> music

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.069 

it's<00:01:33.310> spacing<00:01:33.759> information<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:34.570> far<00:01:34.840> from

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
it's spacing information so far from

00:01:35.079 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's spacing information so far from
Memphis<00:01:35.229> Catholic

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420 

got<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> pyramid<00:02:03.840> coming<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.260> here<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.220> dance

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
got a pyramid coming up here the dance

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.380 
got a pyramid coming up here the dance
routine<00:02:07.550> pretty<00:02:08.550> good<00:02:08.670> climbing<00:02:09.149> could<00:02:09.270> be

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
routine pretty good climbing could be

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.680 
routine pretty good climbing could be
just<00:02:09.540> a<00:02:09.630> little<00:02:09.960> bit<00:02:10.080> stronger<00:02:11.360> step<00:02:12.360> from<00:02:12.600> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
just a little bit stronger step from the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.980 
just a little bit stronger step from the
back<00:02:13.850> arms<00:02:14.850> coming<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.180> little<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.510> tighter<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
back arms coming a little bit tighter to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.750 
back arms coming a little bit tighter to
give<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.410> more<00:02:16.620> support

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520 

and<00:02:21.120> they're<00:02:21.330> gonna<00:02:21.450> rotate<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.080> that's<00:02:22.260> very

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and they're gonna rotate and that's very

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.140 
and they're gonna rotate and that's very
difficult<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.040> three-to-one<00:02:23.700> shoulderstand

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
difficult to three-to-one shoulderstand

difficult to three-to-one shoulderstand

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
so squatters in there to make sure that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.130 
so squatters in there to make sure that
they<00:02:29.900> didn't<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.260> any<00:02:30.320> injuries

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
