00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.780 
gone over to play that pull off on the
first<00:01:39.600> string<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> suggest<00:01:41.250> especially

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
first string so I suggest especially

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
first string so I suggest especially
since<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.299> fat<00:01:42.540> over<00:01:42.780> driven<00:01:43.020> Sam<00:01:43.229> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
since you get this fat over driven Sam I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.469 
since you get this fat over driven Sam I
suggest<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> work<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> little<00:01:44.909> finger<00:01:45.270> roll

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
suggest you work on a little finger roll

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.340 
suggest you work on a little finger roll
it<00:01:46.380> simply<00:01:46.770> means<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.960> when<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.170> over<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it simply means this when you go over to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.819 
it simply means this when you go over to
play<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> G<00:01:50.869> you're<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> lightly<00:01:52.380> roll

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
play that G you're going to lightly roll

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.609 
play that G you're going to lightly roll
your<00:01:53.040> index<00:01:53.430> finger<00:01:53.729> set<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.090> deadening<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
your index finger set your deadening the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.190 
your index finger set your deadening the
second<00:01:56.070> string<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.420> important<00:01:57.960> tool

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
second string it's a very important tool

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.039 
second string it's a very important tool
for<00:01:58.229> articulating<00:01:58.920> same<00:01:59.640> fret<00:02:00.000> fingerings<00:02:00.509> so

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
for articulating same fret fingerings so

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.750 
for articulating same fret fingerings so
the<00:02:01.200> liq<00:02:01.380> simply<00:02:01.799> goes<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.110 

so<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:07.820> happen<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.369> working<00:02:10.520> my<00:02:10.819> index

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
so you happen to be working my index

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.820 
so you happen to be working my index
finger<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.540> DI<00:02:11.690> p<00:02:11.810> joints<00:02:12.350> rolling<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> little

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
finger the DI p joints rolling a little

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.670 
finger the DI p joints rolling a little
bit<00:02:16.390> very<00:02:17.390> important<00:02:17.870> tool<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.110> your<00:02:18.290> playing

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
bit very important tool in your playing

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.410 
bit very important tool in your playing
and<00:02:18.950> I'm<00:02:19.580> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.730> rattle<00:02:19.910> off<00:02:20.120> with<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
and I'm going to rattle off with the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.320 
and I'm going to rattle off with the
picking<00:02:20.780> scheme<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.170> I've<00:02:21.290> come<00:02:21.500> up<00:02:21.560> with<00:02:21.709> is

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
picking scheme that I've come up with is

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.690 
picking scheme that I've come up with is
down<00:02:23.330> pull<00:02:24.050> up<00:02:25.180> down<00:02:26.180> pull<00:02:26.840> up<00:02:27.790> down<00:02:28.790> pull<00:02:29.620> up

pull down up pull down up pull that way
I've<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:37.850> got<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.060> strict<00:02:38.420> alternate<00:02:38.900> picking

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
I've just got a strict alternate picking

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
scheme going on even though I'm not

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.970 
scheme going on even though I'm not

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
little bit and actually it flows really

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.750

well<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.200> can't<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.830> real<00:02:52.160> strict<00:02:52.519> with<00:02:52.670> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
well you can't be real strict with that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.670 
well you can't be real strict with that

the numbers down the ends up on easily
us<00:02:56.840> unless<00:02:57.800> you're<00:02:57.950> just<00:02:57.980> picking<00:02:58.250> everything

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
us unless you're just picking everything

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.800 
us unless you're just picking everything
and<00:02:59.030> then<00:02:59.120> even<00:02:59.360> then<00:02:59.450> there's<00:02:59.660> some

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
and then even then there's some

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.900 
and then even then there's some
variations<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.830> have<00:03:01.040> fun<00:03:01.070> with<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:01.610> lick

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
variations so have fun with this lick

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.340 
variations so have fun with this lick
and<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.450> closing<00:03:02.570> I'd<00:03:02.930> like<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.200> demonstrate

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and in closing I'd like to demonstrate

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.900 
and in closing I'd like to demonstrate
how<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.860> could<00:03:04.130> move<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.430> around<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.760> other
