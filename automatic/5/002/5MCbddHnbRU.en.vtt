00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.240 

on<00:00:09.849> a<00:00:09.910> hot<00:00:10.299> day<00:00:10.330> it's<00:00:10.839> lovely<00:00:11.469> just<00:00:11.650> stand<00:00:12.039> in

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
on a hot day it's lovely just stand in

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.570 
on a hot day it's lovely just stand in
front<00:00:12.549> of<00:00:12.849> a<00:00:12.969> fan<00:00:13.299> all<00:00:14.230> that<00:00:14.469> nice<00:00:14.830> cool<00:00:15.250> air

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
front of a fan all that nice cool air

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.470 
front of a fan all that nice cool air
being<00:00:15.969> blown<00:00:16.359> around<00:00:16.539> ah<00:00:17.550> that's<00:00:18.550> much<00:00:19.060> better

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
being blown around ah that's much better

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.740 
being blown around ah that's much better
I<00:00:20.130> bet<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.250> didn't<00:00:21.550> know<00:00:21.579> that<00:00:21.910> this<00:00:22.150> fans<00:00:22.509> got

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
I bet you didn't know that this fans got

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.359 
I bet you didn't know that this fans got
something<00:00:23.110> in<00:00:23.169> common<00:00:23.410> with<00:00:23.710> some<00:00:24.009> types<00:00:24.250> of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
something in common with some types of

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.200 
something in common with some types of
aircraft

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
aircraft

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.560 
aircraft
can<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:25.779> guess<00:00:25.960> what<00:00:27.419> propeller

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
can you guess what propeller

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.900 
can you guess what propeller
hits<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.410> palace<00:00:29.800> on<00:00:29.890> some<00:00:30.130> aircraft<00:00:30.339> and<00:00:30.820> the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
hits a palace on some aircraft and the

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.180 
hits a palace on some aircraft and the
blades<00:00:31.150> of<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.359> fan<00:00:31.449> work<00:00:32.290> in<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.589> similar<00:00:32.980> way

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
blades of the fan work in a similar way

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.430 
blades of the fan work in a similar way
although<00:00:34.089> the<00:00:34.239> propellers<00:00:34.660> on<00:00:34.780> planes<00:00:35.079> aren't

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
although the propellers on planes aren't

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.680 
although the propellers on planes aren't
there<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.769> cool<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.129> down<00:00:36.339> it<00:00:37.150> can<00:00:37.360> all<00:00:37.480> sure

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
there to cool you down it can all sure

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.780 
there to cool you down it can all sure
what's<00:00:37.960> repeller<00:00:38.350> is<00:00:38.589> it's<00:00:39.129> basically<00:00:39.460> a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
what's repeller is it's basically a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.580 
what's repeller is it's basically a
number<00:00:40.150> of<00:00:40.239> blades<00:00:40.449> join<00:00:40.989> together<00:00:41.170> in<00:00:41.500> the

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
number of blades join together in the

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.830 
number of blades join together in the
center<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.910> on<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.329> front<00:00:43.570> or<00:00:43.750> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
center actually on the front or the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.959 
center actually on the front or the
wings<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.260> an<00:00:44.320> aircraft<00:00:44.500> it<00:00:45.370> can<00:00:45.550> be<00:00:45.610> hard<00:00:45.820> to

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
wings of an aircraft it can be hard to

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.389 
wings of an aircraft it can be hard to
see<00:00:46.180> them<00:00:46.360> when<00:00:46.510> they're<00:00:46.660> spinning<00:00:47.170> they<00:00:48.129> just

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
see them when they're spinning they just

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.430 
see them when they're spinning they just
look<00:00:48.550> like<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.730> brother

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.790 

slow<00:00:53.980> things<00:00:54.309> down<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:54.879> take<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.059> closer<00:00:55.359> look

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
slow things down and take a closer look

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.979 
slow things down and take a closer look
it<00:00:56.800> all<00:00:57.070> starts<00:00:57.550> with<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.789> engine<00:00:58.269> this

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
it all starts with the engine this

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.200 
it all starts with the engine this
planes<00:00:59.320> about<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.710> get<00:00:59.829> going<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.579> pilot<00:01:01.030> is

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
planes about to get going the pilot is

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.160 
planes about to get going the pilot is
turning<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.870> ignition<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:03.869> engine<00:01:04.869> is

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
turning the ignition the engine is

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.050 
turning the ignition the engine is
filled<00:01:05.500> with<00:01:05.680> air<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.159> burns<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.640> fuel<00:01:06.909> to

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
filled with air and burns the fuel to

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.780 
filled with air and burns the fuel to
release<00:01:07.330> energy<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.650> heated<00:01:09.009> gas<00:01:09.220> moves<00:01:09.610> a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
release energy the heated gas moves a

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.730 
release energy the heated gas moves a
piston<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.810> Pistons<00:01:11.229> attached<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.710> a

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
piston and the Pistons attached to a

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.039 
piston and the Pistons attached to a
crankshaft<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:13.360> you're<00:01:13.570> not<00:01:13.720> sure<00:01:13.869> what<00:01:14.020> a

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
crankshaft if you're not sure what a

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.139 
crankshaft if you're not sure what a
crankshaft<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.979> it's<00:01:15.460> just<00:01:15.820> something

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
crankshaft is it's just something

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.820 
crankshaft is it's just something
mechanical<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:16.780> spins<00:01:17.170> around<00:01:17.320> the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
mechanical that spins around the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.710 
mechanical that spins around the
propeller<00:01:18.399> is<00:01:18.820> attached<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.360> crankshaft

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
propeller is attached to the crankshaft

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.770 
propeller is attached to the crankshaft
and<00:01:20.200> at<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.890> engine<00:01:21.250> run<00:01:21.460> propeller<00:01:22.270> spins

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
and at the engine run propeller spins

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.139 
and at the engine run propeller spins
faster<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.710> faster<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.549> this<00:01:24.729> makes<00:01:25.030> the

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
faster and faster and this makes the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.389 
faster and faster and this makes the
aircraft<00:01:25.299> move<00:01:25.810> forward<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:26.950> how<00:01:27.159> does<00:01:27.220> a

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
aircraft move forward so how does a

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.490 
aircraft move forward so how does a
spinning<00:01:27.729> fan<00:01:28.090> get<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:28.539> aircraft<00:01:29.020> moving

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
spinning fan get this aircraft moving

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.440 
spinning fan get this aircraft moving
it's<00:01:30.159> all<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.610> do<00:01:30.759> with<00:01:30.789> something<00:01:31.270> called

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
it's all to do with something called

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.950 
it's all to do with something called
rust<00:01:31.840> rust<00:01:32.800> is<00:01:33.069> what<00:01:33.220> makes<00:01:33.429> things<00:01:33.670> well<00:01:34.330> go

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
rust rust is what makes things well go

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.620 
rust rust is what makes things well go
the<00:01:35.710> wind<00:01:35.950> moving<00:01:36.310> past<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.909> blades<00:01:37.149> creates

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
the wind moving past the blades creates

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.499 
the wind moving past the blades creates
pressure<00:01:37.929> that<00:01:38.200> pushes<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.710> plane<00:01:38.920> forward

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
pressure that pushes the plane forward

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.700 
pressure that pushes the plane forward
propeller<00:01:40.509> blades<00:01:40.810> look<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> bit<00:01:41.259> like<00:01:41.380> wings

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
propeller blades look a bit like wings

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.469 
propeller blades look a bit like wings
and<00:01:42.039> that's<00:01:42.369> not<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.640> coincidence

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
and that's not a coincidence

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.809 
and that's not a coincidence
wings<00:01:44.259> use<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.649> same<00:01:44.890> science<00:01:45.399> to<00:01:45.520> give<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
wings use the same science to give the

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.790 
wings use the same science to give the
aircraft<00:01:46.300> lift<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.810> get<00:01:46.960> off<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.170> ground<00:01:47.350> up

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
aircraft lift to get off the ground up

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.940 
aircraft lift to get off the ground up
and<00:01:48.280> away<00:01:48.810> propeller<00:01:49.810> blades<00:01:50.140> often<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.710> sort

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
and away propeller blades often a sort

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.370 
and away propeller blades often a sort
of<00:01:51.039> twisty<00:01:51.640> shape<00:01:51.880> why<00:01:52.659> do<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.080> middle

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
of twisty shape why do it the middle

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.350 
of twisty shape why do it the middle
than<00:01:53.500> they<00:01:53.590> are<00:01:53.619> at<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.890> tip<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.909> shape<00:01:55.149> is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
than they are at the tip the shape is

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.900 
than they are at the tip the shape is
very<00:01:55.659> important<00:01:56.259> think<00:01:57.220> about<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.520> last<00:01:57.670> time

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
very important think about the last time

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.180 
very important think about the last time
you<00:01:57.970> played<00:01:58.270> on<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.539> playground<00:01:59.020> roundabout<00:01:59.530> if

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
you played on a playground roundabout if

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.710 
you played on a playground roundabout if
you<00:02:00.340> stand<00:02:00.610> in<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.819> middle<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.330> don't<00:02:01.539> go

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
you stand in the middle you don't go

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.690

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
thing about propellers is that they're a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.490
