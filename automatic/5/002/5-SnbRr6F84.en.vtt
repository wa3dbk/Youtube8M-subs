00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 no fewer than 50 players still have a chance to win 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.220
 a spot in the world cup selection 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.990
 there are quite a lot and so are they 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.900
 busy times for the national coach and his 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:20.340
 staff well I have a staff of 8 scout that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.949
 50 players follow us every week and we 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 make every week 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.890
 and basic team and shadows team and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 also because we are following 50 players 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.380
 one last shad because farmers are at 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 patrick kluivert team 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.129
 who you might be in that patrick 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.420
 Kluivert team state is Kenneth Vermeer 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.370
 the dommel is not going to France with 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.129
 but it is with the provisional one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.710
 selection 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 unclear by this this action for 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 make it clear to me that he is still 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.739
 is always in the picture 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.350
 he is in my eyes the keeper who it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.989
 best in my profile and fixed 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 only yes he doesn't play that often and that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.530
 is the problem 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.170
 whoever players are quincy promes karim 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.810
 rekik davy klaassen and sean paul boyds 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.369
 is for van gaal is the last chance to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.830
 to see the youngsters at work because 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.320
 he must on 13 May and list of 30 names 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.110
 I can hand them in at this level 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.200
 get to know now before i really get the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.420
 must make a final decision 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 to select such a boy or not 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.590
 so now i can see him straight in his eyes 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.659
 I can see , I can ask him what 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.439
 he thinks and can i tell him what i am 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.780
 expected from him 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.900
 he has two months left and that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.229
 I can do much better in one 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.140
 training camp as well as over the phone 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.750
 so that is why i have such a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.610
 selection made and if selection is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.020
 actually no real left back and so 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.240
 the national coach had another one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.829
 message for all the box that dreams of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.229
 the wk 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.590
 come on well those last two months 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.729
 because this is not how you get 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.700
 selected 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.219
 I would love to have left covers 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.830
 but then you have to be in that 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:10.920
 fit the profile of that vision and yes 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.740
 that has not yet been successful and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.380
 I have to put daley blind back left 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.380
 because that is the best
