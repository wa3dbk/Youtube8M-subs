the most unexpected

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.460 
the most unexpected
places<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.850> amplified<00:02:26.600> through<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.990> artistry

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
places is amplified through the artistry

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.610 
places is amplified through the artistry
and<00:02:27.740> his<00:02:27.890> individual<00:02:28.460> exposures<00:02:29.380> he<00:02:30.380> looked

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and his individual exposures he looked

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.380 
and his individual exposures he looked
for<00:02:30.800> beauty<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.450> destruction<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.350> trash

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
for beauty in destruction and trash

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.810 
for beauty in destruction and trash
sometimes<00:02:35.390> although<00:02:36.100> not<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.370> much<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.610> mean<00:02:37.700> it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
sometimes although not so much I mean it

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.210 
sometimes although not so much I mean it
wasn't<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.060> he<00:02:38.210> was<00:02:38.330> looking<00:02:38.450> just<00:02:39.220> focused

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
wasn't like he was looking just focused

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.130 
wasn't like he was looking just focused
on<00:02:40.340> hat<00:02:40.610> at<00:02:40.790> all<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.390> mean<00:02:41.540> beauty<00:02:42.020> was

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
on hat at all but I mean beauty was

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.920 
on hat at all but I mean beauty was
really<00:02:42.410> important<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.010> him<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:46.000> that's<00:02:47.000> just

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
really important to him and that's just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.410 
really important to him and that's just
who<00:02:48.080> he<00:02:48.110> was<00:02:48.440> as<00:02:49.010> an<00:02:49.400> artist<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:50.090> know<00:02:50.210> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
who he was as an artist you know you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.200 
who he was as an artist you know you
could<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.660> been<00:02:50.810> doing<00:02:51.140> anything<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:52.210> it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
could have been doing anything and it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.630 
could have been doing anything and it
would<00:02:53.330> have<00:02:53.450> been<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.290> thing<00:02:54.620> he<00:02:55.310> wouldn't

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
would have been that thing he wouldn't

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.040 
would have been that thing he wouldn't
have<00:02:55.700> had<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.090> been<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.240> photographer<00:02:56.570> you

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
have had to have been a photographer you
