00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.810
 speaks guys youtube all quiet 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.549
 with you 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.010
 who's talking that channel isaac 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.770
 order a video and I'll go 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.600
 Bringing you people today is 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.599
 harvest in the second vessel with the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.619
 strawberry also from the 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:26.859
 strawberry and what you should do to 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.279
 also has this result here personal 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:35.770
 as you can see that it is full of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:38.740
 strawberry strawberry hard strawberry 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.070
 if you are giving a double more 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:47.200
 to mature has more or less here 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.270
 here we live here the people who 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.820
 I did to have this result is the bei 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.040
 common earthworm fertilizer made with 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 vegetable peels that I will teach 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.570
 My Channel Cotton Pie 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.449
 I did fertilization once a month. 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.400
 result here I would make another video 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.079
 Strawberry harvest time is one and only 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:15.549
 begins to produce from August to October 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.240
 you will have resulted here but you 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.009
 realize that strawberry is small because 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.200
 Because of this, I told you 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.880
 in the other video as being a big mistake 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.479
 start producing strawberries takes it 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.149
 hence 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:34.090
 so here are women from seedlings 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:38.859
 so lingering people said here gave 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.600
 You read here, little one. 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:45.490
 my other strawberry harvest went well 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.869
 greater than the personal here is the secret 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.619
 is that you 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.200
 very sun water 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.609
 no not to leave each one enough 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.859
 to let a basement like water and 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:04.389
 very kind and you will have a result 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:06.939
 wonderful here, people are me 

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.500
 I realize here that at that time the strawberry 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.879
 starts to get pest 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.909
 so you can see why the plague can 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.299
 to end their plantation of strawberries and 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:22.629
 humor the tourist buy water 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:26.439
 watch your strawberry the plant is 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:29.610
 more or less one year and two months 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.810
 This plant here flowers are cantona 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.849
 are healthy 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.159
 That's what folks like they said in the other 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.129
 video this strawberry that organic taste 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.360
 He 's amazing, he's always been able to talk. 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.579
 for you 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.590
 it's worth planting strawberry plant moran 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.959
 the result here is a result 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.579
 Good, I have more or less good here. 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.099
