00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 yes it's true my sister just had 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:12.549
 a baby what joy I'm happy for her 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.850
 changing the subject I can make a 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.960
 question regarding your Christianity 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.509
 of course 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.570
 this is about the morality of your 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:27.320
 God, you always say that the moral of your 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.510
 God does not truly change the morality of God 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.180
 change me that's true 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 but as in the old testament they had 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.710
 some very strong and hard laws of 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 cope as for example you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.720
 stoned if you worked the day of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.600
 rest and if they found a woman 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.239
 guilty of adultery they killed her too 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.300
 because now you Christians do not 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.820
 they do that is that maybe you take 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 only part of the bible and they do not take it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.440
 complete good the law was the old covenant 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.899
 what God had with his people of Israel 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.610
 now we are no longer in that pact because 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.940
 Jesus Christ the messiah abolished the law 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.030
 mosaic it is true that the law was very 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.760
 hard to endure in those times be 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.130
 an Israelite was not so easy 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.470
 but now Jesus Christ has given us another 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.330
 covenant that is called grace he us 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.770
 teaches that we should love our 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.009
 neighbor as ourselves 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.939
 but because there was that change is that perhaps 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.500
 God was wrong with the first laws 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.140
 God was not wrong with the first 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.360
 laws what happens is that they were necessary 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.600
 of those laws to imply what 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.909
 It was sin and its consequences as well 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.640
 I think that the human being was in 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.469
 another state that is today and God provided 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.040
 these laws according to the need 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:53.210
 of the human being 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.210
 I do not understand 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.229
 well I give you an example you say that you 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.870
 sister just having a baby is not 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.000
 true 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.430
 yes but what does it have to do 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.250
 Well, look, your sister is going to try that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.990
 baby how babies are treated your sister 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.630
 will not treat your baby as if 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.350
 I was adult right 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.780
 Clear 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.900
 for example, your sister will give you food 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.220
 soft and milk and will not give you a piece of 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.450
 hard meat true 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.450
 Yes of course 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.379
 as your baby grows his sister 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.930
 You will be changing its power 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.269
 according to its growth in the same way 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.819
 goodbye I treat the human being different from 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.920
 According to his need, the human being has 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.980
 has been developing better and has 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.080
 learned a lot because of God 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.870
 we do not have anything the old 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.900
 testament but we see it as what 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.580
 it's the past now we have that advantage 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.580
 to know those things 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.230
 what if I ask you if you consider 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.890
 moral that if you should kill a woman 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.170
 that is in adultery that is not moral 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.180
 now the law is cursed by the 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.820
 excellence of Jesus' sacrifice of 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.560
 Nazareth Jesus once said that 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.450
 we must love our 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.260
 enemies 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.489
 and bless those who curse us I hope 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.280
 and be all clear good friend yes but 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.910
 even with your explanation this subject seems 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.739
 be deeper in that you are right 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.530
 I only asked for a part of what I have 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.390
 certainly this topic is understood 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.410
 extends more with those who know more than 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:46.230
 I go to the dining room there are some 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.230
 cookies that I want you to try ok
