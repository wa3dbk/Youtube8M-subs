00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
we're really not close right now to

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.440 
we're really not close right now to
decide<00:01:41.679> one<00:01:41.979> which<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.939> that<00:01:43.149> and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
decide one which this really that and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.630 
decide one which this really that and
we're<00:01:43.749> still<00:01:43.929> giving<00:01:44.049> all<00:01:44.289> of<00:01:44.319> them<00:01:44.640> equal

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
we're still giving all of them equal

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.340 
we're still giving all of them equal
reps<00:01:45.880> basically<00:01:46.539> so<00:01:46.689> I'm<00:01:46.780> another<00:01:47.020> tell<00:01:47.229> you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
reps basically so I'm another tell you

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.480 
reps basically so I'm another tell you
something<00:01:47.679> right<00:01:47.799> there<00:01:48.039> we<00:01:48.189> hadn't<00:01:48.429> even

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
something right there we hadn't even

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.819 
something right there we hadn't even
eliminated<00:01:49.090> one<00:01:49.270> yet<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.749> so<00:01:50.319> that's<00:01:50.499> um

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
eliminated one yet and so that's um

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.099 
eliminated one yet and so that's um
that's<00:01:51.189> that's<00:01:51.880> telling<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.420> it's<00:01:52.539> tough<00:01:52.749> but

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
that's that's telling and it's tough but

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.379 
that's that's telling and it's tough but

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
by Saturday you're gonna have to owe me

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:56.969 
by Saturday you're gonna have to owe me
or<00:01:55.810> not<00:01:55.929> yeah<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.439> got<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.649> have<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.770> narrowed

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
or not yeah we got to have it narrowed

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.879 
or not yeah we got to have it narrowed
down<00:01:57.069> you<00:01:57.789> know<00:01:57.939> enemy<00:01:58.929> ultimately<00:01:59.409> I<00:01:59.590> mean

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
down you know enemy ultimately I mean

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.620 
down you know enemy ultimately I mean
the<00:02:00.609> reason<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:00.969> don't<00:02:01.060> think<00:02:01.299> it'll<00:02:01.450> be<00:02:01.569> the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
the reason I don't think it'll be the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.250 
the reason I don't think it'll be the
string

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
string

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.440 
string
our<00:02:02.350> choices<00:02:02.710> because<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.430> think<00:02:03.670> at<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.390> end

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
our choices because I think at the end

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.260 
our choices because I think at the end
of<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.750> deal<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.920> got<00:02:06.160> every<00:02:06.910> team<00:02:07.150> is

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
of the deal you got every team is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.450 
of the deal you got every team is
different<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:07.990> mean<00:02:08.350> every<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.979> chemistry<00:02:09.430> of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
different I mean every the chemistry of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.370 
different I mean every the chemistry of
everything<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.090> different<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.690> ultimately

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
everything is different and ultimately

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.080 
everything is different and ultimately
it<00:02:11.590> comes<00:02:11.770> down<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.160> who<00:02:12.340> gives<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> best

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
it comes down to who gives you the best

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.470 
it comes down to who gives you the best
opportunity<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.930> live<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.860> know<00:02:15.010> what<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.190> mean

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
opportunity to live you know what I mean

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.030 
opportunity to live you know what I mean
whoever<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.380> mean<00:02:17.530> we're<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.890> go

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
whoever that is I mean we're going to go

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.550 
whoever that is I mean we're going to go
with<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:19.060> mean<00:02:19.240> whoever<00:02:19.480> loses<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.170> job

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
with it and I mean whoever loses the job

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.840 
with it and I mean whoever loses the job
and<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:20.980> part<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.250> being<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.460> good<00:02:21.610> teammate

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
and it's part of being a good teammate

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.940 
and it's part of being a good teammate
to<00:02:22.240> I've<00:02:22.720> been<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.020> situations<00:02:23.200> where<00:02:23.680> i<00:02:23.740> lost

to I've been in situations where i lost
a<00:02:24.130> job<00:02:24.310> before<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.760> minutes<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.330> got<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.540> big

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
a job before a minutes you got a big

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.710 
a job before a minutes you got a big
good<00:02:26.110> backup<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.980> know<00:02:27.100> buying<00:02:27.400> it

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
good backup you know buying it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.970 
good backup you know buying it
everybody's<00:02:28.720> got<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.960> buy<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.350> you're<00:02:29.740> not<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
everybody's got to buy in you're not the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.620 
everybody's got to buy in you're not the
only<00:02:30.040> person<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.700> lost<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> position<00:02:31.420> list

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
only person that lost the position list

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.150 
only person that lost the position list
I<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.290> know<00:02:32.410> why<00:02:32.770> since<00:02:33.100> you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
I can if you know why since you

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.590 
I can if you know why since you
oscillating<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.880> little<00:02:34.060> bit<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.300> know<00:02:34.360> maybe

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
oscillating a little bit you know maybe

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600 
oscillating a little bit you know maybe
one<00:02:34.810> practice<00:02:35.230> here<00:02:35.440> one<00:02:35.680> practice<00:02:36.100> oh<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.280> am

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
one practice here one practice oh I am

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.990 
one practice here one practice oh I am
no<00:02:37.060> better<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:38.860> doing<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.490> every<00:02:39.730> well

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
no better I'm doing that with every well

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.400 
no better I'm doing that with every well
out<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.180> position<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.870> know<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.200> think

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
out of position you know and I think

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.290 
out of position you know and I think
doesn't<00:02:41.590> that's<00:02:41.860> naturally<00:02:42.430> nothing<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.180> I

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
doesn't that's naturally nothing and I

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.940 
doesn't that's naturally nothing and I
think<00:02:43.540> at<00:02:43.660> some<00:02:43.840> point<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.260> gotta<00:02:44.440> step<00:02:44.710> back

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
think at some point you gotta step back

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.250 
think at some point you gotta step back
and<00:02:45.160> look<00:02:45.250> at<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.460> whole<00:02:45.730> deal<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.270> know<00:02:46.390> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
and look at the whole deal you know and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.800 
and look at the whole deal you know and
I<00:02:47.290> mean<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.560> mean<00:02:47.980> any<00:02:48.610> times<00:02:48.970> I'm<00:02:49.270> not<00:02:49.390> probably

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
I mean I mean any times I'm not probably

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.170 
I mean I mean any times I'm not probably
right<00:02:50.650> now<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:50.920> me<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.220> look<00:02:51.520> at<00:02:51.640> things<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:52.030> little

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
right now I me I look at things a little

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.630 
right now I me I look at things a little
bit<00:02:52.390> different<00:02:52.840> because<00:02:52.960> um<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.950> know<00:02:54.610> the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
bit different because um you know the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.070 
bit different because um you know the
level<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.090> reps<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.570> they've<00:02:55.720> had<00:02:55.750> is

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
level of reps that they've had is

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.140 
level of reps that they've had is
different<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.650> know<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.310> mean<00:02:57.580> it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
different you know and so I mean it's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.510 
different you know and so I mean it's
hard<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.510> sit<00:02:58.750> there<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.160> have<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.220> true

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
signal and stuff so I mean that that you

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.570 
signal and stuff so I mean that that you
take<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.600> into<00:03:13.840> account<00:03:13.870> too<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.489> at

take that into account too is it at

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.729 
take that into account too is it at

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
good problem to have that they're not

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.150 
good problem to have that they're not

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
separating themselves because you don't

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.350 
separating themselves because you don't
like<00:03:24.400> what<00:03:24.430> you're<00:03:24.700> seeing<00:03:24.850> out<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.090> any<00:03:25.269> of
