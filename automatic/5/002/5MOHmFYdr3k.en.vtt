00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
all the way too cheaply which was a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
all the way too cheaply which was a
story<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> game<00:01:17.549> today<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.880> thought<00:01:18.090> our

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
story of the game today I thought our

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510 
story of the game today I thought our
past<00:01:19.080> completion<00:01:19.619> today<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:20.009> shocking<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
past completion today was shocking and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
past completion today was shocking and
it's<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.119> city<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.689> normally<00:01:22.110> pretty

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it's not like city we normally pretty

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.990 
it's not like city we normally pretty
good<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.680> our<00:01:22.799> passes<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.549> thought<00:01:23.909> we

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
good with our passes but I thought we

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.940 
good with our passes but I thought we
gave<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.180> away<00:01:24.390> far<00:01:24.780> too<00:01:24.810> cheaply<00:01:25.229> today<00:01:25.619> do

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
gave it away far too cheaply today do

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.140 
gave it away far too cheaply today do
you<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.159> there<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.340> something<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.909> said

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
Aguero coming back from injury it's been

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.399 
Aguero coming back from injury it's been
a<00:01:31.530> while<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.400> looked<00:01:32.579> rusty<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.030> me<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.409> don't

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
a while they looked rusty to me I don't

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
a while they looked rusty to me I don't
know<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.340> train<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> level<00:01:36.090> where

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
know because the train to a level where

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
know because the train to a level where
to<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.600> them<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.079> pizza<00:01:37.530> peak

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
to get them up to the pizza peak

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.260 
to get them up to the pizza peak
performance<00:01:38.280> level<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.880> should<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.180> able

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
performance level so they should be able

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.330 
performance level so they should be able
to<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> play<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.189> just

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to go on and play I think it was just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.010 
to go on and play I think it was just
one<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> those<00:01:41.759> day<00:01:42.090> today<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.630> gave<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
one of those day today where we gave the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
one of those day today where we gave the
ball<00:01:43.140> away<00:01:43.200> too<00:01:43.439> cheaply<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.460> set<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> stall

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
ball away too cheaply they set the stall

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.240 
ball away too cheaply they set the stall
out<00:01:45.210> well<00:01:45.420> defended<00:01:45.960> well<00:01:46.110> attack<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.070> pay

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
out well defended well attack we pay

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.249 
out well defended well attack we pay
cycle<00:01:47.520> said<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.869> don't<00:01:49.049> think<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
cycle said and I think I don't think the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.510 
cycle said and I think I don't think the
keeper<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> shot<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.009> save<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> first

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
keeper on the shot to save the first

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069 
keeper on the shot to save the first
half<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:50.939> they're<00:01:51.210> our<00:01:51.420> best<00:01:51.659> chances

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
half I think they're our best chances

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.260 
half I think they're our best chances
