00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 that women who practice it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.480
 prepare your feminine part through 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.850
 of the movements to make mothers 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.230
 but we have an expert was to know 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.390
 that in the report this is about 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.680
 you exercise and connect 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.050
 with the earth because they take away the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.940
 shoes you do barefoot and you have to 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.070
 listen very well to the drum of the master 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.150
 I also 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.150
 double bass 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.190
 we are about to witness what 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.080
 listen here do not boot of the belly this is 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.920
 a collection between the rhythm the group and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.920
 the roads 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.600
 ah 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.829
 the rhythm connects with the heart and the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.640
 dancer must interpret the rhythm 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.640
 in the dance 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.320
 the connection between 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 musician and dancer especially in the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.160
 belly dance or oriental dance 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.410
 the rituals that were done in the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.210
 sacred temples where women are 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.430
 they gathered to dance and this was like a 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.000
 ritual towards fertility and toward 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.000
 life no 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.970
 the world 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.580
 you could hear a rhythm in the rhythm that the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.380
 I play right now it's called said and this is one 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.510
 of the main rhythms of the rhythms 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.800
 basic ones that are played and most of 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.650
 Arab countries from the high hip hop the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.120
 connection with that of batista or with the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.160
 percussionist is extremely important 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.110
 for the language between the two 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.510
 not suddenly when we're going to finish 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.740
 that we both know when it is 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.080
 where are we going to put the final touch what 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.890
 notice the belly really what 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.990
 we are seeing as another point 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.720
 and this is what we need to connect their 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.770
 muscles and also the female area to 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.770
 that are there 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.410
 when we are talking about the dance of 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.840
 belly we are talking about that we stimulate 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.430
 the internal movements of a belly 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.800
 maybe it's ready to be 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.320
 fertilized literally though it will be quite 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.750
 strong is that you do not have to stimulate 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.780
 the movements and attract through that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.150
 Well, that clear feminine energy is the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.740
 moody is a little longer and it's a lot 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.740
 slower 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.740
 ah 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 ah 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.000
 or not 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.250
 and they are placing the tableware we are going to 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.990
 try the basic steps the matter 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.930
 here is to awaken our energy 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.780
 positive and feminine important without 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.480

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.530
