already aware of the legacy has that not
a<00:00:51.449> rainbow<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> has<00:00:52.620> several<00:00:52.920> different

stripes

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.779 
stripes
I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> lining<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> some

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I think the lining is like that and some

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
I think the lining is like that and some
of<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> bags<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> outside<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of the bags have it on the outside and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.690 
of the bags have it on the outside and
then<00:01:02.430> poppy<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.530> don't<00:01:05.460> want<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700

then poppy is more of I don't want to
say<00:01:05.850> graffiti<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:08.720> not<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:11.030> sophisticated<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
say graffiti but not as sophisticated a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.530 
say graffiti but not as sophisticated a
little<00:01:12.840> bit<00:01:12.930> more<00:01:13.080> fun<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:14.090> print<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.360> the

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.560 
to review for you guys but I've
continued<00:06:41.190> to<00:06:41.340> wear<00:06:41.520> it<00:06:41.700> because<00:06:41.940> I<00:06:42.060> really

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
continued to wear it because I really

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.100 
continued to wear it because I really
like<00:06:42.720> it

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
like it

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.100 
like it
it's<00:06:43.530> long<00:06:43.860> lasting<00:06:44.430> but<00:06:44.940> it<00:06:45.300> doesn't

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
it's long lasting but it doesn't

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.040 
it's long lasting but it doesn't
overwhelm<00:06:47.120> it's<00:06:48.120> not<00:06:48.390> like<00:06:48.690> a<00:06:48.720> headache

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
overwhelm it's not like a headache

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.700 
overwhelm it's not like a headache
inducing<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:50.790> how<00:06:51.240> does<00:06:51.300> the<00:06:51.870> sophistication

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
inducing and how does the sophistication

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.840 
inducing and how does the sophistication
of<00:06:53.040> a<00:06:53.640> high-end<00:06:54.920> designer<00:06:55.920> fragrance<00:06:56.640> fine

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
of a high-end designer fragrance fine

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.180 
of a high-end designer fragrance fine
but<00:06:57.540> it<00:06:57.630> doesn't<00:06:57.990> smell<00:06:58.260> like<00:06:58.320> an<00:06:58.680> old<00:06:58.860> lady's

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
but it doesn't smell like an old lady's

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.120 
but it doesn't smell like an old lady's
perfume<00:07:00.380> probably<00:07:01.380> because<00:07:01.680> it<00:07:01.800> has<00:07:01.950> that

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
perfume probably because it has that

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.220 
perfume probably because it has that
freshness<00:07:02.790> and<00:07:03.630> that<00:07:03.870> like<00:07:04.080> blue<00:07:05.120> watery<00:07:06.230> just

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
freshness and that like blue watery just

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.190 
freshness and that like blue watery just
a<00:07:07.320> touch<00:07:07.800> of<00:07:07.830> sweetness<00:07:08.280> with<00:07:08.700> like<00:07:09.600> the<00:07:09.870> light

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
a touch of sweetness with like the light

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.350 
a touch of sweetness with like the light
white<00:07:10.770> floral<00:07:11.220> so<00:07:11.670> I<00:07:11.700> definitely<00:07:12.090> recommend

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
white floral so I definitely recommend

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.240 
white floral so I definitely recommend
this<00:07:12.870> if<00:07:13.110> it<00:07:13.260> sounds<00:07:13.590> like<00:07:13.620> something<00:07:14.220> that

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
this if it sounds like something that

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.270 
this if it sounds like something that
you<00:07:14.490> would<00:07:14.760> like<00:07:15.050> and<00:07:16.050> you<00:07:16.470> know<00:07:16.590> don't<00:07:16.830> be<00:07:17.070> put

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
you would like and you know don't be put

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.680 
you would like and you know don't be put
off<00:07:17.310> by<00:07:17.580> the<00:07:17.640> fact<00:07:17.730> that<00:07:18.030> it's<00:07:18.240> called<00:07:18.420> poppy

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
off by the fact that it's called poppy

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.930 
off by the fact that it's called poppy
flower<00:07:19.140> because<00:07:19.680> I'm<00:07:20.010> not<00:07:20.370> a<00:07:20.400> huge<00:07:20.700> fan<00:07:20.730> of

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
flower because I'm not a huge fan of

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.670 
flower because I'm not a huge fan of
florals<00:07:21.480> I<00:07:21.570> mean<00:07:21.720> they<00:07:21.840> generally<00:07:22.260> are<00:07:22.440> used

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
florals I mean they generally are used

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.940 
florals I mean they generally are used
in<00:07:23.000> some<00:07:24.000> sort<00:07:24.300> of<00:07:24.390> way<00:07:24.570> in<00:07:25.020> fragrance<00:07:25.710> or

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950 
in some sort of way in fragrance or

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.690 
in some sort of way in fragrance or
perfume<00:07:26.430> but<00:07:27.330> I<00:07:27.660> think<00:07:28.020> that<00:07:28.200> it's<00:07:28.700> definitely

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700 
perfume but I think that it's definitely

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.520 
perfume but I think that it's definitely
a<00:07:30.030> good<00:07:30.300> mix<00:07:30.600> of<00:07:30.900> the<00:07:31.760> floral<00:07:32.760> with<00:07:33.030> the

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530 
a good mix of the floral with the

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.610 
a good mix of the floral with the
freshness<00:07:34.530> as<00:07:34.860> well<00:07:35.660> so<00:07:36.660> it<00:07:36.960> would<00:07:37.140> recommend

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
freshness as well so it would recommend

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.920 
freshness as well so it would recommend
it<00:07:37.770> I<00:07:38.010> am<00:07:38.490> using<00:07:38.730> it<00:07:39.030> but<00:07:39.240> I<00:07:39.390> don't<00:07:39.630> know<00:07:39.780> if

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:39.930 
it I am using it but I don't know if

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.150 
it I am using it but I don't know if
it's<00:07:40.080> something<00:07:40.260> that<00:07:40.410> I<00:07:40.590> would<00:07:40.740> go<00:07:40.860> out<00:07:41.010> and

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 
it's something that I would go out and

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.780 
it's something that I would go out and
repurchase<00:07:41.910> it<00:07:42.090> after<00:07:42.570> I'm<00:07:42.720> done<00:07:42.960> with<00:07:43.200> this

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:43.790 
repurchase it after I'm done with this

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.120 
repurchase it after I'm done with this
but<00:07:44.790> I<00:07:45.350> really<00:07:46.350> do<00:07:46.530> like<00:07:46.620> it<00:07:46.680> and<00:07:46.920> you<00:07:46.980> only

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.130 
but I really do like it and you only

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.910 
but I really do like it and you only
need<00:07:47.370> one<00:07:47.820> spray<00:07:48.410> two<00:07:49.410> sprays

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:49.920 
need one spray two sprays

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.730 
need one spray two sprays
tops<00:07:50.160> so<00:07:50.520> this<00:07:50.730> will<00:07:51.000> last<00:07:51.210> a<00:07:51.510> long<00:07:51.780> time<00:07:52.110> for

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 
tops so this will last a long time for

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.220 
tops so this will last a long time for
the<00:07:52.890> $65<00:07:53.670> for<00:07:53.700> 1.7<00:07:54.420> ounces<00:07:54.690> it<00:07:54.870> seems<00:07:55.050> a<00:07:55.140> little

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:55.230 
the $65 for 1.7 ounces it seems a little

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.800 
the $65 for 1.7 ounces it seems a little
bit<00:07:55.380> expensive<00:07:55.740> but<00:07:56.030> it's<00:07:57.030> really<00:07:57.390> on<00:07:57.540> par

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:57.810 
bit expensive but it's really on par

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.310 
bit expensive but it's really on par
