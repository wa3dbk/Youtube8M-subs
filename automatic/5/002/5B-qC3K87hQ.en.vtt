I think that's how it's pronounced

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.370 
I think that's how it's pronounced
sometime<00:03:33.269> love<00:03:33.450> trouble<00:03:33.840> pronouncing<00:03:33.989> these

sometime love trouble pronouncing these

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.039 
sometime love trouble pronouncing these

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.180

between<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.700> lights<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.660> darts<00:03:43.049> which

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
between the lights and the darts which

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.720 
between the lights and the darts which
is<00:03:43.650> really<00:03:43.799> well<00:03:44.069> pulled<00:03:44.370> off<00:03:44.489> which<00:03:44.700> is

is really well pulled off which is

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.729 
is really well pulled off which is
something<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.600> takes<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:46.019> bit<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.230> bravery

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
something that takes a bit of bravery

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.080 
something that takes a bit of bravery
especially<00:03:47.160> when<00:03:47.310> you're<00:03:47.430> working<00:03:47.549> pencil

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
especially when you're working pencil

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.430 
especially when you're working pencil
with<00:03:48.209> paper<00:03:48.420> because<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:48.959> really<00:03:49.200> hard

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
with paper because it can be really hard

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.039 
with paper because it can be really hard
to<00:03:49.590> remove<00:03:50.040> those<00:03:50.549> really<00:03:50.940> dark<00:03:51.269> shade<00:03:51.750> into

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
to remove those really dark shade into

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.780

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
I think that that has been captured very

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.319 
I think that that has been captured very

smoke<00:04:36.940> around<00:04:37.180> him<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.600> really<00:04:38.230> brings<00:04:38.620> out

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
smoke around him to really brings out

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.100 
smoke around him to really brings out
the<00:04:39.190> center<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.240> image<00:04:40.300> which<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:40.810> linked

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
and it really makes it pop a bit so it's

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.010

being<00:05:05.230> a<00:05:05.470> technically<00:05:05.890> very<00:05:06.280> well-done<00:05:06.820> piece

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
being a technically very well-done piece

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.300 
being a technically very well-done piece
is<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.840> colors<00:05:08.440> on<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.860> left<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.250> right

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
is the colors on the left and the right

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.850 
is the colors on the left and the right
so<00:05:09.640> we<00:05:09.730> have<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.940> cold<00:05:10.680> reflections<00:05:11.680> on<00:05:11.830> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
so we have the cold reflections on the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.170 
so we have the cold reflections on the
left<00:05:12.130> side<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.490> image<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.910> then<00:05:13.000> the

left side of the image and then the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.390 
left side of the image and then the
really<00:05:13.570> warm<00:05:13.900> hot<00:05:14.230> sort<00:05:14.800> of<00:05:14.860> glows<00:05:15.130> on<00:05:15.310> the

really warm hot sort of glows on the

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
right which is really nice it doesn't

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.450 
right which is really nice it doesn't
look<00:05:17.170> out<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.500> place<00:05:17.530> at<00:05:17.830> all<00:05:17.920> it<00:05:18.070> just<00:05:18.100> simply

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
look out of place at all it just simply

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.190 
look out of place at all it just simply
looks<00:05:18.760> like<00:05:18.910> there<00:05:19.090> are<00:05:19.120> two<00:05:19.390> different

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
looks like there are two different

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.750 
looks like there are two different
colored<00:05:20.500> light<00:05:20.740> sources<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.430> it's<00:05:21.550> very

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
colored light sources and it's very

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.820 
colored light sources and it's very
effectively<00:05:22.240> done<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.900> only<00:05:23.380> point<00:05:23.710> of

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
effectively done the only point of

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.710 
effectively done the only point of
constructive<00:05:24.100> criticism<00:05:24.940> i<00:05:25.060> will<00:05:25.240> offer<00:05:25.390> is

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
constructive criticism i will offer is

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.300 
constructive criticism i will offer is
that<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.110> left<00:05:26.350> eye<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:26.530> right<00:05:26.890> I<00:05:26.920> are

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
that the left eye and right I are

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.010 
that the left eye and right I are
slightly<00:05:27.610> different<00:05:27.880> in<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.630> don't<00:05:28.930> know

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
slightly different in that I don't know

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.450 
slightly different in that I don't know
what<00:05:29.170> it<00:05:29.260> is<00:05:29.350> in<00:05:29.470> particular<00:05:29.770> but<00:05:30.130> I<00:05:30.190> think

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
what it is in particular but I think

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.760 
what it is in particular but I think
there's<00:05:30.820> a<00:05:30.940> certain<00:05:31.210> depth<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.230> eyelashes

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
there's a certain depth to the eyelashes

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.500 
there's a certain depth to the eyelashes
in<00:05:32.890> one<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:33.400> something<00:05:33.970> lacking<00:05:34.180> in<00:05:34.480> the

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
in one and something lacking in the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.350 
in one and something lacking in the
shading<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.050> other<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.580> guess<00:05:37.180> it's

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
shading of the other and I guess it's

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.300 
shading of the other and I guess it's
just<00:05:37.420> slightly<00:05:37.780> asymmetrical<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:38.980> feels

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
just slightly asymmetrical and it feels

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.460 
just slightly asymmetrical and it feels
like<00:05:39.490> one<00:05:39.790> should<00:05:40.060> we<00:05:40.180> make<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.480> other<00:05:40.600> in

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
like one should we make the other in

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.020 
like one should we make the other in
that<00:05:41.620> sense<00:05:41.920> but<00:05:42.100> otherwise<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.700> overall

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
that sense but otherwise the overall

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.640 
that sense but otherwise the overall
piece<00:05:43.210> is<00:05:43.360> just<00:05:43.570> astounding<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.140> well<00:05:44.290> done<00:05:44.470> I

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
piece is just astounding the well done I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.140 
piece is just astounding the well done I
love<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:45.010> pain<00:05:45.190> structure<00:05:45.610> I<00:05:45.670> love<00:05:45.940> the

love the pain structure I love the
highlights<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.750> hair<00:05:46.990> is<00:05:47.200> just<00:05:47.230> them<00:05:47.620> but

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130
