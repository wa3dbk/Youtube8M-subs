 productivity just like a good 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.279
 No and good battery saving option 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.330

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.260
 description of the video I invite you to if

 you liked this video olympique is a me 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 like it like it does not follow its 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.640
 social networking anything you know 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.960
 that you can contact through 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.750
 they should be noted that if you like the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 retailer how I like it because this in 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 it really helps us to know that you 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.300
 is liking our work not good 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.020
 less and nothing more to say we are of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.020
 start with the video 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.140
 following 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.910
 and once installed 18 minutes it will be 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.379
 absolutely nothing as you can see the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.269
 launcher was responsible for organizing all 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.070
 the applications which is quite 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.809
 alright then here we slide 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.489
 from top to bottom as of new bumps with 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.290
 what would be good ones 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.420
 widgets only that where doing the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.770
 battery the internal data wifi here if 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.600
 we are going to give you how the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 what do you want in a mobile wi-fi area 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.649
 call vibration location flashlight 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 automatic brightness shine rotate and what's 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.880
 we do not always have a good 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.640
 flashlight as per the mouse lights that goes 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.080
 quite fluid do not second lights and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.759
 good not for us personally and good 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.830
 as you can see here he will show us 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.380
 the applications that we use the most 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.850
 because what will come here 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.319
 messaging as well as camera phone 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.030
 and browser which are the applications that 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.770
 I use pretty much like they were 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.210
 I use a lot of whatsapp and twitter so 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.429
 so much to put up like 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 what maps and settings that good 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.399
 I think this will not put default 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 in the same way we keep seeing that 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 a market application then to see 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.649
 the applications that the developers 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.390
 of apps have to offer not the walt and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.220
 already start with the folders that are 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.869
 they created automatically as you can see 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.459
 the folders are going to be organizing 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.989
 depending on the applications that you 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.710
 have then for example here we have 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.720
 what would come 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.159
 in the tools folder we are going to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.140
 move and as you can see we are not going to 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.000
 move to the game folder which 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.680
 it's pretty good and every time you have to 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.229
 as good as you can see right now as 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.250
 I'm in the game folder because we 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.110
 it's going to look like what's coming 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.760
 Recommendations by the bottom no 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.140
 we change we're going to talk 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.030
 entertainment and an application 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.040
 we're just going to media like 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.480
 that we already see the applications what 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.280
 which is super good just like 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.510
 recommended applications do not 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.540
 approximate according to spotify media 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.970
 youtube the mobile and sound studios music 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.440
 and other no picture what would come without 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.810
 two selections point that I have gallery 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.209
 and it 's that west that you sell in a camera 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.709
 hidden norm we have here the folder of 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.600
 communication that would be more than 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.760
 nothing social networks not facebook skype 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.410
 Messenger email will be the usual 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.090
 talk that if you want to add what 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.590
 it would be some other application of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.170
 communication that will be possible not 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.580
 news and books purchases and others not 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.350
 lifestyle the truth is that this 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.390
 It is super good because it does not have to he 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.489
 like who would say wasting your time 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.769
 or something like that to organize 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.810
 all applications in a folder 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.370
 right now as it was' number here we have 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.280
 all the folders of guardamar if 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.110
 we want to add 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.730
 a new tab buy it simply 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.800
 we need a normal application 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.720
 we leave it works pressed and we're going to 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.980
 can go to the social system add 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.530
 widget change the desktop wallpaper 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.030
 adjustments to your comments and aggressions 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.440
 special in this case as you can see 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.730
 if we want to add a widget or have 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.170
 problem will be like any other 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.540
 widget that we have in this case not 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.830
 give in to add a normal widget but 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.690
 as you can see when you add 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.250
 very jet is like anything else not 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.770
 it is to say there will be no problem 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.380
 one that offers us tonight because 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.340
 besides being super fluid we are going to have 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.739
 what andrew doing an excellent 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.690
 battery saving option not that 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.010
 call battery to search is not going to 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.320
 say the applications that are 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.670
 consuming in our battery of equal 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.800
 way they will see savings adjustments in 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.110
 this case if we want to adjust the battery 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.760
 because as they were mary the time went up 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.560
 estimated equal or less if we want to see 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.989
 what applications are like who would say 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.459
 bothering here on the battery then we go 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.319
 to go here to what they have to do 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.239
 savings settings we will be able to adjust 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.250
 several options like where to make clothes 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.569
 matica location was deluded automatically

 icons 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.200
 this launcher but also the icons 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.820
