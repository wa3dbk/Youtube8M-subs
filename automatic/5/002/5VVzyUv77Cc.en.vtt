00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.760
 I have free slow and also 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.199
 not too difficult 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.539

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 legs was always scared first one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.660
 eyeshadow base to city ​​the color beautiful 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 comes forward and stays on longer 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.980
 and then I use the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 darkest pim of this bronzer input 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.020
 these with a slipper are new and mine 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020
 arcade arch 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.670
 I consciously use this warm light 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.260
 brown tint of depth to create 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.330
 my eye look and therefore the eyes 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.950
 is still very subtle even now 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.500
 I use the child 's lights from it 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.420
 same bronze palette it is a warm one 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.140
 blanket like color and I apply this 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.820
 on my entire moving eyelid and you 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.380
 down again I get the blind fits inquiry 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.710
 at the director for a nice color 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.710
 faith 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.990
 the champagne child can de luxe to it 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.670
 project happiness as a highlighter 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.750
 I highlight my entire inner corner of the eye 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.640
 and as you have probably already seen 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 I mark the color by name 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.590
 arcade arc for int excited glance 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.630
 for applying the same hue on 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.830
 my eyebrow bone with a fluffy 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.660
 blending brush 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.229
 I immediately blinded the edge of this 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.180
 the bronzer and the next step 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.130
 eyeliner and for this look 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.680
 opted for the classic variant with 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.600
 a subtle thing 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.310
 first put the short lines alongside 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.780
 it close to the eyelash edge and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 determine the length of the week 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 here now i am going to determine this and with 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.770
 a little patience vlizo in perfect cat 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.770
 eye 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.010
 as an eye catcher bailey this rosé golden 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.360
 eye shadow and is meditate snap 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.360
 now cut under my eyes 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.209
 A nice detail is that I like the line too 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:30.540
 under the wing extension and not only 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:32.459
 under my eyes and now it is 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.560
 time for mascara use your own 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.570
 favorite mascara and mine i had to 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.570
 equally the ball bottle effect of maxfactor 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.400
 I dot my lower lashes will that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.400
 line through a very natural effect 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.910
 its the next step is complete 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.830
 optional but I really like full 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:03.030
 eyelashes and therefore bring life just not 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:05.130
 at its duration for expert volume with 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.010
 this bronzer from the rhine and i give mine 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.049
 face so that this option seems slimmer 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.850
 i start chimay under my teacher one and 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.090
 pull it through four the hairline 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.980
 to the bottom of my jaw and 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.910
 of course does exactly the same to the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.320
 other side 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.060
 I only take it at the end if I take it 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.810
 go i've done the bottom of my 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.810
 chin along too 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.860
 the sides of my nose but the bargain 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.460
 slightly darker so that this also on that 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.200
 slim line and the next step is 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.000
 of course plus i use my here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.550
 favorite plus that is and the color 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.380
 miglow sander on him and i just did 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.120
 to your pain and the apple of 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.750
 my cheek and this is very subtle 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.750
 a natural result 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.790
 I highlight the highest parts of them 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.170
 face for a beautiful face 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.830
 ratio and of course also for one 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.830
 nice shine 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.010
 for example, this one does jp nose 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.010
 nose and the dimple of an overhead line 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.320
 Spring has just begun to be 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.060
 just a little bit warmer and that's why I'm going with 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.640
 this light bronzer all over my 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.019
 suitable for a surplus effect just like 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:29.060
 that wonderful in the sun on one 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:30.830
 sat on a terrace and act as the last 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.750
 I still have my lips and the look whole 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.640
 I chose to keep it subtle 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.860
 a transparent gloss and degens from 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.550
 l'oréal glam shine collection in the color 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.550
 clear crystal 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.389
 and here is the end result a 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.889
 very subtle look perfect for a baby 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.539
 which is also very easy to wear 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.220
