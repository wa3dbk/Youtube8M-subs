00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.760
 Welcome another video, I'll explain the 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.350
 most convenient way and the most 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.440
 easy to make a screen print of the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.440
 computer 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.060
 near the upper right corner of the 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.800
 keyboard is a technique called print 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.480
 screen will position this window is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 tighten this technique whose name may 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.360
 be abbreviated as trt ce or something 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 type 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 this causes the snapshot of the screen 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.600
 stay on the clipboard when you open 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 part we can crown what is in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.800
 the transfer area that in this case is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.589
 snapshot with the print key 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.970
 screen 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.110
 this is the highest method of making a 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.820
 screen beast 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.290
 if the operating system is the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.290
 windows seven or earlier 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.729
 but for those who use windows 8 or 8.1 to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.320
 an even faster way 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.390
 I will do some gibberish that any 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.390
 image to demonstrate 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.789
 so to get the screen image I 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.110
 hold the windows key and press the 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.110
 print screen on keyboard 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.310
 these things on the screen is a sign that the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.380
 comb was made in the first comb using 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.600
 This method creates a page in the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.399
 library images call screenshots 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.560
 and therein lies the comb 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.560
 of the screen that we did already with a numbering 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.890
 Thank you for existing 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.049
 If you like I'd like to sign up for 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.049
 channel and until the next video
