I<00:02:47.580> hit<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.700> world's<00:02:49.000> biggest<00:02:49.180> bump<00:02:49.600> because<00:02:49.780> I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
I hit the world's biggest bump because I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.380 
I hit the world's biggest bump because I
was<00:02:50.140> staring<00:02:50.350> at<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.740> freaking<00:02:51.390> Nissan

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
was staring at this freaking Nissan

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.300 
was staring at this freaking Nissan
240sx<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.530> drove<00:02:53.710> by

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.250 

I<00:02:57.340> don't<00:02:57.940> think<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.150> bottomed<00:02:58.360> out<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:58.930> I'm<00:02:58.990> good

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
I don't think I bottomed out so I'm good

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.870 
I don't think I bottomed out so I'm good
I<00:02:59.470> didn't<00:03:00.160> scrape<00:03:00.400> which<00:03:00.640> I'm<00:03:00.790> really

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
I didn't scrape which I'm really

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.750 
I didn't scrape which I'm really
surprised<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:01.480> damn<00:03:02.470> they're<00:03:03.459> not<00:03:03.580> like

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
surprised that damn they're not like

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.250 
surprised that damn they're not like
bumps<00:03:04.060> are<00:03:04.180> just<00:03:04.330> like<00:03:04.450> big<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:04.900> freaking

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
bumps are just like big like freaking

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.500 
bumps are just like big like freaking
grooves<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.860> road<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
grooves in the road and you have a

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.240 
grooves in the road and you have a
little<00:03:07.810> super<00:03:08.110> little<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.740> swallow<00:03:09.040> your

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
little super little like swallow your

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:18.990 
little super little like swallow your
car

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.260 

it's<00:03:19.390> good<00:03:19.630> time<00:03:19.900> for<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> new<00:03:20.350> clutch

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.510 

and<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.020> clutch<00:03:25.260> probably<00:03:25.620> has<00:03:25.740> like<00:03:25.920> 50<00:03:26.310> I

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
and this clutch probably has like 50 I

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.500 
and this clutch probably has like 50 I
think<00:03:26.640> 50<00:03:27.150> thousand<00:03:27.990> miles<00:03:28.820> but<00:03:29.820> I'm<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:30.300> sure

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
think 50 thousand miles but I'm not sure

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.760 
think 50 thousand miles but I'm not sure
if<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> clutch<00:03:30.900> was<00:03:31.050> put<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.320> wrong<00:03:31.500> or<00:03:31.650> not

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
if the clutch was put in wrong or not

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.350 
if the clutch was put in wrong or not
because<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:33.450> clutch<00:03:33.780> does<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> lot<00:03:34.890> of

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
because the clutch does like a lot of

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.420 
because the clutch does like a lot of
chattering<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.800> doesn't<00:03:37.980> want<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.250> grab

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
chattering like it doesn't want to grab

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.380 
chattering like it doesn't want to grab
right<00:03:38.700> away

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
right away

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.800 
right away
so<00:03:41.020> instead<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.530> sliding<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.570> clutch

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
so instead of it sliding like a clutch

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.210 
so instead of it sliding like a clutch
is<00:03:43.960> supposed<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.350> you<00:03:44.470> like<00:03:44.620> friction<00:03:45.070> and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
is supposed to you like friction and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.160 
is supposed to you like friction and
give<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> little<00:03:45.610> bit<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.360> like<00:03:46.570> once<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.930> grab

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
give a little bit and like once to grab

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.810 
give a little bit and like once to grab
and<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.860> drink<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.100> good<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.520> can't

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
and it like to drink a good you I can't

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.650 
and it like to drink a good you I can't
explain<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.300> have<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.510> drive<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:52.510> that

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
explain you have to drive it but that

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.000 
explain you have to drive it but that
went<00:03:52.900> away<00:03:53.700> and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.070 

ever<00:03:57.550> since<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.910> went<00:03:58.060> away<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.660> clutch<00:03:58.870> is

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
ever since it went away the clutch is

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.839 
ever since it went away the clutch is
just<00:03:59.260> really<00:03:59.500> it<00:04:00.340> gives<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.730> lot<00:04:00.879> you<00:04:01.060> know

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
just really it gives a lot you know

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.089 
just really it gives a lot you know
so<00:04:02.390> if<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.629> were<00:04:02.749> to<00:04:02.780> shift<00:04:03.019> hard<00:04:03.379> from<00:04:03.709> first<00:04:03.950> in

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
so if I were to shift hard from first in

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.580 
so if I were to shift hard from first in
a<00:04:04.159> second<00:04:04.719> I'd<00:04:05.719> probably<00:04:05.959> experience<00:04:06.530> some

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
a second I'd probably experience some

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.380 
a second I'd probably experience some
fudge<00:04:06.889> slip<00:04:07.659> especially<00:04:08.659> going<00:04:08.840> up<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:09.019> hill

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
fudge slip especially going up a hill

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.970 
fudge slip especially going up a hill
that's<00:04:10.930> why<00:04:11.080> I<00:04:11.110> really<00:04:11.260> don't<00:04:11.470> drive<00:04:11.650> my<00:04:11.800> car

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
that's why I really don't drive my car

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.340 
that's why I really don't drive my car
too<00:04:12.160> hard<00:04:12.550> I'm<00:04:13.270> just<00:04:13.570> preserving<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.170> because

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
too hard I'm just preserving it because

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.680 
too hard I'm just preserving it because
clutches<00:04:14.710> aren't<00:04:14.920> cheap<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.239> know<00:04:16.299> I<00:04:16.420> can't

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
clutches aren't cheap and I know I can't

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.240 
clutches aren't cheap and I know I can't
do<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.900> by<00:04:16.959> myself<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.440> don't<00:04:17.470> have<00:04:17.680> a<00:04:17.709> garage<00:04:17.980> or

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
do it by myself I don't have a garage or

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.080 
do it by myself I don't have a garage or
a<00:04:18.310> lift<00:04:18.519> or<00:04:18.700> anything<00:04:18.760> so

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:44.060 

oh<00:04:26.150> did<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.050> hear<00:04:27.199> that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.760 

that<00:04:44.940> wasn't<00:04:45.090> even<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.360> fast

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.890 

we<00:04:51.220> hit<00:04:51.400> eight<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.759> half<00:04:51.880> pounds<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.270> boost

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
we hit eight and a half pounds of boost

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.629 
we hit eight and a half pounds of boost
I<00:04:53.039> really<00:04:54.039> wasn't<00:04:54.190> wide<00:04:54.430> open<00:04:54.699> throttle<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:56.639> I

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
I really wasn't wide open throttle and I

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.809 
I really wasn't wide open throttle and I
shifted<00:04:58.180> before<00:04:58.479> 5,000<00:04:59.050> rpms<00:04:59.490> yeah<00:05:00.490> when<00:05:00.789> I

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
shifted before 5,000 rpms yeah when I

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.189 
shifted before 5,000 rpms yeah when I
shifted<00:05:01.150> in<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.360> second<00:05:01.690> there<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:01.870> heard<00:05:02.050> it

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199
