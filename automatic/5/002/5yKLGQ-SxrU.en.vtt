okay<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.780> card<00:02:49.019> i<00:02:49.109> think<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.379> little

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
okay this card i think is a little

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.800 
okay this card i think is a little
better<00:02:49.769> but<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.189> still<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:53.599> good<00:02:54.599> for

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
better but it still is a good for

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.390 
better but it still is a good for
limited<00:02:55.260> don't<00:02:55.739> think<00:02:55.919> gets<00:02:56.069> there<00:02:56.280> for

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
limited don't think gets there for

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.250 
limited don't think gets there for
anywhere<00:02:56.669> else<00:02:56.819> then<00:02:57.599> we<00:02:57.719> have<00:02:57.810> pitiless

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
anywhere else then we have pitiless

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.069 
anywhere else then we have pitiless
horde<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:59.159> not<00:02:59.549> sold<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.939> this<00:03:00.030> card<00:03:00.299> 3453

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
horde I'm not sold in this card 3453

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.530 
horde I'm not sold in this card 3453
they<00:03:01.859> do<00:03:01.919> damage<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.579> every<00:03:02.849> turn<00:03:03.060> seems

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
they do damage to every turn seems

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.360 
they do damage to every turn seems
really<00:03:03.930> great<00:03:03.959> up<00:03:04.260> front<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:04.950> honestly<00:03:05.310> I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
really great up front but honestly I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.099 
really great up front but honestly I
think<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.669> more<00:03:05.730> powerful<00:03:06.180> for<00:03:06.719> its<00:03:06.750> dash

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
think it's more powerful for its dash

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.979 
think it's more powerful for its dash
than<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.519> for<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.510> playing<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> straight

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
than it is for just playing it straight

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.159 
than it is for just playing it straight
up<00:03:10.139> but<00:03:10.409> I<00:03:10.650> mean<00:03:11.040> five<00:03:11.549> power<00:03:11.879> is<00:03:12.239> nice<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:13.019> have

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
up but I mean five power is nice to have

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.890 
up but I mean five power is nice to have
so<00:03:13.409> early<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.950> game<00:03:14.159> and<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:15.510> think<00:03:15.659> that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
so early in the game and I think that

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.589 
so early in the game and I think that
will<00:03:16.229> probably<00:03:16.739> make<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.669> just<00:03:18.180> worth<00:03:18.329> playing

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
will probably make it just worth playing

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.059 
will probably make it just worth playing
just<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.169> five<00:03:19.379> power<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.859> field

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
just to have the five power of the field

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.229 
just to have the five power of the field
it's<00:03:20.459> very<00:03:20.609> hard<00:03:20.760> for<00:03:20.790> your<00:03:20.940> opponent<00:03:21.060> to

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
it's very hard for your opponent to

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.030 
it's very hard for your opponent to
attack<00:03:21.329> into<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.199> take<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.590> until<00:03:22.859> them

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
attack into that you take in until them

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.119 
attack into that you take in until them
five<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.840> turn<00:03:25.019> four<00:03:25.409> that's<00:03:25.680> something

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
five that on turn four that's something

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.710 
five that on turn four that's something
that's<00:03:26.220> very<00:03:26.400> difficult<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.510> fact<00:03:27.659> you

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
that's very difficult and the fact you

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.629 
that's very difficult and the fact you
can<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.049> drop<00:03:28.229> them<00:03:28.379> down<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.709> run<00:03:28.919> I<00:03:29.189> like

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
can just drop them down and run I like

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.990 
can just drop them down and run I like
it<00:03:29.870> overall<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.439> I<00:03:31.470> do<00:03:31.709> want<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.189> see<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.790> little

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
it overall but I do want to see a little

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.780 
it overall but I do want to see a little
bit<00:03:33.090> more<00:03:33.239> before<00:03:33.359> I<00:03:33.569> say<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.229> make<00:03:35.129> up<00:03:35.250> my<00:03:35.280> final

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
bit more before I say I make up my final

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.420 
bit more before I say I make up my final
decision<00:03:36.269> about<00:03:36.329> him<00:03:36.629> I'm<00:03:37.290> not<00:03:37.530> quite<00:03:37.829> sold<00:03:38.129> I

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
decision about him I'm not quite sold I

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.770 
decision about him I'm not quite sold I
think<00:03:38.699> he<00:03:38.819> could<00:03:38.939> be<00:03:39.060> really<00:03:39.209> good<00:03:39.329> limited

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
think he could be really good limited

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.929 
think he could be really good limited
