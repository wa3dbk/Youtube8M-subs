we're back again work on the Odyssey

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.620 
we're back again work on the Odyssey
this<00:00:14.570> time<00:00:14.840> we<00:00:15.080> are<00:00:15.110> bleeding<00:00:15.650> the<00:00:15.740> brakes

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
this time we are bleeding the brakes

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.980 
this time we are bleeding the brakes
took<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.720> wheels<00:00:17.930> off<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:19.150> then<00:00:20.150> right

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
took the wheels off and then right

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.109 
took the wheels off and then right
behind<00:00:21.910> here<00:00:23.770> this<00:00:24.770> drum<00:00:25.099> there's<00:00:25.939> this

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
behind here this drum there's this

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.870 
behind here this drum there's this
little<00:00:27.220> rubber<00:00:29.680> brake<00:00:30.680> bleeder<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.489> took<00:00:31.669> that

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
little rubber brake bleeder we took that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.500 
little rubber brake bleeder we took that
off<00:00:32.119> and<00:00:32.450> that's<00:00:33.440> where<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.309> bleeder<00:00:34.520> is<00:00:34.760> we

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
off and that's where the bleeder is we

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.319 
off and that's where the bleeder is we
have<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:35.870> hooked<00:00:36.110> up<00:00:36.290> to<00:00:36.470> a<00:00:36.500> little

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
have that hooked up to a little

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.090 
have that hooked up to a little
contraption<00:00:38.329> that<00:00:38.360> Davey<00:00:38.660> made<00:00:38.930> with<00:00:39.920> this

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
contraption that Davey made with this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.660 
contraption that Davey made with this
hose<00:00:40.660> that<00:00:41.660> goes<00:00:42.140> down<00:00:42.739> into<00:00:43.130> this<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:45.050> old

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
hose that goes down into this this old

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.940 
hose that goes down into this this old
bottle<00:00:46.670> there<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.690> we<00:00:47.780> did<00:00:47.960> took<00:00:48.680> that<00:00:48.860> on

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
bottle there and we did took that on

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.240 
bottle there and we did took that on
both<00:00:49.430> sides<00:00:49.490> you<00:00:50.830> there's<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:52.010> brake

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
both sides you there's the brake

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.470 
both sides you there's the brake
reservoir<00:00:52.640> right<00:00:53.240> there<00:00:55.180> let's<00:00:56.180> see<00:00:56.300> if<00:00:56.390> we

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
reservoir right there let's see if we

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.450 
reservoir right there let's see if we
can<00:00:56.660> resolve<00:00:56.810> this<00:00:59.079> high<00:01:00.079> okay<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:00.950> you<00:01:01.160> sucked

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
can resolve this high okay so you sucked

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.890 
can resolve this high okay so you sucked
out<00:01:01.610> all<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.940> breakthrough<00:01:02.480> because<00:01:02.600> there's

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
out all the breakthrough because there's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.819 
out all the breakthrough because there's
no<00:01:03.280> dirty<00:01:04.280> stuff<00:01:05.259> and<00:01:06.259> then<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.439> just<00:01:06.560> put<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
no dirty stuff and then I just put the

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.760 
no dirty stuff and then I just put the
bad<00:01:07.009> stuff<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:08.140> what<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.170> meant<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.470> say<00:01:09.530> is

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
bad stuff in here what I meant to say is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.980 
bad stuff in here what I meant to say is
there's<00:01:09.950> no<00:01:10.009> drain<00:01:10.399> plug<00:01:10.700> for<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.090> no<00:01:11.659> right

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
there's no drain plug for that no right

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.630 
there's no drain plug for that no right
okay<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.680> got<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.920> suck<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.220> all<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.549> you

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
okay so you got to suck it all and you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.820 
okay so you got to suck it all and you
just<00:01:13.670> pour<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:14.180> new<00:01:14.869> stuff<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.380> new<00:01:15.470> stuff

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
just pour this new stuff and new stuff

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.390 
just pour this new stuff and new stuff
in<00:01:16.070> okay<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:16.909> clean<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:17.540> looks<00:01:17.840> looks<00:01:18.830> pretty

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
in okay so clean that looks looks pretty

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.560 
in okay so clean that looks looks pretty
nice<00:01:19.550> clean<00:01:20.090> dot<00:01:20.540> three<00:01:20.960> right<00:01:21.260> there

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
nice clean dot three right there

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.370 
nice clean dot three right there
whatever<00:01:23.570> what<00:01:23.810> does<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:23.930> stand<00:01:24.170> for

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
whatever what does that stand for

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
doctoring you know um it's just the the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.310 
doctoring you know um it's just the the
specification<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.040> how<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.420> temperature<00:01:33.170> oh

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
specification of how the temperature oh

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.830 
specification of how the temperature oh
gosh<00:01:33.830> dot<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:34.640> for<00:01:34.850> instance<00:01:34.880> give<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.780> an

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
gosh dot like for instance give you an

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.070 
gosh dot like for instance give you an
example<00:01:36.909> so<00:01:37.909> well<00:01:38.060> actually<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.780> might<00:01:38.930> be

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
example so well actually that might be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.930 
example so well actually that might be
the<00:01:39.229> both<00:01:39.409> be<00:01:39.590> dot<00:01:39.799> three<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:40.250> this<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.760> dot

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
the both be dot three but this is dot

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.609 
the both be dot three but this is dot
three<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.780> withstands<00:01:42.290> that<00:01:42.440> much

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
three and it withstands that much

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.170 
three and it withstands that much
temperature<00:01:43.010> where<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.610> dot<00:01:43.790> three<00:01:44.030> that

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
temperature where this is dot three that

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.880 
temperature where this is dot three that
stands<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.600> much<00:01:44.810> temperature<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.470> say<00:01:45.740> now

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
stands that much temperature I say now

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.060 
stands that much temperature I say now
what<00:01:46.040> about<00:01:46.130> what<00:01:46.790> about<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.150> Honda<00:01:47.920> does<00:01:48.920> it

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
what about what about the Honda does it

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.590 
what about what about the Honda does it
say<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.940> say<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.240> temperature<00:01:53.770> 284

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
say is it say the temperature 284

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.750 
say is it say the temperature 284
minimum<00:01:56.600> wet<00:01:56.840> boiling<00:01:57.320> point<00:01:57.650> see<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.549> wonder

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
minimum wet boiling point see I wonder

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.850 
minimum wet boiling point see I wonder
if<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.240> difference<00:01:59.659> this<00:02:00.439> is<00:02:00.619> four

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
if that's the difference this is four

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.640 
if that's the difference this is four

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
keep holding it down and then you don't

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.570 
keep holding it down and then you don't
let<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.260> up<00:02:24.350> until<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> person<00:02:24.860> says<00:02:25.160> okay
