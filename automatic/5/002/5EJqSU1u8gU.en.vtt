brush so I'm going to quickly dry my

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050 
brush so I'm going to quickly dry my
entire<00:02:07.350> head<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.610> we're<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.910> get

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
entire head and then we're going to get

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.710 
entire head and then we're going to get
ready<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:10.190> shape<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.400> front<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.850> head

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.410 

this<00:02:15.720> next<00:02:16.140> step<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.530> completely<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.850> skipped

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
this next step can completely be skipped

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.060 
this next step can completely be skipped
but<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.770> really

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
but I just do it because I have really

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.040 
but I just do it because I have really
wicked<00:02:20.459> baby<00:02:20.910> hairs<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.390> front<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
wicked baby hairs in the front and if I

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.630 
wicked baby hairs in the front and if I
don't<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.680> looks<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.100> really<00:02:23.370> sloppy

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
don't and it looks just really sloppy

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.540 
don't and it looks just really sloppy
and<00:02:23.970> undone<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.620> technique<00:02:26.280> where<00:02:26.520> I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and undone I do this technique where I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.229 
and undone I do this technique where I
roll<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.150> barrel<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.080> drag<00:02:28.640> my<00:02:29.640> brush<00:02:29.940> and

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
roll the barrel and I drag my brush and

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.780 
roll the barrel and I drag my brush and
follow<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.020> with<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.410> blow<00:02:32.100> dryer<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
follow it with the blow dryer and it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.190 
follow it with the blow dryer and it
just<00:02:32.940> gives<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.300> little<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.630> more<00:02:33.900> volume

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
just gives it a little bit more volume

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.970 
just gives it a little bit more volume
as<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.100> see<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:36.510> video<00:02:39.739> image<00:02:40.739> blow

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
as you can see in the video image blow

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.190 
as you can see in the video image blow
drain<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.550> quickly<00:02:41.910> turn<00:02:42.270> into<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.540> riot<00:02:42.840> carry

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
drain can quickly turn into a riot carry

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.350 
drain can quickly turn into a riot carry

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
because I'm going to end up splitting it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.479 
because I'm going to end up splitting it
at<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.260> end<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.560> this<00:03:04.650> video<00:03:04.890> which<00:03:05.190> I'll<00:03:05.340> show

sure you take them out really really
carefully<00:04:06.790> so<00:04:06.819> they<00:04:07.090> don't<00:04:07.269> lose<00:04:07.569> its<00:04:07.930> shape

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
carefully so they don't lose its shape

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.039 
carefully so they don't lose its shape
and<00:04:08.470> if<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.190> just<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:09.819> happens<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.510> fall<00:04:10.780> out<00:04:11.019> of

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
and if it just so happens to fall out of

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.349 
and if it just so happens to fall out of
place<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.709> use<00:04:11.890> your<00:04:12.069> finger<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:13.000> swirl

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
place you can use your finger to swirl

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:25.170 
place you can use your finger to swirl
it<00:04:13.659> and<00:04:13.810> then<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.440> shape<00:04:14.680> will<00:04:14.859> come<00:04:15.040> back

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.240 

okay<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.270> last<00:04:26.750> but<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.110> least<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.710> front<00:04:27.950> lid

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250

setting<00:04:30.350> but<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:30.980> because<00:04:31.190> they're<00:04:31.310> a

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
setting but it's because they're a

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.850 
setting but it's because they're a
little<00:04:31.460> bit<00:04:31.610> soggy<00:04:31.880> still<00:04:32.300> so<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.960> split<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.680> the
