and<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:44.370> was<00:04:44.490> kind<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:44.699> interesting<00:04:44.910> they

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
and it was kind of interesting they

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.930 
and it was kind of interesting they
instead<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.440> having<00:04:46.740> their<00:04:46.949> weighing<00:04:47.639> line

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940

right<00:04:48.330> up<00:04:48.479> against<00:04:48.870> me<00:04:49.020> they<00:04:49.169> had<00:04:49.320> her<00:04:49.410> kind<00:04:49.590> of

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
right up against me they had her kind of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.590 
right up against me they had her kind of
pulled<00:04:50.130> back<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.370> little<00:04:50.550> bit<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.509> was

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
pulled back a little bit and it was

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.270 
pulled back a little bit and it was
every<00:04:51.870> time<00:04:52.050> we<00:04:52.199> were<00:04:52.289> on<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.949> center<00:04:53.190> ice

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
every time we were on the center ice

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.560 
every time we were on the center ice
faceoff<00:04:53.729> I'm<00:04:53.850> not<00:04:53.970> quite<00:04:54.210> sure<00:04:54.240> what<00:04:54.479> they

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
faceoff I'm not quite sure what they

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.939 
faceoff I'm not quite sure what they
were<00:04:54.630> trying<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:54.960> do<00:04:55.050> there<00:04:55.229> but<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.620> gave<00:04:55.770> me<00:04:55.889> a

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
were trying to do there but it gave me a

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.279 
were trying to do there but it gave me a
little<00:04:56.039> room<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.430> go<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.000> then<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.930> think

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
little room to go on and then I think

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.980 
little room to go on and then I think
just<00:04:58.919> kind<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.130> caught<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.430> D<00:04:59.550> off-guard

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
just kind of caught the D off-guard

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.920
