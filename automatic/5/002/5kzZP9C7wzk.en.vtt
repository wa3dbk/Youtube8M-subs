00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
accidentally I was going to show you

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.700 
accidentally I was going to show you
their<00:00:08.790> proof<00:00:09.000> but<00:00:09.300> if<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.290> don't<00:00:10.469> believe<00:00:10.620> me

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
their proof but if you don't believe me

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.830 
their proof but if you don't believe me
ask<00:00:10.980> me<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.219> prove<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.490> later<00:00:11.700> these<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.750> the

ask me to prove it later these are the

that there's a PLL up by now but that's

just<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> make<00:02:26.220> sure<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.900> compare<00:02:28.260> an<00:02:28.379> apple

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it I don't know if it will just help

volts<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.620> I've<00:02:46.680> discussed<00:02:47.010> before<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.690> used<00:02:48.690> to

the<00:02:48.840> CGI<00:02:49.260> function<00:02:49.860> be<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.959> pretty<00:02:51.959> much<00:02:52.170> run

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the CGI function be so pretty much run

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the same photographer although I wonder

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.050 
the same photographer although I wonder
said<00:02:57.329> before<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.930> having<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.160> enabled

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
said before that having that on enabled

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
said before that having that on enabled
also<00:03:00.510> ran<00:03:00.750> better<00:03:00.989> than<00:03:01.200> disabled<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.889> was

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
also ran better than disabled that was

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.940 
also ran better than disabled that was
actually<00:03:02.430> something<00:03:03.329> else<00:03:03.799> discovered<00:03:04.799> was

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
actually something else discovered was

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.979 
actually something else discovered was
giving<00:03:05.160> me<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.280> big<00:03:05.430> growth<00:03:05.639> there<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.870> was

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
giving me a big growth there but it was

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.809 
giving me a big growth there but it was
just<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.290> bit<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.500> stupidity<00:03:07.829> on<00:03:08.130> my<00:03:08.160> behalf<00:03:08.549> so

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
just a bit of stupidity on my behalf so

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.030 
just a bit of stupidity on my behalf so
I<00:03:09.019> tend<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.079> find<00:03:10.260> there's<00:03:10.500> no<00:03:10.590> real<00:03:10.739> different

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
I tend to find there's no real different

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.559 
I tend to find there's no real different
