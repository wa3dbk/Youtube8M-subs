there are a lot of legendary rocket
launchers<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.770> destiny<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:42.059> makes<00:00:42.270> one

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
launchers in destiny what makes one

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.090 
launchers in destiny what makes one
rocket<00:00:42.840> launcher<00:00:43.079> better<00:00:43.530> than<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> other

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
rocket launcher better than the other

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
rocket launcher better than the other
well<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.360> boils<00:00:45.719> down<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.200> stats<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> what

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
well it boils down to the stats and what

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940 
well it boils down to the stats and what
your<00:00:47.670> game<00:00:47.850> mode<00:00:48.000> preferences<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> always

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
your game mode preferences what I always

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
your game mode preferences what I always
look<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> rocket<00:00:50.820> launcher<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> blast

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
look for in a rocket launcher is blast

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.290 
look for in a rocket launcher is blast
radius<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.590> larger<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> blast<00:00:53.399> radius<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
radius a larger the blast radius the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.819 
radius a larger the blast radius the
more<00:00:54.510> area<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.930> effective<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.530> rocket

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
more area of effective that rocket

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.040 
more area of effective that rocket
launcher<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> rocket

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
launcher will have if you have a rocket

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.080 
launcher will have if you have a rocket
launcher<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.800> having<00:00:59.160> nearly<00:00:59.640> maxed

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
launcher that is not having nearly maxed

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.060 
launcher that is not having nearly maxed
out<00:01:00.210> blast<00:01:00.570> radius<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
out blast radius it's not the end of the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
out blast radius it's not the end of the
world<00:01:02.219> because<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.789> destiny<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.750> reforge

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
world because in destiny you can reforge

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
world because in destiny you can reforge
and<00:01:04.559> make<00:01:04.680> launchers<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.549> line<00:01:05.760> with

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and make launchers more in line with

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
and make launchers more in line with
what<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.330> liking<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> couple<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.159> solid

what your liking now a couple of solid

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
what your liking now a couple of solid
rocket<00:01:08.820> launchers<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.540> hard<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> get

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
rocket launchers that's not hard to get

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380

and<00:01:17.340> great<00:01:17.850> velocity<00:01:18.509> velocity<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and great velocity velocity is the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.289 
and great velocity velocity is the
second<00:01:20.220> thing<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:20.820> need<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> pay

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
second thing that you really need to pay

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.840 
second thing that you really need to pay
attention<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.020> rocket<00:01:22.560> launchers<00:01:22.920> getting

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
attention to in rocket launchers getting

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.280 
attention to in rocket launchers getting
it<00:01:23.939> rocket<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> its<00:01:24.509> target<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.900> quickly<00:01:25.080> as

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it rocket to its target as quickly as

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530 
it rocket to its target as quickly as
possible<00:01:25.740> means<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.610> miss<00:01:26.820> shots<00:01:27.090> less

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
possible means you will miss shots less

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.620 
possible means you will miss shots less
of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> time<00:01:27.960> since<00:01:28.290> both<00:01:28.560> PVE<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.369> pvp

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
of the time since both PVE and pvp

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
of the time since both PVE and pvp
targets<00:01:30.630> move<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> joy<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> destiny<00:01:32.640> is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
targets move now the joy of destiny is

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
targets move now the joy of destiny is
that<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.299> make<00:01:33.420> imperfect<00:01:34.110> sets<00:01:34.259> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that you can make imperfect sets of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
that you can make imperfect sets of
stats<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.860> most<00:01:35.189> rocket<00:01:35.520> launchers<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.909> make

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
stats on most rocket launchers and make

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
stats on most rocket launchers and make
them<00:01:36.840> better<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.159> said<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> first

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
them better now as I said the first

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
them better now as I said the first
thing<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.000> always<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.990> plaster<00:01:40.470> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
thing that always look for is plaster it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.190 
thing that always look for is plaster it
is<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> largest<00:01:42.420> blast<00:01:42.750> races

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
is well one of the largest blast races

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
is well one of the largest blast races
you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.070> admonitor<00:01:44.640> from<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you can get is the admonitor from the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
you can get is the admonitor from the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
favor warhead Bernie a's hard launch and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.880 
favor warhead Bernie a's hard launch and
linear<00:03:30.150> compensator<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.799> those

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
linear compensator now all of those

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.440 
linear compensator now all of those
compensators<00:03:32.549> increase<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.150> blast<00:03:33.329> radius

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
compensators increase the blast radius

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.020 
compensators increase the blast radius
and<00:03:33.870> velocity<00:03:34.440> linear<00:03:35.160> compensator<00:03:35.670> gives

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
and velocity linear compensator gives

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.789 
and velocity linear compensator gives
the<00:03:36.239> smallest<00:03:36.660> boots<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.079> increase<00:03:37.680> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
the smallest boots and increase the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.740 
the smallest boots and increase the
stability<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:38.610> any<00:03:38.850> increases<00:03:39.299> what<00:03:39.600> you're

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
stability but any increases what you're

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.259 
stability but any increases what you're
after<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.680> rolled<00:03:41.040> my<00:03:41.160> admonitor<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.970> it
