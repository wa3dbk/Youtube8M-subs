00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.070 
hey YouTube is a tivo rocket I know this

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.560 
hey YouTube is a tivo rocket I know this
looks<00:00:03.129> a<00:00:03.400> lot<00:00:03.520> like<00:00:03.670> a<00:00:03.730> video<00:00:04.000> I<00:00:04.029> just<00:00:04.330> shot

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:04.570 
looks a lot like a video I just shot

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.960 
looks a lot like a video I just shot
recently<00:00:04.980> but<00:00:05.980> it's<00:00:06.100> not<00:00:06.310> this<00:00:06.520> is<00:00:06.670> actually

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
recently but it's not this is actually

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.339 
recently but it's not this is actually
just<00:00:07.060> a<00:00:07.210> quick<00:00:07.619> customer<00:00:09.299> warning<00:00:10.349> for

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
just a quick customer warning for

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.310 
just a quick customer warning for
anybody<00:00:11.740> who<00:00:12.070> purchases<00:00:12.519> the<00:00:12.820> matrix<00:00:13.239> p<00:00:13.509> eq<00:00:13.809> 15

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320

anybody who purchases the matrix p eq 15
now<00:00:14.949> the<00:00:15.459> mount<00:00:15.639> on<00:00:15.820> this<00:00:16.180> is<00:00:16.810> crap<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:17.740> it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
now the mount on this is crap and it

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.130 
now the mount on this is crap and it
really<00:00:18.130> does<00:00:18.340> not<00:00:18.520> work<00:00:18.880> for<00:00:19.180> mounting<00:00:19.810> on<00:00:19.930> to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
really does not work for mounting on to

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.960 
really does not work for mounting on to
your<00:00:20.260> rail<00:00:20.440> i<00:00:20.740> don't<00:00:21.340> know<00:00:21.430> if<00:00:21.460> that's<00:00:21.670> just

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
your rail i don't know if that's just

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.150 
your rail i don't know if that's just
mine<00:00:22.270> but<00:00:22.540> that's<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.320> way<00:00:23.440> this<00:00:23.470> one<00:00:23.650> came

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
mine but that's the way this one came

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.529 
mine but that's the way this one came
really<00:00:25.030> does<00:00:25.180> not<00:00:25.360> work<00:00:25.600> at<00:00:25.840> all<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:28.360> have

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
really does not work at all now to have

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.609 
really does not work at all now to have
the<00:00:28.750> thing<00:00:29.020> work<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.510> really<00:00:31.869> kind<00:00:32.289> of<00:00:32.409> have

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
the thing work you really kind of have

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.130 
the thing work you really kind of have
to<00:00:32.800> be<00:00:32.920> like<00:00:33.190> some<00:00:33.460> technical<00:00:34.089> genius<00:00:34.659> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
to be like some technical genius so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.860 
to be like some technical genius so
actually<00:00:38.140> it<00:00:38.559> works<00:00:38.769> fine<00:00:39.129> now<00:00:39.480> that's<00:00:40.480> kind

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
actually it works fine now that's kind

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.079 
actually it works fine now that's kind
of<00:00:40.899> rare<00:00:41.170> but<00:00:43.890> usually<00:00:44.890> what<00:00:45.429> happens<00:00:45.489> is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
of rare but usually what happens is

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.090 
of rare but usually what happens is
it'll<00:00:46.479> work<00:00:46.690> fine<00:00:47.019> and<00:00:47.319> if<00:00:47.469> you<00:00:47.649> move<00:00:47.949> it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
it'll work fine and if you move it

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.029 
it'll work fine and if you move it
around<00:00:48.190> on<00:00:48.609> your<00:00:48.789> rail<00:00:48.999> if<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.420> can<00:00:49.569> get<00:00:49.719> it<00:00:49.839> on

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
around on your rail if you can get it on

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.919 
around on your rail if you can get it on
it'll<00:00:51.039> stop<00:00:51.249> working<00:00:51.819> so<00:00:52.300> basically<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.809> has

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
it'll stop working so basically it has

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.250 
it'll stop working so basically it has
to<00:00:53.139> have<00:00:53.319> pressure<00:00:53.769> on<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:54.639> some<00:00:54.819> reason

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to have pressure on it for some reason

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.520 
to have pressure on it for some reason
now<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.699> reason<00:00:57.969> I<00:00:58.239> believe<00:00:58.600> this<00:00:58.839> is<00:00:59.049> is<00:00:59.289> this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
now the reason I believe this is is this

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.239 
now the reason I believe this is is this
screw<00:00:59.979> here<00:01:00.010> in<00:01:00.460> here<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.960> from<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.799> factory

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
screw here in here the from the factory

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.660 
screw here in here the from the factory
do<00:01:03.429> not<00:01:03.609> come<00:01:05.790> very<00:01:06.790> well<00:01:07.390> installed<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.410> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
do not come very well installed and the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.910 
do not come very well installed and the
threading<00:01:09.670> gets<00:01:10.510> stripped<00:01:10.900> incredibly<00:01:11.710> easy

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
threading gets stripped incredibly easy

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.640 
threading gets stripped incredibly easy
because<00:01:12.850> actually<00:01:13.360> uses<00:01:13.660> this<00:01:13.810> plastic<00:01:14.500> as

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
because actually uses this plastic as

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.050 
because actually uses this plastic as
the<00:01:15.100> threading<00:01:15.550> um<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:18.280> if<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.730> replace

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
the threading um now if you replace

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.410 
the threading um now if you replace
those<00:01:19.240> with<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.480> bigger<00:01:19.720> screw<00:01:20.230> or<00:01:21.190> possibly<00:01:22.150> if

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
those with a bigger screw or possibly if

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.250 
those with a bigger screw or possibly if
you<00:01:22.660> clamp<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.530> down<00:01:23.590> with<00:01:24.370> some<00:01:24.400> super<00:01:24.970> glue

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
you clamp it down with some super glue

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.440 
you clamp it down with some super glue
inside<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.560> there<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.130> use<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:28.000> factory

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
inside of there and use the factory

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.900 
inside of there and use the factory
screws<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.260> just<00:01:29.500> hold<00:01:29.860> them<00:01:30.100> down<00:01:30.160> in<00:01:30.700> there

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
screws and just hold them down in there

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.450 
screws and just hold them down in there
as<00:01:31.030> tightly<00:01:31.360> as<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.690> can<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.250> really

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
as tightly as you can then it really

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.650 
as tightly as you can then it really
actually<00:01:33.670> might<00:01:34.210> work<00:01:34.240> fairly<00:01:34.810> well<00:01:36.120> but<00:01:39.660> all

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
actually might work fairly well but all

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.940 
actually might work fairly well but all
in<00:01:40.960> all<00:01:41.050> I<00:01:41.110> think<00:01:41.320> it's<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:41.680> really<00:01:41.710> cool<00:01:42.280> ah<00:01:43.950> PQ

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
in all I think it's a really cool ah PQ

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.190 
in all I think it's a really cool ah PQ
it's<00:01:45.880> got<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.120> functioning<00:01:46.510> light<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.960> laser

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
it's got the functioning light and laser

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.580 
it's got the functioning light and laser
you<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.130> set<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.430> here<00:01:49.150> on<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.450> DL<00:01:49.900> setting<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
you can set it here on the DL setting to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.770 
you can set it here on the DL setting to
duel<00:01:51.900> here<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.680> AL<00:01:54.100> setting<00:01:54.640> or<00:01:54.850> here<00:01:55.600> on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
duel here on the AL setting or here on

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.020 
duel here on the AL setting or here on
the<00:01:56.110> AL<00:01:56.409> setting<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:58.510> will<00:01:58.750> go<00:01:59.020> to<00:02:00.030> just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
the AL setting and it will go to just

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.920 
the AL setting and it will go to just
laser<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.780> then<00:02:02.760> this<00:02:03.760> setting<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.720> has<00:02:04.900> a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
laser and then this setting that has a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.070 
laser and then this setting that has a
pee<00:02:05.380> inside<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:07.090> will<00:02:07.240> go<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.870> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
pee inside that will go to just the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.580 
pee inside that will go to just the
light<00:02:09.750> which<00:02:10.750> refuses<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.530> work<00:02:11.680> at<00:02:12.040> the
