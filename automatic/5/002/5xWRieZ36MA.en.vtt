00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
something we're still debating today did

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.390 
something we're still debating today did
it<00:04:37.870> boomerang<00:04:38.320> in<00:04:38.500> any<00:04:38.620> way<00:04:38.830> cost<00:04:39.190> him

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
it boomerang in any way cost him

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.550 
it boomerang in any way cost him
anything<00:04:39.640> well<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:40.690> was<00:04:40.810> very<00:04:41.050> close<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:41.320> the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
anything well it was very close to the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.260 
anything well it was very close to the
election<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.100> we<00:04:42.280> know<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.760> election

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
election and we know that that election

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.210 
election and we know that that election
was<00:04:43.390> very<00:04:43.630> very<00:04:43.840> close<00:04:44.200> but<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.620> think<00:04:44.980> in<00:04:45.100> the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
was very very close but I think in the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.280 
was very very close but I think in the
long<00:04:45.400> run<00:04:45.460> people<00:04:46.120> had<00:04:46.300> seen<00:04:46.690> enough<00:04:46.720> of

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
long run people had seen enough of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.860 
long run people had seen enough of
George<00:04:47.590> W<00:04:47.770> Bush<00:04:47.920> those<00:04:48.310> who<00:04:48.460> voted<00:04:48.670> for<00:04:48.820> him<00:04:49.150> to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
George W Bush those who voted for him to

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.440 
George W Bush those who voted for him to
forgive<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.590> gaffe<00:04:51.010> like<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.580> because<00:04:52.060> he<00:04:52.360> had

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
forgive a gaffe like that because he had

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.270 
forgive a gaffe like that because he had
made<00:04:52.690> his<00:04:52.870> case<00:04:53.110> in<00:04:53.320> debates<00:04:53.710> he'd<00:04:54.010> made<00:04:54.250> his

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
made his case in debates he'd made his

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.810 
made his case in debates he'd made his
case<00:04:54.610> in<00:04:54.850> speeches<00:04:55.890> in<00:04:56.890> other<00:04:57.160> way<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.700> think

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
case in speeches in other way so I think

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.900 
case in speeches in other way so I think
candidates<00:04:58.570> can<00:04:58.840> overcome<00:04:59.580> mistakes<00:05:00.580> but

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
candidates can overcome mistakes but

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.000 
candidates can overcome mistakes but
they've<00:05:01.030> got<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:01.360> come<00:05:01.510> back<00:05:01.540> strong<00:05:02.050> and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
they've got to come back strong and

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.280 
they've got to come back strong and
explain<00:05:03.550> themselves<00:05:03.820> later<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:04.960> do<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.230> think

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
explain themselves later so do you think

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.140 
explain themselves later so do you think
that<00:05:05.920> this<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.160> going<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.640> be<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.790> case<00:05:07.120> where

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
that this is going to be a case where

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.700 
that this is going to be a case where
they're<00:05:07.510> going<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.690> do<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.840> herman<00:05:08.230> cain<00:05:08.440> the

the Donald Trump ever was but he flirted

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.740 
the Donald Trump ever was but he flirted
with<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.350> idea<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:15.370> sort<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.240> kill<00:05:16.450> him<00:05:16.570> in<00:05:16.660> the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
with the idea to sort of kill him in the

gate so to speak I think that's the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.800 
gate so to speak I think that's the
attempt<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.780> think<00:05:20.230> that<00:05:21.540> Herman<00:05:22.540> Cain's

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
attempt I think that Herman Cain's

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.170 
attempt I think that Herman Cain's
passion<00:05:23.470> for<00:05:23.860> Israel<00:05:24.340> came<00:05:24.520> through<00:05:24.850> in<00:05:25.030> that

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
passion for Israel came through in that

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.460 
passion for Israel came through in that
interview<00:05:25.570> even<00:05:25.750> though<00:05:25.960> he<00:05:26.110> did<00:05:26.290> have<00:05:26.440> a

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
interview even though he did have a

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.570 
interview even though he did have a
little<00:05:26.650> bit<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:26.920> a<00:05:27.100> deer<00:05:27.370> in<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:27.550> headlights

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
little bit of a deer in the headlights

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.760 
little bit of a deer in the headlights
moment<00:05:28.420> so<00:05:28.870> it's<00:05:28.990> just<00:05:29.200> it<00:05:29.500> will<00:05:29.650> be

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
moment so it's just it will be

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.620 
moment so it's just it will be
interesting<00:05:29.980> to<00:05:30.250> see<00:05:30.610> what<00:05:30.640> happens<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.510> I

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
interesting to see what happens and I

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.750 
interesting to see what happens and I
think<00:05:31.870> people<00:05:32.470> don't<00:05:32.590> like<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.100> meanest<00:05:33.580> of

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
think people don't like the meanest of

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.450 
think people don't like the meanest of
politics<00:05:34.300> also<00:05:35.230> and<00:05:35.470> I<00:05:35.500> think<00:05:35.740> that<00:05:36.040> can<00:05:36.280> help

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
politics also and I think that can help

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.190 
politics also and I think that can help
a<00:05:36.580> candidate<00:05:36.970> when<00:05:37.180> there<00:05:37.360> is<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.540> gas<00:05:37.810> as<00:05:38.020> well

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
a candidate when there is a gas as well

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.620 
a candidate when there is a gas as well
