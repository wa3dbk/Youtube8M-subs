00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.200 
computer-generated the print and blurred
the<00:01:48.470> floral<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.369> becomes<00:01:49.670> more<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:49.939> an

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
toe print looks at the moment this is

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.719 
toe print looks at the moment this is
how<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:56.929> collection<00:01:57.470> will<00:01:57.649> flow<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.340> terms<00:01:58.549> of

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
how the collection will flow in terms of

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.730 
how the collection will flow in terms of
color<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.299> goes<00:01:59.479> from<00:01:59.659> this<00:01:59.840> sort<00:02:00.110> of<00:02:00.200> coral

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
color it goes from this sort of coral

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.969 
color it goes from this sort of coral
and<00:02:00.979> rust<00:02:01.369> hothouse<00:02:02.030> palette<00:02:02.690> gets<00:02:03.590> slightly

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
and rust hothouse palette gets slightly

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.070

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
so I really like the thought of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.560 
so I really like the thought of
contrasting<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.640> collection<00:04:30.120> with<00:04:30.330> that

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
contrasting the collection with that

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.510 
contrasting the collection with that
space<00:04:30.840> we're<00:04:31.710> gonna<00:04:31.830> quit<00:04:32.100> have<00:04:32.250> quite<00:04:32.430> an

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
space we're gonna quit have quite an

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.280 
space we're gonna quit have quite an
intimate<00:04:33.030> space<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.600> although<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.960> will<00:04:34.230> be

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
intimate space so although you will be

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.310 
intimate space so although you will be
in<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.740> turbine<00:04:35.430> hall<00:04:35.790> just<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.540> set<00:04:36.840> itself

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
in that turbine hall just the set itself

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:48.210 
in that turbine hall just the set itself
is<00:04:37.530> quite<00:04:37.830> intimate

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.840 

I<00:04:48.280> get<00:04:48.910> more<00:04:49.510> nervous<00:04:49.720> each<00:04:50.080> time<00:04:50.700> this<00:04:51.700> is

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
I get more nervous each time this is

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.710 
I get more nervous each time this is
show<00:04:52.090> number<00:04:52.270> 29<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:55.150> had<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.510> nerves
