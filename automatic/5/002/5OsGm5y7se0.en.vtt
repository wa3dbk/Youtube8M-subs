00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
bit more this jet pack uses fans that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.910 
bit more this jet pack uses fans that
should<00:03:24.870> burst<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.440> barrel<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
but what if we were to remove the air

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.349 
but what if we were to remove the air
from<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> equation<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.459> if<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:32.880> were<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.180> run

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
much effort but why because air

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.430 
much effort but why because air

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.440 
running too right
apparently<00:03:58.109> no<00:03:58.440> even<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.640> complete<00:04:00.150> vacuum

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
apparently no even in a complete vacuum

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.960 
apparently no even in a complete vacuum
we<00:04:01.230> wouldn't<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.680> able<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:02.010> run<00:04:02.220> just<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.790> few

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
we wouldn't be able to run just a few

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.930 
we wouldn't be able to run just a few
percent<00:04:03.090> faster<00:04:03.840> than<00:04:04.019> usual<00:04:04.199> but<00:04:04.799> why<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
percent faster than usual but why the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.130 
percent faster than usual but why the
answer<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.449> simple<00:04:06.930> we<00:04:07.290> can't<00:04:07.620> run

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
answer is simple we can't run

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.260 
answer is simple we can't run
very<00:04:08.350> fast<00:04:08.650> when<00:04:09.490> you're<00:04:09.640> writing<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:10.090> bike

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
very fast when you're writing a bike

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.360 
very fast when you're writing a bike
you're<00:04:10.570> traveling<00:04:11.110> much<00:04:11.440> faster<00:04:11.470> than<00:04:12.160> when

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
you're traveling much faster than when

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.830 
you're traveling much faster than when
you<00:04:12.460> are<00:04:12.490> running<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.270> more<00:04:13.510> air

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
you are running so the more air

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.780 
you are running so the more air
resistance<00:04:14.170> you'll<00:04:14.620> encounter<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.400> thus

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
resistance you'll encounter and thus

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.150 
resistance you'll encounter and thus
this<00:04:16.060> drafting<00:04:16.780> will<00:04:17.049> have<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.440> noticeably

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
this drafting will have a noticeably

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.030 
this drafting will have a noticeably
bigger<00:04:18.340> impact<00:04:18.910> so<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.840> only<00:04:20.049> thing<00:04:20.380> we<00:04:20.620> mere

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
bigger impact so the only thing we mere

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.370 
bigger impact so the only thing we mere
mortals<00:04:21.549> can<00:04:21.640> do<00:04:21.910> is<00:04:22.270> wait<00:04:22.660> for<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:23.050> just

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
mortals can do is wait for this just

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.400 
mortals can do is wait for this just
acting<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.130> be<00:04:24.280> improved<00:04:24.670> keep<00:04:25.630> exploring<00:04:26.020> and

acting to be improved keep exploring and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.460 
acting to be improved keep exploring and
I'll<00:04:26.710> see<00:04:26.740> you<00:04:27.040> next<00:04:27.310> time
