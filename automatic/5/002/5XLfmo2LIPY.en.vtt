00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
so that's the brand and then this is the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.979 
so that's the brand and then this is the
style<00:00:39.320> then<00:00:39.950> I<00:00:40.430> got<00:00:40.820> about<00:00:41.090> two<00:00:41.329> weeks<00:00:41.540> ago<00:00:41.720> and

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
style then I got about two weeks ago and

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.080 
style then I got about two weeks ago and
I<00:00:42.220> absolutely<00:00:43.220> love<00:00:43.820> it

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
I absolutely love it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.319 
I absolutely love it
this<00:00:44.210> is<00:00:44.510> about<00:00:44.989> 28<00:00:45.530> inches<00:00:45.770> I<00:00:46.399> have<00:00:46.969> a<00:00:47.000> pretty

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
this is about 28 inches I have a pretty

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.349 
this is about 28 inches I have a pretty
long<00:00:47.420> torso<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:48.320> I<00:00:48.769> think<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:49.399> is<00:00:49.429> true<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.210> its

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
long torso so I think it is true to its

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.180 
long torso so I think it is true to its
Amelie<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.140> think<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.590> might<00:00:51.710> be<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.859> little<00:00:52.010> bit

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
Amelie I think it might be a little bit

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.840 
Amelie I think it might be a little bit
longer<00:00:52.399> maybe<00:00:52.879> even<00:00:53.239> 30<00:00:54.100> but<00:00:55.100> yeah<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:55.250> do<00:00:55.460> think

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
longer maybe even 30 but yeah I do think

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.470 
longer maybe even 30 but yeah I do think
it<00:00:56.059> is<00:00:56.269> true<00:00:56.539> this<00:00:56.839> way

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.970 

see<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.570> guys<00:01:01.750> pretty<00:01:02.140> much<00:01:02.380> gonna<00:01:02.590> deal<00:01:02.950> with

like this densely I would say is medium
it's<00:02:07.030> not<00:02:07.210> too<00:02:07.450> then<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:08.020> not<00:02:08.200> too<00:02:08.259> thick<00:02:08.740> you

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069
