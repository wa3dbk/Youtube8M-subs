thousand<00:00:43.579> of<00:00:43.670> them<00:00:43.730> in<00:00:43.820> this<00:00:43.909> one<00:00:44.149> field<00:00:44.510> and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
thousand of them in this one field and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.649 
thousand of them in this one field and
in<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.010> next<00:00:46.129> field<00:00:46.429> over<00:00:46.909> you<00:00:47.089> can<00:00:47.239> see<00:00:47.269> some

the Niagara as you can see the color of
the<00:00:55.280> Green<00:00:55.460> Giant<00:00:55.879> is<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.059> little<00:00:56.629> bit<00:00:57.010> more

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the Green Giant is a little bit more

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.029 
the Green Giant is a little bit more
brilliant<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:59.199> that<00:01:00.199> shows<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.710> difference

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
brilliant and that shows the difference

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.729 
brilliant and that shows the difference
right<00:01:01.249> down<00:01:01.489> through<00:01:01.639> that<00:01:01.789> row<00:01:02.059> there<00:01:02.739> the
