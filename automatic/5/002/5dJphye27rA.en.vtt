00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.530
 hate you tube welcome but small 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.270
 info video and indeed I have now 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 meets billions in demand 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.390
 community server or the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.730
 good man is caro has the community 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.800
 server he bought it now consider 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 for money yes with over two billion and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.770
 I play for it and I think 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
 our two communities will get together 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.470
 really much fun on the server and me 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.879
 would say caroline first 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.730
 deserves loses first a few 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.070
 words exactly i lose a few words 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.190
 and some information that the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 server for how long or yes actually 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 what have to do with the server and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.510
 Although it's about the server minecraft 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 server has 50 lotz but the teamspeak 3 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 server on which we actually 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.870
 Quite often, it has 100 closed 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.809
 that means if the server is probably full 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.739
 should be what I do not believe 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.470
 and if that is what I am 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.840
 just do not believe it 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.570
 and then you can still join us 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.549
 shall speak and wants to have fun 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 By the way, the server is exactly then 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.899
 online see the video so he is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.939
 really now there left the svp and the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.079
 link to things are server is natural 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.100
 a description and from now you can 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.570
 really gamble with him 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.430
 focus of this server is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.079
 clearly on the survival mode that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.640
 means as much as I will 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.259
 same source federal spending interest 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.729
 server is on and we will be together 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.469
 to grow a really cool city 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.850
 So things like that protection spur 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.079
 so that everything is in there , yes I have 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.609
 already built men where you your 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.320
 could get rid of worries 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.299
 that you can tell her that and he 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.100
 then answer and yes you can 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.359
 but funny things jump'n'run but before 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.369
 All really we want a horny 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.000
 city construction as everyone wears his 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.219
 Part of it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.420
 and then you can do now 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.439
 or with plaster and there we can 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.179
 discuss everything 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.280
 and as I said just with yours 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.500
 favorite band together imaginary 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.930
 without i suppose yes my imagination 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.310
 is synonymous ne education yes as I said 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.890
 I would also be happy if many of them 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.720
 you would be there and wallace convertible will be 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.130
 it would not clean up people doing that 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.700
 of course I want to be very 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.940
 looking forward 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.910
 even though roms subscribers here 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.180
 would come on this server and with 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.110
 I would build a world together 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.640
 correct what you mention would have to 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.760
 In any case , the server is not like it 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.230
 also yes minecraft keys is better too 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.209
 For cracked minecraft is open too 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.340
 if I'm against it 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.480
 i just say it's the server 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.500
 for offense, minecraft is open to you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.690
 need you but at the beginning 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.190
 so start registering 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.180
 but you will move to the plugin 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.140
 everything you see both on the server 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.459
 We don't want it that way 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.930
 lose a lot of time that was it 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.400
 Information also big as I said 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.769
 Together with us, be peaceful 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.030
 not and yes away as I said the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.170
 tied but we do not want anything 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.220
 just want to live together peacefully 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.500
 So the world is building up as four 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.860
 hours online and the rest in white 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.230
 cabrio 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.940
 yes, not exactly that now he believes 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.280
 is exactly the 24 hours online but 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.510
 only 24 7 online and that until 13 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.850
 October what did you do on the 13th of October? 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.110
 our secret is loud ours 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.570
 calendar goes the world below 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.400
 Of course not exactly 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.549
 the minecraft world founded yes that is 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.610
 right we would look like that 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.410
 that is how the 13th of october is going on 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.940
 server down for some time we look 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.040
 us to a server to something out of it 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.900
 open lab show has become out of it 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.100
 Can or if we want to download the world 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.709
 whatever whatever it has to offer 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.260
 already said around and then there would be 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.660
 Of course someday again 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.180
 if rump wants to or if I have 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.859
 I would like to be opened again 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.700
 maybe with others but will again 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.620
 be opened 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
 just like I said, you can not do everything 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.440
 We report will be periodically 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.730
 maybe upload videos and oh god 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.959
 I'm just really looking forward to the court 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.209
 on this community itself with you 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.160
 play and yes more information would be 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.540
 actually too much or just that 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.280
 It would all be too much that you experience everything 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.920
 on the teamspeak server resp 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.019
 if you it goes to minecraft 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.790
 then one would say of me it is 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.349
 Now again from me 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.739
 and from this talking house it is 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.480
 time again and say goodbye 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.109
 and yes that also brings credits here 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.840
 free the coupe and that would not matter if 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.180
 we at the end of each event again 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.500
 possible to keep it short as soon as this one 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.970
 himself online and then gamble with susan 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.459
 Good for a peaceful one 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.459
 each other and healing tsch√ºss
