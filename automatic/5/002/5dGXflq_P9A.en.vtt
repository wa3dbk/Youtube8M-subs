all the items anyways
every<00:04:40.530> time<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.800> take<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.950> step<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.370> one<00:04:41.520> of

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.450 
every time you take a step on one of
these<00:04:41.700> six<00:04:42.030> panels<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.950> random

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.020 
these six panels I think it's a random
yeah<00:04:44.850> random<00:04:45.840> but<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.070> want<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.460> it's<00:04:47.940> just

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
yeah random but if you want to it's just

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.720 
yeah random but if you want to it's just
like<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> Goomba<00:04:48.780> battle<00:04:49.140> or<00:04:49.610> something<00:04:50.610> like

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
like a Goomba battle or something like

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.500 
like a Goomba battle or something like
