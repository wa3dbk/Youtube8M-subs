 workshops that hear us 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 barons the impasse we do not always have 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.110
 narnia and the means especially to spend 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.890
 something so it's a good plan 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.620
 it's a trick 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.780

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 fair financial participation and I

 do not like this apps is important you 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.750
 and you can leave an opinion on the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
 profile of your host that means that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 you are hosted and on the site you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.049
 or so be careful do not go but 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.640
 it's rare these kids are hosting you 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 for free and you say do not go there 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 not because in general as it is on 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.180
 a site here are some good things 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.920
 it's people who want to do that 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.000
 they have used but it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.890
 reminds me of something 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.159

 we had already given attention Cecilia 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.590
 this is not quite the same is 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.829
 the tea the surfing rubber layer that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.570
 means couch a coach in English or 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.270
 attention media lodged you on a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
 sofa and it was free of charge there 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.540
 can you ask at these levels 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.180
 superior to higher levels and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.009
 especially you have access to a room to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.149
 the kitchen to a little bit all see it's a 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.290
 little Spanish inn 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.790
