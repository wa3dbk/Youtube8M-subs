00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.830 

the<00:00:00.480> right<00:00:00.690> plan<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.290> my<00:00:01.530> mind<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:02.510> to<00:00:03.510> take<00:00:03.720> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
the right plan to my mind is to take the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.210 
the right plan to my mind is to take the
night<00:00:03.990> off<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.700> after<00:00:05.700> pawn<00:00:05.879> takes<00:00:06.140> to<00:00:07.140> play<00:00:07.410> C

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220

night off and after pawn takes to play C
six<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.679> the<00:00:10.679> idea<00:00:11.070> here<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.849> black<00:00:12.420> is

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
six and the idea here is that black is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.169 
six and the idea here is that black is
is<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> start<00:00:14.130> targeting<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.880> point
