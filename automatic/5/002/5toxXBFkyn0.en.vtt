00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.090
 alone will have a sword opportunity only 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 they will have it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.370
 to perform the final choreography for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.220
 this challenge will have a television and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.150
 the video of the dance to be performed should 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.520
 be all together in the zoom 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.620
 before turning on the screen ie 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.650
 that they will not be able to rehearse with the tv 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.880
 ignited neither the sound nor one of the 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.420
 members of the house was not 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.420
 I presented 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.299
 If the student does not attend, it will be a reason for 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.299
 give up the challenge 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.380
 can not go any learn alone no 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.259
 you can only miss a few minutes of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.469
 South to drink water or go to the bathroom 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.810
 bau under that circumstance the rest 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:29.850
 You can continue rehearsing 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.790
 the choreographic steps to follow should 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.210
 be identifies in you identical to the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.210
 videos 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.270
 same if they can not replace any 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.480
 step and you can only create one free step 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 in the part of the video where it is not 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.130
 describes no choreography 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.530
 and one of you officers would officiate the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.680
 geography but it should be part of the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.840
 final biography like the rest 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.979
 that is, I have to choose a coach and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.979
 we had told you 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.610
 in the part of the video where you dance in 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 couple one of you should dance alone 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.640
 the same choreographic steps outside the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.730
 nipple and without video on the screen may 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.970
 rehearse freely if you do not want alone in 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.160
 groups on Monday should gather the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.560
 weekly test and will be evaluated by 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.140
 big brother will do it only with music 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.700
 that is, they will not have the video 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.230
 of reference will also have the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.440
 appropriate clothing to receive the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 day 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.240
 agree to jointly remember the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.810
 budget percentage from 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.810
 weekly 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.060
 we have to superpose air is for 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.290
 this basic asset for the use of the tv 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.510
 if the video is not turned on 11 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 turn on the tv with the control button 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.160
 remote or use 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.319
 something in English that we did not go out and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:30.460
 select usb shifts 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:33.850
 place the usb on the side of the tv 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.290
 the video appears to give you with the remote ok 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.359
 and start the video 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.079
 with the play buttons and control pause 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.079
 the video is handled 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.940
 we can not rehearse for an hour and then 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.010
 the 46 do not leave juande seven 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.630
 remaining to go out and do things for 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.250
 example is a dance choreography of 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.720
 two or three minutes is two or three 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.720
 weeks to know how perfect 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:17.880
 silber 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:17.880
 in there and leave everyone together because 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.900
 they can not 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.910
 topic 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.390
 as to when they all go in how much 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.390
 Time begins the test 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.889
 all 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.590
 because the first hours are convenient for us 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.060
 stay like five hours or four 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.260
 hours to grab the choreography 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.040
 then if you want to rehearse perhaps the 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.040
 agree more than an hour more and we're going 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.539
 of how is the choreography but when 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.539
 they are many pleasures followed 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.539
 Iberian 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.120
 but at least I know it's three hours 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.550
 then you're going away 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.550
 then I left area now we do something 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:45.910
 now so that it does not remain 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:04.300
 the first three eight and eight and also 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300
 30 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.910
 when it has 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.720
 someone in the confessional and I 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.720
 confirm please 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.380
 comfortable clothes 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.650
 if we can come to be found in the 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.650
 friends 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:43.340
 Hello, what percentage are you going to contribute? 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:46.120

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.490
 Perfect weekly 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.730

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.730
 then 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.439
 with the boy I need you to go now 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:01.930
 all together to zoom to see the video 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:05.159
 see how to turn on and off to see 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.159
