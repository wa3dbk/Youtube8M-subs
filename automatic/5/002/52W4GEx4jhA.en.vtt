00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.080 
so much faster and this game actually
just<00:01:04.379> prestiged<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> didn't<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
just prestiged so I didn't really have a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.080 
just prestiged so I didn't really have a
specialist<00:01:06.869> class<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> usually<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
specialist class so usually I would you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.630 
specialist class so usually I would you
specialist<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.010> mainly<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.310> wake

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
specialist and mainly because you wake

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
specialist and mainly because you wake
up<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.970> lot<00:01:12.240> faster<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.830> lot<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> times

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
just sit next to this wall but you know

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.800 
just sit next to this wall but you know
a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.310> friends<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> say<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.540> I'm

a lot of my friends like to say that I'm
more<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.409> an<00:02:04.590> aggressive<00:02:04.799> Knifer<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> guess<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
more of an aggressive Knifer I guess you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.660 
more of an aggressive Knifer I guess you
could<00:02:06.180> say<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.340> that's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
could say and you know I think that's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.729 
could say and you know I think that's
actually<00:02:08.910> true<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.690> I've<00:02:10.080> noticed<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.709> I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
actually true like I've noticed that I

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.110 
actually true like I've noticed that I
always<00:02:11.310> rush<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.940> knife<00:02:12.120> only

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
always rush when I knife only

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.750 
always rush when I knife only
and<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:14.200> know<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.709> guess<00:02:15.010> there<00:02:15.159> are<00:02:15.250> two<00:02:15.489> types

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and you know I guess there are two types

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.089 
and you know I guess there are two types
of<00:02:16.150> knifers<00:02:16.599> like<00:02:16.959> there's<00:02:17.470> an<00:02:17.620> aggressive

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
of knifers like there's an aggressive

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:25.350 
of knifers like there's an aggressive
night<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.819> oh<00:02:19.209> wait<00:02:19.629> watch<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:22.620> yeah<00:02:24.360> but

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
night for it oh wait watch this yeah but

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.000 
night for it oh wait watch this yeah but
some<00:02:25.599> that<00:02:26.110> was<00:02:26.200> nice<00:02:26.349> little<00:02:26.379> throwing<00:02:26.799> up<00:02:26.920> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
some that was nice little throwing up to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.270 
some that was nice little throwing up to
the<00:02:27.129> face<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.909> I<00:02:28.540> enjoyed<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.159> guess

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
the face and I enjoyed that so I guess

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.280 
the face and I enjoyed that so I guess
there<00:02:30.519> are<00:02:30.610> two<00:02:30.760> types<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.180> knifers<00:02:31.569> there<00:02:31.959> is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290

i'm pretty sure but recently i've been
using<00:03:23.829> that<00:03:24.040> portable<00:03:24.430> radar<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.849> lot<00:03:25.239> like<00:03:25.720> a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
using that portable radar a lot like a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.080 
using that portable radar a lot like a
lot<00:03:26.139> more<00:03:26.349> than<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.680> smoke<00:03:26.950> grenade<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.430> i

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
lot more than the smoke grenade and i

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.759 
lot more than the smoke grenade and i
actually<00:03:28.419> use<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.660> prestige<00:03:29.049> token<00:03:29.440> for<00:03:29.650> it

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
actually use the prestige token for it

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.909 
actually use the prestige token for it
because<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.940> portable<00:03:31.389> radar<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:32.200> just<00:03:32.650> so
