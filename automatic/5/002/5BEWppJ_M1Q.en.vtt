00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.179
 christopher nolan the batman 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.250
 the knight of darkness reappears 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.740
 box that comes with the broken mask 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.260
 of the bat is after the fight with bn 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.580
 so I'll already watched the remains of the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.859
 so I'll talk a little bit 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.600
 here to blu-ray and show the box and the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 Your content here for you 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.199
 the cool face blu ray say that he 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.579
 alternatively the conventional format does not 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.370
 conventional film format 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.850
 conventional film with the max dae 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.110
 christopher nolan movie in imax and filmed 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.760
 on normal film 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.100
 and then the movie will alternate as 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.899
 happened in the movies who saw in imex via 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.750
 and release here that the imax film is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.820
 and us in other leaderships of the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.590
 scenes he closed so it happens 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 here on blu ray also so let's go 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.690
 we will show that the box of several 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:04.350
 angles here is the illustration of the knots 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.400
 here all the components of the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 Cashier 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.250
 on one side well on the other side the batman in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 Up the bat continues to open a gap 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.320
 taking things from the box that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.320
 protections 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:43.390
 Here the the box with the three discs're 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.850
 and here take these protections to the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.460
 people straight see the broken mask 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.900
 from batman 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.280
 This box of you can put 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.650
 the blue kings plastic material middle of 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.750
 quality is not very good so 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.300
 I was hoping to get a little better 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.830
 for this box but anyway 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.960
 including mine came broken here in 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.030
 It's all down like I'm letting go, but I think 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.530
 This happened to yours. It 's just a 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.990
 exchange should not be all 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.350
 so here looks back where it belongs 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:22.480
 Do you have this to marry the dvds? 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:29.020
 of the discs that is of a classic 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.820
 even worse is quite a big thing is not 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.230
 For the price I expected a product a 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.940
 little more robust but at least at least 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.220
 Beautiful is on the bookshelf looks beautiful 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.830
 Let's continue showing the box and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.630
 broken cheetah markets I think who 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.720
 brought here was the benefit of a 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.050
 motoboy what a boy in the movie, right? 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.930
 is the scene that slow with talton helmet 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.090
 apparently he brought it because 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.380
 Wow, it does not have everything broken in it. 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.230
 version here 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.840
 the box here is quite conventional 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.390
 comes with the two thousand reais is the blu ray 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.760
 with the film and blu ray with 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.520
 information and here is a DVD with 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.720
 So let's talk about the movie. 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.489
 few extras 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.050
 I think these three hours of 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.600
 special information must have 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.739
 at least 16 almost two 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.940
 she is super well organized the menus are 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.820
 separated by theme so you do not 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.320
 need to watch long documentary 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.670
 about the movie you can watch 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.560
 specific things of the 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.209
 interesting in the development of 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.140
 batman the dark knight of darkness 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.450
 reappear 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.340
 so you have for example the whole scene 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.920
 from the plane's hijacking to the opening scene 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.230
 It's amazing you see how christopher 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.790
 nolan did all that with 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.860
 almost no graphical computation 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.700
 computer graphics was only to value 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.890
 that action and all had hung the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.739
 things happening that all of 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.810
 incredible nonsense because it has scenes 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.849
 should the stuntmen be creating 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.849
 fight choreographies and then you have the 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.190
 christian bale and the hardy struggling tom 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.220
 and it's not stuntmen who make the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.410
 It is precisely because of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.110
 of the realism that the course was not 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.700
 is the part of the end also that the the fight 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.310
 by Gotham control that you 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.739
 you can see all 1,000 extra at 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.209
 fighting and learning to fight that too 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.070
 it's really cool that is something that does not 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.289
 been a long time in the movies because 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.949
 Nowadays it's very easy you have a 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.710
 small group of 30 40 people and 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.229
 duplicating it on a computer 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.430
 and that christopher nolan surged and 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.280
 said I do not want everybody there 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.880
 then truth as it is in this documentary 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.500
 They are really cool to see it see it 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.199
 Clever purist of christopher nolan 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.330
 It is and while the director is very cool 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.919
 there is also the documentary about 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.560
 is not that it shows all the 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.050
 from the history of the screens to the 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.300
 tumblr that have been built here 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.070
 Also for this film were painted 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.289
 also in that fragile he has that 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.620
 rocket launcher now in an interview with 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.110
 the developers of the batmobile is very 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.389
 Anyway, how's the movie extra? 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.490
 This edition is very good, it's the same 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.800
 edit is that it came out unspecified here come with the 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.080
 mask and with the movie on dvd also 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.639
 so that's it, this limited edition of 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.979
 collectors blu ray is already in all 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.620
