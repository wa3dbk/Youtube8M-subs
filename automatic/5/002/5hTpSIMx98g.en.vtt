 He is already the father of frames. 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.870
 even though it inserts the mind first if 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.809
 totally against 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.440
 It is the mouse that even without spot is a whore 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.300
 Mouse 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.450

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.230
 who thinks they can not configure 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.229
 macro and other things like that 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.810
 is the dry the mouse once again surprises 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.210
 it already has some settings for 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.950

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.220
 also ne 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.899
 the here you make your own macro and 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.810
 sensibility that for me is what the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.819
 drive has to have that is ipi so much to 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.880
 move in the right foot and rights that give 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.280
 for up and down snow and calibrates the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.569
 new 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.869
 basically it depends on tanks and has in the 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.810
 case is when you want to use the snip you 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.270
 just for the button and in the miner's garden only 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.929
 The mouse excuses sensitivity to you 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.630

 the video is not actually the product 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.220
 I'll give my opinion even though I'm 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.510
 against landmarks you know well is even for 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.470
