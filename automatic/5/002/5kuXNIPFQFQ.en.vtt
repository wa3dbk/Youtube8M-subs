replaceable this has kind of been the
standard<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> industry<00:00:32.310> for<00:00:33.150> many<00:00:33.300> years

standard of the industry for many years
yet<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.340> falling<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> favor<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:36.630> because

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
yet is falling out of favor now because

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.090 
yet is falling out of favor now because
it's<00:00:38.970> so<00:00:39.300> much<00:00:39.480> more<00:00:39.780> expensive<00:00:40.200> than<00:00:40.560> any<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
it's so much more expensive than any of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.200 
it's so much more expensive than any of
the<00:00:41.190> replacement<00:00:42.000> pumps<00:00:43.790> that<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.940> probably

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the replacement pumps that it probably

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.660 
the replacement pumps that it probably
is<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.380> see<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.120> lot<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.150> use<00:00:48.840> in

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
is not going to see a lot more use in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.590 
is not going to see a lot more use in
residential<00:00:50.670> applications

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
residential applications

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000 
residential applications
certainly<00:00:52.260> there'll<00:00:52.470> be<00:00:52.500> plenty<00:00:52.740> of<00:00:52.860> them<00:00:52.920> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
certainly there'll be plenty of them in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
certainly there'll be plenty of them in
commercial<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.790> I'm<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
commercial but I'm going to do a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.180 
commercial but I'm going to do a
disassembly<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.920> thing<00:00:57.830> on<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:59.010> first

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
disassembly of this thing on the first

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.730 
disassembly of this thing on the first
part<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.900> we'll<00:01:01.140> let<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
part of this and then we'll let go a

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.490 
part of this and then we'll let go a
little<00:01:01.890> farther<00:01:02.250> later<00:01:03.019> okay<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.470> have

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
little farther later okay here we have

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.950 
little farther later okay here we have
the<00:01:04.710> pump<00:01:05.250> tore<00:01:05.700> apart<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.509> impeller

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the pump tore apart with the impeller

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:21.070 
the pump tore apart with the impeller
here<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.130> pump<00:01:08.490> housing<00:01:08.820> there

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.370 

now<00:01:21.680> these<00:01:21.860> impellers<00:01:22.550> they<00:01:23.390> came<00:01:25.480> as<00:01:28.090> brass

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
now these impellers they came as brass

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.670 
now these impellers they came as brass
steel<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.120> plastic<00:01:32.120> this<00:01:32.600> one's<00:01:32.840> plastic<00:01:33.500> so

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
steel and plastic this one's plastic so

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.620 
steel and plastic this one's plastic so
it's<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:33.920> little<00:01:34.070> bit<00:01:34.280> newer<00:01:34.550> one<00:01:36.370> but

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
it's a little bit newer one but

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.870 
it's a little bit newer one but
occasionally<00:01:38.630> these<00:01:38.900> parts<00:01:39.410> here<00:01:39.860> on<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
occasionally these parts here on the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.400 
occasionally these parts here on the
impeller<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.570> threw<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.930> water<00:01:42.170> out

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
impeller that threw the water out

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.140 
impeller that threw the water out
occasionally<00:01:42.890> those<00:01:43.250> things<00:01:43.550> would<00:01:43.790> break

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
occasionally those things would break

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.140 
occasionally those things would break
off<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.840> whole<00:01:44.960> thing<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.320> fall<00:01:45.500> apart

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
off and whole thing and fall apart

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.370 
off and whole thing and fall apart
sometimes<00:01:47.150> they'd<00:01:47.510> make<00:01:47.690> noise<00:01:47.930> when<00:01:48.230> they

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
sometimes they'd make noise when they

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.020 
sometimes they'd make noise when they
did<00:01:48.620> it<00:01:48.650> however<00:01:49.280> if<00:01:49.640> they<00:01:49.910> didn't<00:01:50.330> make<00:01:50.540> noise

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
did it however if they didn't make noise

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.640 
did it however if they didn't make noise
it<00:01:53.030> would<00:01:53.240> sit<00:01:53.450> there<00:01:53.630> running<00:01:53.960> right<00:01:54.230> way

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
it would sit there running right way

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.920 
it would sit there running right way
like<00:01:54.950> nobody's<00:01:55.610> business<00:01:55.820> just<00:01:56.330> not<00:01:56.450> pumping

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
like nobody's business just not pumping

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.890 
like nobody's business just not pumping
anything<00:01:57.790> anyway<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.300> replaceable

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
anything anyway that is a replaceable

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.850 
anything anyway that is a replaceable
part<00:02:00.260> on<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:02.060> pump<00:02:02.360> okay<00:02:03.110> here<00:02:03.500> we've<00:02:03.650> got

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
part on this pump okay here we've got

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.900 
part on this pump okay here we've got
the<00:02:04.130> bearing<00:02:04.880> assembly<00:02:05.800> pull<00:02:06.800> loose<00:02:07.220> where

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
the bearing assembly pull loose where

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.669 
the bearing assembly pull loose where
you<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.119> them<00:02:08.210> taken<00:02:08.510> the<00:02:08.570> coupling<00:02:09.050> off<00:02:09.260> yet

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
you have them taken the coupling off yet

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.050 
you have them taken the coupling off yet
let<00:02:09.890> me<00:02:09.980> get<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> little<00:02:10.190> closer<00:02:10.460> nurse<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.030> can

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
let me get a little closer nurse you can

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.020 
let me get a little closer nurse you can
see<00:02:11.330> how<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.510> thing<00:02:12.430> kind<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.550> works<00:02:13.850> I

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
see how that thing kind of works I

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.250 
see how that thing kind of works I
wouldn't<00:02:17.030> say<00:02:17.150> it's<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> best<00:02:17.750> view<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
wouldn't say it's the best view in the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
wouldn't say it's the best view in the
world<00:02:20.800> okay<00:02:21.800> here<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.160> can<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.000> coupler

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
world okay here you can see the coupler

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.520 
world okay here you can see the coupler
in<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.400> two<00:02:25.580> halves<00:02:25.910> here's<00:02:26.600> one<00:02:26.900> half<00:02:27.110> here

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
in the two halves here's one half here

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.960 
in the two halves here's one half here
and<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.709> other<00:02:27.830> half<00:02:28.100> cent<00:02:28.400> narrow<00:02:28.610> straight

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
and the other half cent narrow straight

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.110 
and the other half cent narrow straight
out<00:02:29.120> when<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.270> take<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:29.690> apart

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
out when I take this apart

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.340 
out when I take this apart
okay<00:02:32.120> here's<00:02:32.360> what<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.660> looks<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:33.020> torn

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
okay here's what it looks like torn

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.320 
okay here's what it looks like torn
apart<00:02:33.470> here's<00:02:34.040> your<00:02:34.160> motor<00:02:34.340> shaft<00:02:34.640> here<00:02:35.209> and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
apart here's your motor shaft here and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.350 
apart here's your motor shaft here and
your<00:02:35.420> coupling<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.080> here<00:02:36.940> I'm<00:02:37.940> gonna<00:02:38.090> go<00:02:38.239> ahead

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
your coupling is here I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.760 
your coupling is here I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:38.570> pull<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.930> coupling<00:02:39.230> out<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.680> there

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
and pull that coupling out of there

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.350 
and pull that coupling out of there
we'll<00:02:39.920> lay<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.310> thing<00:02:40.580> out<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.940> we<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.150> take

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
we'll lay that thing out so we can take

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.210 
we'll lay that thing out so we can take
a<00:02:41.390> look<00:02:41.690> at<00:02:42.640> both<00:02:43.640> sides<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.810> okay<00:02:45.739> this<00:02:45.980> is

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
a look at both sides of it okay this is

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.460 
a look at both sides of it okay this is
what<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.520> coupler<00:02:46.940> looks<00:02:47.239> like<00:02:47.540> when<00:02:48.320> it's

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
what the coupler looks like when it's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.990 
what the coupler looks like when it's
torn<00:02:48.709> apart<00:02:49.209> as<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.720> motor<00:02:50.989> turns<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:52.340> pulls

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
torn apart as the motor turns it pulls

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.570 
torn apart as the motor turns it pulls
on<00:02:53.270> one<00:02:53.570> strengths<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.230> motors<00:02:54.560> here<00:02:54.890> it's

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
on one strengths of the motors here it's

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.449 
on one strengths of the motors here it's
pulling<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.360> one<00:02:56.660> spring<00:02:57.140> which<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:57.980> also

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
pulling on this one spring which is also

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.880 
pulling on this one spring which is also
pulling<00:02:58.700> on<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.120> spring<00:02:59.450> which<00:03:00.170> starts<00:03:00.650> this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
pulling on this spring which starts this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.550 
pulling on this spring which starts this
to<00:03:01.130> rotate<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.510> very<00:03:02.720> loose<00:03:03.140> type

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
to rotate so it's a very loose type

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.970 
to rotate so it's a very loose type
coupler<00:03:05.050> believe<00:03:06.050> it<00:03:06.140> or<00:03:06.230> not<00:03:06.350> these<00:03:06.650> things

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
coupler believe it or not these things

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.400 
coupler believe it or not these things
very<00:03:07.459> very<00:03:07.610> seldom<00:03:08.209> fail<00:03:08.570> on<00:03:08.840> their<00:03:09.020> own<00:03:10.030> so

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
very very seldom fail on their own so

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.290 
very very seldom fail on their own so
and<00:03:12.410> we'll<00:03:12.680> go<00:03:12.830> over<00:03:12.920> troubleshooting<00:03:13.670> in

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
and we'll go over troubleshooting in

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.350 
and we'll go over troubleshooting in
another<00:03:15.190> video<00:03:16.250> but<00:03:16.880> that's<00:03:17.060> what<00:03:17.269> the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
another video but that's what the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.410 
another video but that's what the
coupler<00:03:17.750> looks<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.910> okay<00:03:19.910> there's<00:03:20.269> your

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
coupler looks like okay there's your

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.890 
coupler looks like okay there's your
motor<00:03:21.730> I'm<00:03:22.730> gonna<00:03:22.940> go<00:03:23.090> ahead<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.390> take<00:03:23.750> this

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
motor I'm gonna go ahead and take this

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.930 
motor I'm gonna go ahead and take this
bracket<00:03:24.230> office<00:03:24.800> so<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.010> can<00:03:25.220> see<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.580> motors

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
bracket office so you can see the motors

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.550 
bracket office so you can see the motors
but<00:03:26.209> one<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> things<00:03:27.050> I<00:03:27.140> wanted<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.440> show

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
but one of the things I wanted to show

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.560 
but one of the things I wanted to show
you<00:03:27.590> before<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:28.040> got<00:03:28.160> too<00:03:28.400> far<00:03:28.670> without<00:03:29.330> an

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
you before I got too far without an

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.510 
you before I got too far without an
oiler<00:03:30.050> here<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.730> oiler<00:03:32.270> here

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
oiler here and oiler here

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.220 
oiler here and oiler here
and<00:03:33.940> an<00:03:34.060> oiler<00:03:34.390> here<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:34.780> there's<00:03:34.930> actually

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
and an oiler here so there's actually

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.360 
and an oiler here so there's actually
three<00:03:35.530> borders<00:03:35.980> on<00:03:36.190> these<00:03:36.400> things<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.250> I'm

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
three borders on these things so I'm

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.980 
three borders on these things so I'm
going<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.550> go<00:03:39.640> ahead<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.060> take<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:40.570> last

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
going to go ahead and take this last

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.220 
going to go ahead and take this last
part<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.470> apart<00:03:42.540> okay<00:03:43.540> after<00:03:43.780> taking

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
part of this apart okay after taking

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.880 
part of this apart okay after taking
these<00:03:44.560> two<00:03:44.860> screws<00:03:45.280> off<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:47.050> just<00:03:47.410> lift<00:03:47.680> this

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
these two screws off you just lift this

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.540 
these two screws off you just lift this
out

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
out

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.460 
out
and<00:03:48.900> there's<00:03:49.900> your<00:03:50.080> motor<00:03:52.320> pretty<00:03:53.320> much

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
and there's your motor pretty much

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.820 
and there's your motor pretty much
simple<00:03:53.920> as<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.280> there's<00:03:55.210> rubber<00:03:56.200> mounts<00:03:56.680> on

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
simple as that there's rubber mounts on

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.760 
simple as that there's rubber mounts on
either<00:03:57.370> end<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:59.940> we'll<00:04:00.940> be<00:04:01.410> we'll<00:04:02.410> go<00:04:02.560> over

either end and we'll be we'll go over

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.590 
either end and we'll be we'll go over
some<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.400> troubleshooting<00:04:04.330> and
