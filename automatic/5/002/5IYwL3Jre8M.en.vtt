 Hot Dog is also called in German 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.710
 HÃ¤usser 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.739
 just packed under all the stories, dogs get up a lot 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.780
 History likes 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.430
 In Frankfurt it was supposed to be a butcher's shop for a few hundred years 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.690
 have given a very special knew 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 she really tasted very good 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 and because in the long time something reminded consciously of the back of a dachshund 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 he thought her clever 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.680
 Even its customers are the sausage of everything delicious even so delicious that no one 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.680
 from them the recipe with to America close 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.800
 In America, the sausage was a great success because the Americans 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.660
 Garden where is difficult to pronounce named she sees Blackstone 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.010
 to the Zetsche in German Dachshund in front of St 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.380
 but the name was still very long 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.480
 that's why they made the DAX 2 and just yet 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.730
 and because the voest is made hot for the best 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.970
 Another spot came before that was for self-help and sometime way 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.020
 you started - put in between two buns 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.900
 Depending on your taste, ketchup may include sauerkraut or mustard 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.440
 and the whole old opera Celan Sausage was defeated as torture 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.890
 Stories may be approx 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.800
 one tells oneself about that and if one an American cartoonist 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 At the beginning of the twentieth century he was supposed to have visited a polo in New York 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 but the game was so boring that offenders seem to be a seller 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740
 thereafter, the dax group is Schulte 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 they did not seem to taste good anymore 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.759
 when the next morning he published a caricature of it 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.239
 in the newspaper 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.430
 on it you saw a dachshund in between Reutin staples and called Orban 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.249
 the picture is there 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.629
 the term is to be transferred from there into general usage 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.989
 his

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.429
 Stories like kg 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.839
 I know the essentials 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:38.749
 in the nineteenth century, it should actually have been butchers 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.749
 processed their meat sausage dog meat 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.269
 they even say that they paid people who roamed the villages around there 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.519
 to drive stray dogs to bring them to the butchery 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.689
 There, the dogs were processed into sausages and these were fact 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.589
 local congregations 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:07.339
 Today you can eat today almost without worry there is no customer guaranteed 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:08.589
 free beach 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:12.429
 But what exactly in Target Course famous has that is that will not betray 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.849
