to work seven by seven which I'm sure

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.180 
to work seven by seven which I'm sure
many<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.050> are<00:00:39.200> familiar<00:00:39.410> with<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:42.160> here<00:00:43.160> I

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
many of you are familiar with and here I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.639 
many of you are familiar with and here I
have<00:00:43.489> my<00:00:43.520> ex<00:00:44.059> limit<00:00:44.570> switch<00:00:44.840> which<00:00:45.379> will<00:00:45.410> come

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
have my ex limit switch which will come

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.460 
have my ex limit switch which will come
in<00:00:45.770> contact<00:00:45.920> with<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.820> moving<00:00:47.690> z-axis<00:00:48.290> there

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
in contact with the moving z-axis there

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.740 
in contact with the moving z-axis there
and<00:00:48.920> then<00:00:49.280> I've<00:00:49.370> got<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.790> limit<00:00:50.150> switch<00:00:50.420> there

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
and then I've got the limit switch there

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.970 
and then I've got the limit switch there
in<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.230> back<00:00:51.380> corner

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
in the back corner

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.100 
in the back corner
for<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.820> Y<00:00:53.570> table<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:54.410> then<00:00:55.400> lastly<00:00:55.880> I<00:00:56.300> have<00:00:57.079> a

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
for the Y table and then lastly I have a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.580 
for the Y table and then lastly I have a
limit<00:00:57.380> switch<00:00:57.500> there<00:00:59.980> right<00:01:00.980> on<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.160> corner

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
limit switch there right on the corner

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.100 
limit switch there right on the corner
for<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:04.040> z-axis<00:01:06.430> okay

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
for the z-axis okay

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.530 
for the z-axis okay
and<00:01:09.110> now<00:01:09.229> first<00:01:09.670> I'm<00:01:10.670> going<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.970> just<00:01:11.210> display

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
and now first I'm going to just display

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.069 
and now first I'm going to just display
how<00:01:12.079> this<00:01:13.090> reference<00:01:14.090> all<00:01:14.360> home<00:01:14.920> works<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:17.240> go

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
how this reference all home works so go

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.929 
how this reference all home works so go
ahead<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.319> hit<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.649> button<00:01:18.829> here<00:01:19.159> on<00:01:19.340> mach3

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
ahead and hit the button here on mach3

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.050 
ahead and hit the button here on mach3
and<00:01:22.939> as<00:01:23.119> you'll<00:01:23.299> see<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:25.130> z-axis<00:01:25.369> will<00:01:25.880> move

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
and as you'll see the z-axis will move

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.399 
and as you'll see the z-axis will move
up<00:01:26.920> trigger<00:01:27.920> its<00:01:28.130> limit<00:01:31.569> the<00:01:32.569> y-axis<00:01:33.259> will

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
up trigger its limit the y-axis will

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.760 
up trigger its limit the y-axis will
move<00:01:33.560> all<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.859> way<00:01:33.889> back<00:01:34.959> until<00:01:35.959> it<00:01:36.109> hit<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.350> it

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
move all the way back until it hit it it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.950 
move all the way back until it hit it it
limit

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.590 

and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> x-axis<00:01:46.710> comes<00:01:46.920> across<00:01:47.600> he

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and then the x-axis comes across he

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.640 
and then the x-axis comes across he
finishes<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> last<00:01:49.710> movement<00:01:50.130> there

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.600 

so<00:01:57.650> essentially<00:01:57.980> what<00:01:58.220> we've<00:01:58.400> done<00:01:58.640> here<00:01:58.970> is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
so essentially what we've done here is

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.950 
so essentially what we've done here is
completely<00:02:01.610> zeroed<00:02:02.180> our

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
completely zeroed our

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.590 
completely zeroed our
all<00:02:03.050> three<00:02:03.560> accesses<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.910> is<00:02:05.090> important

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
all three accesses and this is important

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.330 
all three accesses and this is important
because<00:02:05.660> what<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.650> will<00:02:06.860> do<00:02:06.980> is<00:02:07.010> it'll

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
because what this will do is it'll

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.260 
because what this will do is it'll
reference<00:02:07.880> your<00:02:08.150> zero<00:02:08.510> zero<00:02:09.020> zero<00:02:09.140> position

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
reference your zero zero zero position

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.510 
reference your zero zero zero position
and<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.390> beginning<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.900> your<00:02:12.400> before<00:02:13.400> you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
and the beginning of your before you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.720 
and the beginning of your before you
start<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.880> work<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.300> piece<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.730> you're

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
start to work on a piece and you're

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.950 
start to work on a piece and you're
gonna<00:02:16.820> want<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.090> probably<00:02:17.270> do<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:17.690> anytime

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
gonna want to probably do this anytime

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.380 
gonna want to probably do this anytime
you're<00:02:18.440> you're<00:02:19.160> starting<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.610> new<00:02:19.640> project<00:02:19.970> you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
you're you're starting a new project you

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.590 
you're you're starting a new project you
opened<00:02:20.690> up<00:02:20.780> Mach<00:02:21.020> three<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.730> may<00:02:23.030> be<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.300> Mach

opened up Mach three you may be the Mach

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.270 
opened up Mach three you may be the Mach
three<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.960> know<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.320> doesn't<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.770> where<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
three you know it doesn't know where the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.850 
three you know it doesn't know where the
where<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.210> accesses<00:02:26.930> are<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.470> doesn't<00:02:27.740> know

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
where the accesses are it doesn't know

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.280 
where the accesses are it doesn't know
where<00:02:28.070> your<00:02:28.250> tool<00:02:28.580> head<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:29.270> opposed<00:02:30.140> to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
where your tool head is as opposed to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.500 
where your tool head is as opposed to
where<00:02:30.590> everything<00:02:31.040> else<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:32.210> this<00:02:32.330> is

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
where everything else is so this is

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.850 
where everything else is so this is
something<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.200> want<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.500> kind<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.740> get

is it'll set it'll reset your machine
coordinates<00:02:43.850> back<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.270> zero<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.050> even<00:02:45.320> if

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
coordinates back to zero so even if

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.590 
coordinates back to zero so even if
you've<00:02:45.530> already<00:02:45.680> done<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.250> it's<00:02:47.000> important

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
you've already done this it's important

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.170 
you've already done this it's important
because<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.950> you've<00:02:49.160> loot<00:02:49.430> lost<00:02:49.730> steps

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
because if you've loot lost steps

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.930 
because if you've loot lost steps
anywhere<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:51.200> maybe<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.770> previous<00:02:52.010> project<00:02:52.430> or

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
anywhere in maybe a previous project or

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.210 
anywhere in maybe a previous project or
an<00:02:53.450> axis<00:02:53.900> has<00:02:54.080> been<00:02:54.230> moved<00:02:54.500> while<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.920> machine

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
an axis has been moved while the machine

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.960 
an axis has been moved while the machine
was<00:02:55.370> off<00:02:55.550> it's<00:02:56.480> important<00:02:56.960> to<00:02:57.520> get<00:02:58.520> back<00:02:58.730> to

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
was off it's important to get back to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.210 
was off it's important to get back to
your<00:02:59.600> zero<00:02:59.930> zero<00:03:00.230> zero<00:03:00.320> position<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.130> that

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
your zero zero zero position and that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.460 
your zero zero zero position and that
way<00:03:01.400> your<00:03:01.700> soft<00:03:02.120> limits<00:03:02.540> if<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.870> do<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.290> them

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
way your soft limits if you do have them

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.270 
way your soft limits if you do have them
set<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:03.709> will<00:03:04.220> work<00:03:04.370> properly<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:06.160> lastly<00:03:07.160> I'm

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
set up will work properly so lastly I'm

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.640 
set up will work properly so lastly I'm
going<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.489> show<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.670> just<00:03:08.000> how<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.650> performed

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
going to show you just how I performed

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.140 
going to show you just how I performed
that<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.790> Mach<00:03:11.180> 3<00:03:12.730> here<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:15.700> what<00:03:16.700> I'm<00:03:16.790> gonna<00:03:16.910> do

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that on Mach 3 here so what I'm gonna do

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:34.809 
that on Mach 3 here so what I'm gonna do
first<00:03:19.480> its<00:03:20.480> jog<00:03:20.900> around<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.410> little<00:03:21.560> bit

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.199 

and<00:03:35.420> get<00:03:35.569> to<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> random<00:03:36.230> position<00:03:36.409> here<00:03:37.209> and

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
and get to a random position here and

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.850 
and get to a random position here and
just<00:03:38.390> display<00:03:38.599> how<00:03:38.989> I<00:03:39.019> was<00:03:39.409> able<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.680> perform

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
just display how I was able to perform

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.890 
just display how I was able to perform
this<00:03:40.299> this<00:03:41.299> stop

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
this this stop

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.399 
this this stop
so<00:03:42.849> first<00:03:43.849> I<00:03:44.000> want<00:03:44.120> me<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.329> show<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.599> that<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.170> do

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
so first I want me to show you that I do

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.500 
so first I want me to show you that I do
have<00:03:45.739> all<00:03:45.890> my<00:03:45.980> limits<00:03:46.280> which<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.549> set<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:46.909> and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
have all my limits which is set up and

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.390 
have all my limits which is set up and
I'll<00:03:47.599> go<00:03:47.750> ahead<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.019> display<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.319> here<00:03:48.769> so

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
I'll go ahead and display that here so

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.490 
I'll go ahead and display that here so
if<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:49.640> keep<00:03:49.849> an<00:03:49.970> eye<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.239> these<00:03:50.480> boxes<00:03:50.870> right

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
if you keep an eye on these boxes right

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.229 
if you keep an eye on these boxes right
around<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.920> area<00:03:52.129> you'll<00:03:52.579> see<00:03:52.610> what<00:03:52.909> happens

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
around this area you'll see what happens

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.140 
around this area you'll see what happens
I'm<00:03:53.540> gonna<00:03:53.690> push<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.079> X<00:03:54.319> stop<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:55.819> we<00:03:56.000> see

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
I'm gonna push the X stop and we see

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.350 
I'm gonna push the X stop and we see
that<00:03:56.329> m1<00:03:56.540> home<00:03:57.079> lights<00:03:57.470> up<00:03:57.709> we<00:03:58.700> push<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.120> Z

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
that m1 home lights up we push the Z

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.890 
that m1 home lights up we push the Z
stop<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.319> three<00:04:01.250> home<00:04:01.459> lights<00:04:01.819> up<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.299> then

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
stop and three home lights up and then

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.750 
stop and three home lights up and then
the<00:04:03.049> Y<00:04:04.150> m2<00:04:05.150> home<00:04:05.390> lights<00:04:05.780> up<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:07.370> our<00:04:07.400> limit

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
the Y m2 home lights up so our limit

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.330 
the Y m2 home lights up so our limit
switches<00:04:08.090> are<00:04:08.480> set<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.470> place<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.069> I'm

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
switches are set in place and I'm

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.399 
switches are set in place and I'm
calling<00:04:10.730> these<00:04:10.819> limit<00:04:11.120> switches<00:04:11.299> but<00:04:11.599> really

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
calling these limit switches but really

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.280 
calling these limit switches but really
these<00:04:12.560> are<00:04:12.769> homing<00:04:13.370> switches<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:15.019> can<00:04:15.139> be

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
these are homing switches that can be

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.170 
these are homing switches that can be
used<00:04:15.500> as<00:04:15.650> both<00:04:15.859> but<00:04:16.250> right<00:04:16.669> now<00:04:16.850> we're<00:04:17.060> you

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
used as both but right now we're you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.409 
used as both but right now we're you
mean<00:04:17.359> using<00:04:17.810> them<00:04:17.959> as<00:04:18.169> homing<00:04:18.769> switches<00:04:19.419> so

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
mean using them as homing switches so

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.240 
mean using them as homing switches so
let's<00:04:21.229> go<00:04:21.350> ahead<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.560> get<00:04:21.709> back<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
let's go ahead and get back to the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.110 
let's go ahead and get back to the
program<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:25.130> button<00:04:25.370> right<00:04:25.460> here<00:04:25.580> this

what you're seeing now are are the

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.629 
what you're seeing now are are the
coordinate<00:04:42.620> system<00:04:42.949> that<00:04:42.979> we're<00:04:43.220> using<00:04:43.400> a

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
coordinate system that we're using a

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.520 
coordinate system that we're using a
reference<00:04:43.789> coordinate<00:04:44.300> system<00:04:44.630> but<00:04:45.199> if<00:04:45.289> we<00:04:45.410> go

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
reference coordinate system but if we go

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.839 
reference coordinate system but if we go
ahead<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:45.860> click<00:04:46.010> machine<00:04:46.160> coordinates

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.659 
ahead and click machine coordinates
you're<00:04:47.570> actually<00:04:47.870> seeing<00:04:48.280> what's<00:04:49.280> really

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
you're actually seeing what's really

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.810 
you're actually seeing what's really
happening<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:51.340> what's<00:04:52.340> happening<00:04:52.639> is<00:04:52.729> is

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
happening and what's happening is is

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.610 
happening and what's happening is is
when<00:04:53.210> those<00:04:53.360> limit<00:04:53.660> switches<00:04:53.840> are<00:04:54.169> switched

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
when those limit switches are switched

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.839 
when those limit switches are switched
it's<00:04:55.419> taking<00:04:56.419> us<00:04:56.510> back<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.870> zero<00:04:57.430> on<00:04:58.430> every

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
it's taking us back to zero on every

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.330 
it's taking us back to zero on every
axis<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.650> that's<00:05:00.650> where<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.949> want<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.190> begin

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
axis and that's where you want to begin

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.230 
axis and that's where you want to begin
before<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.210> start<00:05:02.449> working<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:04.240> that's

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
before you start working and that's
