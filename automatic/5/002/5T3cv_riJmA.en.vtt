 hello all my prokhor and you look 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:12.490
 tutorial how to open a file with someone attack 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.610
 usually downloading some maps for 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.039
 minecraft you see there a folder and 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.920
 transfer it to your saves folder 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:27.210
 here about exactly the same here I downloaded 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:30.130
 You open the card and there are no folders 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.219
 there is only some incomprehensible file and 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.679
 how does open it open it 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 quite simply let's enter as 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:45.659
 usually percentage appdata percentage and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.600
 open the first folder afterwards. maykravt 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:54.039
 we open the Diet and either we just throw 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.190
 I made a separate folder and here we throw 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.370
 this file 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 just throwing it all close and so 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.530
 next we need the program m sits 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.130
 after we launched this 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.930
 the program we open the folder where we are 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.890
 threw this file and open the file itself and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.700
 as you can see now our map is loaded 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.210
 that is, you can work with it 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.560
 somehow manage it can copy 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.100
 cut puts your world and this one 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.490
 this card is made exactly in them sit and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.030
 so no relation to the game she is 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.400
 It has 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.420
 from means you can not open it in any way 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.680
 besides sitting there and just such 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.240
 customization stacks 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.880
 where you can edit the size of the land and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.880
 so what is needed for the original 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.370

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.980
