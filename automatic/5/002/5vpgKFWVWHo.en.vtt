00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.900
 talk to such a very relevant 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.770
 a topic that just wanted the internet to 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.359
 the speed of sound is goji berries 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 these berries lose weight let's go with you 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 today we will understand myself here 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.300
 so here they look like berries 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.039
 cute in taste reminiscent of raisins 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.099
 can be with dried apricots 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.570
 here is just me seeds here and i am now 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.640
 tell you why actually bought them 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.590
 milk them so good at all these 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.780
 the berries are not some know-how they were already 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.090
 known long ago 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.370
 eastern oriental medicine and in fact 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.440
 it turns out that they just got to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.420
 us these berries now maybe they 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.399
 reached earlier but now like this 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 the first began to develop rapidly and of course 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.600
 what I noticed is of course on 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.930
 vitamins there are a lot of vitamin c it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.789
 in there 500 times more than in citrus 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 large amounts of b vitamins 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.989
 B vitamins is very good 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.489
 vitamins gli anni nerves here for 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 communication on the system for brain 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.240
 activities and if you want to be fit 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 and fun and 1 oven for sure you need 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.490
 getting b vitamins as follows or 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.939
 why play attention is beta carotene and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.409
 it's very good for sight yes now 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.659
 everyone is sitting at computers now 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.090
 sun oil sunglasses and this 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.250
 very good element for the retina even 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.990
 according to some sources zak comes in here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 Santin is also very good 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.670
 trace element for the retina and now I 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.180
 cynology just actively use it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.759
 active additives 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.619
 who buy in these here capsules like 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.509
 for sight the next thing drew 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.040
 account the fact that this includes amino acids 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.590
 and because really far from 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 all berries include amino acids and if you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.549
 remember the video debt department where I spoke 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.780
 that is very important to receive 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.729
 high-quality proteins about what should be 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 high-grade proteins high-grade files 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.070
 just the same blocks which includes all 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.009
 amino acids 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.350
 This includes 18 amino acids and 8 of 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.270
 they are irreplaceable and you imagine it 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 practically like who has products and you know 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.659
 create it noticed that when slash 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.230
 there is a small handful of these berries 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.120
 you feel full enough 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.220
 the next moment what we pay attention 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.290
 This composition of course 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.330
 on minerals then very small in 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.950
 billionth neral here come here 20 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.080
 the mineral will not pay attention to everything 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.300
 what I noticed is that 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.280
 very large dosage includes iron 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.260
 here and you know that for women and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 for girls is very important to fill 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.300
 lack of iron because in fact 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.770
 We have a regular process until 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.560
 which comes every month 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.450
 the fruit and therefore most often very often 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.640
 women suffer mild ny 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.770
 in order to complete the process 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.470
 blood formation we need iron here 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.550
 so its here here here 15 times 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.860
 more than spinach 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.130
 and spinach was the leader in content 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.410
 gland follow on what drew attention 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.200
 and generally heard it long ago 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.000
 how did it go with us 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.790
 goji berries that berries year 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.810
 very good source of antioxidants 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.610
 antioxidants like now on 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.550
 the latest world of medicine is ready what if 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.900
 you take ax antioxidants then you 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.030
 less likely to hurt or not 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.040
 sick at all because antioxidant 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.320
 protects us from free radicals they 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.020
 protect us from aging 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.490
 premature to stop reaction 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.920
 lipid peroxidation 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.930
 which destroys our shells our 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.350
 cells of you really are also very 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 Excellent source of water and I want to say 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.090
 that's oriental medicine there 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.459
 used there for cancer treatment for 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.110
 recovery after it may be 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.989
 the operation is something like this 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.100
 anti-inflammatory and 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.320
 It is written that they improve exchange 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.150
 processes that is written that they 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.190
 accelerate metabolic processes due to this 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.530
 in fact it is right here so dug in 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.180
 our advertisers are active talking tom 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.489
 that you can really be like them 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.620
 I can say that if you eat 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.270
 goji berries if you 're out of cakes on 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.180
 night and if you will lie and no 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.650
 body movement does not produce something rather 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.620
 total we do not lose weight that is not necessary 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.420
 yourself the same hopes but if you want 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.840
 get enough 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.700
 vitamins and at the same time that it was 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.410
 the species they are of natural origin then on 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.989
 my opinion is goji berries enough so 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.640
 good option then native field 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.770
 vitamin a poly vitamin necessarily 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.690
 take on time 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.489
 buzz because well basically now 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.220
 medicine has long been saying that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.500
 we don't get the one you need set 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.570
 vitamins that should get with 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.010
 food that's why berries 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.020
 goji seems to me in this case just 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.180
 great option that's why i bought it 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.430
 samand berries i can say that i am very 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.740
 I'm glad that I got real berries 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.020
 because I saw that on many 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.760
 forums but very many reviews and sour 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.590
 the thing that comes is not goji berries 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.110
 comes some dried cranberries and and 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.610
 people get very upset so 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.160
 below, I will leave a reference where 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.140
 I bought these berries I hope for you 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.060
