00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.410
 Yes this year's heavy snow is released from native instruments 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.650
 I think that I would like to introduce something called love and love here 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.980
 Of course this can be purchased alone, though 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 It has also been introduced into the complete product complete control 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.470
 It is to buy has become a thing called here come with free 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.220
 It is the feature of this product, but as the name first drive software 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.060
 To become we have and is it raw drum sound and Electro Come of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.619
 There is a place where you can create a new sound by mixing these two 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.550
 It is a concept 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.300
 I can make it quite interesting but I think I would like to see it together 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.460
 But first it's a start-up of the sound source we have with the proceeds to here native 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.370
 Normally you can just launch at contact 5 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.399
 Here's is that this comes with complete control 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.460
 I would like to launch with complete control 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.850
 Let's load that fist if you open complete control 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.329
 It is this browse button It is nice to have you click the line like this 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.720
 I will 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.450
 There was such love and love love when I turned the dial 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.500
 Load this so you can choose from two categories 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:08.400
 Well now Taft has become similar as well It has become a drum kit 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.850
 That's good, isn't it set and then this single is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.660
 Although it is as it is, it can be said that it chooses only a kick 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.410
 For example, if we expect only a kick it this is is had become this way 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:26.070
 It is a chrysanthemum alone, which is a feature in this case, but all kicks have pitches 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.320
 It feels like this, so you can play it as you like 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.160
 However, it has become a feature of singles 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.050
 And and he let's also take because I want to show you the whole it is I'm sure this time 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.440
 I choose the part of love love as it is 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.420
 You can decide whether it is acoustic or analog. 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.110
 This analog represents something that looks like an electric tongue now 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.960
 Let's go along with the proposal of the usual acoustic along and there is a Fuchi preset. 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.009
 So I it was a second I from this is now 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.159
 If you have loaded will be such a form something kick snare is we are located 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.840
 I suggest this place in the light guide for complete control 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.710
 It's also a feature of this product when I'm giving it, but it sounds like it's also a built-in drum pattern 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.440
 It has been 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.620
 Where in this 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.170
 It is written that it is a groove in this upper right when saying it goes 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.170
 You've by clicking the play button I now Suites is in two 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:17.840
 It is when that want to change this kind of has become a thing in this pattern a little 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.980
 You can switch the hit with the arrow here 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 If you want to choose this pattern a little more efficiently, this is a groove 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.960
 There is , so when you open it like this it looks like smooth or tight 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.960
 Divided into categories or patterns 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.680
 If they are side by side, will each choose a little 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.920
 If you select this, it will be cut into categories. 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.390
 And it is it is written midi and enter in this 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.810
 It will be ok if you insist on this because it will be a pattern of this 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.049
 and we were able to hand insist on the use of force 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.879
 You can switch between and listen to that kind of thing 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.390
 To TeiShun will automatically be here to finger this is, but I think that good to go to the tune 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.250
 I will 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:03.180
 I've been looping for a while, so I would like to apply to this 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.710
 This preview at this stage and the web 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.960
 After running automatically go double click 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.989
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.969
 car 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.629
 I can look for such a feeling pattern 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:20.510
 Of course, also be incorporated in the clock stations If you have found a pattern of this favorite 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:24.349
 If you can, I will put it under the pro 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.829
 It is time to read this pattern, but there is also lunch here so this is 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.450
 It will be a dragon drop In case of cubase New right 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:34.170
 I can move it here, so move it 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.240
 Let's copy this or delete it for the right we got it and it's ok 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.930
 I will try to play this 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.930
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.250
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.120
 It looks like there are so many rich patterns available 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.380
 If you are not good at dramas, you can easily capture the putter like this 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.700
 That's where you say 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:03.880
 And I can even though I have a postscript in a pattern to specify the Chiba speed 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:06.660
 Let's do it at home, or double-click it, and it's about half an hour soon . 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.660
 I'm taking a virgin 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:14.380
 You can look to remember the place that can also be varied sense of such feeling of pattern 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.550
 I hope you but it is if you have a little bounce it is music 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.709
 But if this music was bouncing at 16 , first of all this grid is 16 parts 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:25.140
 We have you match and are in this swing 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.140
 Let's do that once we can adjust the law 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.380
 We have raised was the end swing 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.710
 Is not a feeling 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:44.950
 16 parts of it back point of you will be the form that moves back little by little 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.510
 If you work down again at this stage and the right is reflected with the specified value 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.240
 It is a mechanism to say 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.240
 I'd like to add a little bit of timbre, though 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:09.330
 When it disappears , it becomes a tone with a boo 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.159
 And this app set is good even in the rise 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.159
 And it began to click because it is available 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.379
 th 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:26.410
 It is a form that I said that I look for something that looks good 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:30.860
 Next time this was is I explain the details of something or was each timbre you I edit part
