hi<00:00:15.240> there<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:16.039> have<00:00:17.039> dedicated<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.270> past<00:00:18.539> 11

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
hi there I have dedicated the past 11

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.620 
hi there I have dedicated the past 11
years<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.770> life<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> material<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.270> most

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
years of my life to a material that most

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.429 
years of my life to a material that most
people<00:00:21.990> hardly<00:00:22.439> notice<00:00:23.330> I'm<00:00:24.330> an<00:00:24.539> artist<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
people hardly notice I'm an artist and I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.000 
people hardly notice I'm an artist and I
work<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> material<00:00:26.400> glass<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:28.010> simply

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
work with the material glass I simply

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.099 
work with the material glass I simply
loved<00:00:29.340> less<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.910> especially<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
loved less and especially the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
loved less and especially the
transparency<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.920> glass<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.899> was<00:00:33.989> only

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
transparency of glass but it was only

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.260 
transparency of glass but it was only
recently<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> discovered<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> true

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
recently that I discovered the true

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.619 
recently that I discovered the true
magic<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.809> transparency<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:38.270> course<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.480> an

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
magic of transparency of course as an

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
magic of transparency of course as an
artist<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.290> been<00:00:40.469> working<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.890> this

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
artist I have been working with this

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310 
artist I have been working with this
quality<00:00:41.640> before<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> purely

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
quality before but from a purely

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.880 
quality before but from a purely
aesthetic<00:00:43.920> point<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.250> view<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.590> then<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.860> day

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
aesthetic point of view and then one day

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700 
aesthetic point of view and then one day
it<00:00:47.340> hit<00:00:47.760> me<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.079> much<00:00:49.350> more<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it hit me that there is so much more to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.850 
it hit me that there is so much more to
transparency<00:00:50.670> than<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.149> meets<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> eye<00:00:51.860> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
transparency than what meets the eye it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
transparency than what meets the eye it
is<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.280> tangible<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> yet<00:00:54.480> abstract<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is so tangible and yet abstract and that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.740 
is so tangible and yet abstract and that
notion<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.370> triggered<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.850> curiosity<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
notion really triggered my curiosity and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.270 
notion really triggered my curiosity and
made<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.680> about<00:00:58.800> transparency

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
made me think about transparency

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
made me think about transparency
transparency<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:03.059> per<00:01:03.359> definition<00:01:03.600> clear<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
transparency is per definition clear and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.969 
transparency is per definition clear and
it<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> frustrating<00:01:05.369> when<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.060> isn't<00:01:06.979> but

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it is frustrating when it isn't but

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
it is frustrating when it isn't but
instead<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> getting<00:01:08.549> frustrated<00:01:09.320> try<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
instead of getting frustrated try to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.380 
instead of getting frustrated try to
reflect<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.040> how<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> change<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> see

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
reflect on how a change is what you see

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.499 
reflect on how a change is what you see
and<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:14.150> maybe<00:01:15.150> you'll<00:01:15.360> see

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and what you don't see maybe you'll see

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
and what you don't see maybe you'll see
something<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.990> haven't<00:01:16.170> seen<00:01:16.320> before<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
something you haven't seen before and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.060 
something you haven't seen before and
maybe<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.360> experience<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.530> trigger<00:01:19.770> some

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
maybe this experience will trigger some

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.679 
maybe this experience will trigger some
new<00:01:20.310> thoughts<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.000> new<00:01:21.270> ideas<00:01:23.270> but<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
new thoughts and new ideas but what is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
new thoughts and new ideas but what is
transparently<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:27.270> mentioned<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
transparently as I mentioned it is a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.010 
transparently as I mentioned it is a
material<00:01:28.530> quality<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> also<00:01:30.540> more

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
material quality but it is also more

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
material quality but it is also more
than<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.100> also<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.579> metaphor

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
than that because it's also a metaphor

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
than that because it's also a metaphor
for<00:01:33.509> accountability<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> term<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
for accountability and it is a term that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
for accountability and it is a term that
is<00:01:35.430> often<00:01:35.909> used<00:01:36.119> within<00:01:36.390> politics<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
is often used within politics and the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.899 
is often used within politics and the
corporate<00:01:37.799> world<00:01:38.119> it<00:01:39.119> simply<00:01:40.110> mean<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
corporate world it simply mean that

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
corporate world it simply mean that
everything<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> open<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
everything is out in the open and that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.429 
everything is out in the open and that
nothing<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> hidden<00:01:44.549> under<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> table<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:48.439> work

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
nothing is hidden under the table I work

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.020 
nothing is hidden under the table I work
within<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.860> field<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.250> arts<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.790> crafts

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
within the field of arts and crafts

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
within the field of arts and crafts
where<00:01:51.540> glass<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> mainly<00:01:52.380> used<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.920> making

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
where glass is mainly used for making

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.560 
where glass is mainly used for making
objects<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.090> look<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:55.640> these<00:01:56.640> objects<00:01:57.210> may<00:01:57.450> or

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
objects to look at these objects may or

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.899 
objects to look at these objects may or
may<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> functional<00:01:59.219> purpose<00:01:59.640> but

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
may not have a functional purpose but

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.789 
may not have a functional purpose but
they<00:02:00.060> always<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> purpose<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> being

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
they always have the purpose of being

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
they always have the purpose of being
looked<00:02:02.040> at<00:02:03.740> not<00:02:04.740> many<00:02:05.100> material<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
looked at not many material have a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.290 
looked at not many material have a
transparent<00:02:06.509> aspect<00:02:07.369> but<00:02:08.369> less<00:02:08.670> thus

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
transparent aspect but less thus

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.330 
transparent aspect but less thus
so<00:02:11.300> why<00:02:11.570> not<00:02:11.870> flip<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.500> perspective<00:02:13.070> around

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
so why not flip the perspective around

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.730 
so why not flip the perspective around
and<00:02:13.550> focus<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.270> what<00:02:14.690> happens<00:02:15.140> when<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.530> look

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
and focus on what happens when you look

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.070 
and focus on what happens when you look
through<00:02:16.010> glass<00:02:18.550> with<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:19.760> notion<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.660> mind<00:02:20.900> I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
through glass with this notion in mind I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.350 
through glass with this notion in mind I
began<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.710> project<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.490> call<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.000> filter

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
began a project that I call the filter

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.390 
began a project that I call the filter
project<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.080> started<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.710> create<00:02:25.040> my<00:02:25.370> own

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
project and I started to create my own

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.730 
project and I started to create my own
camera<00:02:26.270> filters<00:02:28.720> these<00:02:29.720> filters<00:02:30.050> all<00:02:30.500> have

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
camera filters these filters all have

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.890 
camera filters these filters all have
different<00:02:31.040> kinds<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.760> optics<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
different kinds of optics and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.020 
different kinds of optics and
distortions<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.740> they<00:02:34.010> all<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
distortions and they all have the
