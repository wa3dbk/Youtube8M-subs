00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
would think it has more to do with

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.010 
would think it has more to do with
what's<00:00:57.090> inside<00:00:57.300> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020

years ago I had an accident who broke my
back<00:01:11.149> she<00:01:12.020> left<00:01:12.619> me<00:01:12.859> unable<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.219> use<00:01:13.700> my<00:01:13.969> legs

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
back she left me unable to use my legs

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.569 
back she left me unable to use my legs
as<00:01:14.539> I<00:01:14.659> used<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.319> really<00:01:15.799> didn't<00:01:16.219> think<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.460> was

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
as I used to I really didn't think I was

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.309 
as I used to I really didn't think I was
ever<00:01:16.700> going<00:01:16.939> to<00:01:17.030> be<00:01:17.090> able<00:01:17.329> to<00:01:17.450> dance<00:01:17.630> again<00:01:17.869> I

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
ever going to be able to dance again I

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.969 
ever going to be able to dance again I
thought<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.209> could<00:01:20.659> figure<00:01:20.869> out<00:01:21.079> how<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.679> use

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
thought if I could figure out how to use

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.370 
thought if I could figure out how to use
the<00:01:22.250> wheelchair<00:01:22.789> for<00:01:23.090> dancing<00:01:23.509> then<00:01:24.020> maybe<00:01:24.259> I

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
the wheelchair for dancing then maybe I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.550 
the wheelchair for dancing then maybe I
could<00:01:24.560> teach<00:01:24.920> other<00:01:25.159> people<00:01:25.640> how<00:01:26.329> to<00:01:26.810> dance<00:01:27.200> in

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
think they knew that it was possible for

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.170 
think they knew that it was possible for
people<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.680> wheelchairs<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:11.550> be<00:03:11.820> able<00:03:12.060> to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
people in wheelchairs to be able to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.830 
people in wheelchairs to be able to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.970 
dance the way we do the up stage looks
like<00:03:16.080> was<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.190> flailing<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:18.110> was<00:03:19.110> nervous<00:03:19.440> at

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980
