00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.919
 [music] 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.110
 look 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.370
 I do not want 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.130
 from this black worm some troubles 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.670
 the comb on the fell shalashik broke the ball 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.630
 He did not escape He was black 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.720
 little worm 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.800
 he just wanted to play with you too 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.650
 Bad sign 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.760
 but also that I believe in such omens because 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:11.030
 which gallop has to run 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:14.060
 wait and run right on the trail you ran away 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.540
 thanks for the ball mouth 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.579
 something bad already happened no 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.209
 good and we, too, so far nothing bad 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.300
 It happened 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.290
 I wonder why probably because we 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:36.230
 you are friends with him and the size of friendship can 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:39.050
 be something about dick someone consider 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.130
 black worm bad omens but for 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.950
 Luntik and Kuzi 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.070
 he became a new friend to be good 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.070
 relations are more important than any impurities 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:59.449
