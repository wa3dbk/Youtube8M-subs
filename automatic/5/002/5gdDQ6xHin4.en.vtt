was<00:03:04.040> just<00:03:04.250> an<00:03:04.340> excuse<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.900> get<00:03:06.019> our<00:03:06.170> faces<00:03:06.440> on

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
was just an excuse to get our faces on

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.710 
was just an excuse to get our faces on
camera<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.000> people<00:03:08.030> knew<00:03:08.450> what<00:03:08.600> we

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
camera just so people knew what we

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.539 
camera just so people knew what we
looked<00:03:08.989> like<00:03:09.049> because<00:03:09.470> they<00:03:09.590> heard<00:03:10.070> us<00:03:10.280> talk

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
looked like because they heard us talk

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.850 
looked like because they heard us talk
so<00:03:11.090> often<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.600> don't<00:03:11.870> know<00:03:11.959> about<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:12.680> me

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
so often I don't know about that for me

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.580 
so often I don't know about that for me
it<00:03:12.980> was<00:03:13.010> for<00:03:13.430> me<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.970> was<00:03:14.090> like<00:03:14.120> fun<00:03:14.900> well

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590

it was for me it was like fun well
though<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:15.890> was<00:03:16.489> fun<00:03:16.790> but<00:03:16.970> like<00:03:17.500> me

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
though it was fun but like me

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.130 
though it was fun but like me

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
like I just realized earlier that if you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.550 
like I just realized earlier that if you
don't<00:04:26.700> know<00:04:26.880> there's<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.450> little<00:04:27.660> gap<00:04:28.050> in<00:04:28.410> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
don't know there's a little gap in the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.880 
don't know there's a little gap in the
shield<00:04:29.270> for<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.330> Jackals<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.470> shoot<00:04:31.680> them

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
shield for the Jackals you shoot them

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.990 
shield for the Jackals you shoot them
you<00:04:32.700> flick<00:04:33.090> up<00:04:33.330> like<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.960> quarter<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.380> an<00:04:34.530> inch

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
you flick up like a quarter of an inch

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.370 
you flick up like a quarter of an inch
and<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.030> shoot<00:04:36.270> them<00:04:36.420> in<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.540> head<00:04:36.600> you

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
and you shoot them in the head you

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.990 
and you shoot them in the head you
killed<00:04:37.620> him<00:04:37.710> real<00:04:37.860> quick<00:04:38.040> that's<00:04:38.700> something

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
killed him real quick that's something

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.460 
killed him real quick that's something
I've<00:04:39.120> been<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.750> fourth<00:04:40.080> game<00:04:40.290> in<00:04:40.350> a

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
I've been this is the fourth game in a

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.370 
I've been this is the fourth game in a
row<00:04:40.560> I've<00:04:40.800> done<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.220> for<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:43.260> never

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
row I've done that for and you never

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.830 
row I've done that for and you never
mention<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.160> well<00:04:44.520> because<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:45.690> not

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
mention it and I well because it's not

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.960 
mention it and I well because it's not
the<00:04:45.930> fourth<00:04:46.170> guide<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.710> row<00:04:46.890> but<00:04:47.160> right<00:04:47.760> it's

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
the fourth guide in a row but right it's

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.210 
the fourth guide in a row but right it's
like<00:04:48.230> something<00:04:49.230> often<00:04:49.380> played<00:04:49.650> halo<00:04:49.890> way<00:04:50.160> too

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
like something often played halo way too

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.150 
like something often played halo way too
fucking<00:04:50.610> long<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.660> think<00:04:51.990> about<00:04:52.230> anymore<00:04:52.470> you

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
fucking long to think about anymore you

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.360 
fucking long to think about anymore you
know<00:04:53.280> it's<00:04:53.460> like<00:04:53.520> having<00:04:54.000> them<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:55.380> math<00:04:55.650> or

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
know it's like having them the math or

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.670 
know it's like having them the math or
the<00:04:56.520> science<00:04:56.910> Nobel<00:04:57.180> laureate<00:04:57.630> teach<00:04:57.900> basic

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
the science Nobel laureate teach basic

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.550 
the science Nobel laureate teach basic
physics<00:04:59.310> they<00:04:59.820> can't<00:05:00.270> nobody<00:05:00.680> slow<00:05:01.680> down<00:05:02.510> yeah

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
physics they can't nobody slow down yeah

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.230 
physics they can't nobody slow down yeah
you're<00:05:04.560> glossing<00:05:04.860> over<00:05:05.100> like<00:05:05.669> no<00:05:05.820> way<00:05:06.060> it's

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
you're glossing over like no way it's

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.020 
you're glossing over like no way it's
talking<00:05:06.450> about
