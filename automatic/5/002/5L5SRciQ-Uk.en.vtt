00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
speaking of iron golem here he is and we

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
speaking of iron golem here he is and we
shove<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> hole<00:00:51.390> no<00:00:51.809> problem<00:00:52.289> in

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
shove them into the hole no problem in

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
shove them into the hole no problem in
order<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> put<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.300> correct<00:00:54.719> spot

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
order to put them into the correct spot

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
order to put them into the correct spot
I'm<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> put<00:00:56.129> water<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.850> opposite

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
I'm going to put water on the opposite

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.790 
I'm going to put water on the opposite
corner<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.350> part<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.039> trapdoor<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
corner of the part of the trapdoor and

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.100 
corner of the part of the trapdoor and
then<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.100> need<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.399> put<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.820> fence<00:01:03.359> post<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.930> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
then we need to put a fence post on that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.190 
then we need to put a fence post on that
same<00:01:04.379> corner<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:06.000> water<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> can't

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
same corner as the water now you can't

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.330 
same corner as the water now you can't
just<00:01:07.950> simply<00:01:08.299> you<00:01:09.299> cannot<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
just simply you cannot put this into the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.030 
just simply you cannot put this into the
corner<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> use<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:13.040> piston

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
corner you actually have to use a piston

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
corner you actually have to use a piston
to<00:01:14.369> push<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.390> important<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to push it in it's very important that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.640 
to push it in it's very important that
you<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.000> just<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> water<00:01:18.509> flows

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
you do so just so the water flows

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
you do so just so the water flows
correctly<00:01:19.650> around<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:21.530> iron<00:01:22.530> golem<00:01:23.150> okay<00:01:24.150> so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
correctly around the iron golem okay so

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.179 
correctly around the iron golem okay so
once<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> push<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.280> put<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
once you push that in you can put in the

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.149 
once you push that in you can put in the
rails<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.470> power<00:01:31.799> them<00:01:32.130> up

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
rails in here and you just power them up

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.190 
rails in here and you just power them up
however<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:35.390> put<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> solid<00:01:36.780> block<00:01:36.900> on

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
however you like put a solid block on

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.420 
however you like put a solid block on
the<00:01:37.350> other<00:01:37.470> end<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> cart<00:01:38.310> will

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the other end so that the cart will

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
the other end so that the cart will
bounce<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.470> your

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
bounce right back in and this is your

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.400 
bounce right back in and this is your
output<00:01:41.750> right<00:01:42.750> here

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.160 

that's<00:01:49.410> basically<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.250> gist<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.870> build

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that's basically the gist of the build

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.830 
that's basically the gist of the build
all<00:01:52.920> right<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.460> nudge<00:01:53.970> him<00:01:54.240> he's<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
all right if we nudge him he's going to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.660 
all right if we nudge him he's going to
move<00:01:55.530> over<00:01:55.740> hit<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.190> cart<00:01:57.110> not<00:01:58.110> Jim<00:01:58.550> just<00:01:59.550> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
move over hit the cart not Jim just a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.590 
move over hit the cart not Jim just a
little<00:02:00.030> bit<00:02:00.470> come<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:01.530> come<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.420> there<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.480> go

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
little bit come on come on there you go

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.390 
little bit come on come on there you go
and<00:02:03.840> he'll<00:02:04.020> push<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.380> cart<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.830> us<00:02:04.950> it'll

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
and he'll push the cart for us it'll

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.150 
and he'll push the cart for us it'll
light<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.120> output<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.830> part

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
light up the output so that is that part

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.310 
light up the output so that is that part
in<00:02:08.700> order<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.030> hide<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.570> golem<00:02:09.930> we're<00:02:10.200> going

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
in order to hide the golem we're going

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.400 
in order to hide the golem we're going
to<00:02:10.380> use<00:02:10.680> half<00:02:11.130> slabs<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.990> can<00:02:13.110> use<00:02:13.230> any

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
to use half slabs and you can use any

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.660 
to use half slabs and you can use any
kind<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.650> half<00:02:13.800> slabs<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.100> these<00:02:14.280> ones<00:02:14.490> are

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
kind of half slabs that these ones are

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.270 
kind of half slabs that these ones are
okay<00:02:14.970> these<00:02:15.780> ones<00:02:15.900> need<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.230> hide<00:02:16.410> amongst<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
okay these ones need to hide amongst the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.300 
okay these ones need to hide amongst the
stone<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.330> also<00:02:18.740> wooden<00:02:19.740> half<00:02:19.950> slabs

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
stone there is also wooden half slabs

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.310 
stone there is also wooden half slabs
there's<00:02:20.670> stone<00:02:21.030> brick<00:02:21.360> half<00:02:21.540> slabs<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> lot

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
there's stone brick half slabs and a lot

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.420 
there's stone brick half slabs and a lot
of<00:02:22.350> people<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> build<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.190> stone

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
of people like to build a little stone

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.800 
of people like to build a little stone
brick<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.390> actually<00:02:24.450> going<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.780> be

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
brick so this is actually going to be

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.570 
brick so this is actually going to be
really<00:02:25.020> useful<00:02:25.110> will<00:02:25.530> use<00:02:25.680> these<00:02:25.830> ones<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.250> do

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
really useful will use these ones to do

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.110 
really useful will use these ones to do
our<00:02:26.760> thing<00:02:26.970> oops<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.810> glitched<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.560> go

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
our thing oops it glitched there you go

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.280 
our thing oops it glitched there you go
and<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.210> you're<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.480> do<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.960> can't

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and what you're going to do you can't

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
and what you're going to do you can't
just<00:02:31.560> put<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.130> half<00:02:32.460> slabs<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:33.150> top<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.750> him

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
just put the half slabs on top of him

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.680 
just put the half slabs on top of him
that<00:02:34.440> doesn't<00:02:34.710> work<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:36.000> actually<00:02:36.240> have<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
that doesn't work so we actually have to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.660 
that doesn't work so we actually have to
put<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:36.990> above<00:02:37.380> him<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.130> we're<00:02:38.400> going<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.580> use

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
put it above him and we're going to use

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.610 
put it above him and we're going to use
pistons<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.450> push<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.720> down<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.230> put<00:02:40.500> them

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
pistons to push it down I can put them

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.590 
pistons to push it down I can put them
up<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:42.140> that's<00:02:43.140> how<00:02:43.380> glitched<00:02:44.190> he<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.610> he's

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
up here that's how glitched he is he's

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360 
up here that's how glitched he is he's
actually<00:02:45.810> covering<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.320> lot<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.650> space<00:02:47.010> so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
actually covering a lot of space so

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.180 
actually covering a lot of space so
we're<00:02:47.459> going<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.640> put<00:02:47.700> them<00:02:47.820> up<00:02:47.940> here<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:49.410> I'm

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
we're going to put them up here and I'm

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.229 
we're going to put them up here and I'm
going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.490> put<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.570> Pistons<00:02:51.959> right<00:02:52.350> here

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
going to put the Pistons right here

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.560 
going to put the Pistons right here
whoops<00:02:54.830> now<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.100> course<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.580> half<00:02:56.760> slabs<00:02:57.209> have

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
whoops now of course the half slabs have

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.260 
whoops now of course the half slabs have
to<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:58.020> as<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.160> they're<00:02:59.520> have<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> beat<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> top

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
to be as if they're have to beat the top

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.940 
to be as if they're have to beat the top
half<00:03:00.510> slabs<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.989> can't<00:03:01.200> be<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.530> bottom<00:03:01.800> half

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
half slabs that can't be the bottom half

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.140 
half slabs that can't be the bottom half
slabs<00:03:02.360> that's<00:03:03.360> just<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.660> way<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> has<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.050> work

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
slabs that's just the way it has to work

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.120 
slabs that's just the way it has to work
and<00:03:06.150> we'll<00:03:06.570> use<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> Pistons<00:03:07.230> push<00:03:07.440> down<00:03:07.860> and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
and we'll use the Pistons push down and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.090 
and we'll use the Pistons push down and
because<00:03:08.670> they're<00:03:08.820> half<00:03:09.000> slabs<00:03:09.330> then<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.950> iron

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
because they're half slabs then the iron

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.500 
because they're half slabs then the iron
gun<00:03:11.340> will<00:03:11.519> actually<00:03:11.850> be<00:03:11.940> able<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.150> breathe

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
gun will actually be able to breathe

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.060 
gun will actually be able to breathe
through<00:03:13.019> them<00:03:13.459> there<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.550> go<00:03:15.890> still<00:03:16.890> can't

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
through them there you go still can't

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.340 
through them there you go still can't
place<00:03:17.310> these<00:03:17.489> ones<00:03:17.760> down<00:03:18.030> well<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.080> almost

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
place these ones down well I almost

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.070 
place these ones down well I almost
place<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.739> one<00:03:19.890> down<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.480> do<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.750> other<00:03:21.870> side

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
place that one down so do the other side

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:36.720 
place that one down so do the other side
now<00:03:22.910> same<00:03:23.910> thing

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.500 

you<00:03:37.330> know<00:03:37.450> just<00:03:37.690> destroy<00:03:38.170> all<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.560> evidence

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
you know just destroy all the evidence

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.610 
you know just destroy all the evidence
and<00:03:41.159> that<00:03:42.159> floor<00:03:42.640> here<00:03:42.670> looks<00:03:43.120> pretty<00:03:43.420> fine<00:03:43.720> to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
and that floor here looks pretty fine to

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.809 
and that floor here looks pretty fine to
me<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:46.569> can<00:03:46.780> in<00:03:47.099> so<00:03:48.099> then<00:03:48.250> this<00:03:48.400> will<00:03:48.549> be<00:03:48.670> your

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
me you can in so then this will be your

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.509 
me you can in so then this will be your
floor<00:03:49.090> essentially<00:03:52.440> oops<00:03:53.440> anyone's<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:54.430> you

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
floor essentially oops anyone's then you

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.800 
floor essentially oops anyone's then you
can't<00:03:54.730> place<00:03:54.910> down<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.209> can<00:03:55.330> always<00:03:55.510> just<00:03:55.660> use

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
can't place down you can always just use

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.050 
can't place down you can always just use
the<00:03:55.930> Pistons<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.410> push<00:03:56.590> down<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.849> iron

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
the Pistons to push down and the iron

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.720 
the Pistons to push down and the iron
golem<00:03:58.360> is<00:03:58.480> defined<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.560> well<00:03:59.830> he's<00:04:00.069> breathing

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
golem is defined and well he's breathing

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.150 
golem is defined and well he's breathing
he's<00:04:00.970> not<00:04:01.720> getting<00:04:02.170> hurt<00:04:02.379> and<00:04:02.590> if<00:04:02.739> we<00:04:02.890> walk

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
he's not getting hurt and if we walk

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.240 
he's not getting hurt and if we walk
across<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.670> can<00:04:03.819> see<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:05.709> hits<00:04:05.980> it

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
across you can see that it hits it

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.470 
across you can see that it hits it
lights<00:04:06.519> up<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.790> pressure<00:04:06.970> play<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.390> of

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
lights up the pressure play and of

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.780 
lights up the pressure play and of
course<00:04:07.690> it's<00:04:07.870> only<00:04:08.319> one<00:04:08.590> direction<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.579> like

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
course it's only one direction it's like

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.130 
course it's only one direction it's like
a<00:04:09.819> diode<00:04:10.209> kind<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.599> thing<00:04:10.720> if<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:10.900> go<00:04:10.989> the

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
a diode kind of thing if you go the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.130 
a diode kind of thing if you go the
other<00:04:11.170> way<00:04:11.470> well<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.340> works<00:04:12.610> as<00:04:12.790> well<00:04:13.140> because

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
other way well it works as well because

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.409 
other way well it works as well because
you<00:04:14.260> eventually<00:04:14.650> will<00:04:15.010> nudge<00:04:15.250> him<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:16.269> it

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
you eventually will nudge him but it

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.879 
you eventually will nudge him but it
works<00:04:16.600> best<00:04:16.930> from<00:04:17.289> going<00:04:17.590> in<00:04:17.680> one<00:04:17.859> direction

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
works best from going in one direction

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.550 
works best from going in one direction
in<00:04:18.639> particular<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.959> you're<00:04:20.109> pushing<00:04:20.410> him
