00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
something so I came up with something

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.949 
something so I came up with something
that<00:02:35.069> was<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.730> hope<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.299> little<00:02:36.510> bit<00:02:36.600> different

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
that was I hope a little bit different

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.390 
that was I hope a little bit different
and<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> thing<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.680> suppose<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.100> should<00:02:38.280> point

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
and the thing I suppose we should point

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.710 
and the thing I suppose we should point
out<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.850> you've<00:02:39.030> created<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.510> bit<00:02:39.600> of

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
out is that you've created a bit of

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.660 
out is that you've created a bit of
theatre<00:02:40.110> here<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:40.680> you've<00:02:41.370> made<00:02:41.610> it

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
theatre here but you've made it
