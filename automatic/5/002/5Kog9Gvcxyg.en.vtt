00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 yo everyone does lydia and 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.620
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.160
 video so it's not going to compensate on 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.130
 Minecraft 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.420
 but who wants can include on how 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.870
 so put internet 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.550
 how to put internet on your play3 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.340
 do a month ago I do not have the xbox 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.890
 so so I stuck pay 3 so this tutorial 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.779
 will be that for the pay 3 have everything 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.529
 just when you arrive in your 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 your menu will you go into 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.439
 settings 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
 so there you are out on parameters 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.530
 network is part of m internet connection 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 so there he tells you if you have a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.020
 ethernet cable or pasta like the internet 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.390
 thanks to the internet I do not know why 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.329
 so you go in easy actually 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.050
 easy it is without cable customize 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.160
 the cables you have in front there are 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.730
 yet yes so this tutorial and for so I 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.960
 repeats for ps3 and without cable so 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.750
 wired or wireless connection 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.890
 we are going to put wireless you are doing 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.810
 either scan that actually the scan does that 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.640
 detected either detected your livebox or 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.430
 the scan manually so grab 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.159
 sexually manually obviously we 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.020
 stick on this calm so the save as 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.830
 cannes logically here is my livebox 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.200
 g 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.620
 I'm doing right then he wrote 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.570
 no web or lpk psk or two sword ps 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.200
 because in fact yes there loses you make 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.780
 believers bends to the swords so then 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.130
 so I have here so it's a kind of 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.760
 paper that we do not know if you see 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.460
 so in fact that there is the key here so the 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:02:02.130
 wifi security key 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:02:02.130
 so we will put it in 2 014 9 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.140
 book 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:45.060
 four mutineers of leo 3 6 8 07 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.860
 f logically after you do 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.410
 sarthe would count so there you see in 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.000
 does the most beautiful and tegra 2 reduced itself 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.100
 not sure what that means but 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.200
 is this beauf you make me right so there has 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.510
 taken obviously checks if you have any 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.490
 problems you can tell me in 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.490
 e messages in the comments 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.150
 you can tell us in the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.720
 comments and I will try from you 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.290
 reply 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.420
 So that's actually how it can be 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.310
 say to say how much of the sat or 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.250
 detected whose you see everything is 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.170
 filled done validate xtc the connection 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.630
 is you have therefore actually 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.850
 when all will be fulfilled will when 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.540
 even make precedent if I remember 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.250
 well so there some celebration of 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.510
 ip addresses so from your iphone the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.580
 internet connection so that's what we 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.170
 means if you have passed the psn 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.230
 it's like you want to play online 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.320
 upm peace and nat type housing they go 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.160
 say not succeed but I do not know what 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.280
 that they say but I find that he 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.600
 distend success is my bubble well 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.510
 here it is available here it says available 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.040
 that's all they say by success so 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.769
 there just have to wait for my assets two 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.769
 dishes refutation course you wait for them 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.850
 two maybe from conditions of 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.700
 download and so here is actually 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.709
 everything is finished so there he has pie ix test 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.560
 atari college screen will celebrate 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:16.890
 previous to correct lcd dishes and 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:20.459
 logically konishi server running there 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.940
 logically the only market upstairs to 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.510
 right 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.230
 look at the best writing connect if 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.230
 it's not okay 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.729
 a little fast so that's connected in the 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.789
 account management 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.210
 yes after if I go in my sights then 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.669

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.440

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.889
 like that at the same time if you want 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:51.319
 to make parts ok so here is so 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.849
 ruin we all test that will wait all 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.479
 test that so 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.539
 angel of duty as much put a new 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:06.250
 game that comes may be worried out 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:11.050
 started my time but here I went 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.449
 20 14 so we'll test it right now 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.300
 pl is obviously good if you are 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.729
 connected is that it works 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.870
 unless you have problems but if 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.979
 you have problems do not forget 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.229

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.590
 comments 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:30.159
 and I will try to spread you and if you 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.159

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:41.390
 you can write your your skype and 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.860
 Thu 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:50.300
 I would accept you and at the tight game you 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:54.860
 answer so now so here 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:59.480
 in any case it's download I 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:03.910
 want to race did that name but not 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.910
 so many times the Apulia where goes the night 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.110
 actually this because there they had to 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.730
 request a new update without 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.770
 to assemble videos but 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.990
 obviously the updates there we come 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.040
 there never but I will make them gold video 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.690
 because I do not have that to do 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.240
 now 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.890
 finally if it lasts five minutes or 4 so 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.380
 I 'm not afraid we're going to lose five 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.980
 minutes 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:37.910
 even though I might well even though I 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:45.070
 cani couple at 4 years old disconnected at the 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.070
 verification of French trophies 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.129
 and this mess 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:07.240
 small that his sleeve the connection is in 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:12.729
 course seemed like that you 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:15.849
 connecting thinking has so in fact good 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.259
 month the age was disconnected because 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:18.970
 simply because I go to the 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:27.330
 update so you will have to they you 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:34.630
 do it and so after you go 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:37.509
 hi by the way these friendly games ali on 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.520
 imagine that you understood obviously 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:43.750
 the language of khaled my qualities and 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:48.009
 then you will choose you at a 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:50.800
 part so you will choose a part in 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:52.180
 line with years that you do not 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.879

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.949
 if he wanted to do it online and now 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.080
 So that's all for this little tutorial 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:02.919

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.699
