available for the mobile version of
their<00:05:01.819> site<00:05:02.060> again<00:05:02.479> you're<00:05:02.900> taking<00:05:03.110> into

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
their site again you're taking into

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.469 
their site again you're taking into
consideration<00:05:03.319> the<00:05:04.069> the<00:05:04.699> device<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.389> you're

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
consideration the the device and you're

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.909 
consideration the the device and you're
also<00:05:05.599> thinking<00:05:05.810> about<00:05:06.050> okay<00:05:06.469> if<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.650> person's

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
also thinking about okay if the person's

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.770 
also thinking about okay if the person's
accessing<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.490> from<00:05:07.639> this<00:05:07.729> device<00:05:08.030> they're

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
accessing it from this device they're

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.360 
accessing it from this device they're
probably<00:05:08.990> going<00:05:09.349> to<00:05:09.440> be<00:05:09.560> in<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:10.099> or<00:05:10.340> that

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
probably going to be in this or that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.189 
probably going to be in this or that
situation<00:05:10.729> so<00:05:11.330> if<00:05:11.419> you<00:05:11.479> can<00:05:11.629> think<00:05:11.780> ahead<00:05:11.930> and

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
situation so if you can think ahead and

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.050 
situation so if you can think ahead and
plan<00:05:12.379> ahead<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.830> can<00:05:13.219> design<00:05:13.490> an<00:05:13.639> even<00:05:13.879> more

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
plan ahead you can design an even more

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.899 
plan ahead you can design an even more
effective<00:05:14.650> responsive<00:05:15.650> website<00:05:16.190> so<00:05:16.430> this

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
effective responsive website so this

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.490 
effective responsive website so this
whole<00:05:17.090> idea<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.389> one<00:05:17.599> thumb<00:05:17.900> one<00:05:18.139> eye<00:05:18.169> is<00:05:18.379> just

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
whole idea of one thumb one eye is just

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.619 
whole idea of one thumb one eye is just
a<00:05:18.650> good<00:05:18.800> thing<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.009> keep<00:05:19.129> in<00:05:19.250> mind<00:05:19.449> if<00:05:20.449> you're<00:05:20.599> a

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
a good thing to keep in mind if you're a

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.450 
a good thing to keep in mind if you're a
mother<00:05:20.810> walking<00:05:21.050> through<00:05:21.319> the<00:05:21.409> store<00:05:21.620> you've

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
let go of that stroller so you need to

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.570 
let go of that stroller so you need to
be<00:05:27.199> able<00:05:27.259> to<00:05:27.349> sort<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.530> focus<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:28.069> and<00:05:28.219> learn

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
be able to sort of focus and and learn

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.830 
be able to sort of focus and and learn
everything<00:05:28.879> you<00:05:29.060> can<00:05:29.300> learn<00:05:29.449> about<00:05:29.629> the

one<00:05:35.719> I<00:05:35.750> designed<00:05:36.409> with<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.650> mind<00:05:36.860> it's<00:05:37.069> a

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
one I designed with that in mind it's a

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.439 
one I designed with that in mind it's a
good<00:05:37.250> thing<00:05:37.400> one<00:05:37.849> of<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.000> examples<00:05:38.419> that

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
good thing one of the examples that

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.969 
good thing one of the examples that
you're<00:05:38.599> going<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.779> see<00:05:38.960> if<00:05:39.169> you<00:05:39.319> do<00:05:39.529> any<00:05:39.770> kind

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
you're going to see if you do any kind

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.680 
you're going to see if you do any kind
of<00:05:40.039> research<00:05:40.400> on<00:05:40.550> responsive<00:05:41.090> design<00:05:41.389> is<00:05:41.569> this

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
of research on responsive design is this

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.990 
of research on responsive design is this
idea<00:05:41.960> of<00:05:42.020> responsive<00:05:42.500> architecture<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:43.310> got

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
idea of responsive architecture I got

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.790 
idea of responsive architecture I got
brought<00:05:44.180> up<00:05:44.240> in<00:05:44.479> a<00:05:44.539> book<00:05:44.719> that<00:05:45.169> I<00:05:45.229> read<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.529> while

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
brought up in a book that I read a while

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.260 
brought up in a book that I read a while
ago<00:05:46.069> I<00:05:46.099> want<00:05:46.310> to<00:05:46.340> say<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.490> book<00:05:46.729> by<00:05:46.909> Ethan

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
ago I want to say a book by Ethan

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.480 
ago I want to say a book by Ethan
Marcotte<00:05:47.630> I<00:05:48.500> think<00:05:48.919> that's<00:05:49.099> who<00:05:49.190> was<00:05:49.370> that

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
Marcotte I think that's who was that

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.339 
Marcotte I think that's who was that
brought<00:05:49.669> it<00:05:49.789> up<00:05:49.880> it's<00:05:50.630> a<00:05:50.719> really<00:05:51.050> really<00:05:51.199> cool

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
brought it up it's a really really cool

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.680 
brought it up it's a really really cool
idea<00:05:51.650> but<00:05:52.400> aside<00:05:52.669> from<00:05:52.729> that<00:05:53.029> basically

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
idea but aside from that basically

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.689 
idea but aside from that basically
responsive<00:05:54.259> architecture<00:05:54.560> is<00:05:55.219> the<00:05:55.400> idea<00:05:55.639> that

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
responsive architecture is the idea that

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:56.920 
responsive architecture is the idea that
buildings<00:05:56.120> are<00:05:56.180> gonna<00:05:56.300> respond<00:05:56.690> to<00:05:56.840> the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
buildings are gonna respond to the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.050 
buildings are gonna respond to the
people<00:05:57.229> that<00:05:57.740> are<00:05:57.919> in<00:05:58.099> them<00:05:58.310> so<00:05:58.490> maybe<00:05:58.639> smart

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
people that are in them so maybe smart

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.180 
people that are in them so maybe smart
glass<00:05:59.360> will<00:05:59.659> become<00:05:59.930> like<00:06:00.110> a<00:06:00.139> solid<00:06:00.560> wall<00:06:00.800> at

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
glass will become like a solid wall at

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.890 
glass will become like a solid wall at
night<00:06:01.669> but<00:06:01.969> during<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.270> day<00:06:02.300> it's

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
night but during the day it's

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.950 
night but during the day it's
see-through<00:06:03.199> or<00:06:04.129> walls<00:06:04.430> move<00:06:04.940> and<00:06:05.300> adjust<00:06:05.389> and

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
see-through or walls move and adjust and

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.879 
see-through or walls move and adjust and
things<00:06:06.139> like<00:06:06.319> that<00:06:07.270> but<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.529> important<00:06:09.529> thing

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
things like that but the important thing

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.830 
things like that but the important thing
about<00:06:09.919> responsive<00:06:10.789> architecture<00:06:10.940> beside<00:06:11.690> the

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
about responsive architecture beside the
