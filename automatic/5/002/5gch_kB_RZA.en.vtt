postoperatively sometimes patients

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609

wonder why we discuss it so early but we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.160 
wonder why we discuss it so early but we
find<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.189> discuss<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.939> manage<00:01:51.240> DD

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
find that if we discuss and manage DD

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.219 
find that if we discuss and manage DD
early<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:53.039> have<00:01:53.219> better<00:01:53.460> recovery<00:01:53.880> rates<00:01:54.390> we

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
early we have better recovery rates we

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
early we have better recovery rates we
also<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.740> cover<00:01:56.100> things<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.490> pet

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
generally the removal although it must

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.710 
generally the removal although it must
be<00:03:48.900> somewhat<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.859> little<00:03:50.190> bit<00:03:50.280> uncomfortable

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
be somewhat a little bit uncomfortable

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.759 
be somewhat a little bit uncomfortable
certainly<00:03:51.720> shouldn't<00:03:51.959> be<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.170> painful

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
certainly shouldn't be a painful

procedure for you and in probably most

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.670 
procedure for you and in probably most
of<00:03:56.220> our<00:03:56.370> cases<00:03:56.579> we<00:03:56.940> find<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.930> indeed

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
of our cases we find that is the indeed

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.039 
of our cases we find that is the indeed
what<00:03:58.890> happens<00:03:59.250> for<00:03:59.489> them<00:03:59.790> we<00:04:00.569> like<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:01.019> check

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
what happens for them we like to check

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.990 
what happens for them we like to check
with<00:04:01.590> them<00:04:01.769> through<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.100> procedure<00:04:02.519> we<00:04:02.819> get

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
with them through the procedure we get

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.110 
with them through the procedure we get
them<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.299> cough<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.569> distract<00:04:04.319> them<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.120> then

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
them to cough to distract them and then

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.020 
them to cough to distract them and then
we<00:04:06.329> like<00:04:06.780> then<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.920> move<00:04:08.190> on<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.609> explain<00:04:08.970> to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
we like then to move on and explain to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.750 
we like then to move on and explain to
them<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.450> what<00:04:10.139> to<00:04:10.319> expect<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:11.040> day<00:04:11.340> now<00:04:11.609> that

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
them in what to expect that day now that

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.150 
them in what to expect that day now that
their<00:04:11.910> catheter<00:04:12.120> has<00:04:12.359> been<00:04:12.600> removed<00:04:12.959> some<00:04:13.920> men

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
their catheter has been removed some men

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.250 
their catheter has been removed some men
will<00:04:14.430> pass<00:04:14.970> their<00:04:15.269> urine<00:04:15.540> quite<00:04:15.780> normally

will pass their urine quite normally

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.830 
will pass their urine quite normally
other<00:04:16.620> men<00:04:17.010> will<00:04:17.220> leak<00:04:17.700> significantly<00:04:18.510> for<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
other men will leak significantly for a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.460 
other men will leak significantly for a
day<00:04:19.079> or<00:04:19.229> two

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
day or two

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.810 
day or two
and<00:04:19.709> we<00:04:20.039> very<00:04:20.250> much<00:04:20.489> like<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.940> prepare

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
and we very much like to prepare

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.670 
and we very much like to prepare
and<00:04:21.940> men<00:04:22.150> for<00:04:22.450> that<00:04:22.510> because<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.320> can<00:04:23.470> be<00:04:23.650> very

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
and men for that because it can be very

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.160 
and men for that because it can be very
disappointing<00:04:24.580> if<00:04:24.700> they<00:04:24.850> think<00:04:25.180> oh<00:04:25.390> no<00:04:25.960> this

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
disappointing if they think oh no this

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.960 
disappointing if they think oh no this
is<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.500> start<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:27.040> continents<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.700> it's
