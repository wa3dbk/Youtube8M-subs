now<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.710> first<00:01:14.100> step<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> remove<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
now well the first step is to remove the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.320 
now well the first step is to remove the
battery<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.630> remove<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> sticker<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.340> I'm

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
battery and remove the sticker and I'm

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.670 
battery and remove the sticker and I'm
not<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> show<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> me<00:01:19.229> doing<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
not going to show you me doing that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
not going to show you me doing that
because<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> can't<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
because if you can't do that you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.609 
because if you can't do that you
probably<00:01:21.390> shouldn't<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.900> disassembling<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619

on getting this out because basically
decide<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.989> looked<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.349> a<00:02:22.409> bent<00:02:22.799> a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
decide like it looked like a bent a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.259 
decide like it looked like a bent a
little<00:02:22.950> bit<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.459> didn't<00:02:23.700> break<00:02:23.909> but<00:02:24.239> I

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
little bit it didn't break but I

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.509 
little bit it didn't break but I
probably<00:02:24.510> could<00:02:24.900> very<00:02:25.140> easily<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.799> then

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
probably could very easily and then

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.039 
probably could very easily and then
basically<00:02:26.730> once<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.299> is<00:02:27.480> free<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.780> just

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
basically once this is free you just

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.979 
basically once this is free you just
kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.620> flip<00:02:29.189> it<00:02:29.220> down<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> little<00:02:29.790> bit<00:02:29.989> then

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
kind of flip it down a little bit then

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.320 
kind of flip it down a little bit then
you<00:02:31.290> gotta<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:32.670> there<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:32.910> remove

the<00:04:13.699> old<00:04:13.909> screen<00:04:14.239> is<00:04:14.840> much<00:04:15.139> different<00:04:15.820> it's

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
the old screen is much different it's

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.849 
the old screen is much different it's
like<00:04:17.060> probably<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.870> same<00:04:18.049> plug<00:04:18.349> i<00:04:18.530> think<00:04:18.769> it

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
like probably the same plug i think it

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.849 
like probably the same plug i think it
is<00:04:19.389> it<00:04:20.389> looks<00:04:20.840> like<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.139> exactly<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.680> same

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
is it looks like it's exactly the same

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.939 
is it looks like it's exactly the same
plug<00:04:22.510> just<00:04:23.510> does<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:23.840> this<00:04:23.960> extra<00:04:24.380> stuff<00:04:24.440> and

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
plug just does all this extra stuff and

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.200 
plug just does all this extra stuff and
it's<00:04:25.250> much<00:04:25.490> much<00:04:25.849> thicker<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:28.210> newer

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
it's much much thicker and the newer

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.939 
it's much much thicker and the newer
screen<00:04:29.599> so<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.110> won't<00:04:30.320> fit<00:04:30.650> obviously

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
screen so it won't fit obviously

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.899 
screen so it won't fit obviously

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
for the new screen the old screened

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.520 
for the new screen the old screened
plugs<00:04:40.159> in<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.370> same<00:04:40.669> just<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:42.080> cables

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
plugs in the same just the this cables

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.580 
plugs in the same just the this cables
just<00:04:42.770> like<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.370> little<00:04:44.120> bit<00:04:44.300> bigger<00:04:45.169> than<00:04:45.440> this

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
just like a little bit bigger than this

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.030 
just like a little bit bigger than this
cable<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.639> that<00:04:46.669> doesn't<00:04:47.240> fit

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
cable so that doesn't fit

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.860 
cable so that doesn't fit
