we<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:18.029> lunge<00:00:18.570> variation<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:19.350> help<00:00:19.529> with

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we do a lunge variation to help with

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.380 
we do a lunge variation to help with
acceleration<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.880> priming<00:00:21.119> that

normal sprint start anytime you're doing
it<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.399> biggest<00:00:32.730> key<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> spring<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.780> their

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it the biggest key to a spring is their

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
it the biggest key to a spring is their
first<00:00:34.230> step<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.670> step<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.270> as

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
first step you want that step to be as

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
first step you want that step to be as
powerful<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.899> possible<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.040> cover<00:00:38.250> as

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
back into the ground as hard as you can

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.970 
back into the ground as hard as you can
we<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> take<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> concept<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.230> move<00:00:46.860> it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we like to take that concept and move it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.500 
we like to take that concept and move it
over<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> walking<00:00:48.030> lunge<00:00:48.390> variation

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
over into a walking lunge variation

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.709 
over into a walking lunge variation
which<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.379> call<00:00:49.620> accelerator<00:00:50.250> lunches<00:00:50.730> with

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
which we call accelerator lunches with

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
which we call accelerator lunches with
that<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.230> basically<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.949> normal<00:00:53.280> locking

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that is basically at your normal locking

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.430 
that is basically at your normal locking
linesman<00:00:54.120> from<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.449> bottom<00:00:54.870> position

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
linesman from that bottom position

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
linesman from that bottom position
you're<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.309> focus<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.789> driving<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you're going to focus on driving that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.939 
you're going to focus on driving that
knee<00:00:57.600> into<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> chest<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.469> you're<00:00:58.620> coming

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
knee into the chest like you're coming

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.569 
knee into the chest like you're coming
out<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> start<00:00:59.550> of<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> sprint<00:01:00.750> every<00:01:01.199> step

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
out of the start of a sprint every step

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.969 
out of the start of a sprint every step
so<00:01:02.579> coach<00:01:03.239> jer<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> toes<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.589> pick

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
so coach jer the toes are going to pick

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.730 
so coach jer the toes are going to pick
up<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> weights<00:01:05.990> just<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> normal<00:01:07.350> lines

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
up the weights just like a normal lines

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.590 
up the weights just like a normal lines
just<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.280> coming<00:01:08.880> off<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> line<00:01:09.240> you're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
just like a coming off the line you're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.090 
just like a coming off the line you're
just<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:09.960> stay<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.229> nice<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.799> vertical

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
just gonna stay up nice and vertical

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.920 
just gonna stay up nice and vertical
from<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:11.909> driving<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.479> knee<00:01:12.659> up

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
from here you're driving that knee up

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
from here you're driving that knee up
and<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.220> making<00:01:14.430> sure<00:01:14.700> you're<00:01:14.850> punching

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and out and making sure you're punching

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
and out and making sure you're punching
it<00:01:15.299> back<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:15.750> into<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> ground<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.619> we

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it back down into the ground well we

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.039 
it back down into the ground well we
don't<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.670> driving<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.930> then

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
don't want you to driving me up and then

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
don't want you to driving me up and then
kick<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.490> trying<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.939> pull

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
kick out like you're trying to pull

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
kick out like you're trying to pull
yourself<00:01:21.600> into<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> next<00:01:22.170> position<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.740> next

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
yourself into the next position the next

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.179 
yourself into the next position the next
step<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> focus<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:26.009> getting

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
step if you want to focus on getting

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.609 
step if you want to focus on getting
that<00:01:26.400> knee<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.909> drive<00:01:27.840> into<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.229> other<00:01:28.350> leg

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that knee up drive into that other leg

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
that knee up drive into that other leg
so<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.009> carries<00:01:29.220> over<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:29.939> you're

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
so it carries over just like you're

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
so it carries over just like you're
coming<00:01:30.450> off<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> line<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> sprint<00:01:31.710> running<00:01:32.070> a

40 or doing any type of speed work we

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.090 
40 or doing any type of speed work we
will<00:01:35.400> typically<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.439> three<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> four

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
will typically do you know three to four

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.490 
will typically do you know three to four
sets<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:39.000> 20<00:01:39.420> yards<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.290> lots

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
sets of about 20 yards of that with lots
