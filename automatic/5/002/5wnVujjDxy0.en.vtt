on<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.210> going<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.449> show<00:00:03.540> you

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
on this video we're going to show you

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.990 
on this video we're going to show you
how<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.049> fit<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.589> continuous<00:00:05.279> ink<00:00:05.490> system

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
how to fit the continuous ink system

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.870 
how to fit the continuous ink system
from<00:00:06.899> city<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.350> case<00:00:07.589> price<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.460> canon

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
from city in case price to the canon

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.100 
from city in case price to the canon
pixma<00:00:09.150> IP<00:00:10.340> 4500<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.210> fit<00:00:12.420> method<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
pixma IP 4500 so the fit method for the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.500 
pixma IP 4500 so the fit method for the
IP<00:00:13.759> 4300<00:00:14.780> is<00:00:15.780> exactly<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.710> same<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.180> when<00:00:18.390> your

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
IP 4300 is exactly the same so when your

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.480 
IP 4300 is exactly the same so when your
continuous<00:00:19.050> ink<00:00:19.260> system<00:00:19.680> arrives<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
continuous ink system arrives one of the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.970 
continuous ink system arrives one of the
first<00:00:20.730> things<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.150> check<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.439> you've<00:00:22.830> not

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
first things to check is that you've not

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.790 
first things to check is that you've not
got<00:00:23.250> more<00:00:23.490> than<00:00:23.699> 4<00:00:24.000> inch<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.449> air<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.260> any<00:00:25.500> one

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
got more than 4 inch of air in any one

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.009 
got more than 4 inch of air in any one
of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.130> lines<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.750> will<00:00:27.869> need

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
of the lines if you have you will need

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.220 
of the lines if you have you will need
to<00:00:28.170> carry<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> following<00:00:29.220> procedure

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
to carry out the following procedure

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.840 
to carry out the following procedure
so<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.710> making<00:00:32.250> sure<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
so with this making sure that this

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
so with this making sure that this
roller<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:34.050> position<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.980> then

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
roller is in the up position and then

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
roller is in the up position and then
with<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> syringe<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.800> sharp<00:00:37.800> needle

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
with the syringe with the sharp needle

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010 
with the syringe with the sharp needle
on<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.879> case<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.660> blue

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
on it in this case it's a little blue

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650 
on it in this case it's a little blue
one<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.980> need<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.730> straight<00:00:42.239> through

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
one we need to put it straight through

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.410 
one we need to put it straight through
the<00:00:43.530> big<00:00:43.739> plug<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> need<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.390> sure

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the big plug so you need to make sure

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.630 
the big plug so you need to make sure
that<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> needle<00:00:46.530> doesn't<00:00:47.010> touch<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> ink

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that the needle doesn't touch the ink

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.240 
that the needle doesn't touch the ink
inside<00:00:48.410> because<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.440> need<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> draw<00:00:49.980> her<00:00:50.100> out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
inside because we need to draw her out

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
inside because we need to draw her out
not<00:00:50.730> ink<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.690> once<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.230> through<00:00:52.500> an<00:00:52.739> angle

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
not ink so once it's through an angle

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.869 
not ink so once it's through an angle
we're<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> draw<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.949> expel<00:00:55.949> 10

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
we're going to draw back and expel 10

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.260 
we're going to draw back and expel 10
mil<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.149> air<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:57.930> 10<00:00:58.350> mil<00:00:59.120> expel<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
mil of air so that's 10 mil expel the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
mil of air so that's 10 mil expel the
syringe<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:02.539> then<00:01:03.539> repeat<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> process

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
syringe and then repeat the process

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.370 
syringe and then repeat the process
again<00:01:04.979> through<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:06.030> angle<00:01:06.360> making<00:01:06.840> sure<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
again through it an angle making sure it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.300 
again through it an angle making sure it
doesn't<00:01:07.710> touch<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.159> ink<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.659> then<00:01:09.659> draw<00:01:09.930> back

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.789 

and<00:01:14.600> then<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> third<00:01:15.990> time<00:01:16.500> we're<00:01:16.680> going

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
and then on the third time we're going

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.010 
and then on the third time we're going
to<00:01:16.860> separate<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> plunger<00:01:17.909> from<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.270> syringe

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.840 

so<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.560> hold<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> syringe<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.580> pull

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
so you hold the syringe and then pull

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.039 
so you hold the syringe and then pull
the<00:01:23.970> plunger<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.540> actually

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the plunger out so what I will actually

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.710 
the plunger out so what I will actually
do<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.530> well<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.490> you've<00:01:30.150> removed<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
do is well actually you've removed the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
do is well actually you've removed the
air<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.290> fill<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> ink<00:01:31.860> line<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
air it will fill the ink line and it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
air it will fill the ink line and it
will<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.759> running<00:01:32.939> down<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:33.720> make

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
will be running down and it will make

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.660 
will be running down and it will make
sure<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> cartridges<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.790> full<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.600> ink

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
sure that the cartridges are full of ink

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.190 
sure that the cartridges are full of ink
so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> repeat<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.930> process

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so you will need to repeat this process

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800 
so you will need to repeat this process
for<00:01:40.829> any<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> other<00:01:41.579> colors<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.240> have

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
for any of the other colors that have

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810 
for any of the other colors that have
got<00:01:42.960> more<00:01:43.200> than<00:01:43.439> 4<00:01:43.710> inches<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.159> air<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
got more than 4 inches of air in the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.710 
got more than 4 inches of air in the
lines<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.670> how<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.880> remove<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> air

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
lines so that's how to remove the air

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
lines so that's how to remove the air
from<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> system<00:01:49.820> one<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> other<00:01:51.329> things

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
from a system one of the other things

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.510 
from a system one of the other things
that<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> must<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> continuous<00:01:53.280> ink

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that you must do for the continuous ink

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
that you must do for the continuous ink
system<00:01:53.759> whether<00:01:54.750> you've<00:01:54.990> primed<00:01:55.320> whether<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
system whether you've primed whether you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.350 
system whether you've primed whether you
private<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:58.070> these<00:01:59.070> inner<00:01:59.340> plugs<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.909> is

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
private or not these inner plugs here is

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
private or not these inner plugs here is
an<00:02:00.570> air<00:02:00.719> balance<00:02:01.140> chamber<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.040> these<00:02:02.369> outer

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
an air balance chamber and these outer

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.230 
an air balance chamber and these outer
plugs<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.689> refill<00:02:04.110> holes<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
plugs are you refill holes so in the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.779 
plugs are you refill holes so in the
inner<00:02:06.390> ear<00:02:06.719> balance<00:02:06.979> chamber<00:02:07.979> there's

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
inner ear balance chamber there's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.520 
inner ear balance chamber there's
normally<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> small<00:02:09.629> amount<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.140> ink<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
normally a small amount of ink at the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.480 
normally a small amount of ink at the
bottom<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.069> during<00:02:11.489> transit<00:02:11.910> sometimes

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
bottom but during transit sometimes

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.850 
bottom but during transit sometimes
it's<00:02:13.150> possible<00:02:13.690> for<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.020> incan<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> inner

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's possible for the incan the inner

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.700 
it's possible for the incan the inner
chamber<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.730> become<00:02:16.090> higher<00:02:16.420> than<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.500> outer

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
chamber to become higher than the outer

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.280 
chamber to become higher than the outer
chamber<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> what<00:02:19.150> would<00:02:19.360> actually<00:02:19.510> happen<00:02:19.810> if

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
chamber so what would actually happen if

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.050 
chamber so what would actually happen if
you<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.440> installed<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.340> without<00:02:21.640> doing

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you just installed that without doing

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.840 
you just installed that without doing
this<00:02:22.210> you<00:02:22.930> would<00:02:23.080> end<00:02:23.230> up<00:02:23.380> with<00:02:23.440> ink<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.550> your

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
this you would end up with ink in your

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.730 
this you would end up with ink in your
air<00:02:25.000> filters<00:02:25.510> which<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.020> don't<00:02:26.200> really<00:02:26.410> want

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
air filters which you don't really want

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.590 
air filters which you don't really want
so<00:02:27.520> what<00:02:27.700> we're<00:02:27.850> going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.360> we're<00:02:28.510> going

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.210 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:02:28.720> transfer<00:02:29.170> some<00:02:29.440> ink<00:02:29.620> from<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.890> inner

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
to transfer some ink from the inner

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.150 
to transfer some ink from the inner
chamber<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> outer<00:02:31.210> chamber<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:33.130> will

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
chamber to the outer chamber you will

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.660 
chamber to the outer chamber you will
only<00:02:33.490> have<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.940> do<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.300> once<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:36.460> should

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
only have to do this once and you should

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.760 
only have to do this once and you should
do<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.970> before<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.450> system's<00:02:37.840> installed<00:02:38.410> for

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
do it before the system's installed for

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.600 
do it before the system's installed for
all<00:02:38.920> colors<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.440> with<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.830> syringe<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.430> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
all colors so with the syringe with the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.640 
all colors so with the syringe with the
long<00:02:43.000> needle<00:02:43.210> on<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.720> time<00:02:43.990> we're<00:02:44.470> going<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
long needle on this time we're going to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.070 
long needle on this time we're going to
put<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.920> in<00:02:45.070> there<00:02:45.280> small<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.940> hole<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.720> draw

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
put it in there small in a hole and draw

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.490 
put it in there small in a hole and draw
around<00:02:47.200> about<00:02:48.360> six<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.570> Mel<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.050> ink<00:02:50.230> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
around about six to a Mel of ink and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.760 
around about six to a Mel of ink and
we're<00:02:50.770> going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.920> transfer<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.620> outer

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
we're going to transfer it to the outer

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.620 
we're going to transfer it to the outer
chamber<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.760> they<00:02:57.910> ask<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.360> I've

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
chamber like so and they ask that I've

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.290 
chamber like so and they ask that I've
finished<00:02:59.130> so<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.250> will<00:03:00.460> need<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.820> repeat<00:03:01.150> the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
finished so you will need to repeat the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.980 
finished so you will need to repeat the
process<00:03:01.480> for<00:03:01.750> any<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.470> other<00:03:02.590> colors<00:03:03.990> once

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
process for any of the other colors once

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.410 
process for any of the other colors once
you've<00:03:05.200> finished<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:06.670> can<00:03:06.880> put<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> plugs

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
you've finished you can put the plugs

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.140 
you've finished you can put the plugs
back<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:10.710> like<00:03:11.710> so<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.400> system<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.940> now

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
back in like so so the system is now

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.350 
back in like so so the system is now
pride<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.650> it's<00:03:14.860> ready<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> be<00:03:15.550> installed<00:03:15.940> in

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
pride and it's ready to be installed in

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.480 
pride and it's ready to be installed in
the<00:03:16.450> printer<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.740> next<00:03:20.860> stage<00:03:21.160> we're

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
the printer so on the next stage we're

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.560 
the printer so on the next stage we're
going<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.790> going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.000> put<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.450> one

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
going to just going to put this to one

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.080 
going to just going to put this to one
side<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:22.930> second<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.340> next<00:03:24.490> stage<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:25.060> to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
side for second the next stage is to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.870 
side for second the next stage is to
install<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.020> silicon<00:03:26.440> seals<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.640> we're<00:03:27.790> going

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
install the silicon seals so we're going

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.200 
install the silicon seals so we're going
to<00:03:28.000> remove<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.450> printhead<00:03:28.780> from<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.230> printer

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
to remove the printhead from the printer

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.480 
to remove the printhead from the printer
lift<00:03:31.210> the<00:03:31.360> gray<00:03:31.570> lever<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.800> then<00:03:32.980> tilt<00:03:33.310> the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
lift the gray lever up and then tilt the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.820 
lift the gray lever up and then tilt the
print<00:03:33.760> head<00:03:34.030> towards<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.720> at<00:03:34.810> 45<00:03:35.380> degrees<00:03:35.800> and

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
print head towards you at 45 degrees and

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.950 
print head towards you at 45 degrees and
lift<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.490> straight<00:03:36.640> out<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.660> within<00:03:40.840> your

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
lift it straight out so within your

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.810 
lift it straight out so within your
accessory<00:03:41.620> back<00:03:41.830> there<00:03:42.100> are<00:03:42.250> some<00:03:42.490> small

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
accessory back there are some small

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.900 
accessory back there are some small
silicon<00:03:43.480> seals<00:03:43.810> these<00:03:44.740> silicon<00:03:45.220> seals<00:03:45.550> should

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
silicon seals these silicon seals should

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.530 
silicon seals these silicon seals should
be<00:03:46.030> placed<00:03:46.300> around<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:47.230> printhead<00:03:50.040> itself<00:03:51.040> so

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
be placed around the printhead itself so

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.410 
be placed around the printhead itself so
they<00:03:52.540> do<00:03:52.600> actually<00:03:52.840> only<00:03:53.230> go<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:53.880> one<00:03:54.880> way<00:03:54.910> and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
they do actually only go on one way and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.570 
they do actually only go on one way and
it'll<00:03:55.600> very<00:03:56.020> clear<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.590> see<00:03:56.830> if<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.130> put<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.430> on

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
it'll very clear to see if you put it on

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.380 
it'll very clear to see if you put it on
the<00:03:57.730> wrong<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.930> basically<00:03:59.440> put<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.890> around<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the wrong so basically put it around the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.390 
the wrong so basically put it around the
metal<00:04:01.390> printhead<00:04:01.990> that<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.290> can<00:04:02.440> see<00:04:02.710> there

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
metal printhead that you can see there

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.370 
metal printhead that you can see there
else<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.880> there<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:04.330> are<00:04:04.450> already<00:04:04.720> in<00:04:05.080> by

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
else on there that are already in by

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.830 
else on there that are already in by
Canon<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.010> don't<00:04:06.220> remove<00:04:06.580> that<00:04:06.640> did<00:04:07.570> go

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
Canon you don't remove that did go

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.430 
Canon you don't remove that did go
straight<00:04:08.230> on<00:04:08.470> top<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.720> we're<00:04:11.050> going<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.260> place

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
straight on top so we're going to place

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.340 
straight on top so we're going to place
one<00:04:11.470> round<00:04:12.100> each<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.780> head<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
one round each of the head so the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.180 
one round each of the head so the
purpose<00:04:14.770> of<00:04:14.920> these<00:04:15.100> seals<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.900> get

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
purpose of these seals is to get

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.740 
purpose of these seals is to get
basically<00:04:18.190> an<00:04:18.520> airtight<00:04:18.940> seal<00:04:18.970> around<00:04:19.480> the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
basically an airtight seal around the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.170 
basically an airtight seal around the
bottom<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.290> cartridge<00:04:20.739> if<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.760> don't<00:04:21.940> put

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
bottom of the cartridge if you don't put

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.879 
bottom of the cartridge if you don't put
these<00:04:22.390> seals<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:23.050> one<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.070> few<00:04:24.280> things

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
these seals in one of the few things

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.520 
these seals in one of the few things
happen<00:04:25.719> basically<00:04:26.719> you'll<00:04:26.840> get<00:04:27.020> straight<00:04:27.349> to

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
happen basically you'll get straight to

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.350 
happen basically you'll get straight to
printouts<00:04:28.069> or<00:04:30.400> you'll<00:04:31.400> end<00:04:31.580> up<00:04:31.759> with<00:04:31.969> loads<00:04:32.210> of

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
printouts or you'll end up with loads of

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.409 
printouts or you'll end up with loads of
error<00:04:32.569> in<00:04:32.749> your<00:04:32.870> lives<00:04:33.080> again<00:04:33.319> so<00:04:34.249> it's<00:04:35.060> such<00:04:35.300> a

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
error in your lives again so it's such a

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.409 
error in your lives again so it's such a
small<00:04:35.629> part<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.590> does<00:04:36.800> play<00:04:37.099> an<00:04:37.759> important

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
small part but it does play an important

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.909 
small part but it does play an important
role<00:04:39.939> then<00:04:40.939> also<00:04:41.210> I'll<00:04:41.599> put<00:04:41.629> those<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.289> so

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
role then also I'll put those in so

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.209 
role then also I'll put those in so
print<00:04:43.520> head<00:04:43.699> back<00:04:43.939> in<00:04:44.210> at<00:04:44.569> an<00:04:44.779> angle<00:04:45.039> tilt<00:04:46.039> it

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:46.219 
print head back in at an angle tilt it

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.029 
print head back in at an angle tilt it
back<00:04:46.430> leave<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.629> down<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.740> we've<00:04:48.889> now

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
back leave it down so we've now

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.920 
back leave it down so we've now
installed<00:04:49.249> the<00:04:49.699> sails<00:04:49.969> and<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.509> systems

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
installed the sails and the systems

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.769 
installed the sails and the systems
already<00:04:51.169> been<00:04:51.560> primed<00:04:52.159> as<00:04:52.999> per<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.599> other

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:53.779 
already been primed as per the other

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.980 
already been primed as per the other
video<00:04:54.969> right<00:04:55.969> so<00:04:56.150> for<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:56.449> model<00:04:56.840> of<00:04:56.900> the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
video right so for this model of the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.779 
video right so for this model of the
continuous<00:04:57.529> that<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> bulk<00:04:57.979> ink<00:04:58.159> system<00:04:58.400> goes

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
continuous that the bulk ink system goes

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.580 
continuous that the bulk ink system goes
on<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.240> left-hand<00:04:59.689> side<00:04:59.779> of<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.259> printer

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
on the left-hand side of the printer

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.439 
on the left-hand side of the printer
so<00:05:03.590> with<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.800> cartridges<00:05:04.400> higher<00:05:05.029> than<00:05:05.330> the

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
so with the cartridges higher than the

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.959 
so with the cartridges higher than the
continuous<00:05:05.810> ink<00:05:06.259> system<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:07.370> need<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.669> remove

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
continuous ink system you need to remove

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.230 
continuous ink system you need to remove
the<00:05:08.210> elastic<00:05:08.360> bands<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.349> then<00:05:10.219> unscrew<00:05:10.789> all

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
the elastic bands and then unscrew all

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.830 
the elastic bands and then unscrew all
of<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.569> orange<00:05:11.750> caps<00:05:12.789> so<00:05:13.789> you<00:05:14.360> need<00:05:14.539> to<00:05:14.659> make

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
of the orange caps so you need to make

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.269 
of the orange caps so you need to make
sure<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:15.319> this<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.680> higher<00:05:15.889> than<00:05:16.129> the

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279 
sure that this is higher than the

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.100 
sure that this is higher than the
continuous<00:05:16.580> ink<00:05:17.000> system<00:05:17.210> or<00:05:17.509> you<00:05:17.719> may<00:05:17.870> get

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
continuous ink system or you may get

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.670 
continuous ink system or you may get
some<00:05:18.319> droplets<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.889> ink<00:05:19.099> coming<00:05:19.969> out<00:05:20.289> so<00:05:21.289> you

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
some droplets of ink coming out so you

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.390 
some droplets of ink coming out so you
take<00:05:21.889> them<00:05:22.069> off<00:05:22.159> by<00:05:22.370> just<00:05:22.669> twisting<00:05:23.210> the

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
take them off by just twisting the

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.959 
take them off by just twisting the
anti-clockwise<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:28.610> then<00:05:28.729> we're<00:05:28.819> going<00:05:28.939> to

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
anti-clockwise and then we're going to

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:30.820 
anti-clockwise and then we're going to
flip<00:05:29.150> them<00:05:29.419> over<00:05:29.539> and<00:05:29.870> put<00:05:29.900> them<00:05:30.139> all<00:05:30.349> in<00:05:30.560> in

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
flip them over and put them all in in

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.640 
flip them over and put them all in in
one<00:05:30.909> go<00:05:32.409> so<00:05:33.409> flip<00:05:33.740> them<00:05:33.919> over<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:35.060> they're<00:05:35.240> red

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
one go so flip them over and they're red

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.929 
one go so flip them over and they're red
click<00:05:36.650> them<00:05:36.830> all<00:05:36.919> down<00:05:37.219> and<00:05:39.639> put<00:05:40.639> the<00:05:40.759> gray

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
click them all down and put the gray

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:46.570 
click them all down and put the gray
lever<00:05:41.240> back<00:05:42.110> down<00:05:43.060> so<00:05:44.379> the<00:05:45.379> t-bar<00:05:45.770> itself<00:05:46.310> on

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
lever back down so the t-bar itself on

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.999 
lever back down so the t-bar itself on
the<00:05:46.699> bottom<00:05:47.089> there's<00:05:47.599> a<00:05:47.689> small<00:05:47.990> green<00:05:48.529> sticky

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
the bottom there's a small green sticky

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.790 
the bottom there's a small green sticky
part<00:05:49.279> you<00:05:49.969> should<00:05:50.210> remove<00:05:50.509> this<00:05:50.839> either<00:05:51.529> do<00:05:51.770> it

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
part you should remove this either do it

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.709 
part you should remove this either do it
with<00:05:51.949> your<00:05:52.069> fingers<00:05:52.449> or<00:05:53.449> your<00:05:53.569> tweezers<00:05:54.110> like

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
with your fingers or your tweezers like

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:04.869 
with your fingers or your tweezers like
so<00:05:59.560> can<00:06:00.560> be<00:06:00.740> a<00:06:00.770> bit<00:06:01.009> tricky<00:06:01.189> sometimes<00:06:02.649> well<00:06:03.879> so

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
so can be a bit tricky sometimes well so

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.029 
so can be a bit tricky sometimes well so
the<00:06:05.060> t-bar<00:06:05.479> goes<00:06:05.930> on<00:06:06.199> the<00:06:06.319> left-hand<00:06:06.919> side

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
the t-bar goes on the left-hand side

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.730 
the t-bar goes on the left-hand side
here<00:06:07.580> so<00:06:08.060> there<00:06:08.569> is<00:06:08.659> a<00:06:08.689> small<00:06:08.930> lip<00:06:09.409> here

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
here so there is a small lip here

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.309 
here so there is a small lip here
basically<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.939> clip<00:06:11.210> just<00:06:11.419> sit<00:06:11.750> at<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.169> back

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 
basically the clip just sit at the back

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.320 
basically the clip just sit at the back
of<00:06:12.529> the<00:06:12.620> lid<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:13.610> should<00:06:13.819> be<00:06:13.939> looking<00:06:14.060> at

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
of the lid and you should be looking at

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.389 
of the lid and you should be looking at
about<00:06:14.539> four<00:06:14.930> centimeters<00:06:15.379> up<00:06:15.889> from<00:06:16.219> this

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:16.399 
about four centimeters up from this

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.679 
about four centimeters up from this
point<00:06:16.699> here<00:06:17.089> and<00:06:17.409> then<00:06:18.409> just<00:06:18.649> press<00:06:18.919> down<00:06:19.189> very

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:19.689 
point here and then just press down very

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:23.379 
point here and then just press down very
firmly<00:06:20.860> so<00:06:21.860> there<00:06:22.039> is<00:06:22.159> the<00:06:22.430> cable<00:06:22.639> is<00:06:22.879> twisted

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
firmly so there is the cable is twisted

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.629 
firmly so there is the cable is twisted
here<00:06:23.599> you<00:06:23.779> need<00:06:23.930> to<00:06:23.990> make<00:06:24.139> sure<00:06:24.560> that<00:06:25.219> this<00:06:25.399> is

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
here you need to make sure that this is

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.639 
here you need to make sure that this is
not<00:06:25.909> twisted<00:06:26.810> when<00:06:26.960> you<00:06:27.080> put<00:06:27.289> it<00:06:27.469> in<00:06:28.029> like<00:06:29.029> so

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:29.649 
not twisted when you put it in like so

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:34.180 
not twisted when you put it in like so
so<00:06:30.649> you<00:06:30.710> just<00:06:31.039> took<00:06:31.310> it<00:06:31.550> just<00:06:32.139> it<00:06:33.139> around

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
so you just took it just it around

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.700 
so you just took it just it around
they<00:06:35.120> are<00:06:35.360> making<00:06:35.600> sure<00:06:35.990> that<00:06:36.290> it's<00:06:36.500> not

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
they are making sure that it's not

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.890 
they are making sure that it's not
twisted<00:06:37.120> but<00:06:38.120> you<00:06:38.180> must<00:06:38.360> press<00:06:38.600> down<00:06:38.870> very

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
twisted but you must press down very
