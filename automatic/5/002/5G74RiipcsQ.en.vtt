00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.069 
thinking remember me telling you it's a
match<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> peaked<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.239> two<00:00:39.510> main<00:00:39.780> points

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the face taps out which I love I did

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.690 
the face taps out which I love I did
that<00:01:04.500> doesn't<00:01:04.619> happen<00:01:04.920> enough<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.460> mean<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that doesn't happen enough I mean it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
that doesn't happen enough I mean it
shouldn't<00:01:05.880> happen<00:01:06.090> too<00:01:06.420> often<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.530> really

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
shouldn't happen too often but it really

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.760 
shouldn't happen too often but it really
does<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.840> impactful<00:01:10.409> finish

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
does it is really an impactful finish

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
does it is really an impactful finish
when<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> happens<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.689> why

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
when that happens and I just that's why

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
when that happens and I just that's why
I<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.549> end<00:01:14.580> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I think it's so good is that the end is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600 
I think it's so good is that the end is
that<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:16.409> only<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.740> Michael's<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that not only is Michael's and it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.740 
that not only is Michael's and it's
great<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.060> doesn't<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.360> Michaels

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
great because it doesn't make Michaels

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
great because it doesn't make Michaels
look<00:01:18.900> look<00:01:19.320> weak<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.860> doesn't<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.220> muck<00:01:20.460> Lake

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
look look weak it doesn't like muck Lake

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.060 
look look weak it doesn't like muck Lake
might<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.119> Matt<00:01:21.780> look<00:01:22.110> make<00:01:22.350> Michaels

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
might make like Matt look make Michaels

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.249 
might make like Matt look make Michaels
look<00:01:23.220> flaky<00:01:23.430> or<00:01:23.670> anything<00:01:23.970> he<00:01:24.689> tries<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
minutes and then finally taps out and it

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.010

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.320 
used to say this is a great match it
would<00:03:46.620> always<00:03:46.830> would<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.520> a<00:03:47.550> great<00:03:47.820> match<00:03:48.000> it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
would always would be a great match it

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.780

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
wasn't just that the latest match that

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.420 
wasn't just that the latest match that
they'd<00:03:51.060> put<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:52.050> really<00:03:52.470> always<00:03:52.620> was<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.220> I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
they'd put on it really always was and I

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.590 
they'd put on it really always was and I
thought<00:03:53.459> always<00:03:53.790> stuck<00:03:54.060> out<00:03:54.209> for<00:03:54.300> some<00:03:54.570> reason

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
thought always stuck out for some reason

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.420 
thought always stuck out for some reason
but<00:03:54.900> no<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.440> was<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> good<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:55.980> was<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> great

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
but no it was a good it was a great

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.760 
but no it was a good it was a great
match<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.940> always<00:03:57.360> thought<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.380> as<00:03:58.470> you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
match and I always thought of it as you

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.260 
match and I always thought of it as you
know<00:03:58.860> one<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.070> those<00:03:59.280> great<00:03:59.640> matches<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
know one of those great matches and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.240 
know one of those great matches and
probably<00:04:00.900> if<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.290> was<00:04:01.410> being<00:04:01.590> fair<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:01.950> should

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
probably if I was being fair it should

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.790 
probably if I was being fair it should
be<00:04:02.520> in<00:04:02.610> my<00:04:02.700> top<00:04:02.760> five<00:04:02.910> because<00:04:03.270> it<00:04:03.390> did<00:04:03.900> shape<00:04:04.620> a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800

we've had so many spot fests and learn

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.189 
we've had so many spot fests and learn
so<00:04:29.819> many<00:04:29.909> matches<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.330> run<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.720> similar
