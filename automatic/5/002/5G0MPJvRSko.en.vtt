00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.770
 Hello girls 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.170
 This is because with you is really good here 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.990
 a simple and easy to fix morelli and 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.140
 today girls I teach you how 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.590
 turn a denim jacket into a 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.160
 Wear jeans and wear a lot of coconut. 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.980
 with a lot of good creativity and for you 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.620
 to be able to make this transformation 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 what you will need to win only from 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.840
 a scissor a pen a pen 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.470
 you prefer 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.950
 spike a ruler 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.910
 the jacket is light and what I forget 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.450
 to put was a forceps without tweezers 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.380
 good then starting to transform our 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.040
 jacket 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.869
 I made a template first of how I 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.520
 I would cut my jacket since I 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.329
 I wanted to run I did not want to cut the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.229
 straight then I measured everything right 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.299
 I drew a paper 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.390
 the format of how I would like to cut 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.630
 my jacket cut out and made a mold 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.610
 even so I can cut it right 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.020
 so I advise you always to do 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.909
 the mold he wants you not to come 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.700
 cut wrong touch 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.210
 so let's go to the first position on my 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.549
 mold in place where or cut and I go 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.080
 marking with my pen to 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.080
 Can cut everything right 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 and shortly after cutting the two sides 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.770
 It's time for Dci to want to be alone. 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.750
 He cut it out then I'll take it. 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.470
 tweezers and begins to break my barred 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.470
 exactly so look 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.420
 and then said is everything with the tweezers that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.099
 was the end result looked okay 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.790
 bereaved I do well the way I do 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.010
 I wanted to and soon after was part of 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.709
 cut the weed to form even a 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.810
 vest to cut the girl 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.660
 has a lot of secrets since it already has the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 sewing then just cut it yourself 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.489
 following the seam I left a 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.420
 just a little bit more even just 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.849
 to have been more so I could shred 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.910
 also with the tweezers and then and 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.670
 My favorite hour came when 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.700
 The time to put the spikes I chose 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.680
 these dishes and a good point to give 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.599
 style rock in gold mine in mine 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.069
 jeans vest right 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:39.069
 Anyway, I advise you always. 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.590
 through 17 where you place draw 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:46.349
 a paper before how you want it to stay 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.349
 this for later and applying 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.760
 in the spike application, that's fine 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.340
 simple girls 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 It's just you pick up the spike in jeans. 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.300
 able that you have a bit of 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.460
 difficulty if it is mainly yields 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.020
 advises little fingers since money is the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.170
 thicker material 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.800
 but anyway it 's just you nailing the spike on 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.260
 jeans and with the aid of scissors 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.990
 you press the little girls that stay 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.640
 inside press pre-in to 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.560
 may it not hurt to come 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.160
 fight even in jeans 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.160
 look that 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.430
 and now just let go of the imagination and 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.270
 put the mirrors the way you 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.270
 to prefer 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.840
 and here girls already underneath the 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.450
 jacket and I'm going to put the spikes of 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.110
 same way I put it in the 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.420
 top of the jacket on the left shoulder and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.120
 always in the same way always measuring 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.710
 before applying the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.710
 Spanish correctly 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.439
 and not to be spike only in the part of the 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.870
 front 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.219
 this is the back part in the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.370
 behind the collective 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:59.840
 I was also measuring Luis 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.840
 parents in back 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.610
 good mines this was the end result 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.380
 I really liked this transformation 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.539
 I hope you liked it too. 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.419
 and if you like, do not forget to show 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.030
 This was a great tip and gave a 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:26.310
 passadinha there on the blog touch the super 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.310
 A kiss for you all and see you next time.
