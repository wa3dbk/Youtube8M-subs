two ways for the body to grow one is on

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.549 
two ways for the body to grow one is on
a<00:00:35.130> pump<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.630> know<00:00:36.750> getting<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.230> blood<00:00:37.530> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
a pump you know getting that blood on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.200 
a pump you know getting that blood on
the<00:00:37.680> muscle<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> muscle<00:00:38.399> contracting

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the muscle the muscle contracting

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
getting nutrients into the muscle and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.319 
getting nutrients into the muscle and
the<00:00:43.680> muscle<00:00:43.710> constantly<00:00:44.520> pumping<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.030> getting

that helps the muscle grow enormous lee
a<00:00:51.059> lot<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> people<00:00:51.629> don't<00:00:51.780> realize<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
a lot of people don't realize this the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
a lot of people don't realize this the
second<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> obvious<00:00:54.210> answer<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:54.750> is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
second is the obvious answer which is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.319 
second is the obvious answer which is
tearing<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> muscle<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> muscle

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
tearing the muscle down so the muscle

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.619 
tearing the muscle down so the muscle
can<00:00:57.510> rebuild<00:00:58.079> itself<00:00:58.590> back<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.129> now<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
can rebuild itself back up now the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.280 
can rebuild itself back up now the
steroids<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.949> help<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.969> both<00:01:03.149> areas<00:01:03.629> they

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
help rebuild the muscle faster and they

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.289 
help rebuild the muscle faster and they
help<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.920> attaining<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.299> greater<00:01:10.260> pump

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
higher reps going for the pump they

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.940 
higher reps going for the pump they
don't<00:02:54.850> understand<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.810> amount<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.230> pain<00:02:56.560> I'm

you'll know exactly what I'm talking
about<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.390> when<00:03:07.510> you're<00:03:07.690> on<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> cycle<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.680> can

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
about but when you're on a cycle you can

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.640 
about but when you're on a cycle you can
train<00:03:09.820> like<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.510> get<00:03:10.780> much<00:03:11.080> better

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
train like that and get much better

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.759 
train like that and get much better
results<00:03:11.830> by<00:03:12.790> pumping<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.570> muscle<00:03:14.019> than

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
results by pumping the muscle than

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.259 
results by pumping the muscle than
actually<00:03:15.190> training<00:03:15.610> heavy<00:03:16.269> vets<00:03:16.630> from<00:03:17.620> my

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
actually training heavy vets from my

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.090 
actually training heavy vets from my
experience<00:03:19.269> now<00:03:19.510> being<00:03:19.720> natural<00:03:20.260> it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
experience now being natural it's

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.550 
experience now being natural it's
different<00:03:21.640> being<00:03:22.450> natural<00:03:23.019> you're<00:03:23.260> gonna<00:03:23.380> get

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
different being natural you're gonna get

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.300 
different being natural you're gonna get
a<00:03:23.620> lot<00:03:23.890> better<00:03:24.100> results<00:03:24.660> lifting<00:03:25.660> heavy

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
a lot better results lifting heavy

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.580 
a lot better results lifting heavy
getting<00:03:27.310> stronger<00:03:28.080> tearing<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.170> muscles

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
getting stronger tearing the muscles

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.650 
getting stronger tearing the muscles
down<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.220> letting<00:03:30.640> them<00:03:30.730> rebuild<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.540> when<00:03:31.630> I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
down and letting them rebuild and when I

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.170 
down and letting them rebuild and when I
say<00:03:31.900> tearing<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.320> muscles<00:03:32.680> down<00:03:33.000> you're<00:03:34.000> not

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
say tearing the muscles down you're not

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.150 
say tearing the muscles down you're not
annihilating<00:03:34.989> your<00:03:35.019> muscles<00:03:35.500> because<00:03:35.890> being

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
annihilating your muscles because being

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.130 
annihilating your muscles because being
natural<00:03:36.610> your<00:03:36.820> body<00:03:37.320> can't<00:03:38.320> recover<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:39.340> well

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
natural your body can't recover as well

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.040 
natural your body can't recover as well
if<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.680> completely<00:03:42.340> annihilate<00:03:43.300> your<00:03:43.750> body

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
if you completely annihilate your body

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.680 
if you completely annihilate your body
if<00:03:44.320> you're<00:03:44.440> gonna<00:03:44.560> do<00:03:44.769> 30<00:03:45.100> sets<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.760> legs<00:03:46.000> it's

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
if you're gonna do 30 sets of legs it's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.210 
if you're gonna do 30 sets of legs it's
going<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.930> take<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.350> two<00:03:47.680> weeks<00:03:48.010> to

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
going to take you two weeks to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.550 
going to take you two weeks to
completely<00:03:48.730> recover<00:03:49.000> from<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.720> being

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
completely recover from that being

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.400 
completely recover from that being
natural<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.880> when<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.540> say<00:03:52.810> there's<00:03:53.019> no<00:03:53.170> such

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
natural so when I say there's no such

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.350 
natural so when I say there's no such
thing<00:03:53.680> as<00:03:53.709> overtraining<00:03:54.250> well<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:55.030> know<00:03:55.150> what

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
thing as overtraining well you know what

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.130 
thing as overtraining well you know what
yeah<00:03:55.780> there<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:57.160> exaggerate<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> lot<00:03:58.510> if

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
yeah there is I exaggerate a lot if

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.440 
yeah there is I exaggerate a lot if
you're<00:03:59.320> on<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.470> good<00:03:59.799> cycle<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.580> you're<00:04:01.180> eating

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
you're on a good cycle and you're eating

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.270 
you're on a good cycle and you're eating
10,000<00:04:02.290> calories<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.830> day

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
10,000 calories a day

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.070 
10,000 calories a day
you're<00:04:03.400> getting<00:04:03.670> your<00:04:03.760> sleep<00:04:04.060> in<00:04:04.300> there's<00:04:04.840> no

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
you're getting your sleep in there's no

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.740 
you're getting your sleep in there's no
such<00:04:05.350> thing<00:04:05.590> as<00:04:05.620> overtraining<00:04:06.160> no<00:04:06.970> such<00:04:07.450> thing

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
such thing as overtraining no such thing

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.050 
such thing as overtraining no such thing
it's<00:04:07.990> a<00:04:08.110> word<00:04:08.290> for<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.620> week<00:04:08.830> so<00:04:09.760> that's

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
it's a word for the week so that's

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.340 
it's a word for the week so that's
basically<00:04:10.569> the<00:04:10.780> difference<00:04:11.170> between

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
basically the difference between

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.390 
basically the difference between
training<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:13.080> training<00:04:14.080> off<00:04:14.290> from<00:04:15.250> my

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
training on and training off from my

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.550 
training on and training off from my
experience<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.180> can<00:04:16.329> do<00:04:16.510> much<00:04:16.780> higher<00:04:17.139> reps

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
experience you can do much higher reps

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.240 
experience you can do much higher reps
and<00:04:18.209> create<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.419> pain<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.079> then<00:04:20.680> fight<00:04:21.070> the

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
and create the pain and then fight the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.650 
and create the pain and then fight the
pain<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:22.080> work<00:04:23.080> through<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.660> continue

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
pain and work through it and continue

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.900 
pain and work through it and continue
growing<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:27.360> avoiding<00:04:28.360> injuries
