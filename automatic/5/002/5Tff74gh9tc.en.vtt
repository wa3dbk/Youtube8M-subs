00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.200
 for tomorrow what should happen to the rioters with the bull 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.390
 According to police, going on the road has made it possible 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.969
 the public 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.959
 and since there has been busy for some time samsom that man staff bet on 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.849
 Sunday at events 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.579
 and of course also for the closed-off procedure die wietse van der glas 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.560
 Handelskade the furious pressure 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.159
 from one store after another restaurants 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.579
 more than forty new space must be placed 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.669
 the retailers are furious about what happened 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.489
 it's really unbelievable and then they say those guests have it for 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.100
 about one hundred thousand guilders renewed 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.510
 the police admit that they did not expect it to get out of hand like this 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.580
 walk 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.740
 we will not soon forget last night, the police chief says 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.250
 it is outrageous what happened 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.920
 olen and 68,000 holland s60 vincent cheered their club last night 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.090
 they celebrated the party 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 probably the biggest winner of the NFL cup 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.410
 then anp 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.430
 only the vandals went through the city last night trail of destruction 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.340
 leaving behind 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.650
 this morning the damage was recorded 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 the police two people who report stores inside of broken windows 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.800
 Vandals were mainly focused on sports jewelry stores last night 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800
 but three stores took shoes and items of clothing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.579
 I can play thus the player 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.210
 and we are surprised 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.930
 because this working year the government had a bit of being able to continue working on what's going on 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.230
 was going to happen 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.870
 when you see the images on TV the day before and the state on the coolsingel 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.690
 about a hundred thousand men yes 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.690
 then you know what will happen 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.450
 the perpetrator brought in dozens of people and the numbers on the n9 continued 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 and he has already lost many players 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.390
 the cause of the disturbances can be found in the large quantities 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.289
 alcohol 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.530
 that was consumed 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.890
 the catering on the town hall square was at half past nine the door ordered by the police 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.830
 it is rumored that the free beer was provided by an entrepreneur 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.630
 when the world goes on 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.630
 but what they promise to be won is already fixed 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.560
 and then just nonsense we have all together been together to get one of the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.269
 neighbors right and left 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.709
 the european union to the north of spain shorten the murder of a clerk 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.069
 for cheaper food 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 the public on the town hall square that today is deeply outraged 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.479
 the perpetrator stepped that is not 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.659
 it's a fun one 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.639
 but I immediately went to give it a chance 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.709
 that is not possible with her name in Amsterdam 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.659
 because it is always difficult 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 causing the woman to be arrested may already be released and then it goes 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.819
 Earn money although the bond with you needs this one 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.050
 the public gallery 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.539
 agree with the agreement 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.759
 you don't have to do it 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.199
 pure nature 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.229
 the hospitality industry on the town hall square will survive a bit at the next 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.039
 football festival must happen 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.229
 keep the doors closed as previously happened to those sick or all 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.229
 competitions is perhaps the best solution 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.010
 the damage is estimated at a few hundred thousand guilders 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.969
 disturbances started around seven o'clock last night 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.799
 the mood suddenly boomed, resulting in dozens of injured people 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.719
 various arrests 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.409
 shortly after the players' departure the problems in the city center started 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.849
 the group of four hundred young people in front of the paved windows of shops 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:22.450
 in 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.049
 pelted the regional transport buses at the robbery square 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.249
 almost immediately after the festivities, the coolsingel is on 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.169
 excellently 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:37.489
 we have already broken out the fighting parties with stones thrown at one 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.619
 vehicle 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:43.229
 that escalated the wine to offer around the three 400 euros 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.649
 by the sending of the city departed and there the destruction 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:49.339
 The police decided to leave the town hall square around nine o'clock 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.639
 clear and close the lane 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.249
 after an hour, a group of supporters gathered again if you were like you 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.059
 the mobile unit is training there 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:03.549
 what then reason 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.979
 in total, the police arrested seven people for public violence 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.509
 they are still stuck 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.809
 The police received reports of slightly injured but only the government 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:22.019
 hospital already received over forty people with various injuries 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.669
 including some serious 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.669
 at eleven o'clock the peace had returned to the city center 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.919
 the rotterdam police have since acknowledged that they have failed 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.840
 last night after the celebration of Feyenoord 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.350
 No major problems taken into account making the case easy 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.909
 the hand could walk 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.629
 the disturbances of last night are internal to the Rotterdam police 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.930
 a solid one is evolving today 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.139
 this after consultation this morning between the police chief and mayor pepper 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.930
 main conclusion the police were in no way prepared for 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.930
 the most important question is how is that possible? 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.360
 the seas 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.029
 departed based on 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:05.279
 lack of information about this we have not anticipated this 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.889
 and the family that have been working for a while to minimize the number of staff 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.129
 put on Sundays and at events 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.529
 You have chosen a strength that in retrospect does not turn completely 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:15.680
 paid out of existence 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.210
 it is clear to the police that they are always the most important factors 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.569
 been the ones who contributed to the misery last night 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.089
 wanted the third round 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.039
 euro says there is also free beer with it not at all 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.080
 more in hand 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.810
 so used the beer and yet also the will to kick riots because that's how it is 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.670
 Also called Feyenoord supporter falls goalkeeper had to rioters from the center of 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.330
 to come to Rotterdam Yes I do not know in which category people were placed 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.139
 but it is comparable to football vandalism just to get out of it 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.669
 stadium in this case 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.990
 it is not without reason that football is involved 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.539
 mua at such a moment is best expressed 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.270
 what kind of lessons does the rotterdam police after evaluation of this whole 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.210
 happen to the following games 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.539
 I think the gentleman for the future anyway 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.520
 the 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.969
 we must try to provide more information 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.299
 so get a better information position and reserve it in the second class 

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:06.479
 to have because 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.290
 our estimate is that we have based it on the fact that it is not foreseen 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.169
 contain too little to say 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.770
 in the case it became painfully clear that they thought the 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.050
 fringes around the footballer of the year misery finally over 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.800
 there were again with both
