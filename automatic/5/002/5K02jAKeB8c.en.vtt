teeth on the pulverizer because those
are<00:01:32.399> a<00:01:32.430> little<00:01:32.610> bit<00:01:32.700> smaller<00:01:33.030> than<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> teeth

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
put some jaws in the back of it so that

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.880 
put some jaws in the back of it so that
the<00:02:00.149> customer<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.020> able<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> pick<00:02:01.770> up

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the customer would be able to pick up

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.240

around<00:02:05.340> more<00:02:05.610> easily<00:02:05.670> even<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.840> tape<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.829> DAP

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
around more easily even if we tape a DAP

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.170 
around more easily even if we tape a DAP
down<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> bit<00:02:10.679> more<00:02:10.890> easy<00:02:11.400> access

the new pulverizer together that looks
good<00:03:34.280> yeah<00:03:34.580> okay<00:03:34.910> going<00:03:35.120> out<00:03:35.300> things<00:03:35.480> that

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
good yeah okay going out things that

good yeah okay going out things that
we're<00:03:35.780> running<00:03:36.110> into<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:36.470> right<00:03:36.620> now<00:03:36.800> are<00:03:37.100> the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
we're running into you right now are the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.880 
we're running into you right now are the
spacing<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.510> teeth<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.470> look<00:03:39.650> these

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
spacing of the teeth and look these

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.230 
spacing of the teeth and look these
teeth<00:03:40.190> are<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.400> little<00:03:40.520> bit<00:03:40.670> wider<00:03:40.880> than<00:03:41.120> we

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
teeth are a little bit wider than we

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.850 
teeth are a little bit wider than we
originally<00:03:41.360> anticipated<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.500> model<00:03:42.770> it's

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
originally anticipated on the model it's

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.620 
originally anticipated on the model it's
like<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.100> model<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.459> with<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.610> different<00:03:43.970> makeup

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
like we model it with a different makeup

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.970 
like we model it with a different makeup
tooth<00:03:44.900> these<00:03:45.110> are<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.260> brand<00:03:45.500> new<00:03:45.560> type<00:03:45.830> of

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
tooth these are a brand new type of

tooth these are a brand new type of
tooth<00:03:46.130> system<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:47.030> they<00:03:47.120> appear<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.480> be<00:03:47.630> a

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
tooth system and they appear to be a

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.690 
tooth system and they appear to be a
little<00:03:47.900> bit<00:03:47.990> too<00:03:48.170> wide<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.770> they're<00:03:49.580> not

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
little bit too wide and they're not

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.850 
little bit too wide and they're not
meshing<00:03:50.060> past<00:03:50.420> one<00:03:50.690> another<00:03:50.870> right<00:03:51.050> now<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.440> we

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
meshing past one another right now so we

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.680 
meshing past one another right now so we
may<00:03:52.040> have<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.280> either<00:03:52.520> reposition<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.480> teeth

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
may have to either reposition the teeth

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.150 
may have to either reposition the teeth
on<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.959> cutting<00:03:54.200> edges<00:03:54.500> or<00:03:54.680> we<00:03:54.800> might<00:03:54.920> have<00:03:54.980> to

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
on the cutting edges or we might have to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.320 
on the cutting edges or we might have to
go<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.459> different<00:03:55.640> selection<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.180> tooth

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
go to a different selection of tooth

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330 
go to a different selection of tooth
it's<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.900> beast<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.380> looks<00:03:57.560> beautiful<00:03:58.070> it's<00:03:58.220> a

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
it's a beast it looks beautiful it's a

not<00:04:00.830> look<00:04:00.890> like<00:04:01.370> some<00:04:02.150> kind<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.570> monstrous

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
not look like some kind of a monstrous

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.320 
not look like some kind of a monstrous
beast<00:04:03.800> ready<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.310> just<00:04:04.459> devour<00:04:04.820> anything<00:04:05.180> in

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
beast ready to just devour anything in

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.020 
beast ready to just devour anything in
its<00:04:05.480> sight<00:04:09.010> well<00:04:10.010> today<00:04:10.280> is<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.489> big<00:04:10.610> day<00:04:10.640> where

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
its sight well today is a big day where

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.000 
its sight well today is a big day where
we<00:04:11.150> find<00:04:11.390> out<00:04:11.540> if<00:04:11.750> all<00:04:11.959> this<00:04:12.110> work<00:04:12.620> has<00:04:12.830> been

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
we find out if all this work has been

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.659 
we find out if all this work has been
worth<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:14.560> it's<00:04:15.560> about<00:04:15.739> a<00:04:15.800> month<00:04:16.070> later<00:04:16.370> and

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
worth it it's about a month later and

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.520 
worth it it's about a month later and
the<00:04:16.820> pulverizer<00:04:17.450> has<00:04:17.780> been<00:04:17.930> welded<00:04:18.380> together

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
the pulverizer has been welded together

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.740 
the pulverizer has been welded together
painted<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.669> put<00:04:20.030> on<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.269> front<00:04:20.480> of<00:04:20.630> an

excavator

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.970 

the<00:04:26.640> teeth<00:04:26.910> seem<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.360> be<00:04:27.450> working<00:04:27.780> fine<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.830> can

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
the teeth seem to be working fine it can

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.040 
the teeth seem to be working fine it can
pick<00:04:29.160> up<00:04:29.310> everything<00:04:29.790> from<00:04:29.970> metal<00:04:30.450> debris<00:04:30.600> to

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
pick up everything from metal debris to

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.310 
pick up everything from metal debris to
mid-sized<00:04:31.620> pieces<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.280> concrete<00:04:33.170> but<00:04:34.170> the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
mid-sized pieces of concrete but the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.870 
mid-sized pieces of concrete but the
operator<00:04:34.770> seems<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.250> be<00:04:35.340> having<00:04:35.700> some

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
operator seems to be having some

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.820 
operator seems to be having some
difficulty<00:04:36.480> with<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.750> idea<00:04:37.140> of<00:04:37.230> tipping<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
difficulty with the idea of tipping the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.430 
difficulty with the idea of tipping the
bucket<00:04:38.220> up<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:39.270> let<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.540> material<00:04:39.630> fall<00:04:40.260> back

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
bucket up to let the material fall back

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.530 
bucket up to let the material fall back
into<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.070> most<00:04:41.280> effective<00:04:41.730> crushing<00:04:42.270> area

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
into the most effective crushing area

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.120 
into the most effective crushing area
it's<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.440> little<00:04:43.590> bit<00:04:43.680> different<00:04:43.860> from<00:04:44.040> the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
it's a little bit different from the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.830 
it's a little bit different from the
other<00:04:44.310> polarizer<00:04:44.790> where<00:04:45.090> gravity<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.540> working

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
other polarizer where gravity is working

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.870 
other polarizer where gravity is working
against<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.350> so<00:04:47.010> try<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.220> get<00:04:47.400> gravity<00:04:47.790> to

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
against you so try to get gravity to

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.360 
against you so try to get gravity to
work<00:04:48.000> for<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:48.480> open<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:48.840> wide

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.330 

this<00:04:51.910> time<00:04:52.180> it<00:04:52.389> seems<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.870> work<00:04:53.020> much<00:04:53.260> better

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.080 

that's<00:04:58.850> beautiful<00:05:00.280> but<00:05:01.280> there<00:05:01.670> are<00:05:01.820> still

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
that's beautiful but there are still

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.420 
that's beautiful but there are still
some<00:05:02.360> problems<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:03.410> concrete<00:05:03.980> chunks<00:05:04.190> are

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
some problems the concrete chunks are

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.400 
some problems the concrete chunks are
not<00:05:04.580> being<00:05:04.790> crushed<00:05:05.180> in<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.570> very<00:05:05.780> spot<00:05:05.990> mark

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
not being crushed in the very spot mark

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.260 
not being crushed in the very spot mark
figured<00:05:06.830> would<00:05:07.010> be<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.250> most<00:05:07.400> effective<00:05:07.700> I

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
figured would be the most effective I

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.360 
figured would be the most effective I
think<00:05:09.139> what's<00:05:09.350> happening<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.830> materials

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
think what's happening is materials

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.920 
think what's happening is materials
getting<00:05:10.520> jammed<00:05:10.880> between<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.419> bottoms<00:05:11.780> of

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
getting jammed between the bottoms of

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.650 
getting jammed between the bottoms of
the<00:05:12.020> teeth<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:13.190> this<00:05:13.820> just<00:05:14.240> blocker<00:05:14.480> plate

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
the teeth and this just blocker plate

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.659 
the teeth and this just blocker plate
yeah<00:05:15.440> these<00:05:15.650> are<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:15.950> plates<00:05:16.160> right<00:05:16.430> here

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
yeah these are the plates right here

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.129 
yeah these are the plates right here
that<00:05:16.850> are<00:05:16.880> blocking<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.480> material<00:05:17.930> from

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
that are blocking the material from

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.110 
that are blocking the material from
flowing<00:05:18.440> through<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.070> we<00:05:19.520> can<00:05:19.550> cut<00:05:19.880> this

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
flowing through and we can cut this

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.720 
flowing through and we can cut this
plate<00:05:20.419> out<00:05:20.500> or<00:05:21.500> possibly<00:05:21.980> just<00:05:22.250> cut<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.490> window

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
plate out or possibly just cut a window

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.190 
plate out or possibly just cut a window
in<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.120> plate<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.570> allow<00:05:23.750> some<00:05:24.020> of<00:05:24.139> that

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
in the plate and allow some of that

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.230 
in the plate and allow some of that
material<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.770> flow<00:05:25.010> out<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:26.150> would

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
material to flow out and it would

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.670 
material to flow out and it would
prevent<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.720> jamming<00:05:27.139> that's<00:05:27.320> occurring

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
prevent the jamming that's occurring

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.670 
prevent the jamming that's occurring
right<00:05:27.710> now<00:05:28.630> finally<00:05:29.630> mark<00:05:30.020> gets<00:05:30.260> in<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.500> rig

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
right now finally mark gets in the rig

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.140 
right now finally mark gets in the rig
himself<00:05:31.100> to<00:05:31.280> figure<00:05:31.520> out<00:05:31.669> how<00:05:31.850> to<00:05:31.880> best

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
himself to figure out how to best

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.570 
himself to figure out how to best
operate<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.750> machine<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.650> discovers<00:05:34.550> a

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
operate the machine and discovers a

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.150 
operate the machine and discovers a
possible<00:05:35.030> answer<00:05:35.240> once<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:36.410> material<00:05:36.830> is<00:05:36.919> in

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
possible answer once the material is in

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.810 
possible answer once the material is in
the<00:05:37.400> bucket<00:05:37.730> keep<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.390> pointed<00:05:38.840> at<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.260> ground

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
the bucket keep it pointed at the ground

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.770 
the bucket keep it pointed at the ground
it'll<00:05:40.820> do<00:05:40.970> a<00:05:41.000> couple<00:05:41.300> of<00:05:41.330> things<00:05:41.510> that'll

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
it'll do a couple of things that'll

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.240 
it'll do a couple of things that'll
allow<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.260> see<00:05:42.470> what's<00:05:42.680> going<00:05:42.950> on<00:05:43.070> in<00:05:43.160> the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
allow you to see what's going on in the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.920 
allow you to see what's going on in the
bottom<00:05:43.430> you'll<00:05:43.820> be<00:05:43.940> able<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.180> see<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.390> holes

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
bottom you'll be able to see the holes

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.840 
bottom you'll be able to see the holes
in<00:05:45.140> the<00:05:45.200> Grizzly<00:05:45.530> plate<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.340> you'll<00:05:46.520> also<00:05:46.700> be

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
in the Grizzly plate and you'll also be

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.240 
in the Grizzly plate and you'll also be
able<00:05:46.970> to<00:05:47.090> see<00:05:47.300> when<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.660> top<00:05:48.050> teeth<00:05:48.350> mesh

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
able to see when the top teeth mesh

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.010 
able to see when the top teeth mesh
through<00:05:49.640> between<00:05:49.850> the<00:05:50.150> bottom<00:05:50.419> teeth<00:05:50.630> that'll

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
through between the bottom teeth that'll

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.180 
through between the bottom teeth that'll
indicate<00:05:51.350> to<00:05:51.440> you<00:05:51.500> that<00:05:51.650> your<00:05:51.830> cycle<00:05:52.100> is

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
indicate to you that your cycle is

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.680 
indicate to you that your cycle is
finished<00:05:52.220> go<00:05:52.729> ahead<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.060> grab<00:05:53.210> it<00:05:53.360> up<00:05:53.479> another

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
finished go ahead and grab it up another
