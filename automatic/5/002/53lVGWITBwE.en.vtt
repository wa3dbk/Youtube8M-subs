time I got lights
I<00:00:10.050> didn't<00:00:10.500> replace<00:00:10.830> them<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.490> LEDs<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.240> I

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
I didn't replace them with LEDs and I

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.259 
I didn't replace them with LEDs and I
just<00:00:12.509> got<00:00:12.630> regular<00:00:13.230> red<00:00:13.410> ones<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.969> I<00:00:14.969> wasn't

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
just got regular red ones and I wasn't

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.830 
just got regular red ones and I wasn't
really<00:00:15.450> satisfied<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> performance<00:00:16.520> so

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
really satisfied with the performance so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.710 
really satisfied with the performance so
picked<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.199> LEDs<00:00:22.430> running<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.119> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
picked up some LEDs running all right so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.250 
picked up some LEDs running all right so
you<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:24.840> started<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.380> popular<00:00:27.830> this<00:00:28.830> off<00:00:30.260> all

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
you just started by popular this off all

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.330 
you just started by popular this off all
right<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.750> pop<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.020> off<00:00:34.280> it's<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
right you just pop that off it's the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.530 
right you just pop that off it's the
first<00:00:35.610> thing<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.910> well<00:00:36.059> let<00:00:36.180> me<00:00:36.210> turn<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
first thing to do well let me turn that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.530 
first thing to do well let me turn that
off<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.610> then<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.879> these<00:00:39.030> little

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
off and then they have these little

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.090 
off and then they have these little
things<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.110> pull<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.680> bulbs

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
things here you just pull out the bulbs

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
things here you just pull out the bulbs
right<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:44.480> see<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> probably<00:00:45.899> should've<00:00:46.200> got

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
right there see I probably should've got

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
right there see I probably should've got
LEDs<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> mean<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.520> were<00:00:47.579> four<00:00:47.789> dollars

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
LEDs but I mean there were four dollars

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.330 
LEDs but I mean there were four dollars
so<00:00:48.420> they're<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> bad<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
so they're not that bad you can just

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.360 
so they're not that bad you can just
pull<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.670> bulbs<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.160> pull<00:00:56.340> out

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
pull out the bulbs so you just pull out

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.240 
pull out the bulbs so you just pull out
the<00:00:56.489> balls<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.800> let<00:00:58.800> me<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.070> how

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the balls just like that let me see how

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.439 
the balls just like that let me see how
these<00:00:59.399> how<00:00:59.850> much<00:01:00.030> brighter

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
these how much brighter

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
these how much brighter
oh<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> mean<00:01:00.690> give<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> demo<00:01:04.400> I'll<00:01:05.400> pop

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
oh you mean give you a demo I'll pop

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.399 
oh you mean give you a demo I'll pop
them<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:09.360> LEDs<00:01:09.750> barely<00:01:10.140> wanted

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
them back in now the LEDs barely wanted

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.490 
them back in now the LEDs barely wanted
to<00:01:10.500> finish<00:01:10.710> theirs

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to finish theirs

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.520 
to finish theirs
all<00:01:13.500> right

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.440 

I<00:01:18.650> see<00:01:19.340> how<00:01:19.400> much<00:01:19.549> different<00:01:19.970> difference<00:01:20.270> that

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
I see how much different difference that

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:31.560 
I see how much different difference that
really<00:01:20.690> is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.550 

I<00:01:31.950> guess<00:01:32.950> there's<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.460> difference<00:01:33.910> but<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.560> guess

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
I guess there's a difference but I guess

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.770 
I guess there's a difference but I guess
I'll<00:01:35.770> find<00:01:36.010> out<00:01:36.190> tonight<00:01:36.250> after<00:01:39.510> this<00:01:40.510> either

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
I'll find out tonight after this either

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:51.810 
I'll find out tonight after this either
with<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.530> real<00:01:41.680> difference<00:01:42.100> is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.740 

see<00:01:52.820> what<00:01:53.570> they<00:01:53.690> look<00:01:53.870> like

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
just pop it in there it's clearly at

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.450

other regular red bulbs and then I try
to<00:03:10.890> get<00:03:11.040> LEDs<00:03:11.580> for<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.780> mirrors<00:03:13.110> right<00:03:13.260> here

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
to get LEDs for the mirrors right here

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.280 
to get LEDs for the mirrors right here
but<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.420> wasn't<00:03:15.660> gonna<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:15.989> right<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.140> was
