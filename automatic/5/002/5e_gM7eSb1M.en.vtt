00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
guys to do today is shoulder

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.419 
guys to do today is shoulder
stabilization<00:00:09.800> exercises<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:11.400> the

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
stabilization exercises with the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.249 
stabilization exercises with the
medicine<00:00:11.910> ball<00:00:11.940> all<00:00:12.420> right<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:12.960> basically

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
medicine ball all right now basically

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.810 
medicine ball all right now basically
what<00:00:13.590> that's<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> do<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.309> strengthen<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
what that's going to do is strengthen a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.890 
what that's going to do is strengthen a
lot<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.059> these<00:00:15.179> little<00:00:15.420> rotator<00:00:15.809> muscles

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
lot of these little rotator muscles

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.109 
lot of these little rotator muscles
inside<00:00:16.650> our<00:00:16.890> shoulder<00:00:17.279> which<00:00:17.609> people<00:00:17.910> damage

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
inside our shoulder which people damage

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.210 
inside our shoulder which people damage
so<00:00:18.449> often<00:00:18.840> now<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> exactly<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:20.130> it's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
so often now this is exactly what it's

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.590 
so often now this is exactly what it's
going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> look<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.060> ball<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
going to look like the ball is going to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240 
going to look like the ball is going to
go<00:00:21.720> against<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> wall<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.740> we're<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
go against the wall and we're going to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.310 
go against the wall and we're going to
make<00:00:23.430> circles<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.269> our<00:00:24.480> arms<00:00:24.810> straight<00:00:24.930> out

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
make circles with our arms straight out

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500 
make circles with our arms straight out
putting<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> stress<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.699> our<00:00:26.760> rotator<00:00:27.269> cuff

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
putting the stress on our rotator cuff

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.880 
putting the stress on our rotator cuff
now<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> move<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> ball<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
now we're going to move the ball to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.500 
now we're going to move the ball to
different<00:00:29.460> positions<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> wall

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
different positions on the wall

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.959 
different positions on the wall
basically<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.740> get<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> different<00:00:32.550> effect<00:00:32.820> in

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
basically to get a different effect in

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.130 
basically to get a different effect in
each<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.660> rotator<00:00:34.050> muscles

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
each one of these little rotator muscles

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
each one of these little rotator muscles
ok<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.190> let<00:00:35.430> me<00:00:35.489> show<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> going

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
ok so let me show you how this is going

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.459 
ok so let me show you how this is going
to<00:00:36.149> work<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to work the first one we're going to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.610 
to work the first one we're going to
have<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> ball<00:00:37.860> straight<00:00:38.550> ahead<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.879> us<00:00:38.969> now

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
have the ball straight ahead of us now

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
have the ball straight ahead of us now
we're<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.920> our<00:00:41.040> arms<00:00:41.070> straight

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
we're going to have our arms straight

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
we're going to have our arms straight
and<00:00:41.820> lean<00:00:42.450> forward<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.020> little<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.469> into<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and lean forward a little bit into the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.350 
and lean forward a little bit into the
ball<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.520> way<00:00:44.730> we're<00:00:44.910> putting<00:00:45.180> some

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
ball that way we're putting some

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.299 
ball that way we're putting some
pressure<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.200> using<00:00:46.440> our<00:00:46.739> shoulders

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
pressure and we're using our shoulders

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
pressure and we're using our shoulders
to<00:00:47.700> withstand<00:00:47.969> our<00:00:48.360> body<00:00:48.600> weight<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.110> we're

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
to withstand our body weight all we're

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.650 
to withstand our body weight all we're
going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.160> small<00:00:50.789> circles

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.020 

now<00:00:59.230> that's<00:00:59.500> one<00:00:59.860> version<00:01:00.310> the<00:01:00.640> second

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
now that's one version the second

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.710 
now that's one version the second
version<00:01:01.060> now<00:01:01.540> we'll<00:01:02.880> now<00:01:03.880> that's<00:01:04.059> one<00:01:04.330> version

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720

be across me and I'm still going to lean
on<00:01:12.040> it<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.310> make<00:01:12.460> circles<00:01:16.770> alright<00:01:17.770> now<00:01:18.340> we're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
on it and make circles alright now we're

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.010 
on it and make circles alright now we're
going<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.760> do<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.090> same<00:01:19.330> thing<00:01:19.600> out<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.930> the

going to do the same thing out to the
side<00:01:20.230> a<00:01:20.260> little<00:01:20.500> bit<00:01:20.620> we're<00:01:21.190> going<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.370> roll

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
side a little bit we're going to roll

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.400 
side a little bit we're going to roll
the<00:01:21.670> ball<00:01:21.700> outside<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.600> midline<00:01:22.900> of<00:01:23.050> my<00:01:23.170> body

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
the ball outside the midline of my body

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.920 
the ball outside the midline of my body
now<00:01:24.280> we're<00:01:24.490> here<00:01:25.290> more<00:01:26.290> circles<00:01:26.710> as<00:01:26.830> well<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
now we're here more circles as well and

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.690 
now we're here more circles as well and
we're<00:01:29.560> going<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.740> repeat<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.010> same<00:01:30.190> thing

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
we're going to repeat that same thing

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.320 
we're going to repeat that same thing
above<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:32.729> below<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.880> making

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
above and below now that is making

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.719 
above and below now that is making
circles<00:01:37.840> shoulder<00:01:38.440> stabilization<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:39.460> next

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
circles shoulder stabilization the next

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.920 
circles shoulder stabilization the next
one<00:01:39.850> we're<00:01:39.940> going<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.090> go<00:01:40.240> through<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.630> going
