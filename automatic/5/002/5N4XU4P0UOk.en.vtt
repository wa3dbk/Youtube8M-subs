Welcome, I'm Richard Shrake from Sun River
Oregon, the originator of Resistance Free

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.520
training and riding. I'm right here with myhorseuniversity.com
and we're going to give you some training

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.200
tips on working with your horse. One of the
things we do know about horses is that when they're

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.230
relaxed - and their neurons in their brain
are connected to those nerve endings - we

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.930
have an animal that is not only in what we
call a "green zone" but he's an animal that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.640
can retain training. So, we have all of our
students take the time to release what we

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.399
call "beta endorphins" which are a natural
tranquilizer on the horse. Before they actually

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.520
ever go saddle them up and really work with
them. So, one of the things we do know is if you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.649
just take your hand - and you'll notice my
thumb here is kind of like a turkey drumstick

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:12.030
- and if I take it and I just rub underneath
the eye of the horse and very slowly just

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.320
rub the eye quietly in a rhytmic way, not
only will that release the endorphin but

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.430
then I can take my hand and go right above
the eye. And that's an area right there that

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.060
that natural tranquilizer, as it works and
it's released, puts that horse into that wonderful

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.930
quiet soft zone. Another place that really
helps relax that horse and release that natural

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.750
tranquilizer is right here in their cheeks.
Rub both hands very quietly - notice he blinks

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.430
his eye and starts to give me a little ear
here - he says "I'm a little fussy but I'll

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.909
just slowly start that relaxation" and then I wait
for the head to drop like that and the next

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.790
thing you know, this horse is into that green
zone which means he's very, very, very, very trainable.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.530
The other place that I like to go to is - if
you get the time - is go right here at the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.629
poll. And as you gently rub both sides with
your hands, this horse will start to soften.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.299
See him start to just lick and chew and drop
that head very quietly. Any time your horse

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.329
is relaxed in a green zone, he's trainable
and I just like to say thanks for giving me

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:37.559
the time to share with you a couple training
tips on Resistance Free training and I hope

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:43.919
that you'll try them because I know they work.
Thank you for watching myhorseuniversity.com.
