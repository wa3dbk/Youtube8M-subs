10 15 20 30 years there's also gonna be

abomination scar she-hulk dr. Samson and
who<00:01:15.180> else<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.960> pretty<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
who else I think that's pretty much it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.760 
who else I think that's pretty much it
from<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.670> we've<00:01:17.820> seen<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.270> far<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.020> maybe<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
from what we've seen so far and maybe a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.570 
from what we've seen so far and maybe a
couple<00:01:20.009> other<00:01:20.130> characters<00:01:20.640> too<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
couple other characters too and but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
couple other characters too and but
pretty<00:01:23.909> much<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.420> looks<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
pretty much it looks like what it's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.390 
pretty much it looks like what it's
going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.580> Hulk<00:01:27.350> cartoon<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.920> sort

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
going to be is a Hulk cartoon that sort

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.330 
going to be is a Hulk cartoon that sort
of<00:01:29.689> modern<00:01:30.689> based<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> comic<00:01:31.979> book<00:01:32.130> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
of modern based and in the comic book so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
of modern based and in the comic book so
in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.820> modern<00:01:33.210> continuity<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.009> last

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
in the modern continuity of the last

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
in the modern continuity of the last
maybe<00:01:35.520> five<00:01:36.000> six<00:01:36.479> years<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.960> it'll<00:01:37.079> probably

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
maybe five six years so it'll probably

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310 
maybe five six years so it'll probably
include<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> stuff<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.200> know

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
include a lot of the stuff that you know

include a lot of the stuff that you know
is<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> Hall

complex<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.299> cool<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:43.170> think

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
complex which is really cool I think

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469

it's<00:01:43.770> been<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> while<00:01:44.430> since<00:01:44.790> we've<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.299> had

obviously<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.319> Incredible<00:02:26.680> Hulk<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.980> a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
obviously the Incredible Hulk is a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.310 
obviously the Incredible Hulk is a
really<00:02:27.340> fun<00:02:27.850> character<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.540> think<00:02:28.810> probably

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
really fun character I think probably

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.930 
really fun character I think probably
the<00:02:29.560> reason<00:02:29.830> why<00:02:29.920> they<00:02:30.010> decide<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.430> do<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.700> is

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the reason why they decide to do this is

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.970 
the reason why they decide to do this is
just<00:02:31.180> based<00:02:31.570> on<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> popularity<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
just based on the popularity of the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.310 
just based on the popularity of the
Avengers<00:02:33.370> movie<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.720> course<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.200> know

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
Avengers movie and of course you know

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.380 
Avengers movie and of course you know
Hulk<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.160> movie<00:02:36.490> kind<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.970> steals<00:02:37.209> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
Hulk in that movie kind of steals the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.060 
Hulk in that movie kind of steals the
show<00:02:37.420> at<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.870> end<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.200> mean<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:38.860> completely

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
show at the end I mean not completely

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.860 
show at the end I mean not completely
like<00:02:39.700> they<00:02:39.790> all<00:02:39.910> get<00:02:40.120> their<00:02:40.270> chance<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.720> could

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
like they all get their chance you could

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.240 
like they all get their chance you could
you<00:02:41.020> could<00:02:41.170> argue<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.470> same<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.830> Iron<00:02:41.950> Man

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
you could argue the same for Iron Man

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.699 
you could argue the same for Iron Man
where<00:02:42.489> he<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.239> know<00:02:43.530> spoilers<00:02:44.530> for<00:02:44.620> anyone

the movie now
Iron<00:02:49.120> Man<00:02:49.390> where<00:02:49.630> he<00:02:49.840> sort<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.680> takes<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
Iron Man where he sort of takes the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.610 
Iron Man where he sort of takes the
missile<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.790> or<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.420> yeah<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> nuke<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.350> and

missile and or the yeah the nuke and and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.690 
missile and or the yeah the nuke and and
you<00:02:53.950> know<00:02:54.070> forces<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:54.970> up<00:02:55.120> through<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
you know forces it up through the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.360 
you know forces it up through the
wormhole<00:02:57.700> or<00:02:58.000> whatever<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.630> speak<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.950> you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
wormhole or whatever so to speak but you

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.710 
wormhole or whatever so to speak but you
know<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.610> Hulk<00:03:00.730> got<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.970> lot<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.239> really<00:03:01.480> cool

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
know the Hulk got a lot of really cool

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.630 
know the Hulk got a lot of really cool
moments<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.500> Avengers<00:03:02.890> movie<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.400> think

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
moments in the Avengers movie so I think

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.550 
moments in the Avengers movie so I think
it<00:03:03.730> makes<00:03:03.880> sense<00:03:04.000> they're<00:03:04.300> gonna<00:03:04.420> try<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.660> do<00:03:04.900> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
it makes sense they're gonna try to do a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.259 
it makes sense they're gonna try to do a
cartoon<00:03:06.190> show<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.730> never<00:03:06.880> get<00:03:07.090> enough

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
cartoon show and you never get enough

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.300 
cartoon show and you never get enough
good<00:03:07.660> Marvel<00:03:08.080> cartoons<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.830> can<00:03:08.980> never<00:03:09.130> get

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
good Marvel cartoons you can never get

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.280 
good Marvel cartoons you can never get
enough<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.600> sounds<00:03:10.870> like<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.140> they're

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
enough so it sounds like it they're

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.540 
enough so it sounds like it they're
probably<00:03:11.440> gonna<00:03:11.620> put<00:03:11.800> as<00:03:11.980> part<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.280> block

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
probably gonna put as part of a block

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.009 
probably gonna put as part of a block
with<00:03:12.820> ultimate<00:03:13.810> spider-man<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.600> New

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
with ultimate spider-man and the New

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.590 
with ultimate spider-man and the New
Avengers<00:03:17.260> Assemble<00:03:17.560> cartoon<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.579> being<00:03:19.450> is

so I'm sure the series will be a lot of
fun

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
fun

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.009 
fun
how<00:03:50.829> long<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.130> lasts<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:51.760> don't<00:03:52.420> know<00:03:52.540> I'd

how long it lasts for I don't know I'd
be<00:03:53.230> surprised<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.890> lasts<00:03:54.100> longer<00:03:54.400> than<00:03:54.640> two

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
be surprised if it lasts longer than two

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.960 
be surprised if it lasts longer than two
seasons<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:57.010> might<00:03:57.190> not<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.370> might<00:03:57.730> only<00:03:57.850> last

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
seasons it might not it might only last

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.150 
seasons it might not it might only last
one<00:03:58.450> season<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.620> know<00:03:59.650> it's<00:03:59.860> hard<00:04:00.040> to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
one season but it you know it's hard to

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.650 
one season but it you know it's hard to
say<00:04:00.310> because<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.790> popular<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.209> Avengers

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
say because the popular the Avengers

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.970 
say because the popular the Avengers
right<00:04:01.840> now<00:04:01.959> is<00:04:02.110> crazy<00:04:02.320> with<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.709> movie

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
right now is crazy with the movie

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.979 
right now is crazy with the movie
there's<00:04:03.700> it's<00:04:03.970> going<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.239> be<00:04:04.329> part<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.750> block

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
there's it's going to be part of a block

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.170 
there's it's going to be part of a block
so<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:05.320> not<00:04:05.410> going<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.680> be<00:04:05.829> by<00:04:06.010> itself<00:04:06.180> it'll

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
so it's not going to be by itself it'll

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.330 
so it's not going to be by itself it'll
be<00:04:07.299> part<00:04:07.630> of<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.780> cartoon<00:04:08.140> block<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:09.220> know

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
be part of a cartoon block so you know

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.590 
be part of a cartoon block so you know
most<00:04:09.459> people<00:04:09.670> don't<00:04:09.790> want<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.090> see<00:04:10.239> The

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
most people don't want to see The

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.259 
most people don't want to see The
Avengers<00:04:10.769> if<00:04:11.769> this<00:04:11.980> is<00:04:12.160> just<00:04:12.400> before<00:04:12.549> Avengers

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
Avengers if this is just before Avengers

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.210 
Avengers if this is just before Avengers
or<00:04:13.900> just<00:04:14.260> for<00:04:14.410> spider-man<00:04:14.859> or<00:04:14.950> whatever

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
or just for spider-man or whatever

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.890 
or just for spider-man or whatever
people<00:04:15.970> will<00:04:16.180> probably<00:04:16.359> tune<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.840> watch

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
people will probably tune in and watch

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.259 
people will probably tune in and watch
all<00:04:17.260> three<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.650> them<00:04:17.829> you<00:04:18.010> know<00:04:18.220> when<00:04:18.880> they<00:04:19.060> air

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
all three of them you know when they air

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.029 
all three of them you know when they air
so<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.900> think<00:04:20.289> it's<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.440> good<00:04:20.530> idea<00:04:20.769> they<00:04:20.859> can<00:04:20.919> be

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
so I think it's a good idea they can be

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.920 
so I think it's a good idea they can be
a<00:04:21.070> lot<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.250> fun<00:04:21.489> see<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.849> show<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.330> I'm

know<00:04:34.599> creating<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.650> cartoons<00:04:36.069> but<00:04:36.250> making

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
know creating the cartoons but making

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.939 
know creating the cartoons but making
them<00:04:36.849> more<00:04:37.060> current<00:04:37.479> so<00:04:37.720> bringing<00:04:38.530> in<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.770> lot

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
them more current so bringing in a lot

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.170 
them more current so bringing in a lot
of<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.069> stuff<00:04:39.310> that's<00:04:39.400> happened<00:04:39.909> in<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.090> last

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
of the stuff that's happened in the last

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.420 
of the stuff that's happened in the last
five<00:04:40.479> six<00:04:40.870> seven<00:04:41.229> years<00:04:41.259> I<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:42.250> that

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
five six seven years I think that that

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.040 
five six seven years I think that that
could<00:04:42.639> really<00:04:42.849> make<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.330> cartoon<00:04:43.750> series

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
could really make the cartoon series

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.510 
could really make the cartoon series
that<00:04:44.379> are<00:04:44.470> going<00:04:44.590> on<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.800> lot<00:04:44.949> better<00:04:45.220> if<00:04:45.370> they

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
that are going on a lot better if they

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.969 
that are going on a lot better if they
you<00:04:46.090> know<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.960> know<00:04:47.080> stay<00:04:47.289> closer<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.770> what's
