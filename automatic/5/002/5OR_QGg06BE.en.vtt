okay this is the 89 power squat racks

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.769 
okay this is the 89 power squat racks
from<00:00:05.550> valor<00:00:05.790> Fitness<00:00:06.240> let<00:00:06.510> me<00:00:06.569> get<00:00:06.689> these

from valor Fitness let me get these

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.740 
from valor Fitness let me get these
features<00:00:07.170> benefits<00:00:07.439> of<00:00:07.859> these<00:00:07.979> racks<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:09.570> made

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
features benefits of these racks we made

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.810 
features benefits of these racks we made
the<00:00:09.870> mainframe<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.410> me<00:00:10.559> bit<00:00:10.740> taller<00:00:11.129> than<00:00:11.549> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
the mainframe you me bit taller than the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.970 
the mainframe you me bit taller than the
bd8<00:00:12.150> for<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.450> reason<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:13.499> have<00:00:13.620> some<00:00:13.799> phone

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
bd8 for the reason of we have some phone

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.310 
bd8 for the reason of we have some phone
calls<00:00:14.190> from<00:00:14.549> larger<00:00:15.329> people<00:00:15.509> maybe<00:00:15.809> six<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.289> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
calls from larger people maybe six for a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.700 
calls from larger people maybe six for a
taller

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
taller

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.830 
taller
they<00:00:17.460> were<00:00:17.520> also<00:00:17.760> squatting<00:00:18.360> heavier<00:00:18.600> weights

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
they were also squatting heavier weights

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.800 
they were also squatting heavier weights
so<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.470> made<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> frame<00:00:20.040> taller<00:00:20.540> for<00:00:21.540> most

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
so we made the frame taller for most

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.320 
so we made the frame taller for most
ability<00:00:22.050> more<00:00:22.770> safety<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.520> also<00:00:23.970> made<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
ability more safety it also made the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
ability more safety it also made the
shaft<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.990> goes<00:00:25.140> inside<00:00:25.530> the<00:00:25.710> mainframe<00:00:26.100> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
shaft that goes inside the mainframe a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.340 
shaft that goes inside the mainframe a
little<00:00:26.430> bit<00:00:26.550> longer<00:00:26.760> first<00:00:27.480> ability<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
little bit longer first ability and

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.290 
little bit longer first ability and
support<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.830> well<00:00:28.980> if<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.850> go<00:00:29.910> back<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> your

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
support as well if you go back to your

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.730 
support as well if you go back to your
math<00:00:30.510> days<00:00:30.780> and<00:00:31.140> high<00:00:31.230> school<00:00:31.500> physics

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
math days and high school physics

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.139 
math days and high school physics
understand<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> longer<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
understand that the longer the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.509 
understand that the longer the
telescopic<00:00:33.660> range<00:00:34.140> inside<00:00:34.769> the<00:00:34.949> main<00:00:35.100> tubing

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
telescopic range inside the main tubing

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.239 
telescopic range inside the main tubing
the<00:00:36.210> more<00:00:36.359> supports<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.199> so<00:00:38.129> we

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
the more supports going to have so we

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.160 
the more supports going to have so we
not<00:00:38.579> only<00:00:38.609> do<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> raise<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.449> mainframe

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
not only do to raise the mainframe

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.459 
not only do to raise the mainframe
we<00:00:41.100> took<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.879> slider<00:00:42.179> shaft<00:00:42.539> and<00:00:42.870> made<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we took the the slider shaft and made it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.029 
we took the the slider shaft and made it
a<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.649> bit<00:00:43.829> longer<00:00:44.039> quite<00:00:44.999> a<00:00:45.089> bit<00:00:45.210> longer

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
a little bit longer quite a bit longer

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.069 
a little bit longer quite a bit longer
so<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.159> I<00:00:47.280> were<00:00:47.399> doing<00:00:47.519> squats<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.420> 5<00:00:48.659> foot<00:00:48.839> 10

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
so if I were doing squats I'm 5 foot 10

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.169 
so if I were doing squats I'm 5 foot 10
let's<00:00:49.800> say<00:00:49.949> I'd<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.550> height<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:50.819> in

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
let's say I'd be in this height right in

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.389 
let's say I'd be in this height right in
here<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.319> see<00:00:52.409> the<00:00:52.499> distance<00:00:52.890> left<00:00:53.069> over

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
here you can see the distance left over

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.130 
here you can see the distance left over
for<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.729> travel<00:00:54.179> and<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.839> there<00:00:55.019> in<00:00:55.109> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
for the travel and it's there in the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
for the travel and it's there in the
6-foot<00:00:55.620> range<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.249> here<00:00:56.519> still<00:00:57.179> more

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
6-foot range up to here still more

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.809 
6-foot range up to here still more
distance<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.960> far<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.409> the<00:00:58.469> mainframe<00:00:58.819> so

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
distance as far as in the mainframe so

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.049 
distance as far as in the mainframe so
those<00:00:59.969> individuals<00:01:00.449> want<00:01:01.139> to<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.289> bench<00:01:01.530> press

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
those individuals want to do bench press

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.109 
those individuals want to do bench press
squat<00:01:03.059> racks<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:04.589> added<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> second<00:01:05.309> slider<00:01:05.579> up

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
squat racks we added a second slider up

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
squat racks we added a second slider up
top<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.350> adjust<00:01:07.469> it<00:01:08.430> has<00:01:08.579> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
top which also can adjust it has a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
top which also can adjust it has a
v-notch<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> Olympic<00:01:10.049> bar<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
v-notch for the Olympic bar to do the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
v-notch for the Olympic bar to do the
bench<00:01:11.340> press

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
bench press

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.539 
bench press
we've<00:01:12.450> still<00:01:12.659> kept<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.560> safety<00:01:14.040> spot<00:01:14.250> down

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
we've still kept the safety spot down

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
we've still kept the safety spot down
here<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> raise<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
here and you want to raise this up to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
here and you want to raise this up to
find<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.219> level<00:01:17.490> around<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:18.000> chest<00:01:18.270> area

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
find that level around your chest area

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
find that level around your chest area
so<00:01:18.899> if<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.110> can't<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> bench<00:01:19.680> press<00:01:19.829> all

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so if you can't get the bench press all

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:20.690 
so if you can't get the bench press all
the<00:01:20.250> way<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.430> up

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the way back up

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.359 
the way back up
you've<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.570> safety<00:01:21.960> support<00:01:22.289> here<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you've got safety support here the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.550 
you've got safety support here the
popper<00:01:23.700> pins<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> side<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:25.229> moved<00:01:25.439> around

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
popper pins on the side we moved around

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.859 
popper pins on the side we moved around
to<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> back<00:01:26.219> for<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.579> reason<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.969> if<00:01:27.659> we're

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to the back for the reason of if we're

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.139 
to the back for the reason of if we're
up<00:01:27.990> too<00:01:28.170> high<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:29.189> might<00:01:29.399> be<00:01:29.520> sheared<00:01:29.820> off<00:01:29.939> by

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
up too high they might be sheared off by

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.209 
up too high they might be sheared off by
the<00:01:30.210> plates<00:01:30.630> coming<00:01:31.320> down<00:01:31.439> close<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> rack

the plates coming down close to the rack

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.300 
the plates coming down close to the rack
also<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.240> hands<00:01:33.719> won't<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.530> caught<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
also your hands won't get caught in the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.910 
also your hands won't get caught in the
the<00:01:35.640> pins<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> side<00:01:36.380> down<00:01:37.380> below<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.799> have

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the pins on the side down below we have

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.660 
the pins on the side down below we have
a<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.520> call<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.789> a<00:01:38.850> plate<00:01:39.149> storage<00:01:39.740> peg<00:01:40.740> yes<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
a we call it a plate storage peg yes it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.700 
a we call it a plate storage peg yes it
holds<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> plates<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.479> storage<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> was
