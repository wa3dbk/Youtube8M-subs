00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
I mean there's no reason to i guess i

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.710 
I mean there's no reason to i guess i
can<00:05:28.680> heal<00:05:28.920> this<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.880> adds<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.210> damage

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
can heal this and that adds to damage

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.000 
can heal this and that adds to damage
but<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.750> death<00:05:33.990> Road<00:05:34.200> out<00:05:34.350> but<00:05:34.560> just<00:05:34.680> taunt

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
but the death Road out but just taunt

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.220 
but the death Road out but just taunt
but<00:05:35.310> that's<00:05:35.610> also<00:05:35.790> kind<00:05:36.330> of<00:05:36.390> pointless<00:05:36.750> so<00:05:37.200> I

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
but that's also kind of pointless so I

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.610 
but that's also kind of pointless so I
think<00:05:37.320> rather<00:05:37.620> just<00:05:38.430> feeling<00:05:41.960> my<00:05:42.960> fate<00:05:43.410> is

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
think rather just feeling my fate is

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.520 
think rather just feeling my fate is
sealed<00:05:43.920> oh<00:05:46.190> my<00:05:47.190> fate<00:05:47.640> is<00:05:47.880> see<00:05:48.120> why<00:05:48.300> not<00:05:48.480> I<00:05:48.900> see

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
sealed oh my fate is see why not I see

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.240 
sealed oh my fate is see why not I see
where<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.770> health<00:05:49.980> goes<00:05:52.070> can<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.130> believe

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
where that health goes can you believe

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.090 
where that health goes can you believe
it<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:54.900> could<00:05:55.200> have<00:05:55.290> actually<00:05:55.440> had<00:05:55.680> lethal

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
it so I could have actually had lethal

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.240 
it so I could have actually had lethal
here<00:05:56.370> if<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:57.150> hadn't<00:05:57.630> played<00:05:57.780> villain<00:05:58.200> then<00:05:58.860> I

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
here if I hadn't played villain then I

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.530 
here if I hadn't played villain then I
could<00:05:59.520> have<00:05:59.610> attacked<00:05:59.820> with<00:06:00.030> us<00:06:00.180> but<00:06:00.330> that<00:06:00.420> was

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
could have attacked with us but that was

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.030 
could have attacked with us but that was
just<00:06:00.570> basically<00:06:01.440> luck<00:06:02.040> i<00:06:02.930> 100%<00:06:03.930> luck<00:06:04.320> if<00:06:04.560> the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
just basically luck i 100% luck if the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.980 
just basically luck i 100% luck if the
