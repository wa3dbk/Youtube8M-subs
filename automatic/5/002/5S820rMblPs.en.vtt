rifles<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.460> wasn't<00:00:26.609> seeing<00:00:26.730> any<00:00:27.029> gameplay

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
rifles I just wasn't seeing any gameplay

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.060 
rifles I just wasn't seeing any gameplay
from<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
from it and when I actually got on the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
from it and when I actually got on the
game<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> tried<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> m16<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.900> tried<00:00:31.140> out

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
game and tried out the m16 and tried out

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.840 
game and tried out the m16 and tried out
a<00:00:31.289> lot<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> other<00:00:31.769> weapons<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.399> quickly

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
a lot of the other weapons I quickly

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.120 
a lot of the other weapons I quickly
realized<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> m16<00:00:34.290> wouldn't<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.860> as

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
realized that the m16 wouldn't be as

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.030 
realized that the m16 wouldn't be as
easy<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:36.300> use<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> game<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.890> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
easy to use in this game as it was in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.369 
easy to use in this game as it was in
other<00:00:38.160> games<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.149> know<00:00:39.379> typically

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
other games it can you know typically

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.619 
other games it can you know typically
take<00:00:40.860> more<00:00:41.190> than<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.550> burst<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.090> kill<00:00:42.300> people

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
take more than one burst to kill people

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.709 
take more than one burst to kill people
so<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.280> I've<00:00:44.640> been<00:00:44.670> hesitant<00:00:45.300> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
so because of that I've been hesitant in

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.049 
so because of that I've been hesitant in
using<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.649> found<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:47.789> liked

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
using it but I found that I really liked

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
using it but I found that I really liked
to<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.450> m16<00:00:49.110> especially<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> class

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to use the m16 especially with a class

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.560 
to use the m16 especially with a class
setup<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.700> I'm<00:00:50.820> rolling<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.390> now

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
setup that I'm rolling with right now

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200 
setup that I'm rolling with right now
which<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.309> hardline<00:00:53.309> sleight<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> hand<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
which is hardline sleight of hand and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
which is hardline sleight of hand and
ninja<00:00:54.660> since<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.680> roll<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.370> high

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
ninja since I roll with really high

ninja since I roll with really high
killstreaks<00:00:57.059> hardline<00:00:58.020> comes<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.469> handy

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
killstreaks hardline comes in handy

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.490 
killstreaks hardline comes in handy
because<00:00:58.980> honestly<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.780> difference<00:01:01.109> between

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
because honestly the difference between

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.189 
because honestly the difference between
you<00:01:01.800> know<00:01:01.879> first<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.300> three<00:01:03.690> kill<00:01:03.930> spy

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you know first of all a three kill spy

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.219 
you know first of all a three kill spy
plane<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> kill<00:01:05.220> spy<00:01:05.460> plane<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.570> really

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
plane and a to kill spy plane is really

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
plane and a to kill spy plane is really
good<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.310> sometimes<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.909> get

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
good because you know sometimes you get

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.240 
good because you know sometimes you get
those<00:01:09.180> bad<00:01:09.479> lives<00:01:09.780> where<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.770> start<00:01:11.130> off

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
those bad lives where you know start off

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
those bad lives where you know start off
not<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.729> great<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.439> you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.770> kill

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
not so great and you know one kill

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.050 
not so great and you know one kill
obviously<00:01:14.430> makes<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> huge<00:01:15.030> difference

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
obviously makes a huge difference

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.580 
obviously makes a huge difference
because<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.720> soon<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> spy

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because as soon as you get that spy

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.380 
because as soon as you get that spy
plane<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> air<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.270> those

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
plane up in the air you really get those

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510 
plane up in the air you really get those
kills<00:01:18.720> rolling<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> goes<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.400> know

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
kills rolling and that goes you know

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
kills rolling and that goes you know
double<00:01:20.850> time<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.049> game<00:01:22.200> type

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
about when I have been playing I've been

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.050 
about when I have been playing I've been
using<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.509> high<00:01:30.689> kill<00:01:30.930> streaks<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
using really high kill streaks and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
using really high kill streaks and
typically<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> roll<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> UAV<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
typically I roll with the UAV in the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.499 
typically I roll with the UAV in the
Blackbird<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.520> first<00:01:35.759> two<00:01:35.970> kill<00:01:36.210> streaks

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and my third kill streak is usually one

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.230 
and my third kill streak is usually one
of<00:01:39.450> either<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.470> chopper<00:01:40.799> gunner<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.220> dogs<00:01:41.790> or

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
of either the chopper gunner the dogs or

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
of either the chopper gunner the dogs or
the<00:01:42.299> gunship<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.619> those<00:01:43.740> three<00:01:44.159> I've

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the gunship and out of those three I've

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
the gunship and out of those three I've
decided<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.810> chopper<00:01:46.320> gunner<00:01:46.470> is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
decided that the chopper gunner is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.340 
decided that the chopper gunner is
probably<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.310> favorite<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.939> close<00:01:48.930> second

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
probably my favorite a close second

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.160 
probably my favorite a close second
being<00:01:49.560> gunship<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.759> finally<00:01:51.720> attack

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
being gunship and then finally attack

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.420 
being gunship and then finally attack
dogs<00:01:52.409> now<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> might<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.220> bit

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
dogs now that might be a little bit

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.020 
dogs now that might be a little bit
surprising

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
surprising

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020 
surprising
because<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.590> know<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.040> chopper<00:01:56.729> gunner<00:01:56.939> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because you know the chopper gunner is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
because you know the chopper gunner is
actually<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> nine<00:01:57.630> kill<00:01:57.840> streak<00:01:58.079> while<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
actually a nine kill streak while the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
actually a nine kill streak while the
other<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.070> kills<00:01:59.310> kill<00:01:59.880> streaks<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> attack

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
other two kills kill streaks the attack

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
other two kills kill streaks the attack
dogs<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> gunship<00:02:01.560> are<00:02:01.799> 11<00:02:02.189> kill<00:02:02.399> streaks

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
dogs on the gunship are 11 kill streaks

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.999 
dogs on the gunship are 11 kill streaks
the<00:02:03.630> fact<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> matter<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the fact of the matter is is the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
the fact of the matter is is the
controllability<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.149> being<00:02:06.329> able<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
controllability like being able to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.190 
controllability like being able to
control<00:02:07.020> where<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> helicopter<00:02:08.340> goes

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
control where the helicopter goes

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.570 
control where the helicopter goes
with<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:09.470> gunship<00:02:09.860> which<00:02:10.099> you'll<00:02:10.280> see<00:02:10.310> some

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
with the gunship which you'll see some

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.000 
with the gunship which you'll see some
gameplay<00:02:10.910> from<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> little<00:02:11.540> bit<00:02:11.720> um<00:02:12.010> that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
gameplay from and a little bit um that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.820 
gameplay from and a little bit um that
you<00:02:13.340> know<00:02:13.780> factor<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.440> one<00:02:15.620> more<00:02:15.770> thing

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
you know factor is just one more thing

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.710 
you know factor is just one more thing
to<00:02:16.099> think<00:02:16.520> about<00:02:16.610> when<00:02:16.910> playing<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.599> know

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
to think about when playing you know

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.100 
to think about when playing you know
when<00:02:17.989> using<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:19.180> gunship<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.930> kind

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
when using the gunship and it just kind

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.360 
when using the gunship and it just kind
of<00:02:21.140> makes<00:02:21.349> things<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.739> little<00:02:21.950> bit<00:02:22.069> more

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
of makes things a little bit more

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.490 
of makes things a little bit more
difficult<00:02:23.090> now<00:02:23.270> not<00:02:23.510> much<00:02:23.810> more<00:02:24.080> difficult

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
difficult now not much more difficult

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.320 
difficult now not much more difficult
don't<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:24.830> me<00:02:24.950> wrong<00:02:24.980> but<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.180> one

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
don't get me wrong but it just is one

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.059 
don't get me wrong but it just is one
more<00:02:26.480> thing<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.200> worry<00:02:27.230> about<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.980> I

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
more thing I have to worry about and I

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.890 
more thing I have to worry about and I
really<00:02:28.400> liked<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.910> chopper<00:02:29.150> gunner<00:02:29.390> has<00:02:29.630> you

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
really liked the chopper gunner has you

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.960 
really liked the chopper gunner has you
know<00:02:29.989> pretty<00:02:30.380> much<00:02:30.470> an<00:02:30.650> autopilot<00:02:31.100> on<00:02:31.400> or<00:02:31.940> just

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
know pretty much an autopilot on or just

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.449 
know pretty much an autopilot on or just
you<00:02:32.300> know<00:02:32.420> somebody<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:33.110> place<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.680> me<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
you know somebody in place of me as the

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.420 
you know somebody in place of me as the
pilot<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.930> controls<00:02:36.350> for<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:37.040> gunship

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
pilot so the controls for the gunship

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.530 
pilot so the controls for the gunship
because<00:02:37.670> I'm<00:02:37.760> sure<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> lot<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.209> people<00:02:38.420> are

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
because I'm sure a lot of people are

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.130 
because I'm sure a lot of people are
curious<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.950> very<00:02:40.430> very<00:02:41.150> easy<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.989> move

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
curious it's very very easy to move

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.320 
curious it's very very easy to move
around<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:42.950> not<00:02:43.130> difficult<00:02:43.370> whatsoever<00:02:44.120> it

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
around it is not difficult whatsoever it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.220 
around it is not difficult whatsoever it
is<00:02:44.720> not<00:02:44.930> anything<00:02:45.500> close<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.280> controls<00:02:46.670> of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
is not anything close to the controls of

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.479 
is not anything close to the controls of
let's<00:02:48.230> say<00:02:48.380> Battlefield<00:02:48.950> Bad<00:02:49.010> Company<00:02:49.130> 2

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
let's say Battlefield Bad Company 2

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.430 
let's say Battlefield Bad Company 2
where<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.540> control<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.200> and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
where you have to control the up and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.530 
where you have to control the up and
down<00:02:51.560> left<00:02:51.920> right<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.400> all<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.670> really<00:02:53.180> you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
down left right and all that really you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.270 
down left right and all that really you
just<00:02:53.780> use<00:02:53.959> your<00:02:53.989> analog<00:02:54.470> sticks<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.130> you

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
just use your analog sticks and you

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.210 
just use your analog sticks and you
maneuver<00:02:55.730> around<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:56.750> no<00:02:57.290> harder<00:02:58.010> than

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
maneuver around and it's no harder than

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.670 
maneuver around and it's no harder than
an<00:02:58.549> RC<00:02:58.970> car<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.450> control<00:02:59.750> around<00:03:00.049> really<00:03:00.260> and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
an RC car to control around really and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.820 
an RC car to control around really and
I'm<00:03:00.799> sure<00:03:01.030> by<00:03:02.030> now<00:03:02.060> you've<00:03:02.660> probably<00:03:02.810> all<00:03:03.170> had

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
I'm sure by now you've probably all had

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.920 
I'm sure by now you've probably all had
at<00:03:03.980> least<00:03:04.069> one<00:03:04.310> RC<00:03:04.700> car<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:05.299> really<00:03:05.660> not

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
at least one RC car so it's really not

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.020 
at least one RC car so it's really not
too<00:03:06.230> difficult<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:07.280> was<00:03:07.430> expecting<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
too difficult and I was expecting it to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.900 
too difficult and I was expecting it to
be<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.989> with<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.799> gunship<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:10.640> the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
be so with the gunship you have the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.670 
be so with the gunship you have the
option<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.600> shooting<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.989> minigun<00:03:12.319> which<00:03:12.560> I

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
option of shooting the minigun which I

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.949 
option of shooting the minigun which I
pretty<00:03:12.890> much<00:03:12.980> do<00:03:13.220> this<00:03:13.340> entire<00:03:13.760> game<00:03:14.060> or

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
pretty much do this entire game or

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.199 
pretty much do this entire game or
rockets<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.040> Rockets<00:03:16.459> replenish<00:03:17.060> you

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
rockets and the Rockets replenish you

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.509 
rockets and the Rockets replenish you
can't<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.660> shoot<00:03:17.810> all<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.230> them<00:03:18.380> at<00:03:18.470> once<00:03:18.709> I

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
can't just shoot all of them at once I

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.520 
can't just shoot all of them at once I
think<00:03:20.000> like<00:03:20.180> they<00:03:20.450> reload<00:03:20.930> there<00:03:21.320> we<00:03:21.410> go<00:03:21.500> I

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
think like they reload there we go I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.380 
think like they reload there we go I
just<00:03:21.739> shot<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.920> rocket<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.700> wasn't<00:03:23.299> shooting

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
just shot a rocket I wasn't shooting

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.420 
just shot a rocket I wasn't shooting
those<00:03:23.630> off<00:03:23.900> too<00:03:24.140> much<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.650> they<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:25.190> come<00:03:25.340> in

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
those off too much and they can come in

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.550 
those off too much and they can come in
handy<00:03:25.579> because<00:03:26.390> they<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> blast<00:03:27.320> radius

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
handy because they have a blast radius

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.220 
handy because they have a blast radius
whereas<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.220> minigun<00:03:28.670> is<00:03:29.060> gonna<00:03:29.780> be<00:03:29.900> actual

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
whereas the minigun is gonna be actual

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.990 
whereas the minigun is gonna be actual
bullets<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:30.709> if<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:30.950> see<00:03:31.130> somebody<00:03:31.519> in<00:03:31.579> an<00:03:31.880> ad

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
bullets so if you see somebody in an ad

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.910 
bullets so if you see somebody in an ad
doorway<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.989> can't<00:03:33.200> quite<00:03:33.380> get<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.680> them

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
doorway and you can't quite get to them

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.250 
doorway and you can't quite get to them
the<00:03:34.220> Rockets<00:03:35.120> can<00:03:35.269> definitely<00:03:35.690> come<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:35.959> handy

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
the Rockets can definitely come in handy

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.380 
the Rockets can definitely come in handy
right<00:03:36.410> there<00:03:37.250> unfortunately<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:37.910> think<00:03:38.239> that

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
right there unfortunately I think that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.780 
right there unfortunately I think that
was<00:03:38.570> my<00:03:38.780> second<00:03:39.290> get<00:03:39.470> death<00:03:39.799> of<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:40.370> game<00:03:40.549> I'm

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
the I don't know about the power but the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.910 
the I don't know about the power but the
feel<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.280> magnums<00:04:19.849> from<00:04:20.269> mono<00:04:20.539> warfare<00:04:20.930> to

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
feel of the magnums from mono warfare to

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.860 
feel of the magnums from mono warfare to
the<00:04:22.040> I'm<00:04:22.460> not<00:04:22.700> sure<00:04:22.760> if<00:04:23.240> they're<00:04:23.420> like<00:04:23.630> another

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
the I'm not sure if they're like another

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.080 
the I'm not sure if they're like another
version<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.680> magnums<00:04:25.070> as<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.670> guys<00:04:25.850> know

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
version of the magnums as you guys know

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.060 
version of the magnums as you guys know
I'm<00:04:26.420> not<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.750> gun<00:04:27.020> person<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.680> don't<00:04:27.740> really<00:04:27.950> know

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
I'm not a gun person I don't really know

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.680 
I'm not a gun person I don't really know
all<00:04:28.100> that<00:04:28.310> stuff<00:04:28.580> but<00:04:28.970> they<00:04:29.120> kind<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:29.480> look

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
all that stuff but they kind of look

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.900 
all that stuff but they kind of look
like<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.020> magnums<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.490> said<00:04:31.550> they

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
like the magnums and like I said they

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.670 
like the magnums and like I said they
sort<00:04:32.180> of<00:04:32.240> feel<00:04:32.540> like<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.930> magnums<00:04:33.350> in<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.530> lot

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
sort of feel like the magnums in a lot

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.340 
sort of feel like the magnums in a lot
of<00:04:33.800> way<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.300> it's<00:04:35.300> definitely<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.810> good<00:04:36.080> thing

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
of way and it's definitely a good thing

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.440 
of way and it's definitely a good thing
in<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.740> game<00:04:36.980> where<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> lot<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.790> weapons<00:04:37.940> are

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
in a game where a lot of the weapons are

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.660 
in a game where a lot of the weapons are
not<00:04:38.690> very<00:04:38.900> powerful<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.590> I'm<00:04:39.650> pretty<00:04:39.890> sure<00:04:39.980> to

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
not very powerful and I'm pretty sure to

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.150 
not very powerful and I'm pretty sure to
bolts<00:04:41.000> with<00:04:41.120> these<00:04:41.300> things<00:04:41.600> will<00:04:42.350> kill<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.590> so

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
bolts with these things will kill you so

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.370 
bolts with these things will kill you so
if<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.400> can<00:04:43.550> just<00:04:43.670> hit<00:04:43.790> them<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.750> know<00:04:44.840> chest

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
if you can just hit them you know chest

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.100 
if you can just hit them you know chest
area<00:04:45.770> with<00:04:46.520> each<00:04:46.670> one<00:04:46.940> with<00:04:47.450> one<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:48.020> know

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
area with each one with one you know

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.470 
area with each one with one you know
Pole<00:04:48.980> of<00:04:49.010> each<00:04:49.340> trigger<00:04:49.700> then<00:04:50.060> you'll<00:04:50.240> be<00:04:50.360> good

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
Pole of each trigger then you'll be good

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.210 
Pole of each trigger then you'll be good
now<00:04:50.810> unfortunately<00:04:51.200> right<00:04:51.710> there<00:04:51.890> they

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
now unfortunately right there they

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.580 
now unfortunately right there they
weren't<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.580> reliable<00:04:53.060> because<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.930> never<00:04:54.170> roll

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
weren't so reliable because I never roll

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.290 
weren't so reliable because I never roll
with<00:04:54.740> steady<00:04:54.950> aim<00:04:55.130> settings<00:04:55.640> probably<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> good

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
with steady aim settings probably a good

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.630 
with steady aim settings probably a good
idea<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.980> haven't<00:04:57.980> really<00:04:58.190> had<00:04:58.370> too<00:04:58.520> much

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
idea I haven't really had too much
