00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.069
 hello here's butt has to look today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.559
 we have a suitcase from the former ddr 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:16.830
 There was a national army 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:24.650
 used to have the so-called office fix 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.650
 they look at the called malbasa 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.539
 92 millimeters long wide 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:15.380
 67 and the height 18 as well as modern now 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:25.670
 you also want to make it so 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:28.360
 Pull the side and then fold down the height 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.360
 we measure 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:02:00.160
 52 now the fuel but sex 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:07.910
 whose office fix have fuel vfb 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:10.660
 again plasberg west rules whether that 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.410
 works already 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.220
 probably that's about now 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.220
 30 years old to try 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.510
 Now we have a tablet to measure 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:03:21.830
 So just under three inches thick 707 so 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:21.830
 775 goes or stays 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.100
 it seems to burn 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.010
 Actually, it's pretty good 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.019
 as well as turned on 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:20.239
 let's see how long that endures one 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:20.239
 tablet found from it 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.319
 it seems to be the same now 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.310
 soon it will be over 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.040
 So it has ten minutes and 55 seconds 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.110
 take about 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:06:09.130
 oh what I had forgotten with us 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:14.230
 the material thickness 15 that's the cheap 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:16.780
 version developed around areal 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.090
 Visible in the spring there was one more 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.890
 previous version the brass wall 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.110
 and then there is another one 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:27.419
 I have to give it a look 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.340
 I find it in my basement now 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:33.510
 okay that's it then until the 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.510
 next time bye
