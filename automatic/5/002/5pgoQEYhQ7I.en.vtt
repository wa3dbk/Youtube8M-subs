00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
pretty chords in here by the way it's a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.149 
pretty chords in here by the way it's a
minor<00:01:14.190> so<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.610> A<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.940> D<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.860> strums

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
minor so two A to D and the strums

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.770 
minor so two A to D and the strums
pretty<00:01:17.640> consistent<00:01:18.270> once<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
pretty consistent once you get the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.279 
pretty consistent once you get the
pattern<00:01:19.130> basically<00:01:20.509> hit<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.539> top<00:01:21.869> string

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
pattern basically hit the top string

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.109 
pattern basically hit the top string
that<00:01:22.530> low<00:01:22.740> E<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.310> hit<00:01:23.459> the<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that low E if you hit the a with it it's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
that low E if you hit the a with it it's
fine<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.959> then<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.289> up<00:01:25.590> down<00:01:26.069> up<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.819> then

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
fine and then go up down up and then

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.500 
fine and then go up down up and then
repeat<00:01:27.209> it

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.530 

and<00:01:29.630> then<00:01:30.110> go<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.620> major<00:01:31.100> which<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.700> 2<00:01:32.030> D<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.510> G

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
and then go to a major which is 2 D to G

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.640 
and then go to a major which is 2 D to G
to<00:01:33.470> B<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.730> do<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.300> same<00:01:35.450> thing<00:01:35.690> but<00:01:35.960> now<00:01:36.590> the
