um we had heard that it was best if your

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.510 
um we had heard that it was best if your
roofs<00:02:19.250> are<00:02:19.520> flat<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.170> when<00:02:21.520> your

roofs are flat so that when your

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.010 
roofs are flat so that when your
chickens<00:02:23.180> sleep<00:02:23.510> at<00:02:23.690> night<00:02:23.810> especially

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
their feet with their feathers so their

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.229 
their feet with their feathers so their
feet<00:02:30.410> stay<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.830> bit<00:02:30.980> warmer<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.940> we're

the winter so we did that up here with a
little<00:02:38.510> light<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.959> we'll<00:02:39.140> use<00:02:39.910> sometimes<00:02:40.910> in

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
little light that we'll use sometimes in

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.330 
little light that we'll use sometimes in
the<00:02:41.150> winter<00:02:41.269> not<00:02:42.050> for<00:02:42.260> heat<00:02:42.410> but<00:02:42.709> just<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.160> keep

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the winter not for heat but just to keep

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.699 
the winter not for heat but just to keep
our<00:02:43.519> egg<00:02:43.610> production<00:02:43.940> up<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.900> then<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> little

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
our egg production up and then a little

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.220 
our egg production up and then a little
temperature<00:02:46.190> gauge<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.989> usually

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
temperature gauge just so it's usually

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.759 
temperature gauge just so it's usually
just<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.680> couple<00:02:48.709> degrees<00:02:49.069> above<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:51.350> outside

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
just a couple degrees above the outside

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.030 
just a couple degrees above the outside
during<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.250> winter<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.140> then<00:02:54.140> here's<00:02:54.380> our<00:02:54.500> we

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
during the winter and then here's our we

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:05.199 
during the winter and then here's our we
have<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> little<00:02:55.400> timer<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.569> cord<00:03:04.150> from<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
have a little timer on a cord from the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.910 
have a little timer on a cord from the
back<00:03:05.360> side<00:03:05.870> here<00:03:10.600> you'll<00:03:11.600> see<00:03:11.870> we've<00:03:12.049> got<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.320> he

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
back side here you'll see we've got a he

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.390 
back side here you'll see we've got a he
built<00:03:13.130> um<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:14.380> little<00:03:15.380> window<00:03:15.709> back<00:03:15.920> here<00:03:16.190> that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
built um a little window back here that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.039 
built um a little window back here that
we<00:03:16.489> use<00:03:16.670> as<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:16.880> vent<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:17.480> we<00:03:17.570> like<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.720> keep<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
we use as a vent so we like to keep the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.530 
we use as a vent so we like to keep the
front<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.590> open<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.160> back<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:20.120> we

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
front to open in the back and we

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.330 
front to open in the back and we
generally<00:03:20.989> keep<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.350> back<00:03:21.530> open<00:03:21.859> most<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.220> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
generally keep the back open most of the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.430 
generally keep the back open most of the
year<00:03:22.549> unless<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.910> gets<00:03:23.000> real<00:03:23.359> real<00:03:23.540> cold<00:03:23.810> just

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
year unless it gets real real cold just

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.039 
year unless it gets real real cold just
so<00:03:24.560> they<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.709> some<00:03:25.040> ventilation<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:26.180> that

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
so they have some ventilation and that

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.080 
so they have some ventilation and that
just<00:03:27.260> Nora<00:03:27.560> just<00:03:27.769> swing<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.130> up<00:03:28.250> baby<00:03:28.459> market

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
just Nora just swing that up baby market

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.470 
just Nora just swing that up baby market
that<00:03:29.239> just<00:03:29.269> swings<00:03:29.690> up<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.079> walk<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:32.090> built<00:03:32.329> it

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
that just swings up and walk we built it

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.920 
that just swings up and walk we built it
all<00:03:32.570> out<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:33.760> poplar<00:03:36.070> local<00:03:37.070> poplar<00:03:37.489> my<00:03:37.790> uncles

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.370 

and<00:03:41.930> here's<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:44.180> side<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:45.859> little<00:03:45.890> ramp<00:03:47.380> for

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
and here's this side a little ramp for

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.650 
and here's this side a little ramp for
the<00:03:48.440> tens<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.579> we're<00:03:49.790> sure<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> go<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.570> out

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
the tens and we're sure to go in and out

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.520 
the tens and we're sure to go in and out
and<00:03:51.200> then<00:03:51.709> here's<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.130> little<00:03:52.340> door<00:03:52.850> we<00:03:53.780> have

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.840 

what<00:03:57.530> we<00:03:57.680> did<00:03:57.859> with<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.190> is<00:03:58.250> put<00:03:58.609> it<00:03:58.730> on<00:03:58.819> a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
what we did with this is put it on a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.490 
what we did with this is put it on a
pulley<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.120> raises<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.720> lowers<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:03.260> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
pulley so that raises and lowers it and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.059 
pulley so that raises and lowers it and
the<00:04:03.859> best<00:04:04.130> part<00:04:04.489> about<00:04:04.549> it<00:04:04.880> is<00:04:05.769> we<00:04:06.769> don't<00:04:06.920> have

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
the best part about it is we don't have

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.809 
the best part about it is we don't have
to<00:04:07.160> go<00:04:07.340> inside<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:09.620> run<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.639> open<00:04:11.030> up

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
to go inside the run to open up

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
outside your fence insulator basically

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.510 
outside your fence insulator basically
hold<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.220> on<00:04:23.310> there<00:04:23.840> in<00:04:24.840> your<00:04:24.990> window<00:04:25.350> yeah<00:04:26.310> we

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
inside of those is a hardware closet

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.050

there to keep them open pretty simple it

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.480 
there to keep them open pretty simple it
was<00:05:18.180> easy<00:05:18.590> quick<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.680> easy<00:05:19.889> for<00:05:20.159> us<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.280> put

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
was easy quick and easy for us to put

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.670
