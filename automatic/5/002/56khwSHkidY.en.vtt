look at the HP Mini 21:40 netbook
there's<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.820> couple<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.090> things<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.269> set<00:00:09.480> this

there's a couple of things that set this
netbook<00:00:09.870> apart<00:00:10.230> from<00:00:10.349> others<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:11.400> thing<00:00:11.610> that

netbook apart from others one thing that
I<00:00:11.759> want<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.059> focus<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.540> first<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.590> display

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
I want to focus on first is the display

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.570 
I want to focus on first is the display
resolution<00:00:14.190> which<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.199> 16<00:00:16.199> point<00:00:16.560> 16<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.340> 9

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
resolution which is 16 point 16 to 9

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.880 
resolution which is 16 point 16 to 9
aspect<00:00:18.240> ratio<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> great<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.770> want

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
aspect ratio which is great if you want

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.470 
aspect ratio which is great if you want

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
to play in widescreen video but it does

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.000 
to play in widescreen video but it does
mean<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.869> don't<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.230> quite<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.619> many

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
mean that you don't have quite as many

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
mean that you don't have quite as many
pixels<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> bottom<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> screen<00:00:24.600> or

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
other netbooks in other words you have a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.740 
other netbooks in other words you have a
1024<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:30.449> 576<00:00:31.019> display<00:00:32.009> resolution<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.790> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
1024 by 576 display resolution on this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
1024 by 576 display resolution on this
netbook<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.440> opposed<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> something<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
netbook as opposed to something like the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.220 
netbook as opposed to something like the
osseous<00:00:36.719> epc<00:00:37.350> 1000<00:00:37.890> H<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.700> has<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.210> 1024<00:00:40.050> by

osseous epc 1000 H which has a 1024 by
600<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.730> means<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> look

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
600 and what that means is if you look

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
600 and what that means is if you look
closely<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.010> down<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
closely you can see down here in the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.139 
closely you can see down here in the
bottom

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
bottom

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.970 
bottom
you<00:00:45.239> basically<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.719> room<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.140> fit<00:00:46.350> about<00:00:46.559> two

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you basically have room to fit about two

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.600 
you basically have room to fit about two
more<00:00:47.160> lines<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.610> text<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.079> 600<00:00:50.070> pixels

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
more lines of text on the 600 pixels

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.119 
more lines of text on the 600 pixels
than<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> 576<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:52.829> one

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
than you do on the 576 so that's one

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
than you do on the 576 so that's one
thing<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.670> might<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> little

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
thing that you might want to be a little

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.860 
thing that you might want to be a little
bit<00:00:54.510> concerned<00:00:54.840> about<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.410> need<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.800> much

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
bit concerned about if you need as much

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.279 
bit concerned about if you need as much
screen<00:00:57.870> real<00:00:57.960> estate<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.530> possible<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.850> said

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
screen real estate as possible that said

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.650 
screen real estate as possible that said
the<00:01:01.489> when<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.609> playing<00:01:02.789> widescreen

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the when you're playing widescreen

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
the when you're playing widescreen
high-definition<00:01:04.650> video<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> netbook<00:01:06.030> with

high-definition video on a netbook with

high-definition video on a netbook with
the<00:01:06.770> 1024<00:01:07.770> by<00:01:07.890> 576<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.970> won't<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> any<00:01:09.450> black

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the 1024 by 576 you won't have any black

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
the 1024 by 576 you won't have any black
bars<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.320> top<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.860> bottom<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.340> the

screen because it is just right another

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.490 
screen because it is just right another
thing<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> wanted<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> point<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:16.080> while

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
thing I wanted to point out here while

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.130 
thing I wanted to point out here while
we've<00:01:16.619> got<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.890> two<00:01:17.130> computers<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.140> it's

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
we've got the two computers out is it's

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.660 
we've got the two computers out is it's
a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.500> bit<00:01:19.619> hard<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> tell<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a little bit hard to tell because of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.190 
a little bit hard to tell because of
this<00:01:20.850> camera<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:23.189> display<00:01:23.869> even<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
this camera but the display even that is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.609 
this camera but the display even that is
dimmest<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.150> pretty<00:01:27.540> bright<00:01:27.840> compared

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
dimmest it is pretty bright compared

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.170 
dimmest it is pretty bright compared
with<00:01:28.799> someone<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:31.380> epc<00:01:31.860> 1080<00:01:32.990> which

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
with someone like the epc 1080 which

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.929 
with someone like the epc 1080 which
definitely<00:01:36.180> gets<00:01:36.479> significantly<00:01:36.720> dimmer<00:01:37.939> but

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
definitely gets significantly dimmer but

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
definitely gets significantly dimmer but
doesn't<00:01:39.240> quite<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.810> bright<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
doesn't quite get as bright and like I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.719 
doesn't quite get as bright and like I
said<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> little<00:01:41.009> bit<00:01:41.100> hard<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> tell<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
said it's a little bit hard to tell that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.850 
said it's a little bit hard to tell that
but<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.689> look<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> whites<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> two

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
but if you look at the whites on the two

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.090 
but if you look at the whites on the two
computers<00:01:45.290> definitely<00:01:46.290> brighter<00:01:46.560> over<00:01:46.710> here

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
computers definitely brighter over here

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.240 
computers definitely brighter over here
on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> HP<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.110> believe<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> gets<00:01:49.890> all<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
on the HP I believe when it gets all the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.590 
on the HP I believe when it gets all the
way<00:01:50.490> bright<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> colors<00:01:50.970> start<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> look<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
way bright the colors start to look a

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
one I noticed that if you just sort of

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.180 
one I noticed that if you just sort of
shook<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.870> little<00:04:50.080> bit<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.860> couldn't

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
use the computer for a few seconds

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.029 
use the computer for a few seconds
