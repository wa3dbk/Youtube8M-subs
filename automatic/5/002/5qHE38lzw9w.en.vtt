00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.470 

shutter<00:00:01.530> speed<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:02.070> really<00:00:02.340> simple<00:00:02.879> it<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.330> the

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
shutter speed is really simple it is the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.440 
shutter speed is really simple it is the
speed<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:04.049> your<00:00:04.410> shutter<00:00:04.740> it's<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:05.759> long<00:00:05.819> your

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
speed of your shutter it's how long your

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.690 
speed of your shutter it's how long your
shutter<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.899> open<00:00:07.049> letting<00:00:07.919> light<00:00:08.160> into<00:00:08.670> your

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
shutter is open letting light into your

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.360 
shutter is open letting light into your
camera<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.380> control<00:00:10.710> two<00:00:11.040> really

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
camera you can control two really

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.709 
camera you can control two really
important<00:00:11.820> things<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.240> your<00:00:12.389> shutter<00:00:12.630> speed

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
important things with your shutter speed

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.070 
important things with your shutter speed
one<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.830> how<00:00:14.040> much<00:00:14.219> light<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.460> let<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> two

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
one is how much light you let in and two

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.580 
one is how much light you let in and two
is<00:00:16.529> how<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.130> freeze<00:00:17.730> action<00:00:18.260> take<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> look<00:00:19.500> at

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
is how you freeze action take a look at

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
is how you freeze action take a look at
this<00:00:19.680> picture<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.279> dog<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.789> example<00:00:20.880> this

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this picture this dog for example this

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
this picture this dog for example this
was<00:00:21.900> probably<00:00:22.199> taken<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> really<00:00:23.039> fast

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
was probably taken with a really fast

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.670 
was probably taken with a really fast
shutter<00:00:23.789> speed<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.869> tell<00:00:25.140> because

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
shutter speed and we can tell because

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.439 
shutter speed and we can tell because
all<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> water<00:00:26.250> droplets<00:00:26.789> around<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.269> dog's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
all the water droplets around the dog's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.660 
all the water droplets around the dog's
face<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.930> frozen<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> air<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.490> dog's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
face are frozen in the air and the dog's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
face are frozen in the air and the dog's
face<00:00:29.939> itself<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.599> also<00:00:30.750> frozen<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
face itself is also frozen in that

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.280 
face itself is also frozen in that
shaking<00:00:32.369> expression<00:00:33.090> his<00:00:33.510> lips<00:00:33.870> sort<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
shaking expression his lips sort of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.200 
shaking expression his lips sort of
flying<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.040> air<00:00:35.130> everything<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
flying up in the air everything is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.850 
flying up in the air everything is
frozen<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.930> place<00:00:37.200> even<00:00:37.530> though<00:00:37.739> we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
frozen right in place even though we

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.200 
frozen right in place even though we
know<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.280> dog<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.460> moving<00:00:38.820> really

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
know that the dog is moving really

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.479 
know that the dog is moving really
quickly<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.100> fast

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
quickly so when you have really fast

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.030 
quickly so when you have really fast
action<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> shaking<00:00:42.930> dog<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> running

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
action like a shaking dog or a running

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040 
action like a shaking dog or a running
or<00:00:44.190> jumping<00:00:44.399> person<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.600> use<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> really

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
or jumping person if you use a really

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
or jumping person if you use a really
fast<00:00:46.410> shutter<00:00:46.770> speed<00:00:47.160> too<00:00:47.370> you'll<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.700> able<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
fast shutter speed too you'll be able to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.959 
fast shutter speed too you'll be able to
freeze<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.690> action<00:00:49.399> here's<00:00:50.399> another<00:00:50.640> case<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
freeze that action here's another case a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.319 
freeze that action here's another case a
man<00:00:51.329> waterskiing<00:00:52.020> he<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> frozen<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
man waterskiing he is frozen and so is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.920 
man waterskiing he is frozen and so is
this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
this
wave<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:56.190> behind<00:00:56.550> him<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> little<00:00:57.360> parts

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
wave up behind him all the little parts

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840 
wave up behind him all the little parts
of<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> wave<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.350> frozen<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> air<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of the wave are frozen in the air this

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.670 
of the wave are frozen in the air this
was<00:01:00.090> another<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.570> fast<00:01:00.930> shutter<00:01:01.260> speed

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
was another really fast shutter speed

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.590 
was another really fast shutter speed
and<00:01:01.859> another<00:01:02.100> example<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.910> water<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.420> see

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and another example with water you see

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
and another example with water you see
all<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.140> droplets<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.769> frozen<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
all the droplets are frozen right in the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
all the droplets are frozen right in the
air<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.479> were<00:01:06.570> looking<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
air if we were looking at this with the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
air if we were looking at this with the
naked<00:01:07.560> eye<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.430> streams<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
naked eye we would just see streams of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
naked eye we would just see streams of
water<00:01:09.360> coming<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
water coming out but here we get to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
water coming out but here we get to
capture<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> action<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.390> super<00:01:12.840> fast

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
capture the action with a super fast

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.710 
capture the action with a super fast
shutter<00:01:13.409> speed<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:15.360> case<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
shutter speed in this case the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.630 
shutter speed in this case the
photographer<00:01:16.170> used<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> slower<00:01:16.860> shutter<00:01:17.009> speed

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
photographer used a slower shutter speed

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160 
photographer used a slower shutter speed
which<00:01:18.150> means<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> shutter<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.110> open

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
which means that the shutter was open

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.219 
which means that the shutter was open
long<00:01:19.830> enough<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.790> woman<00:01:21.210> walk<00:01:21.930> by

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
long enough to have this woman walk by

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.420 
long enough to have this woman walk by
with<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.650> hospital<00:01:23.250> bed<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> she's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> blur

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
with this hospital bed and she's a blur

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.800 
with this hospital bed and she's a blur
here's<00:01:26.430> another<00:01:26.700> case<00:01:27.000> where<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> slower

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
here's another case where a slower

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.319 
here's another case where a slower
shutter<00:01:27.990> speed<00:01:28.590> shows<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> water<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
shutter speed shows that the water is

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.359 
shutter speed shows that the water is
flowing<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.530> were<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> fast<00:01:32.100> shutter

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
flowing if this were a fast shutter

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
flowing if this were a fast shutter
speed<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> first<00:01:33.390> few<00:01:33.600> photos<00:01:33.930> we

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
speed like the first few photos we

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.810 
speed like the first few photos we
looked<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.439> all<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.070> water<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.520> frozen

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
looked at all the water would be frozen

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.300 
looked at all the water would be frozen
in<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> air<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> slowed<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:37.439> shutter

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
in the air with a slowed down shutter

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
in the air with a slowed down shutter
speed<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.850> case<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.420> sort<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> lacy

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
speed in this case we get sort of a lacy

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.350 
speed in this case we get sort of a lacy
effect<00:01:40.350> with<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> water<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.460> here's<00:01:42.119> another

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
effect with the water and here's another

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.289 
effect with the water and here's another
case<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:43.170> long<00:01:43.590> shutter<00:01:44.040> speed

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
case of a really long shutter speed

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.730 
case of a really long shutter speed
imagine<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.540> had<00:01:45.689> been<00:01:45.720> taken<00:01:46.259> really

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
imagine if this had been taken really

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
imagine if this had been taken really
quickly<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> bunch<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
quickly all we would see is a bunch of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.690 
quickly all we would see is a bunch of
dots<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.799> headlights<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.340> taillights

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
dots from the headlights and taillights

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
dots from the headlights and taillights
of<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.060> cars<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.350> be

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
of these cars because they would be

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
of these cars because they would be
frozen<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.009> place<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.240> long

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
frozen in place but with a really long

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
frozen in place but with a really long
shutter<00:01:54.960> speed<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.380> cars<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:56.100> been<00:01:56.189> allowed

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
shutter speed the cars have been allowed

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.179 
shutter speed the cars have been allowed
to<00:01:56.490> go<00:01:56.790> by<00:01:57.090> while<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> shutter<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.170> open<00:01:58.229> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
to go by while the shutter was open so

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.830 
to go by while the shutter was open so
we<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.430> these<00:01:59.579> streaking<00:02:00.240> headlights<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
we get these streaking headlights and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.959 
we get these streaking headlights and
tail<00:02:01.049> lights

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
tail lights

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.780 
tail lights
okay<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.030> shutter<00:02:03.450> speed<00:02:03.810> let's<00:02:04.110> review<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
okay so shutter speed let's review a

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.730 
okay so shutter speed let's review a
really<00:02:05.790> fast<00:02:06.149> shutter<00:02:06.540> speed<00:02:06.899> let's<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.439> less

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
really fast shutter speed let's in less

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.809 
really fast shutter speed let's in less
light<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.599> freezes<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.780> action

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
light and freezes the action

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.390 
light and freezes the action
and<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:11.239> really<00:02:11.510> slow<00:02:11.870> shutter<00:02:12.560> speed<00:02:12.950> lets<00:02:13.249> in

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and a really slow shutter speed lets in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.239 
and a really slow shutter speed lets in
a<00:02:13.459> lot<00:02:13.489> more<00:02:13.700> light<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:14.569> lets<00:02:15.469> the<00:02:15.650> action

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.249 
a lot more light and lets the action

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.629 
a lot more light and lets the action
show<00:02:16.849> up<00:02:17.060> on<00:02:17.359> the<00:02:17.749> photo<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.499> blur<00:02:18.769> but

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:19.639 
show up on the photo in a blur but

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.640 
show up on the photo in a blur but
sometimes<00:02:20.180> all<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.569> want<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.079> really<00:02:21.439> nice

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
sometimes all you want is a really nice

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.489 
sometimes all you want is a really nice
crisp<00:02:22.069> photo<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:23.269> person<00:02:23.689> or<00:02:23.840> plant<00:02:24.200> or

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:24.499 
crisp photo of a person or plant or

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:25.839 
crisp photo of a person or plant or
whatever<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.189> front<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.639> and

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
whatever it is in front of you and

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.059 
whatever it is in front of you and
sometimes<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.049> photo<00:02:27.260> turns<00:02:27.560> out<00:02:27.769> blurry

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
sometimes that photo turns out blurry

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.920 
sometimes that photo turns out blurry
and<00:02:28.310> you're<00:02:28.459> not<00:02:28.609> sure<00:02:28.639> why<00:02:29.060> well<00:02:29.719> one<00:02:29.900> reason

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
and you're not sure why well one reason

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.809 
and you're not sure why well one reason
could<00:02:30.439> be<00:02:30.560> because<00:02:30.739> your<00:02:31.099> shutter<00:02:31.340> speed<00:02:31.430> is

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
could be because your shutter speed is

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.610 
could be because your shutter speed is
too<00:02:32.030> slow<00:02:32.060> here's<00:02:32.719> a<00:02:32.780> good<00:02:32.930> example<00:02:33.409> you<00:02:33.439> can

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
too slow here's a good example you can

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.520 
too slow here's a good example you can
see<00:02:33.769> that<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.040> doll<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.579> not<00:02:34.939> in<00:02:35.450> focus<00:02:35.689> well

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
see that this doll is not in focus well

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.619 
see that this doll is not in focus well
actually<00:02:36.769> my<00:02:37.129> lens<00:02:37.370> was<00:02:37.609> perfectly<00:02:38.000> focused

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
actually my lens was perfectly focused

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.839 
actually my lens was perfectly focused
on<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.049> doll<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:39.680> my<00:02:39.799> hand<00:02:40.040> was<00:02:40.219> moving<00:02:40.489> as<00:02:40.730> I

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
on the doll but my hand was moving as I

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.610 
on the doll but my hand was moving as I
pressed<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.299> shutter<00:02:41.329> and<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:42.109> was<00:02:42.260> using<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
pressed the shutter and I was using a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.679 
pressed the shutter and I was using a
shutter<00:02:42.859> speed<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:43.430> too<00:02:43.700> slow<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.359> a

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
shutter speed that was too slow so a

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.599 
shutter speed that was too slow so a
slow<00:02:45.169> shutter<00:02:45.439> speed<00:02:45.829> is<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.189> to<00:02:46.280> record

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
slow shutter speed is going to record

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.849 
slow shutter speed is going to record
the<00:02:46.909> motion<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.450> my<00:02:47.599> hands<00:02:48.139> as<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.409> press<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
the motion of my hands as I press the

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.670 
the motion of my hands as I press the
shutter<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.449> see<00:02:50.689> turnout<00:02:51.230> sort<00:02:51.590> of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
shutter and as you see turnout sort of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.309 
shutter and as you see turnout sort of
blurry<00:02:52.010> photo<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.819> shot<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:53.900> at<00:02:54.079> one

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
blurry photo I shot this at one

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.649 
blurry photo I shot this at one
thirtieth<00:02:54.799> of<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.129> second<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:56.239> too

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
thirtieth of a second and that is too

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.199 
thirtieth of a second and that is too
slow<00:02:57.019> for<00:02:57.260> handheld<00:02:57.889> photo<00:02:58.459> now<00:02:58.730> if<00:02:58.849> I'd<00:02:59.000> had<00:02:59.180> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
slow for handheld photo now if I'd had a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.240 
slow for handheld photo now if I'd had a
tripod<00:02:59.780> that'd<00:02:59.989> be<00:03:00.139> another<00:03:00.349> story<00:03:00.769> because

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
tripod that'd be another story because

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.059 
tripod that'd be another story because
my<00:03:01.579> camera<00:03:02.299> wouldn't<00:03:02.480> be<00:03:02.599> moving<00:03:02.930> at<00:03:03.019> all<00:03:03.230> now

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
my camera wouldn't be moving at all now

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.129 
my camera wouldn't be moving at all now
this<00:03:04.250> one<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.430> shot<00:03:04.760> at<00:03:04.939> one<00:03:05.209> sixtieth<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:06.019> a

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
this one is shot at one sixtieth of a

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.949 
this one is shot at one sixtieth of a
second<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:07.129> can<00:03:07.280> see<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.699> the<00:03:07.909> doll<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.750> much

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
second you can see that the doll is much

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.470 
second you can see that the doll is much
more<00:03:09.169> crisp<00:03:09.500> in<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:09.829> photo<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.430> my<00:03:11.120> hand<00:03:11.359> was

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
more crisp in this photo and my hand was

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.360 
more crisp in this photo and my hand was
probably<00:03:11.840> still<00:03:12.199> moving<00:03:12.620> as<00:03:12.709> much<00:03:12.919> as<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.219> was

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
probably still moving as much as it was

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.539 
probably still moving as much as it was
in<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.909> first<00:03:14.120> photo<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.620> one<00:03:15.799> sixtieth<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.459> a

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
in the first photo but one sixtieth of a

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.159 
in the first photo but one sixtieth of a
second<00:03:16.879> is<00:03:16.939> just<00:03:17.180> fast<00:03:17.359> enough<00:03:17.659> to<00:03:17.810> freeze<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
second is just fast enough to freeze the

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.159 
second is just fast enough to freeze the
photo<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.099> what<00:03:19.849> is<00:03:20.030> fast<00:03:20.329> enough<00:03:20.659> and<00:03:20.840> what<00:03:21.019> is

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
photo so what is fast enough and what is

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.159 
photo so what is fast enough and what is
too<00:03:21.590> slow<00:03:21.970> generally<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.389> sixtieth<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.049> a

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
too slow generally one sixtieth of a
