it's hot outside and I mean hot the Sun
can<00:00:03.210> almost<00:00:03.330> be<00:00:03.629> unbearable<00:00:04.410> at<00:00:04.560> times<00:00:04.759> but

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
can almost be unbearable at times but

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.179 
can almost be unbearable at times but

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.560 
of its hydrogen supply you start to
