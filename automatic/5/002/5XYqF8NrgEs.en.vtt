that<00:01:59.420> you<00:02:00.290> didn't<00:02:00.680> think<00:02:00.860> we're<00:02:01.040> possible<00:02:01.070> and

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
that you didn't think we're possible and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.000 
that you didn't think we're possible and
I<00:02:02.090> just<00:02:02.120> got<00:02:02.870> really<00:02:03.050> fascinated<00:02:03.290> with<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
I just got really fascinated with the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.160 
I just got really fascinated with the
robot<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.370> robotic<00:02:05.060> surgeries<00:02:05.480> but<00:02:05.720> very<00:02:06.020> few

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
robot and robotic surgeries but very few

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.410 
robot and robotic surgeries but very few
residents<00:02:06.560> were<00:02:06.770> getting<00:02:07.550> time<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.760> operate

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
residents were getting time to operate

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.570 
residents were getting time to operate
and<00:02:08.840> learn<00:02:08.989> how<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.379> do<00:02:09.530> robotic<00:02:09.920> surgery<00:02:10.280> and

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
and learn how to do robotic surgery and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580 
and learn how to do robotic surgery and
I<00:02:10.879> just<00:02:11.030> saw<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> need<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.840> obviously<00:02:12.319> great

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I just saw a need and obviously great

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.890 
I just saw a need and obviously great
interest<00:02:12.950> among<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.250> residents<00:02:13.400> to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
interest among the residents to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.270 
interest among the residents to
are<00:02:13.959> being<00:02:14.140> more<00:02:14.319> involved<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.069> I've<00:02:15.189> been

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
are being more involved and so I've been

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.039 
are being more involved and so I've been
helpful<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:16.120> developing<00:02:16.629> that<00:02:16.810> and

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
helpful and in developing that and

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.330 
helpful and in developing that and
actually<00:02:17.140> develop<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.590> curriculum<00:02:17.799> so<00:02:18.189> it's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
actually develop a curriculum so it's

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.339 
actually develop a curriculum so it's
been<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.849> couple<00:02:19.090> years<00:02:19.239> but<00:02:19.989> it's<00:02:20.110> been<00:02:20.170> really

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
been a couple years but it's been really

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.780 
been a couple years but it's been really
rewarding<00:02:20.560> we've<00:02:21.010> had<00:02:21.129> a<00:02:21.159> couple<00:02:21.310> residents

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
rewarding we've had a couple residents

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.100 
rewarding we've had a couple residents
go<00:02:21.879> through<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> training<00:02:22.299> program<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
go through the training program and a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.649 
go through the training program and a
few<00:02:23.260> people<00:02:23.500> actually<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.579> do<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.150> good

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
few people actually get to do a good

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.970 
few people actually get to do a good
handful<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.049> surgeries<00:02:26.470> now<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.860> it's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
handful of surgeries now and it's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.490 
handful of surgeries now and it's
building<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:27.610> I'm<00:02:27.730> excited<00:02:28.000> about<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.500> there

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
building so I'm excited about it there

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.080 
building so I'm excited about it there
are<00:02:29.590> two<00:02:29.769> really<00:02:30.040> important<00:02:30.579> things<00:02:30.609> about

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
are two really important things about

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.800 
are two really important things about
this<00:02:31.959> place<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:33.040> make<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:33.310> very<00:02:33.459> unique

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
this place I think make it very unique

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.170 
this place I think make it very unique
the<00:02:34.810> UH<00:02:34.840> new<00:02:34.959> haven<00:02:35.200> hospital<00:02:35.319> one<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.939> place

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the UH new haven hospital one is a place

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.110 
the UH new haven hospital one is a place
where<00:02:37.590> your<00:02:38.590> colleagues<00:02:39.129> your<00:02:39.400> patients

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
where your colleagues your patients

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.190 
where your colleagues your patients
everyone<00:02:41.019> is<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.230> diverse<00:02:42.120> number<00:02:43.120> two<00:02:43.480> people

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
everyone is so diverse number two people

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.589 
everyone is so diverse number two people
are<00:02:44.379> really<00:02:44.620> invested<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.480> if<00:02:46.569> you

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
are really invested in you and so if you

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.960 
are really invested in you and so if you
care<00:02:46.870> about<00:02:46.989> your<00:02:47.109> development<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.730> want

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
care about your development and you want

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.690 
care about your development and you want
to<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.750> best<00:02:49.930> possible<00:02:50.079> career<00:02:50.769> this<00:02:51.639> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
to have the best possible career this is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.729 
to have the best possible career this is
a<00:02:51.879> place<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.450> should<00:02:52.659> come<00:02:52.870> because

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
a place that you should come because

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.229 
a place that you should come because
people<00:02:54.159> are<00:02:54.280> going<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.489> make<00:02:54.609> sure<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:55.150> you

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
people are going to make sure that you

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.780 
people are going to make sure that you
get<00:02:55.389> everything<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.870> need<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.609> other

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
get everything you need one of the other

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.699 
get everything you need one of the other
things<00:02:57.909> I<00:02:58.239> think<00:02:58.299> that<00:02:58.689> we<00:02:58.900> provide<00:02:59.319> at<00:02:59.560> this

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
things I think that we provide at this

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.179 
things I think that we provide at this
institution<00:03:00.189> is<00:03:00.930> building<00:03:01.930> leadership<00:03:02.349> we

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
institution is building leadership we

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.520 
institution is building leadership we
have<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> responsibility<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:04.750> believe<00:03:05.200> not

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
have a responsibility we believe not

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.910 
have a responsibility we believe not
only<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:06.159> train<00:03:06.489> medically<00:03:07.389> but<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.409> train<00:03:08.709> you

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
only to train medically but to train you

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.190 
only to train medically but to train you
so<00:03:09.159> that<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.760> can<00:03:10.000> go<00:03:10.150> out<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.599> be<00:03:10.930> those

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
so that you can go out and be those

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.479 
so that you can go out and be those
leaders<00:03:11.799> we<00:03:12.700> believe<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.480> trainees

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
leaders we believe that the trainees

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.119 
leaders we believe that the trainees
residents<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.670> fellows<00:03:16.060> need<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.079> be<00:03:17.260> let<00:03:18.099> in

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
residents the fellows need to be let in

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.659 
residents the fellows need to be let in
the<00:03:18.400> direction<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:19.120> being<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.840> future<00:03:20.349> of

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
the direction of being the future of

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.879 
the direction of being the future of
Medicine<00:03:21.669> in<00:03:21.819> this<00:03:22.000> country<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.739> think<00:03:23.739> as<00:03:23.859> a

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
Medicine in this country I think as a

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.740 
Medicine in this country I think as a
resident<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.489> particular<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:25.269> things<00:03:25.569> that

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
resident in particular the things that

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.379 
resident in particular the things that
you<00:03:25.840> rely<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.680> our<00:03:27.099> do<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.819> have<00:03:28.030> good<00:03:28.239> access

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
you rely on our do you have good access

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.990 
you rely on our do you have good access
to<00:03:28.690> online<00:03:28.900> resources<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.579> library

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
to online resources is the library

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.789 
to online resources is the library
available<00:03:31.209> now<00:03:31.780> that's<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.169> think<00:03:32.199> where<00:03:32.500> Yale

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
available now that's I think where Yale

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.770 
available now that's I think where Yale
excels<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.639> they<00:03:33.790> have<00:03:33.940> every<00:03:34.299> journal<00:03:34.720> I

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
excels is that they have every journal I

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.569 
excels is that they have every journal I
think<00:03:35.019> known<00:03:35.199> to<00:03:35.379> man<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.190> when<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.519> to

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
think known to man and when you get to

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.069 
think known to man and when you get to
the<00:03:36.760> laboratory<00:03:36.940> experience<00:03:37.599> she's<00:03:37.840> really

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
the laboratory experience she's really

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.629 
the laboratory experience she's really
very<00:03:38.230> few<00:03:38.500> places<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.069> United<00:03:39.220> States<00:03:39.400> or

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
very few places in the United States or

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.830 
very few places in the United States or
the<00:03:39.669> world<00:03:39.940> rather<00:03:40.090> where<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.359> can<00:03:40.480> get<00:03:40.629> that

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
the world rather where you can get that

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.199 
the world rather where you can get that
kind<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.620> transition<00:03:42.549> from<00:03:42.669> being<00:03:42.849> a<00:03:43.000> resident

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
kind of transition from being a resident

diverse populations very challenging

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.050 
diverse populations very challenging
cases<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.560> patients<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.280> we<00:04:16.400> deal<00:04:16.609> with<00:04:16.820> and

cases and patients that we deal with and
so<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.269> think<00:04:17.479> you<00:04:17.750> learned<00:04:17.930> from<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.229> best

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
so I think you learned from the best

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.259 
so I think you learned from the best
here<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.609> kind<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.880> place<00:04:19.940> that's

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
here and it's the kind of place that's

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.670 
here and it's the kind of place that's
just<00:04:20.450> very<00:04:20.510> supportive<00:04:21.169> it's<00:04:21.290> very<00:04:21.440> laid-back

just very supportive it's very laid-back
it's<00:04:22.100> very<00:04:22.250> Danvers<00:04:22.669> I<00:04:22.880> think<00:04:23.060> that's

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
it's very Danvers I think that's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.550 
it's very Danvers I think that's
something<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.450> people<00:04:23.870> may<00:04:23.990> not<00:04:24.139> expect

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
something that people may not expect

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.170 
something that people may not expect
from<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.860> very<00:04:25.070> esteemed<00:04:25.610> academic

from a very esteemed academic

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.240 
from a very esteemed academic
institution<00:04:26.840> but<00:04:27.169> it<00:04:27.560> does<00:04:27.740> feel<00:04:27.950> more<00:04:28.100> like<00:04:28.190> a

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
institution but it does feel more like a

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.950 
institution but it does feel more like a
family<00:04:28.490> we<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:28.970> great<00:04:29.210> time<00:04:29.419> on<00:04:29.630> rounds

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
family we have a great time on rounds

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.780 
family we have a great time on rounds
together<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.620> hang<00:04:31.220> out<00:04:31.340> with<00:04:31.400> some<00:04:31.639> of<00:04:31.760> my

hospital as well as outside of the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.640 
hospital as well as outside of the
hospital<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.780> mean<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.169> prospect<00:04:39.590> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
hospital I mean the prospect the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.080 
hospital I mean the prospect the
residency<00:04:40.070> can<00:04:40.220> be<00:04:40.310> really<00:04:40.520> scary<00:04:40.580> as<00:04:41.060> a

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
residency can be really scary as a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.460 
residency can be really scary as a
fourth-year<00:04:41.450> medical<00:04:41.690> student<00:04:41.870> about<00:04:42.320> to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
fourth-year medical student about to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.740 
fourth-year medical student about to
like<00:04:42.650> take<00:04:43.220> on<00:04:43.430> this<00:04:43.550> responsibility<00:04:43.700> but<00:04:44.510> I

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
like take on this responsibility but I

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.240 
like take on this responsibility but I
think<00:04:45.050> both<00:04:45.229> of<00:04:45.260> us<00:04:45.440> are<00:04:45.560> really<00:04:45.680> surprised<00:04:46.100> by

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
think both of us are really surprised by

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.580 
think both of us are really surprised by
how<00:04:46.400> quickly<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:47.000> felt<00:04:47.270> at<00:04:47.630> home<00:04:47.780> here<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:48.229> don't

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
how quickly we felt at home here I don't

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.750 
how quickly we felt at home here I don't
think<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.770> would<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:48.919> expected<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.370> by<00:04:49.550> any

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
think I would have expected that by any

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.700 
think I would have expected that by any
means<00:04:49.940> but<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.150> think<00:04:50.330> it's<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.510> hallmark<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:51.020> the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
means but I think it's a hallmark of the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.320 
means but I think it's a hallmark of the
hospital<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> institution<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.970> just

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
hospital in the institution and just

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.570 
hospital in the institution and just
that<00:04:53.510> culture<00:04:53.930> of<00:04:54.110> really<00:04:55.100> collegiality<00:04:55.520> and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
that culture of really collegiality and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.700 
that culture of really collegiality and
openness<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.600> sort<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:56.990> pervades<00:04:57.320> here<00:04:57.530> I

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
openness that sort of pervades here I

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.830 
openness that sort of pervades here I
think<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.580> most<00:04:58.760> important<00:04:59.240> thing<00:04:59.300> right<00:04:59.780> now

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
think the most important thing right now

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.200 
think the most important thing right now
that's<00:05:00.320> more<00:05:00.470> salient<00:05:01.010> to<00:05:01.250> me<00:05:01.370> is<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:02.060> fact

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
that's more salient to me is the fact

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.770 
that's more salient to me is the fact
