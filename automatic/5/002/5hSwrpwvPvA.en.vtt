repulsed a lightning shield and force
lightning<00:00:16.199> those<00:00:17.160> are<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.369> most<00:00:17.520> important

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
lightning those are the most important

lightning those are the most important
ones<00:00:18.090> lightsaber<00:00:19.020> throws<00:00:19.320> alright<00:00:20.090> not<00:00:21.090> that

ones lightsaber throws alright not that
crucial<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:23.039> max<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> forest

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
crucial and then max out all the forest

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.419 
crucial and then max out all the forest
talents<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> very<00:00:25.769> top<00:00:27.109> and<00:00:28.429> if

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
talents that are on the very top and if

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.550 
talents that are on the very top and if
he<00:00:29.580> used<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.019> forest<00:00:31.019> talents<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.439> your

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
he used the forest talents for your

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.799 
he used the forest talents for your
glitch<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.160> detailed<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.329> another<00:00:33.540> video

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
glitch that I detailed in another video

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.600 
glitch that I detailed in another video
it<00:00:34.290> should<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.500> really<00:00:34.800> easy<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.190> max<00:00:35.399> all

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it should be really easy to max all

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.380 
it should be really easy to max all
those<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.160> emperor<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:39.000> couple

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
those out so the emperor has a couple

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.040 
those out so the emperor has a couple
different<00:00:39.450> attacks<00:00:40.820> he<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:42.000> these<00:00:42.180> gay

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
different attacks he has these gay

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319 
different attacks he has these gay
purple<00:00:43.440> lightning<00:00:43.789> attacks<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.030> he<00:00:45.120> does

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
purple lightning attacks that he does

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
purple lightning attacks that he does
and<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.110> block<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> trick<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and you can block those but the trick is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.470 
and you can block those but the trick is
that<00:00:49.670> when<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:50.850> blocking<00:00:51.000> those<00:00:51.270> with

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that when you're blocking those with

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.979 
that when you're blocking those with
your<00:00:51.600> lightsaber<00:00:51.960> he<00:00:53.480> they<00:00:54.480> take<00:00:54.719> away<00:00:54.840> your

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
your lightsaber he they take away your

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.760 
your lightsaber he they take away your
energy<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.050> can't<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.469> sit<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
energy so you can't just sit there and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
energy so you can't just sit there and
block<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.129> forever<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> kind<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
block them forever you have to kind of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.670 
block them forever you have to kind of
let<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.989> block<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> second<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.039> then

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
let go a block for a second and then

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.140 
let go a block for a second and then
reflect<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.830> purple<00:01:05.339> lightning<00:01:05.519> back<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
reflect that purple lightning back on to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.580 
reflect that purple lightning back on to
it<00:01:06.210> would<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.600> bit<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.869> damage<00:01:09.590> then

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
it would do a little bit of damage then

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.570 
it would do a little bit of damage then
he<00:01:10.650> has<00:01:10.740> two<00:01:10.860> different<00:01:10.979> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.369> purple

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
he has two different kind of purple

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.740 
he has two different kind of purple
lightnings<00:01:11.850> attack<00:01:12.090> he<00:01:12.240> has<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.540> where<00:01:12.689> he

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
lightnings attack he has one where he

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.179 
lightnings attack he has one where he
just<00:01:12.869> holds<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.290> down<00:01:13.350> constantly<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.100> then

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
just holds it down constantly and then

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.520 
just holds it down constantly and then
he<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.670> where<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:15.840> jumps<00:01:16.229> around<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
he has one where he jumps around the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.929 
he has one where he jumps around the
screen<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.150> dashes<00:01:18.150> from<00:01:18.299> place<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> place

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
screen and dashes from place to place

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.440 
screen and dashes from place to place
doing<00:01:20.939> purple<00:01:21.360> lightning<00:01:21.509> attacks<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:23.450> none

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
doing purple lightning attacks so none

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.550 
doing purple lightning attacks so none
of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> difference<00:01:24.840> between<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.200> two<00:01:25.380> can

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of the difference between those two can

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.800 
of the difference between those two can
be<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:25.770> helpful<00:01:26.330> I'd<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
be pretty helpful I'd have to do a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.929 
be pretty helpful I'd have to do a
little<00:01:28.200> bit<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> damage<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> Emperor<00:01:29.250> he

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
little bit of damage to the Emperor he

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.789 
little bit of damage to the Emperor he
brings<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.810> these<00:01:30.900> Imperial<00:01:31.470> Guards

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
brings in two of these Imperial Guards

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.910 
brings in two of these Imperial Guards
they're<00:01:32.250> pretty<00:01:32.460> easy<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> kill<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> force

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
they're pretty easy to kill the force

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620 
they're pretty easy to kill the force
field<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.340> around<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> room<00:01:35.909> isn't<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
field that's around the room isn't a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.010 
field that's around the room isn't a
like<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> bug<00:01:37.740> zapper<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
like a bug zapper like it is on the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.149 
like a bug zapper like it is on the
other<00:01:40.170> parts<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> game<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
other parts of the game is just more of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
other parts of the game is just more of
off<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.630> wall<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.329> still<00:01:45.509> effective<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
off a wall so it's still effective to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.210 
off a wall so it's still effective to
throw<00:01:46.140> them<00:01:46.290> against<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.950> doesn't

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
throw them against it but it doesn't

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.170 
throw them against it but it doesn't
kill<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.490> instantly

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.950 

I<00:01:53.230> just<00:01:54.230> get<00:01:54.350> good<00:01:54.530> at<00:01:55.810> reflecting<00:01:56.810> that

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
I just get good at reflecting that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.190 
I just get good at reflecting that
purple<00:01:57.350> lightning<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.160> can<00:01:59.170> do<00:02:00.170> a

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
little bit extra damage to him and then

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.550 
little bit extra damage to him and then
his<00:02:04.670> second<00:02:05.150> or<00:02:05.360> his<00:02:05.600> third<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:05.930> fourth<00:02:06.140> kinds

of<00:02:06.620> attacks<00:02:06.890> are<00:02:07.250> he<00:02:08.209> throws<00:02:08.479> these<00:02:10.959> pieces<00:02:11.959> of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
of attacks are he throws these pieces of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.400 
of attacks are he throws these pieces of
debris<00:02:12.320> from<00:02:12.830> around<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> room<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.490> him<00:02:13.640> oh
