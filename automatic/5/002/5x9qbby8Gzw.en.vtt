00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
person I don't have to go through that

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.300 
person I don't have to go through that
whole<00:02:21.790> hard<00:02:22.480> tough<00:02:22.870> learning<00:02:23.080> process<00:02:23.650> all

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
whole hard tough learning process all

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.520 
whole hard tough learning process all
over<00:02:24.370> again<00:02:24.700> mmm<00:02:25.630> but<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.050> said<00:02:26.320> in<00:02:26.500> your

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
over again mmm but what you said in your

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.650 
over again mmm but what you said in your
book<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.370> quite<00:02:27.610> clear<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.940> me<00:02:28.480> it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
book and that is quite clear to me it

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.600 
book and that is quite clear to me it
seems<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.080> when<00:02:29.500> you're<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.920> couple<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.460> a

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
seems like when you're in a couple in a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.300 
seems like when you're in a couple in a
committed<00:02:31.270> relationship<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:32.290> grow<00:02:32.680> actually

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
committed relationship you grow actually

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.150 
committed relationship you grow actually
much<00:02:33.730> faster<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.420> much<00:02:34.630> further<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
much faster and much further with the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.190 
much faster and much further with the
other<00:02:36.280> person<00:02:36.880> I've<00:02:37.450> always<00:02:37.660> thought<00:02:37.990> before

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
other person I've always thought before

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500 
other person I've always thought before
that<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.680> would<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.950> easier<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.580> be<00:02:40.060> single<00:02:40.480> you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
that it would be easier to be single you

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.820 
that it would be easier to be single you
know<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.840> sometimes<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.320> work<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.710> those

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
know and sometimes and work on those

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.550 
know and sometimes and work on those
different<00:02:42.250> aspects<00:02:42.700> but<00:02:43.380> being<00:02:44.380> in<00:02:44.440> a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
different aspects but being in a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.199 
different aspects but being in a
relationship<00:02:44.680> offers<00:02:45.550> an<00:02:45.760> amazing

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
relationship offers an amazing

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.670 
relationship offers an amazing
opportunity<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:47.650> grow<00:02:48.010> together<00:02:49.680> is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
opportunity to grow together is

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.920 
opportunity to grow together is
inevitably<00:02:51.310> because<00:02:51.700> relationships<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:52.660> are

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
inevitably because relationships can are

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.260 
inevitably because relationships can are
very<00:02:53.470> hard<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:54.040> mean<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.340> few<00:02:54.640> things<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.150> the

greater<00:02:58.270> pain<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:01.020> forces<00:03:02.020> us<00:03:02.170> if<00:03:02.560> you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
greater pain and that forces us if you
