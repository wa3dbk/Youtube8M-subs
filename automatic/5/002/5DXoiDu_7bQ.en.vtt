00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.439 
either going with they won't even lay
down<00:05:01.370> i'm<00:05:01.610> debating<00:05:01.760> on<00:05:02.030> though<00:05:02.180> if<00:05:02.300> i<00:05:02.389> should

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
down i'm debating on though if i should

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:03.790 
down i'm debating on though if i should
actually<00:05:02.750> build<00:05:03.169> you<00:05:03.350> know<00:05:03.410> some<00:05:03.620> kind<00:05:03.710> of

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
actually build you know some kind of

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.490 
actually build you know some kind of
Blastoise<00:05:04.280> egg<00:05:04.490> or<00:05:04.699> i<00:05:05.600> might<00:05:06.139> actually<00:05:06.320> just

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
Blastoise egg or i might actually just

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.629 
Blastoise egg or i might actually just
wait<00:05:06.860> since<00:05:07.100> i've<00:05:07.250> heard<00:05:07.370> about<00:05:07.520> the

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
wait since i've heard about the

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.790 
wait since i've heard about the
charizard<00:05:07.940> cards<00:05:08.510> well<00:05:09.229> I<00:05:09.260> really<00:05:09.650> like

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
charizard cards well I really like

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.260 
charizard cards well I really like
Charizard<00:05:10.280> of<00:05:10.400> course<00:05:10.639> like<00:05:10.789> I<00:05:10.880> said<00:05:11.060> I<00:05:11.090> like

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
Charizard of course like I said I like

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.570 
Charizard of course like I said I like
fire<00:05:11.419> pokemon<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:11.930> dragons<00:05:12.289> and<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.740> know<00:05:12.860> so

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
fire pokemon and dragons and you know so

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.390 
fire pokemon and dragons and you know so
I'm<00:05:14.060> thinking<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.900> I<00:05:15.410> might<00:05:15.650> just<00:05:16.190> wait<00:05:16.370> on

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
I'm thinking that I might just wait on

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.150 
I'm thinking that I might just wait on
that<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.199> probably<00:05:18.199> get<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.440> box<00:05:18.590> that<00:05:18.740> said<00:05:19.039> to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
that and probably get a box that said to

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.129 
that and probably get a box that said to
I<00:05:19.190> believe<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:19.639> march<00:05:19.970> i<00:05:20.360> don't<00:05:20.990> know<00:05:21.050> if

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
I believe it's march i don't know if

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.420 
I believe it's march i don't know if
it's<00:05:21.229> earlier<00:05:21.560> later<00:05:21.710> march<00:05:22.010> but<00:05:22.190> i<00:05:22.250> am

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
it's earlier later march but i am

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.950 
it's earlier later march but i am
planning<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:22.820> get<00:05:22.910> a<00:05:22.970> box<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.479> set<00:05:23.690> for<00:05:23.900> an

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
planning to get a box of that set for an

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.020 
planning to get a box of that set for an
opening<00:05:24.320> so<00:05:24.889> i'll<00:05:25.340> probably<00:05:25.550> smell<00:05:25.849> it<00:05:25.940> back

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
opening so i'll probably smell it back

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.219 
opening so i'll probably smell it back
around<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.300> charge<00:05:26.510> our<00:05:26.660> cards<00:05:26.900> which<00:05:27.020> i'm

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
around the charge our cards which i'm

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.779 
around the charge our cards which i'm
sure<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.620> lot<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:28.039> people<00:05:28.190> are<00:05:28.490> going<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.699> be

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
sure a lot of people are going to be

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.189 
sure a lot of people are going to be
doing<00:05:28.940> so<00:05:29.360> they<00:05:29.510> probably<00:05:29.720> won't<00:05:29.870> be<00:05:29.990> too

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
doing so they probably won't be too

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.930 
doing so they probably won't be too
cheap<00:05:30.500> but<00:05:31.010> i<00:05:31.039> think<00:05:31.400> that's<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.699> one<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.849> want

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
cheap but i think that's the one I want

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.700 
cheap but i think that's the one I want
to<00:05:32.150> go<00:05:32.270> with<00:05:32.449> I<00:05:32.660> think<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:32.900> finally<00:05:33.139> decided<00:05:33.440> at

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
to go with I think I finally decided at

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.219 
to go with I think I finally decided at
least<00:05:33.919> what<00:05:34.490> I<00:05:34.520> want<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.820> build<00:05:34.990> if<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.110> guys

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
least what I want to build if you guys

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.210 
least what I want to build if you guys
can<00:05:36.410> help<00:05:36.500> me<00:05:36.590> out<00:05:36.710> with<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:36.919> though<00:05:37.099> if

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
can help me out with that though if

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.029 
can help me out with that though if
there<00:05:37.340> are<00:05:37.400> any<00:05:37.490> cards<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:38.599> you<00:05:38.960> know<00:05:39.110> that

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
there are any cards that you know that

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.500 
there are any cards that you know that
are<00:05:40.160> already<00:05:40.250> out<00:05:40.460> that<00:05:40.910> will<00:05:41.060> work<00:05:41.240> with<00:05:41.479> the

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
are already out that will work with the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.909 
are already out that will work with the
recharge<00:05:41.870> our<00:05:41.990> cards<00:05:42.349> that<00:05:42.530> you<00:05:42.620> think<00:05:42.830> I

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
recharge our cards that you think I

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.439 
recharge our cards that you think I
should<00:05:43.099> probably<00:05:43.220> get<00:05:43.550> before<00:05:44.060> they<00:05:44.150> rise<00:05:44.300> in

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
should probably get before they rise in

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.000 
should probably get before they rise in
price<00:05:44.660> or<00:05:45.139> just<00:05:45.470> go<00:05:45.560> ahead<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:45.770> get<00:05:45.889> them

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
price or just go ahead and get them

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.680 
price or just go ahead and get them
because<00:05:46.190> I'll<00:05:46.310> need<00:05:46.460> them<00:05:46.669> tell<00:05:47.479> me<00:05:47.570> in<00:05:47.630> the

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919
