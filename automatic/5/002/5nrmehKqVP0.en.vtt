00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980
 jako txtr.com and now there will be 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:14.090
 though economic 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.090
 That was a wish from Paulus 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:33.030
 barrack nice wish a saucepan 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:35.370
 make and so I make the world wonder 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.649
 comes from manure learned who would have 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.940
 thought 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:50.969
 the value of at 7 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:01:02.489
 ok sugar-fat-sugar-fat mixture 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:07.020
 what is essentially the scrub 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.490
 and sweep the overflowed milk 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.840
 One hundred percent, you get it apparently 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:22.619
 not bleached out somehow so bleached 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:25.280
 almost do not care no matter I'm so slow 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.280
 is cold 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:47.020
 children are already looking at the jersey 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.020
 does not even look so appetizing 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.640
 there remains a rest in the can 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.970
 quite a lot of really nice to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.970
 Currywurst 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.000
 I make my name as to the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.000
 computer honor 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:39.470
 that looks very clear enough 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.770
 I would say or the heat 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.450
 evenly distributed it comes on 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.709
 on 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.709
 a little bit of rum cost here 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.230
 who really very beautiful very nice 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:59.940
 taste 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:59.940
 I mean, I earn so much 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:35.440
