00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.340 
will grow to the size that she means to
be<00:03:44.740> and<00:03:44.860> her<00:03:44.950> kidneys<00:03:45.190> will<00:03:45.520> form<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:45.940> fit

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
be and her kidneys will form and fit

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.650 
be and her kidneys will form and fit
worst-case<00:03:47.350> scenario<00:03:47.860> is<00:03:48.220> there's<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.300> chance

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
worst-case scenario is there's a chance

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.720 
worst-case scenario is there's a chance
that<00:03:49.780> she<00:03:49.900> could<00:03:50.410> need<00:03:50.680> surgery<00:03:51.220> at<00:03:51.430> three

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
that she could need surgery at three

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.570 
that she could need surgery at three
months<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.350> put<00:03:53.530> maybe<00:03:53.770> some<00:03:53.860> tubes<00:03:54.340> and

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
months just to put maybe some tubes and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.760 
months just to put maybe some tubes and
I<00:03:54.700> guess<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.630> avoid<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.050> blockage<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:56.650> the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
I guess to avoid the blockage but the

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.640 
I guess to avoid the blockage but the
pediatrician<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.490> talked<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:59.290> said<00:03:59.500> you

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650
