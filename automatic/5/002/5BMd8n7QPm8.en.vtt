processor and a jeep is their cpu and
GPU<00:02:21.300> they're<00:02:22.300> basically<00:02:22.840> called<00:02:23.110> processor

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
GPU they're basically called processor

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.760 
GPU they're basically called processor
and<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.800> video<00:02:24.010> processor<00:02:24.580> once<00:02:25.300> those

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
and a video processor once those

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and a video processor once those
cracking<00:02:26.770> overheat<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.310> stuff<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.730> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
cracking overheat and stuff like that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.260 
cracking overheat and stuff like that
that's<00:02:28.420> been<00:02:28.690> your<00:02:28.720> ps3<00:02:29.110> starts<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:30.030> not<00:02:31.030> work

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
that's been your ps3 starts to not work

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.030 
that's been your ps3 starts to not work
as<00:02:31.420> well<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:32.050> will<00:02:32.290> prevent<00:02:32.590> your<00:02:32.800> ps3

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
as well but this will prevent your ps3

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.190 
as well but this will prevent your ps3
from<00:02:33.340> mining<00:02:33.580> hat<00:02:33.760> or<00:02:33.910> whatever<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.870> when<00:02:35.050> your

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
from mining hat or whatever so when your

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.760 
from mining hat or whatever so when your
ps3<00:02:35.410> runs<00:02:35.770> hot<00:02:35.950> those<00:02:36.460> thumb<00:02:36.870> processors<00:02:37.870> will

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
ps3 runs hot those thumb processors will

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.400 
ps3 runs hot those thumb processors will
burn<00:02:39.310> up<00:02:39.340> inside<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.880> there<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.510> crack<00:02:41.230> and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
burn up inside of there and crack and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.020 
burn up inside of there and crack and
stuff<00:02:41.590> like<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:42.760> basically

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
stuff like that so this is basically

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.110 
stuff like that so this is basically
yeah<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.780> kind<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.140> waited<00:02:44.320> grunt<00:02:44.830> now<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.850> what

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
yeah I kind of waited grunt now so what

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.610 
yeah I kind of waited grunt now so what
you<00:02:46.240> do<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.720> get<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.900> standard<00:02:47.410> vacuum

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
you do is you get a standard vacuum

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.750 
you do is you get a standard vacuum
cleaner<00:02:49.020> without<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.320> tip<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.720> um<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:54.550> stick

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
cleaner without the tip and um you stick

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.700 
cleaner without the tip and um you stick
it<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.090> back<00:02:55.240> vents<00:02:55.630> your<00:02:55.720> ps3<00:02:56.050> back<00:02:56.470> and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
it to the back vents your ps3 back and

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.440 
it to the back vents your ps3 back and
forth<00:02:56.890> for<00:02:57.100> about<00:02:57.310> five<00:02:57.640> minutes<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.120> would<00:02:58.210> say

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
forth for about five minutes I would say

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.240 
heatsink of it I've asked for your video
of<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:19.180> basically<00:03:19.570> where<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.780> video

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
of it's basically where the video

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.890 
of it's basically where the video
processor<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.459> air<00:03:21.940> comes<00:03:22.300> out<00:03:22.510> or<00:03:22.690> whatever

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
processor is a air comes out or whatever

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.949 
processor is a air comes out or whatever
um<00:03:23.740> that<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.610> also<00:03:24.850> want<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.690> side

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
um that you also want to it to that side

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.840 
um that you also want to it to that side
to<00:03:26.230> arm<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:28.480> about<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.750> same<00:03:28.780> time<00:03:29.320> now

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
to arm for about the same time now

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.670 
to arm for about the same time now
exelon<00:03:30.850> surely<00:03:31.300> make<00:03:31.480> your<00:03:31.660> ps3<00:03:31.930> bought<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> lot

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
cooler and want smoother and the 1i

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.100 
cooler and want smoother and the 1i
quieter<00:03:35.500> if<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.890> have<00:03:36.100> out<00:03:36.490> ps3<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.690> runs<00:03:37.900> hot

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
quieter if you have out ps3 the runs hot

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.880 
quieter if you have out ps3 the runs hot
another<00:03:38.470> recommendation<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.820> um<00:03:40.860> get<00:03:41.860> a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
another recommendation is um get a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.330 
another recommendation is um get a
thermometer<00:03:42.310> arm<00:03:43.770> from<00:03:44.770> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.070> pick<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.310> up

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
thermometer arm from you can pick one up

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.240 
thermometer arm from you can pick one up
from<00:03:45.640> literally<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.630> lot<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.440> stores<00:03:47.680> targeted

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
from literally a lot of stores targeted

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.390 
from literally a lot of stores targeted
i'm<00:03:48.370> sure<00:03:48.610> carries<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.180> my<00:03:49.600> end<00:03:49.810> whatever

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
i'm sure carries on my end whatever

i'm sure carries on my end whatever
radioshack<00:03:51.400> possibly<00:03:52.030> um<00:03:52.240> he's<00:03:53.050> gotta<00:03:53.230> pick

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
radioshack possibly um he's gotta pick

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.960
