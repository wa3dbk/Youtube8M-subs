00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.300
 hello to all and morgane 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.889
 so today I was talking to you about 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.240
 composed of equipped so it's first I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.710
 wanted to thank everyone who is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.699
 subscribers to my channel or whoever 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.410
 just let a little 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.730
 comment or a little I like it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.410
 really enjoyable and it's really important 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.359
 your support it allows to do 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 know the chain and then also 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.170
 it makes me want to continue everything 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.090
 just so again not 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 continue putting gems and then 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.149
 especially share the videos to make 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.530
 know the chain it's true it's 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.070
 not easy to get a place on 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.710
 Youtube 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.370
 so if you like these guides do not hesitate 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.930
 not to share 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.480
 so we're going to talk about team comps 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 no it is, it'll be over there 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.879
 how to build your team for 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.200
 that it be balanced and that you have 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.870
 your chances against the opposing team 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.430
 so you know there are several roles 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.300
 compared to the champion in league of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 legends when you go in 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 the champions interface you can 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.809
 select precisely the mages the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.770
 distances the tanks so already there you 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.230
 noticed that there were several 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.690
 roles we're going to have next roles that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.240
 will be predisposed for this or that lan 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.460
 this or that way makes it the top 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.650
 the midel therefore obtains first 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.860
 box we're going to actually have curry so 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.439
 the one who inflicts damage a lot of 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.229
 damage at the end of the game 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.759
 so a curry plus a support so the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.890
 support who is the one who is there 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 precisely to help curry so the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 cari it's going to have to farm so pretty 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.070
 intensely it is the one who owes the most 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.240
 firm to just acquire the stuff 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.820
 which will allow him to do a lot 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.979
 damage at the end of the game and support 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.990
 he's here to help the square so 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.729
 he has to give him the kills and the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 leave the farm and he has to help 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.899
 just not fighting succeed his lane and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.470
 to stay the longest 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.180
 on this there so I dylan céline 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.430
 tunes but you'll understand then 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.440
 then what you need to know is the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.200
 support him so he must have some 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.510
 shield care skills 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.830
 also he must he must like he did 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.960
 you do not need a lot of stuff 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.030
 he must also take care of the world 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.950
 so as I explained previous of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.880
 videos on the weekend so the ward who 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.540
 will allow to mark the ground 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.240
 so in boots we have this double 7 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.630
 loses so carrie support so in quarters 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.150
 and you have for example km / h in support 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.590
 you have leona sauna jana you'll get some 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.530
 many others it's up to you to do 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.880
 your choice he pointed out and then in 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.970
 face you will find the same 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.660
 composition in general so a charisma 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.670
 and a medium in mid the middle way 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.380
 there we will have someone so often that 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.550
 is going to be a match simply if he 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.770
 needs a tribute in the team is that 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.240
 to do damage differentiate between 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.260
 physical and physical damage and damage 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.980
 magical that I talk about it in a 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.630
 next video 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.430
 the difference between physical damage 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.070
 magic damage and how to adapt 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.300
 adapt his equipment so the match that 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.910
 is going to be someone who is going to be able to 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.459
 stay long in his voice etc has a 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.709
 good potential for damage and especially that he 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.080
 is able to be autonomous and to 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.850
 quickly shift a top into boots for 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.650
 banks and to come create the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.450
 difference in top and boots 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.390
 it is also someone who often 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.239
 good control claude comtois how you 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.480
 in lol stopped from these a few a good 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.010
 control and who carbon women too 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.150
 it's still important the farm 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.060
 as I am already ten years old 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.250
 videos so mages and such 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.160
 you're going to have luxury harry nidalee you 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.049
 have seen in a previous video 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.360
 then we have the top so the top is 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.790
 someone strong who have to 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.290
 master his year and be a wall 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.690
 it's really he must he has to keep 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.360
 his salad and at the same time make that the 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.180
 the other top opposite does not shift towards 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.799
 the midd other because if if the top in 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.180
 face do not see any resistance down he goes 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.799
 not be embarrassed to go in me since 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.940
 will not be afraid to lose his lane especially 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.670
 if the scene I like their behind 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.860
 finally someone he will have to control to 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.900
 new so it takes control 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.459
 you have to have susten so high 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.319
 ability to stay on his lane that this 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.880
 either by renewal of life or theft of life 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.060
 and then we will have basically 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.330
 type champions so so type 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.450
 time as a fancy string where sion or 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.560
 type of tanks offer as long as it goes 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.900
 to be what makes it m 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.240
 we see that we will be able to bild in shape 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.070
 tanks but who have no skills 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.380
 tanks properly speaking for example 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.840
 from argus garenne from the tale I'm using 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.800
 also and that go from the power shot 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.300
 do more damage 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.850
 so that's where there is a small 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.530
 difference on the classic metagame on 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.260
 can do a composition with a mage 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.550
 instead of a tank that will allow 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.250
 to make of having even there is a 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.990
 advantage at the beginning of the game that goes there 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.400
 have a better rising of the stations a 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.350
 burst we call it on league of 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.490
 legends and kid we will be able to do the 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.350
 difference at the beginning of the game 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.320
 on the other hand a team so consult 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.720
 damages and a mii pity that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.920
 will be less resistant at the end of 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.600
 part 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.820
 so here it's up to you to see how 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.740
 want to control your party but that's 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.200
 true that the bild the compo teams 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.290
 with a corner time as much when a top 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.820
 and more resistant and more stable after 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.210
 with a mage you can create a little 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.730
 more difference then so for the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.010
 jam their uncle jang them get the 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.390
 whoever go so who farm with the 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.400
 monsters to young people as we already have 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.050
 explained percheron guide also on the 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.450
 gender when I have the opportunity 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.940
 when I have a good understanding of his role 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.280
 of jang so has the john their life is going 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.320
 have to manage formlessly on his own 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.670
 autonomy this is going to have to put the 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.590
 pressure using gang it's really 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.760
 very important because john when 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.320
 they do not count they do not have 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.700
 really of interest 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.420
 it's going to be a small teamfight bonus 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.810
 but that's not really what we 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.400
 research 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.040
 the jogger have to put us the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.770
 pressure for precisely there that nights 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.860
 would ever sell it on sanne 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.170
 award in an intensive way like that he 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.450
 pulls his money too much not his 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.940
 money only in equipment and then 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.050
 so bakr and the surprise effect so 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.190
 often 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.629
 the man their cd second when they 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.210
 are all going to be able to succeed their 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:57.069
 banks whether it's by so an effect of 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.259
 surprise that with designers 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.870
 like nocturnal yes and karim can darken 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.000
 on their targets or with control at 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.220
 again with gender as a mu who 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.690
 will be able to block their targets and 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.389
 that they will also have springs 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.180
 zone effect zone parties so 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:17.259
 this is so we summarize a moment corner 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.280
 majan top a mage in a thousand and a curry and 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.690
 a support in boots 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.099
 obviously as I said at the beginning 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.750
 you can have compositions 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.550
 much more original with for example 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.000
 a bot solo is someone who shifts in 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.080
 permanence in October made me type 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.639
 something that really worked 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.229
 but good after that you really have to be 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.849
 agree with your team you have to have 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.099
 really tested this compo so see it 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:38.409
 a meadow team pre built near 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.669
 but as we say otherwise you will not go 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:42.430
 be able to impose his on the team in 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.139
 which of course you arrive so 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.199
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:50.050
 help you in your games and then there 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.599
 do not hesitate to give me your opinion your 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.949
 opinions in comment so we know 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.500
 also that will serve 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.849
 and then ask for topics that can 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.529
 you who might interest you 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.599
 then I find very quickly on the chain 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:04.169
 and then on the always on the site will be 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.169
