00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
left behind it's really interesting to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
left behind it's really interesting to
see<00:01:09.360> how<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.630> publishing<00:01:10.229> companies<00:01:10.590> are

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
see how some publishing companies are

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
see how some publishing companies are
picking<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.760> fast<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.450> how

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
picking up on this very fast and how

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.030 
picking up on this very fast and how
some<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> them<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.140> trying<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.650> hard<00:01:13.770> but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
some of them are trying really hard but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
some of them are trying really hard but
not<00:01:14.369> quite<00:01:14.700> getting<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> ever<00:01:15.720> first<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
not quite getting it and ever first I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.810 
not quite getting it and ever first I
can<00:01:16.200> thought<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.680> making<00:01:17.009> book<00:01:17.280> reviews<00:01:17.640> on

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
can thought that making book reviews on

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.480 
can thought that making book reviews on
YouTube<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.320> useful<00:01:19.680> skill<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
YouTube would be a useful skill that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.219 
YouTube would be a useful skill that
would<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.759> able<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> future<00:01:21.689> job<00:01:21.900> but

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
would be able to use in a future job but

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
would be able to use in a future job but
seeing<00:01:22.439> how<00:01:22.560> many<00:01:22.619> publishing<00:01:23.100> companies<00:01:23.400> are

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
seeing how many publishing companies are

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.980

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
aware of each other because very often a

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.979 
aware of each other because very often a
lot<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.760> people<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.299> book<00:02:18.450> reviews<00:02:18.780> aren't

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
lot of people do book reviews aren't

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.089 
lot of people do book reviews aren't
aware<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.500> fact<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:20.069> just

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
aware of the fact that you can just

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.220 
aware of the fact that you can just
email<00:02:20.579> a<00:02:20.609> company<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.390> ask<00:02:21.659> them<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.049> can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
email a company and ask them if you can

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.809 
email a company and ask them if you can
review<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> book<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.159> I<00:02:23.189> think<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.430> reaching

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
review a book so I think that reaching

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.849 
review a book so I think that reaching
out<00:02:23.939> from<00:02:24.150> both<00:02:24.450> sides<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.109> vital<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.739> this

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
out from both sides is vital to this

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.530 
out from both sides is vital to this
development<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.909> couple<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.209> days<00:02:27.329> ago<00:02:27.450> I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
development and a couple of days ago I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.119
