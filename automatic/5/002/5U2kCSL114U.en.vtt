00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.650
 animals as an artist like me should get it right now 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.660
 in that direction yes you hear then you mainly see that you can here you know

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.270
 the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.220

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.050
 about 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.360
