00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
variation I want to try but this

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.520 
variation I want to try but this
technique<00:00:48.190> works<00:00:48.519> really<00:00:49.030> well<00:00:49.329> I'm<00:00:50.109> really

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
to have a look when we get to the 300

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.710 
to have a look when we get to the 300
degree<00:02:33.790> mark<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:36.250> are<00:02:36.430> at<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.790> 3:00<00:02:37.120> hour<00:02:37.150> and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
and get that full around it real good it

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.900 
and get that full around it real good it
doesn't<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.079> be<00:03:38.230> sealed<00:03:38.530> up<00:03:38.910> perfectly

tight<00:03:40.290> we're<00:03:41.290> going<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.500> poke<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.709> little<00:03:41.829> hole

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
tight we're going to poke a little hole

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.729 
tight we're going to poke a little hole
again<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.260> foil<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.239> reinsert<00:03:46.239> our<00:03:46.739> meat

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
again in the foil and reinsert our meat

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.710 
again in the foil and reinsert our meat
probe<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.959> make<00:03:49.959> sure<00:03:50.230> we<00:03:50.440> get<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:51.570> down<00:03:52.570> about

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
probe and make sure we get it down about

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.979 
probe and make sure we get it down about
mid<00:03:53.110> level<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:53.860> meat<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.850> we'll<00:03:55.780> let<00:03:55.959> it

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
mid level in this meat and we'll let it

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.240 
mid level in this meat and we'll let it
continue<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.620> cook<00:03:56.790> we<00:03:57.790> are<00:03:58.000> exactly<00:03:59.250> five

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
continue to cook we are exactly five

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.400 
continue to cook we are exactly five
hours<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.940> five<00:04:01.180> minutes<00:04:01.209> into<00:04:01.930> this<00:04:02.079> cook

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
hours and five minutes into this cook

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.390 
hours and five minutes into this cook
and<00:04:02.769> my<00:04:02.920> temperature<00:04:03.880> probes<00:04:04.360> reading<00:04:05.130> 197<00:04:06.130> so

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
and my temperature probes reading 197 so

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.810 
and my temperature probes reading 197 so
we're<00:04:06.579> gonna<00:04:06.700> pull<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.870> out<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.790> we're<00:04:09.790> going

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
we're gonna pull it out and we're going

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.720 
we're gonna pull it out and we're going
to<00:04:09.940> have<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.209> quick<00:04:10.510> look<00:04:10.780> here<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.799> take<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.459> few

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
to have a quick look here and take a few

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.520 
to have a quick look here and take a few
to<00:04:12.910> pitcher<00:04:13.269> readings<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:13.810> see<00:04:13.989> what's<00:04:14.200> going

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
to pitcher readings and see what's going

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.710 
to pitcher readings and see what's going
on<00:04:14.680> inside<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:16.329> pan<00:04:18.180> let's<00:04:19.180> take<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.450> few

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
on inside the pan let's take a few

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.479 
on inside the pan let's take a few
temperature<00:04:20.260> readings<00:04:20.709> here<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.160> see<00:04:21.310> where

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
temperature readings here and see where

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.960 
temperature readings here and see where
we<00:04:21.669> are

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.570 

it's<00:04:24.970> probing<00:04:25.479> pretty<00:04:25.780> good<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:27.340> I'm<00:04:27.430> going

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
it's probing pretty good but I'm going

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.250 
it's probing pretty good but I'm going
to<00:04:27.640> rock<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.030> up<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.479> let<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.720> stay<00:04:28.930> in<00:04:28.960> here

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
to rock this up and let it stay in here

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.320 
to rock this up and let it stay in here
another<00:04:29.440> 15<00:04:29.770> minutes<00:04:30.340> or<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.120> then<00:04:31.210> we'll
