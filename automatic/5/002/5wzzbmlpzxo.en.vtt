00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
something that really destroyed this

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
something that really destroyed this
raid<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.470> basically<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:23.630> when<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.810> release

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
raid so basically I when you release

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.450

wizards and arches the arches don't move

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600 
wizards and arches the arches don't move
off<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.079> top<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.950> wizards<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.460> witches

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
castle in a bad position and you have

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.029 
castle in a bad position and you have
arches<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:45.090> top<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.809> everything<00:00:46.079> else<00:00:46.469> 0223

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
arches on top of everything else 0223

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.020 
arches on top of everything else 0223
where<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.059> too<00:00:48.710> which<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.739> two<00:00:50.250> wizards<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
where it's too which is two wizards and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.830 
where it's too which is two wizards and
three<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.320> something<00:00:52.620> else<00:00:53.449> with<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> two<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
three of something else with a two to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.959 
three of something else with a two to
three<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.320> war<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> take

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
three in war you don't want to take

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.220 
three in war you don't want to take
arches<00:00:57.480> guys<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.890> want<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> take<00:00:59.370> barbarians

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
arches guys you want to take barbarians

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.510 
arches guys you want to take barbarians
the<00:01:01.230> reason<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the reason because of that is that the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.509 
the reason because of that is that the
barbarians<00:01:03.090> walk<00:01:03.359> away<00:01:03.719> from<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> CC<00:01:05.040> drop

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
barbarians walk away from the CC drop

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.350 
barbarians walk away from the CC drop
point<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:07.460> archers<00:01:08.460> stand<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.000> top<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
point but archers stand on top of

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.179 
point but archers stand on top of
everything<00:01:09.450> else<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.590> I'll<00:01:11.310> try<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:12.030> this

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
everything else so I'll try and get this

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.260 
everything else so I'll try and get this
nice<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.400> could<00:01:14.430> slow<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.760> down<00:01:14.880> but

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
nice if I could slow it down but

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
nice if I could slow it down but
whatever<00:01:15.869> don't<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.380> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> go<00:01:16.590> at

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
whatever don't really want to go at

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.429 
whatever don't really want to go at
ending<00:01:17.070> things<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.600> CC<00:01:18.900> pool<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.200> going

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
ending things so the CC pool is going

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.789 
ending things so the CC pool is going
great<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.720> split<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.409> everything

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
great so it's split up and everything

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
great so it's split up and everything
but<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> problem<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.210> right<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
but the problem is it's right on the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.640 
but the problem is it's right on the
edge<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> base<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.509> there's<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> mortar

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
edge of the base so and there's a mortar

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
edge of the base so and there's a mortar
up<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.229> pretty<00:01:31.229> much<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.880> whole<00:01:33.150> area

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
up here so pretty much this whole area

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.080 
up here so pretty much this whole area
here<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> cut<00:01:35.009> off<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.340> can't<00:01:35.579> drop<00:01:35.820> anything

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
here is cut off you can't drop anything

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.130 
here is cut off you can't drop anything
in<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.540> without<00:01:36.810> getting<00:01:36.869> wrecked<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.390> here

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
in there without getting wrecked so here

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.260 
in there without getting wrecked so here
comes<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> problem<00:01:40.799> arches<00:01:41.579> cut<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.030> so

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
comes the problem arches cut up so

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.469 
comes the problem arches cut up so
archers<00:01:43.170> come<00:01:43.380> down<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.210> they're<00:01:45.210> not<00:01:45.360> going

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
archers come down and they're not going

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.899 
archers come down and they're not going
to<00:01:45.540> move<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.320> there's<00:01:46.860> stuff<00:01:47.490> inside

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to move because there's stuff inside

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.219 
to move because there's stuff inside
their<00:01:48.180> radius<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.750> they're<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> start

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
their radius that they're going to start

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.789 
their radius that they're going to start
shooting<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.720> watch<00:01:51.720> these<00:01:52.020> two<00:01:52.530> was

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
shooting right now watch these two was

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
shooting right now watch these two was
ease<00:01:53.009> these<00:01:53.640> two<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.090> either<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.869> screw

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
this whole and tirade right so the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.179 
this whole and tirade right so the
Wizards<00:02:00.600> come<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.619> archers<00:02:01.950> still

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
Wizards come out the archers still

have turned around and started targeting
the<00:02:08.459> arches<00:02:08.819> because<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> closest

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the arches because that's the closest

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.940 
the arches because that's the closest
unit<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.289> them

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
unit to them
