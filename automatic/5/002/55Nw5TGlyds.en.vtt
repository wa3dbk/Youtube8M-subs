00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 Antoine Maschera does that, though 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.739
 would take a bit too long in this 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.200
 I just have a great video 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.100
 Seconds Singh was super fast 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.980
 So go or take the link 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.899

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.610
 Video wants to have happened and copied 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.739
 the link and now you go into that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.320
 program because in the converter 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.260
 already copy a youtube link 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.040
 and insert it like that 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.689
 Of course it is already there 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.340
 Checked how could an early start 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.299
 Do not do it for as long as possible 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.420
 button and that will be downloaded 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.330
 so now finished and how 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 have seen if the itunes window on 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.320
 So you have to open that before 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.360
 Are you looking for my iphone or 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.299

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.229
