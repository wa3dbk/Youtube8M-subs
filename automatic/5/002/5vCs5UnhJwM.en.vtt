to a speed of 56 km/h the results of the
test<00:01:46.010> was<00:01:46.430> very<00:01:46.730> good<00:01:46.970> we<00:01:47.840> are<00:01:48.050> very<00:01:48.560> satisfied

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
test was very good we are very satisfied

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.870 
test was very good we are very satisfied
with<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.400> as<00:01:50.000> we<00:01:50.420> can<00:01:50.630> see<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:51.370> most<00:01:52.370> of<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
with it as we can see the most of the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.660 
with it as we can see the most of the
energy<00:01:53.780> was<00:01:54.320> absorbed<00:01:54.500> in<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.100> front<00:01:55.370> of<00:01:55.520> the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
energy was absorbed in the front of the

energy was absorbed in the front of the
car<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.840> doors<00:01:57.170> will<00:01:57.650> be<00:01:57.680> opened<00:01:58.220> without

car that doors will be opened without
any<00:01:58.970> tools<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.590> restraint<00:02:01.250> system<00:02:01.760> performed

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
any tools the restraint system performed

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.060 
any tools the restraint system performed
very<00:02:02.810> well<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.710> can<00:02:03.920> see<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:05.300> apex<00:02:05.690> are<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.920> a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
very well you can see the apex are in a

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.490 
very well you can see the apex are in a
very<00:02:07.100> good<00:02:07.520> positions<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.910> are<00:02:11.060> very

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
very good positions and so we are very

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.880 
very good positions and so we are very
proud<00:02:12.500> with<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> results<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.640> test
