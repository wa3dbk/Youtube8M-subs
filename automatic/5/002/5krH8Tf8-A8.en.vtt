00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
both things at the same time for example

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.700 
both things at the same time for example
if<00:00:35.410> I<00:00:35.650> say<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.160> want<00:00:36.519> either<00:00:36.820> tea<00:00:37.269> or<00:00:37.510> coffee<00:00:37.960> it

if I say I want either tea or coffee it
means<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.280> want<00:00:39.640> tea<00:00:40.210> or<00:00:40.450> I<00:00:40.780> want<00:00:41.290> coffee<00:00:41.680> but<00:00:42.579> I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
means I want tea or I want coffee but I

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.180 
means I want tea or I want coffee but I
don't<00:00:43.059> want<00:00:43.360> both<00:00:43.660> tea<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.290> coffee<00:00:44.530> at<00:00:44.950> the

don't want both tea and coffee at the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.959 
don't want both tea and coffee at the
same<00:00:45.399> time

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.479 

the<00:00:50.510> word<00:00:50.719> neither<00:00:51.079> is<00:00:51.440> actually<00:00:52.309> a

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
the word neither is actually a

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.630 
the word neither is actually a
combination<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.050> words<00:00:54.260> not<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:54.980> either

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
combination of the words not and either

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.610 
combination of the words not and either
so<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.570> use<00:00:57.019> neither<00:00:57.589> to<00:00:58.070> mean<00:00:58.280> not<00:00:58.820> either

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
so you use neither to mean not either

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.649 
so you use neither to mean not either
the<00:01:00.620> word<00:01:00.860> either<00:01:01.159> is<00:01:01.579> used<00:01:01.969> in<00:01:02.239> negative

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
the word either is used in negative

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.380 
the word either is used in negative
sentences<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.190> word<00:01:04.369> neither<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:05.030> used

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
sentences and the word neither is used

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.300 
sentences and the word neither is used
in<00:01:05.630> positive<00:01:06.320> sentences<00:01:11.170> for<00:01:12.170> example<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.860> want

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
in positive sentences for example I want

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.280 
in positive sentences for example I want
to<00:01:13.399> neither<00:01:13.580> toasts<00:01:14.090> nor<00:01:14.540> cereal<00:01:15.080> for

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.609 

another<00:01:28.700> example<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.330> I<00:01:29.540> don't<00:01:30.049> want<00:01:30.380> either

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
another example is I don't want either

another example is I don't want either
cereal<00:01:31.400> or<00:01:31.580> toast<00:01:31.610> for<00:01:32.420> breakfast<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.860> has

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
cereal or toast for breakfast this has

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.429 
cereal or toast for breakfast this has
the<00:01:34.280> exact<00:01:34.640> same<00:01:34.670> meaning<00:01:35.330> as<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.840> previous

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
the exact same meaning as the previous

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.880 
the exact same meaning as the previous
sentence<00:01:37.100> except<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.970> because<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.409> verb<00:01:39.649> is

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
sentence except that because the verb is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.340 
sentence except that because the verb is
in<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.070> negative<00:01:40.369> form<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.210> say<00:01:41.420> either/or

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
you tend to say neither when the verb

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.010 
you tend to say neither when the verb
itself<00:01:45.440> does<00:01:46.070> not<00:01:46.100> have<00:01:46.280> not<00:01:46.820> in<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.539> you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
itself does not have not in it and you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
itself does not have not in it and you
use<00:01:48.229> either<00:01:48.530> when<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.190> verb<00:01:49.369> has<00:01:49.670> not<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.420> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.660 

normally<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.289> word<00:01:56.530> either<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.189> paired<00:01:57.610> with

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
normally the word either is paired with

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.670 
normally the word either is paired with
or<00:01:58.329> for<00:01:59.049> example<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.740> want<00:02:00.490> cereal<00:02:01.210> or<00:02:01.390> toast

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
or for example I want cereal or toast

or for example I want cereal or toast
for<00:02:02.680> breakfast

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
for breakfast

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.779 
for breakfast
when<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.079> say<00:02:05.289> neither<00:02:05.590> likewise

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
when you say neither likewise

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.109 
when you say neither likewise
or<00:02:07.000> becomes<00:02:07.899> nor<00:02:08.319> so<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.129> can<00:02:09.369> think<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:09.940> in

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
or becomes nor so you can think of it in

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:19.860 
or becomes nor so you can think of it in
terms<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.720> either<00:02:11.080> or<00:02:11.860> or<00:02:12.360> neither<00:02:13.360> nor<00:02:18.870> so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
terms of either or or neither nor so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.930 
terms of either or or neither nor so
since<00:02:20.140> both<00:02:20.319> sentences<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.580> exact<00:02:21.910> same

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
since both sentences have the exact same

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.880 
since both sentences have the exact same
meaning<00:02:22.330> how<00:02:23.019> do<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.200> tell<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.470> difference

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
meaning how do you tell the difference

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.759 
meaning how do you tell the difference
between<00:02:24.010> them<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:25.360> tend<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.690> use<00:02:25.959> neither<00:02:26.349> nor

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
between them we tend to use neither nor

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.860 
between them we tend to use neither nor
in<00:02:26.980> more<00:02:27.580> formal<00:02:27.970> situations<00:02:28.780> than<00:02:29.160> either/or

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.660 

so<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> previous<00:02:35.319> example<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:36.190> want

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
so in the previous example I want

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.120 
so in the previous example I want
neither<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.120> cereal<00:02:37.599> nor<00:02:37.810> toast<00:02:38.140> for<00:02:38.380> breakfast

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
neither a cereal nor toast for breakfast

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.819 
neither a cereal nor toast for breakfast
it<00:02:39.310> sounds<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:39.940> formal<00:02:40.480> then<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.840> don't<00:02:41.470> want

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
it sounds more formal then I don't want

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:49.740 
it sounds more formal then I don't want
either<00:02:42.220> cereal<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.120> toast<00:02:43.150> for<00:02:43.930> breakfast<00:02:48.750> top

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750
