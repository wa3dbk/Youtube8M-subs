00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.339
 it is a function a challenger is as it did before it has been seen in the of the 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.319
 advances 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.949
 the exconseller that a team 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.020
 the agent of professionals that are all the technicians that 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.360
 informative along with the marker 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.660
 get each of them for their work 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.390
 and make it a job 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.020
 this format is eta made 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 and the function would be 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.230
 and coordinate each of them 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440
 the technicians are the members of that team 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.150
 who are well prepared who knows what they have to do 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.380
 got to his job without errors 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.310
 was made of 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.860
 different 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.850
 hector will be informative 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.740
 ins a profession that has to like you 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.060
 because it is a profession that needs a lot of vocation 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.810
 it is a job what is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.000
 very stressful is a job that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.750
 the pp takes a long time is a very meticulous work presumed contribution given 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.260
 input 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.590
 at the level of professional development and at 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.800
 the staff too 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.610
 or you get when you make an informative the control of an event that 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.850
 it's done live 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 and what it really looks like from a bulletin board in the heat of a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.330
 informative is that immediacy 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 and the best thing is that that's getting 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.710
 what that expo point of small clueless orias become percent 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.810
 something that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 that people like to see that their method that is employed 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.040
 so that we work to inform as well as train and contract entertain 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.480
 now it's about formative exit plan 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.120
 other jobs have worked as a filmmaker also in other programs or 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.589
 all sports programs 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.339
 I come from that I am lucky to come from 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.969
 of the technique much later we come from where the technique in two we have a 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:18.879
 training 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.619
 He thinks it's very good 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:21.839
 the concept of 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.839
 handle all the equipment 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.809
 demand people 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:31.039
 of the different possibilities of the teams because we know them 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.629
 what I was missing but I think it's the documentary part is done by more than 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.699
 be more 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.669
 more preparation and with more time 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.179
 different media to the news 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.179
 and good and that day also there is like the whole state 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.789
 a film handler 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.689
 because you feel when you dedicate yourself to that function I think 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.289
 that's why it was all 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.289
 initially 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.289
 ng 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:00.549
 2 all
