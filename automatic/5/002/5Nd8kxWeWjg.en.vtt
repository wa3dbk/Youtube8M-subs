step one to look in processing the shell
list<00:02:23.280> clam<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:25.280> make<00:02:26.280> an<00:02:26.459> incision<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
list clam is to make an incision up the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
list clam is to make an incision up the
anterior<00:02:29.220> portion<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.820> mantle

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
anterior portion of the mantle

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.630 
anterior portion of the mantle
colloquially<00:02:31.050> known<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.590> zipper<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
colloquially known as the zipper and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.160 
colloquially known as the zipper and
continue<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.300> through<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.820> siphon<00:02:35.959> so<00:02:36.959> we

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
continue that through the siphon so we

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
continue that through the siphon so we
open<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> clam<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.340> at<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.480> point

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
open up the clam like so at that point

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.090 
open up the clam like so at that point
we<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.989> remove<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.410> gills<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:40.950> are

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520

exactly<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.790> silent<00:03:54.090> method<00:03:54.720> of

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
exactly it's a silent method of

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.130 
exactly it's a silent method of
delivering<00:03:55.230> gimmies<00:03:55.680> know<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:57.450> was<00:03:57.630> quite

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
delivering gimmies know that was quite

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.130 
delivering gimmies know that was quite
exciting<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.860> think<00:03:59.280> like<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> pre<00:04:00.450> skeletal

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
exciting I think like a pre skeletal

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.410 
exciting I think like a pre skeletal
structure<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.650> gives<00:04:02.040> them<00:04:02.160> sort<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.459> rigid

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
structure it gives them sort of rigid

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.130 
structure it gives them sort of rigid
and<00:04:04.070> one<00:04:05.070> ice<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.970> foot<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.420> propel<00:04:07.019> off

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
and one ice for the foot to propel off

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.870 
and one ice for the foot to propel off
of<00:04:07.350> perhaps<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.890> believe<00:04:08.310> what<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.580> is<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.850> fact

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
of perhaps I believe what it is in fact

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.620 
of perhaps I believe what it is in fact
is<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.930> sack<00:04:10.680> full<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.160> enzymes<00:04:11.640> hope<00:04:12.209> using<00:04:12.570> the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
is a sack full of enzymes hope using the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.729 
is a sack full of enzymes hope using the
digestion<00:04:13.050> okay<00:04:14.030> what<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.450> do<00:04:15.739> razor

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
digestion okay what I like to do razor

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.590 
digestion okay what I like to do razor
