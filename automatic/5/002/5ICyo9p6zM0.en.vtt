00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
psychological peg so I think this is

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.390 
psychological peg so I think this is
what<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.380> at<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.620> club<00:04:39.860> they<00:04:40.100> come<00:04:40.280> and

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
what I do so at the club they come and

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.500 
what I do so at the club they come and
they<00:04:40.460> want<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.700> dance<00:04:40.850> with<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.120> other<00:04:41.300> check

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
they want to dance with the other check

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:51.150 
they want to dance with the other check
you<00:04:41.600> out<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:43.060> then<00:04:44.060> they<00:04:44.240> roll<00:04:44.450> up<00:04:44.480> on<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.189 

they<00:04:52.160> don't<00:04:52.190> even<00:04:52.430> look<00:04:52.700> at<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:52.940> at<00:04:53.090> all<00:04:53.120> ages

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.719
