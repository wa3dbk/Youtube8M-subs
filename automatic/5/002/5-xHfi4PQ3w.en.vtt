00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.700 

and<00:01:25.340> everyone<00:01:26.090> knows<00:01:26.330> maybe<00:01:26.990> that's<00:01:27.440> why<00:01:27.680> I

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
and everyone knows maybe that's why I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.810 
and everyone knows maybe that's why I
can<00:01:28.100> never<00:01:28.130> get<00:01:28.820> low<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:30.140> barely<00:01:30.380> remember

most<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.900> next<00:01:33.229> trend<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.619> probably<00:01:34.160> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
most of the next trend is probably the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.310 
most of the next trend is probably the
girliest<00:01:34.820> out<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> bunch<00:01:35.540> but<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:35.900> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
girliest out of the bunch but it's the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.190 
girliest out of the bunch but it's the
floral<00:01:36.740> romper<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:38.240> like<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.660> specific

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
floral romper and I like this specific

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.510 
floral romper and I like this specific
problem<00:01:39.380> because<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.920> colors<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.400> the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
problem because the colors of the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.030 
problem because the colors of the
flowers<00:01:40.729> give<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.119> bit<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.479> sass<00:01:41.810> yet<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.770> black

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
flowers give a bit of sass yet the black

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:53.910 
flowers give a bit of sass yet the black
edges<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:43.820> up<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:44.030> little<00:01:44.240> bit

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.830

out the strappy heels for platform

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.859 
out the strappy heels for platform
booties<00:02:04.039> I<00:02:04.250> choked<00:02:04.820> on<00:02:04.969> a<00:02:05.000> lightweight<00:02:05.450> long

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869

edgy<00:02:08.660> jacket<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.170> know<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.590> more<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:09.860> a

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
edgy jacket I know this is more like a

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.559 
edgy jacket I know this is more like a
nighttime<00:02:10.429> look<00:02:10.849> but<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.150> think<00:02:11.450> it's

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
nighttime look but I think it's

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:26.730 
nighttime look but I think it's
appropriate<00:02:11.870> for<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.410> fall<00:02:12.620> time

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.390 

Oh

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.470 

and<00:02:35.409> the<00:02:36.409> next<00:02:36.650> trend<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.670> overalls<00:02:38.239> and

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
and the next trend is the overalls and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.600 
and the next trend is the overalls and
this<00:02:38.750> outfit<00:02:39.170> was<00:02:39.379> kind<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.799> inspired<00:02:40.069> by<00:02:40.579> a
