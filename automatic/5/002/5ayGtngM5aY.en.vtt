you<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.560> pull<00:03:02.889> on<00:03:02.919> this<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.459> then<00:03:03.579> pull<00:03:03.790> this

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
you just pull on this and then pull this

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:11.069 
you just pull on this and then pull this
out<00:03:05.579> but<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.849> depth<00:03:09.849> of<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.269> going<00:03:10.569> into

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
out but the depth of this going into

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.990 
out but the depth of this going into
this<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.439> very<00:03:11.709> deep<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.189> hard<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:12.669> have<00:03:12.879> it

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
this is very deep it's hard to have it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 
this is very deep it's hard to have it
happen<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.109> really<00:03:14.290> have<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.439> pull<00:03:14.709> hard

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
happen so you really have to pull hard

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.559 
happen so you really have to pull hard
on<00:03:15.129> this<00:03:15.280> because<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:15.639> got<00:03:15.760> counter<00:03:16.239> spring

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
on this because it's got counter spring

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.770 
on this because it's got counter spring
in<00:03:16.689> there<00:03:16.930> that's<00:03:17.799> very<00:03:17.919> very<00:03:18.609> tough<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.359> it's

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
in there that's very very tough and it's

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.030 
in there that's very very tough and it's
going<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.930> take<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.079> few<00:03:20.349> years<00:03:20.409> before<00:03:20.889> this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
going to take a few years before this

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.319 
going to take a few years before this
ever<00:03:21.220> gets<00:03:21.430> weak<00:03:21.609> enough<00:03:21.879> to<00:03:21.940> get<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.239> replace

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
Reese's design really well this is the

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:38.810 
Reese's design really well this is the

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
I mean a simple push that button which

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.190 
I mean a simple push that button which
is<00:06:41.040> almost<00:06:41.490> at<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:41.850> very<00:06:42.030> top<00:06:42.330> of<00:06:42.390> that<00:06:42.660> area

and off it comes into the ground it goes

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.400 
and off it comes into the ground it goes
dumb<00:06:47.490> design<00:06:47.820> best<00:06:48.360> design<00:06:48.690> I<00:06:48.720> think<00:06:48.780> find<00:06:49.200> all
