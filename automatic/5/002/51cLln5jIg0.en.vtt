00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
 how about good friends that a video about 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.740
 how to make a polyhedron 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.870
 what would origami be and hear what it is 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.780
 well let's say the art of folding paper 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.940
 a way to achieve a form and good 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.090
 to put together this skirt in this case a 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.619
 cube in sections six modules to make 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.169
 the six equal faces and good you 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.149
 they will say that it is a model when a model 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.250
 is each party that has equipment before this 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:30.759
 green this line that are here for 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.160
 form them by folding the one on top of 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:38.850
 others with respective to form a 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.120
 figure and obviously the paper is needed 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.809
 paper 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.809
 in telecinco 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 the square hills as far as possible is 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.030
 our good world we are six modules 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.770
 so they started doubling in the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.790
 needle right in the middle 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.790
 the double 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 What we can say is that they work 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.140
 here in that root 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:38.020
 and it's good that we have this we can 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 bend the side of each corner like this to 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 that we stay like this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.570
 I think we're going to do it's going to double 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.260
 again as window and space a 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.260
 large space 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.060
 we can know then make it fold like this 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.060
 in this way 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.680
 each side and thus be able to lie down 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.910
 we just turn the corners 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.880
 we will have a chrome figure and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.860
 this space that we have here the double 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.860
 what is to put the point 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.579
 and then we're going to fold the other end and 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.909
 We want to double the points 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.909
 behind 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.290
 5 more of different color you 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.100
 and well the next thing was going to be that I 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.610
 when we have the other module that 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.750
 know base and putting them 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.790
 america come flying in all sachets 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.530
 It's basic to be clear that you can not 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.660
 none of these are covered or 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.520
 slow on the outside 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.080
 and good for example here we are going to grab 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.970
 other 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.270
 let's put it in the visit of 10 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.550
 tracks 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.270
 well all that have out none 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.410
 cover of this one as they come together is what 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.030
 what are we going to do is going to be put in 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.690
 this adult 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.910
 so in this way 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.740
 no one inside a cover 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.840
 and one we are going to give the next color 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.180
 color that we hope 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.990
 and we are going to want to put it here 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.690
 in this 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.220
 and as you can see this is outside 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.900
 it's the only thing I want to put in 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.870
 the bag here as you put it together 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.470
 we are staying like this 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.350
 two 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.940
 and later 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.370
 here as you can see with those who 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.920
 it means that there obviously it is necessary 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.230
 one 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.599
 what we do is going to be here we go 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.599
 to float 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.879
 and this this is what should not be left 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.220
 inside is the only thing we're going to do 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.280
 to be taking out those that take away the space 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.020
 that are left we put it 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.780
 we have to tighten everything 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.030
 us so that it does not go away to do more and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.359
 the latter is simply the last one 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.580
 we are what we remember 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.590
 and in patients we put it 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.970
 and if we also take out because he should not 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.430
 that inside 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.930
 and here they have three easy kilometers of 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.509
 here 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.229
 and this obviously the only thing we're going to 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.229
 do 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:53.800
 we already told it a bit as a result of 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.980
 the details 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.930
 well, it's done 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.290
 the colors because it depends on how 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.290
 you want to see it here here 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.860
 you have to see hidden then what 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.860
 we must avoid 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.830
 we put that back then what 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.270
 we are is nothing more to put it in each 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.710
 little bag that you see well there goes 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.520
 already as you squeeze it mind in the 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.949
 details they want 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.949
 and with this says our cube 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.750
 we have them because I have served them 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:37.060
 he liked so many thanks we are 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.060
 to serve them and see you later
