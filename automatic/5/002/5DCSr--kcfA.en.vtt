00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello everyone decided to gash short 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.990
 video in addition to the previous release 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.490
 as a reaction to some comments 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.990
 bryliki i call 490 motto canyon and 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 comments wrote process 1 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.350
 It created the series and it's just refresh Haslam 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.060
 and really valuable for a long time 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.859
 canyon only two models for 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.420
 enthusiasts 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.759
 4 690 such 4 790 cue they differ 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 power system and improved 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.239
 thermal interface under the cover at 4,790 per 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.460
 the mountains are often there honest and elevated 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.680
 tension hydra 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.440
 seemingly leaks below pebbles more 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.100
 high-quality crystal 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.289
 should be identical with the usual x 40 here 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 the image where the ordinary are compared 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:05.610
 special has been catching flash special changes 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:08.970
 can not see this screen 4 590 from the store until 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.900
 this is the usual quarrels fresh now 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.860
 look at the slide well as canyon 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.540
 it is noticeable that the ceramic elements 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 arranged differently or more 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.250
 It looks like there are external signs 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.720
 improved power system 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.759
 now compare this image with 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.439
 the appearance of my process is previous 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 video where I filmed on camera 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.040
 substrate what it looks like your attention 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.770
 what exactly get out with very fresh 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.570
 bought in just a couple of months ago 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.450
 In general, I have an assumption that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.350
 intel quietly translated hasana new 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.350
 design 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.280
 lamp gallon or some hasla 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.960
 Refresh 2 and surely I can not say 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.930
 I looked and did not find the official 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.259
 information about this but external 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.330
 this is exactly the canyon possibly gave 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.360
 perfectly understood that thermal grease is not 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.239
 more like thermal insulation and decided 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.800
 do not advertise the change of packaging and may not 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.430
 wanted to draw attention from fresh 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.600
 brave and skyline more no matter you 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.600
 all the same dome 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.080
 and old new fundamentals because 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 alternative tnt no out of range has 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.880
 information please can 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.209
 write in the comments but indicating 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.180
 source let's clarify together 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 situation also if someone recently fell 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 haswell 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.430
 look at the position is interesting 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.799
 find out redesign wears massive 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.680
 a character or just got me 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.459
 unique sample also asked about 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.450
 Solder under the lid of the guys there is no one 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.829
 sailed every line so he even 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.440
 canyons are used by some kind 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.680
 polymer thermal interface but what does he have 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.190
 for property unknown processors with it 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.410
 steel and 10 to 15 degrees cooler but 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.560
 after scalping old special and 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.049
 replacing chewing gum on liquid metal 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 the temperature drops noticeably more 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.000
 in the canyons do not solder as before the body 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.600
 every screw buyer 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.160
 Children's gift is such a short movie 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.859
 many more were asked about the structures densely 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.239
 guys there is nothing complicated all 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.500
 look at it in detail let the review on 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.800
 motherboard 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.240
 Stretches accent will not block because 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.250
 that makes no sense the second time 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.580
 pronounce technical details when 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.040
 buying a look and 100 going to product with 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.470
 hands will be able to see the previous statement 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.230
 where versed on what you need 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.010
 pay attention when checking from shifts 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.480
 platforms basically don't change on this 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.480
 all and good luck to all
