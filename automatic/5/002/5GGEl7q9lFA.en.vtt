00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
Windows servers and how do they differ

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.839 
Windows servers and how do they differ
from<00:00:07.109> regular<00:00:07.319> applications<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.429> programs

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
from regular applications and programs

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.390 
from regular applications and programs
how<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.690> view<00:00:10.019> all<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.590> windows<00:00:10.889> services

installed on a Windows machine

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.680 
installed on a Windows machine
what<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> use<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.610> Windows<00:00:14.940> services<00:00:15.480> and

what is the use of Windows services and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.410 
what is the use of Windows services and
when<00:00:16.260> would<00:00:16.440> an<00:00:16.590> asp.net<00:00:16.920> developer<00:00:17.390> use<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
when would an asp.net developer use a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.740 
when would an asp.net developer use a
Windows<00:00:18.930> service<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> Windows

service and how do they differ from

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
service and how do they differ from
regular<00:00:24.300> applications<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.439> programs<00:00:25.650> a

regular applications and programs a
Windows<00:00:26.970> service<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.449> similar<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> any<00:00:28.050> other

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
Windows service is similar to any other

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
Windows machine these are some of the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
Windows machine these are some of the
differences<00:00:33.030> between<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.870> Windows<00:00:34.590> service

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
differences between a Windows service

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.850 
differences between a Windows service
and<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.700> regular<00:00:36.030> application<00:00:36.860> windows

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and a regular application windows

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
and a regular application windows
services<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:38.520> run<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> background<00:00:39.290> they

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
services are run in the background they

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.350 
services are run in the background they
can<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.590> configured<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> start<00:00:41.489> automatically

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
can be configured to start automatically

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
can be configured to start automatically
when<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> system<00:00:43.020> starts<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:44.219> don't

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
when the system starts and they don't

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.850 
when the system starts and they don't
have<00:00:44.670> any<00:00:44.940> sort<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> user<00:00:45.660> interface<00:00:46.260> for

have any sort of user interface for

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.940 
have any sort of user interface for
example<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.059> look<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.950> calculator

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
example if you look at this calculator

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.729 
example if you look at this calculator
application<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.719> has<00:00:51.899> got<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.410> user

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
application this has got a user

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
application this has got a user
interface<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.149> click<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.600> these

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
interface you know we can click on these

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.860 
interface you know we can click on these
buttons<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.559> perform<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.610> calculations

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
buttons and perform some calculations

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.569 
buttons and perform some calculations
but<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> look<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> vendor<00:00:58.920> service<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
but if you look at a vendor service it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.520 
but if you look at a vendor service it
doesn't<00:00:59.789> have<00:01:00.059> any<00:01:00.239> sort<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> user<00:01:00.989> interface

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
doesn't have any sort of user interface

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.049 
doesn't have any sort of user interface
and<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:02.160> always<00:01:02.309> run<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> background

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and they always run in the background

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.780 
and they always run in the background
and<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.989> Windows<00:01:04.650> services<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.430> also<00:01:05.580> be

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and they Windows services can also be

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.149 
and they Windows services can also be
configured<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.540> start<00:01:06.840> automatically<00:01:07.680> when

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
configured to start automatically when

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.880 
configured to start automatically when
the<00:01:08.189> system<00:01:08.670> boots<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.180> ok<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> next

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the system boots up ok so the next

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
the system boots up ok so the next
question<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> how<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.970> actually<00:01:12.479> view<00:01:12.840> all

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
question is how do we actually view all

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
question is how do we actually view all
the<00:01:13.799> windows<00:01:14.100> services<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:14.939> installed

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the windows services that are installed

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
the windows services that are installed
on<00:01:15.509> my<00:01:15.689> computer<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.100> very

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
on my computer you know that's very

provide core operating system features
such<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.840> example<00:01:49.320> even<00:01:49.530> logging

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
such as for example even logging

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
such as for example even logging
providing<00:01:51.000> security<00:01:51.450> error<00:01:51.990> reporting<00:01:52.710> and

they<00:01:58.020> should<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.290> Windows<00:01:58.799> Event<00:01:59.310> log<00:01:59.430> service

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
they should be Windows Event log service

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.929 
they should be Windows Event log service
which<00:02:00.540> provides<00:02:00.570> event<00:02:01.500> logging<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.790> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
which provides event logging so if you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.560 
which provides event logging so if you
look<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.710> services<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.090> notice<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
look at the services here so notice that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.960 
look at the services here so notice that
we<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.930> Windows<00:02:07.290> Event<00:02:07.619> log<00:02:07.970> Windows

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
we have Windows Event log Windows

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.369 
we have Windows Event log Windows
Firewall<00:02:09.270> service<00:02:09.869> which<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
Firewall service which is going to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.670 
Firewall service which is going to
provide<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> internet<00:02:11.220> security<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
provide the internet security and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.530 
provide the internet security and
have<00:02:12.890> been<00:02:13.040> dose<00:02:13.250> error<00:02:13.549> reporting<00:02:14.090> service

have been dose error reporting service
which<00:02:14.719> is<00:02:14.840> basically<00:02:15.200> going<00:02:15.439> to<00:02:15.709> report

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
which is basically going to report

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.030 
which is basically going to report
errors<00:02:16.819> okay<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.959> there<00:02:18.349> are<00:02:18.439> several<00:02:18.680> other

services as well which provides you know

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.199 
services as well which provides you know
different<00:02:21.980> features<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.519> are<00:02:22.670> required<00:02:22.760> for

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
different features that are required for

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.330 
different features that are required for
the<00:02:23.329> operating<00:02:23.659> system<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.319> most<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.159> these

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the operating system and most of these

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.959 
the operating system and most of these
services<00:02:25.939> are<00:02:26.000> installed<00:02:26.689> by<00:02:27.439> Microsoft<00:02:28.159> now

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
services are installed by Microsoft now

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.240 
services are installed by Microsoft now
sometimes<00:02:29.870> when<00:02:30.139> we<00:02:30.290> download<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.859> install<00:02:31.219> a

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
sometimes when we download and install a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.879 
sometimes when we download and install a
third-party<00:02:31.909> software<00:02:32.120> even<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.439> know<00:02:33.650> those

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
third-party software even you know those

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.039 
third-party software even you know those
software<00:02:34.459> may<00:02:34.700> install<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.540> services

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
software may install some services

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.800 
software may install some services
automatically<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:37.040> those<00:02:37.760> services<00:02:38.329> may

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
automatically and those services may

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.209 
automatically and those services may
provide<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.409> features<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:39.799> are<00:02:40.010> required

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.219 
provide the features that are required

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.280 
provide the features that are required
by<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.180> application<00:02:41.659> that<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.230> are

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
by the application that you are

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.520 
by the application that you are
installing<00:02:43.099> ok<00:02:43.969> so<00:02:44.299> basically<00:02:44.720> these<00:02:45.019> windows

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
installing ok so basically these windows

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.649 
installing ok so basically these windows
services<00:02:46.099> they<00:02:46.280> run<00:02:46.459> in<00:02:46.579> the<00:02:46.669> background<00:02:46.849> you

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
services they run in the background you

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.059 
services they run in the background you
know<00:02:47.780> they<00:02:47.930> don't<00:02:48.049> have<00:02:48.169> any<00:02:48.319> sort<00:02:48.739> of<00:02:48.829> user

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
know they don't have any sort of user

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.159 
know they don't have any sort of user
interface<00:02:49.639> and<00:02:49.879> they<00:02:50.299> can<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.569> configured<00:02:50.989> to

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169 
interface and they can be configured to

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.259 
interface and they can be configured to
start<00:02:51.530> automatically<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.879> how<00:02:53.060> do<00:02:53.120> we

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
start automatically so how do we

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.149 
start automatically so how do we
configure<00:02:53.930> these<00:02:54.079> windows<00:02:54.470> services<00:02:54.919> to

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
configure these windows services to

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.199 
configure these windows services to
start<00:02:55.370> automatically

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
start automatically

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.059 
start automatically
you<00:02:56.720> know<00:02:56.810> let's<00:02:57.019> say<00:02:57.109> for<00:02:57.260> example<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.829> want

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
you know let's say for example we want

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.949 
you know let's say for example we want
this<00:02:58.219> Windows<00:02:58.519> Firewall<00:02:58.819> service<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.689> start

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
this Windows Firewall service to start

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.440 
this Windows Firewall service to start
automatically<00:03:00.620> all<00:03:00.919> we<00:03:01.669> need<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:01.969> do<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.239> right

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
automatically all we need to do is right

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.000 
automatically all we need to do is right
click<00:03:02.480> on<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.049> get<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> properties

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
click on that get to the properties

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.699 
click on that get to the properties
window<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.579> on<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.419> general<00:03:05.719> tab<00:03:05.989> look<00:03:06.620> at

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
window and on the general tab look at

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.559 
window and on the general tab look at
the<00:03:06.829> startup<00:03:07.250> type<00:03:07.519> for<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:08.209> Windows

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
the startup type for this Windows

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.709 
the startup type for this Windows
Firewall<00:03:09.079> service<00:03:09.859> the<00:03:10.400> startup<00:03:10.849> type<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.510> set

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
Firewall service the startup type is set

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.500 
Firewall service the startup type is set
to<00:03:11.870> automatic<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.069> when<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> system<00:03:13.879> boots<00:03:13.909> up

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
to automatic so when the system boots up

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.719 
to automatic so when the system boots up
you<00:03:14.989> know<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.620> service<00:03:16.069> is<00:03:16.189> going<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.519> be

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:16.729 
you know this service is going to be

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.750 
you know this service is going to be
started<00:03:17.299> automatically<00:03:18.019> on<00:03:18.319> system<00:03:18.979> you<00:03:19.519> know

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
started automatically on system you know

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.089 
started automatically on system you know
boot<00:03:20.329> up<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.139> if<00:03:21.229> you<00:03:21.319> look<00:03:21.470> at<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.650> status

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
boot up so if you look at the status

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.469 
boot up so if you look at the status
here<00:03:22.280> look<00:03:22.430> at<00:03:22.519> this<00:03:22.639> Windows<00:03:22.970> Firewall

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:23.479 
here look at this Windows Firewall

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.020 
here look at this Windows Firewall
is<00:03:23.659> already<00:03:24.109> started<00:03:24.620> because<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.519> startup

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
is already started because the startup

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.719 
is already started because the startup
type<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.690> automatic<00:03:27.379> on<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:28.069> other<00:03:28.189> hand<00:03:28.459> if

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:28.729 
type is automatic on the other hand if

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.599 
type is automatic on the other hand if
we<00:03:28.970> choose<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.569> startup<00:03:30.019> type<00:03:30.319> as<00:03:30.530> manual<00:03:31.099> you

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
we choose the startup type as manual you

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.759 
we choose the startup type as manual you
know<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:32.359> service<00:03:32.780> will<00:03:32.959> not<00:03:33.169> be<00:03:33.349> started

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
know this service will not be started

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.339 
know this service will not be started
automatically<00:03:34.370> we<00:03:34.970> have<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.449> manually<00:03:35.930> start

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
automatically we have to manually start

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.319 
automatically we have to manually start
the<00:03:36.560> service<00:03:36.829> for<00:03:37.099> example<00:03:37.159> if<00:03:37.939> you<00:03:38.090> look<00:03:38.180> at

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
the service for example if you look at

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.750 
the service for example if you look at
this<00:03:38.479> Windows<00:03:38.840> card<00:03:39.169> space<00:03:39.500> service<00:03:40.040> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
this Windows card space service the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.969 
this Windows card space service the
startup<00:03:41.150> type<00:03:41.359> is<00:03:41.540> manual<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.439> this<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.799> not

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
startup type is manual so this is not

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.469 
startup type is manual so this is not
going<00:03:43.189> to<00:03:43.370> be<00:03:43.459> started<00:03:43.849> up<00:03:43.909> automatically

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
going to be started up automatically

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.569 
going to be started up automatically
when<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.169> system<00:03:45.560> starts<00:03:46.040> we<00:03:46.400> need<00:03:46.430> to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
when the system starts we need to

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.069 
when the system starts we need to
right-click<00:03:46.909> on<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:47.540> select<00:03:47.810> this

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
right-click on that and select this

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.399 
right-click on that and select this
option<00:03:48.319> start<00:03:49.329> ok<00:03:50.329> similarly<00:03:50.780> if<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.139> want<00:03:51.169> to

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
option start ok similarly if you want to

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.830

is<00:04:39.380> when<00:04:39.710> would<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.040> dotnet<00:04:40.490> developer<00:04:41.150> or<00:04:41.330> an

is when would a dotnet developer or an

is when would a dotnet developer or an
asp.net<00:04:42.260> developer<00:04:42.620> use<00:04:43.340> event<00:04:43.670> or<00:04:43.820> service

asp.net developer use event or service

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.840 
asp.net developer use event or service
in<00:04:44.720> general<00:04:45.110> we<00:04:45.890> should<00:04:45.920> create<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.490> Windows

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
in general we should create a Windows

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.730 
in general we should create a Windows
service<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.540> run<00:04:47.720> code<00:04:48.020> in<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.290> background

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
service to run code in the background

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.190 
service to run code in the background
all<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.280> time<00:04:49.520> without<00:04:50.060> any<00:04:50.480> sort<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.960> user

all the time without any sort of user
interaction<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:52.430> obviously<00:04:52.970> when<00:04:53.810> we<00:04:53.990> said

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
interaction so obviously when we said

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.360 
interaction so obviously when we said
you<00:04:54.740> know<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.520> startup<00:04:56.120> type<00:04:56.950> for<00:04:57.950> a<00:04:57.980> Windows

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370

you know the startup type for a Windows
Services<00:04:58.850> automatic<00:04:59.540> you<00:05:00.020> know<00:05:00.200> when<00:05:00.560> we<00:05:00.790> boot

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790

up the computer the service is going to

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.750 
up the computer the service is going to
start<00:05:03.740> automatically

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
start automatically

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.660

so<00:05:12.770> if<00:05:12.890> at<00:05:13.070> all<00:05:13.160> if<00:05:13.340> there<00:05:13.460> is<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.640> need<00:05:14.060> for<00:05:14.360> you

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
so if at all if there is a need for you

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.600 
so if at all if there is a need for you
you<00:05:15.350> know<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.530> execute<00:05:16.070> code<00:05:16.370> in<00:05:16.520> the

you know to execute code in the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.010 
you know to execute code in the
background<00:05:17.030> all<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.600> time

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020

without any sort of user interface

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.090 
without any sort of user interface
intervention<00:05:20.780> that's<00:05:21.380> when<00:05:21.590> we<00:05:21.740> actually

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
intervention that's when we actually

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.570 
intervention that's when we actually
create<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.430> vendor<00:05:22.850> service<00:05:23.500> okay<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:25.010> for

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
create a vendor service okay so for

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.520 
create a vendor service okay so for
example<00:05:25.610> what<00:05:26.150> we<00:05:26.300> can<00:05:26.540> do<00:05:26.750> is<00:05:26.930> we<00:05:27.140> can<00:05:27.320> create

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
example what we can do is we can create

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.490 
example what we can do is we can create
a<00:05:27.710> vendor<00:05:28.040> service<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.940> host<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.419> WCF<00:05:30.020> servers

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
a vendor service to host it WCF servers

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.980 
a vendor service to host it WCF servers
and<00:05:30.680> then<00:05:31.520> we<00:05:31.940> can<00:05:32.090> configure<00:05:32.480> the<00:05:32.690> windows

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
and then we can configure the windows

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.540 
and then we can configure the windows
service<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.530> start<00:05:33.770> automatically<00:05:34.310> when<00:05:34.490> the

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
service to start automatically when the

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.520 
service to start automatically when the
computer<00:05:34.970> starts<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:35.870> this<00:05:36.050> is<00:05:36.169> going<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.410> make

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
computer starts so this is going to make

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.430 
computer starts so this is going to make
