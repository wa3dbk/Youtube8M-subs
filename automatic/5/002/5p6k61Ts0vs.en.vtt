00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.569 

you

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
multi-dimensional but the weave the

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.509 
multi-dimensional but the weave the
goddess<00:03:40.930> weave<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.379> primarily<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.159> top

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
goddess weave is primarily on the top

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.130 
goddess weave is primarily on the top
and<00:03:43.950> i<00:03:44.950> did<00:03:45.310> notice<00:03:45.629> shedding<00:03:46.629> would<00:03:46.900> i<00:03:46.930> buy

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
and i did notice shedding would i buy

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.259 
and i did notice shedding would i buy
this<00:03:47.200> again<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:47.980> don't<00:03:48.670> think<00:03:48.849> i<00:03:48.909> would<00:03:48.970> buy<00:03:49.209> it

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
this again i don't think i would buy it

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.819 
this again i don't think i would buy it
again<00:03:49.420> primarily<00:03:49.959> because<00:03:51.810> there<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.989> a

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
again primarily because there is a

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.550 
again primarily because there is a
moderate<00:03:54.609> amount<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:55.090> shedding<00:03:55.359> which<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.409> be

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
moderate amount of shedding which can be

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.819 
moderate amount of shedding which can be
fixed<00:03:56.889> with<00:03:56.950> free<00:03:57.280> checking<00:03:58.139> but<00:03:59.139> i<00:03:59.560> don't

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
fixed with free checking but i don't

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.410 
fixed with free checking but i don't
want<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.489> go<00:04:00.609> through<00:04:00.639> that<00:04:00.879> extra

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
want to have to go through that extra

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.129 
want to have to go through that extra
step<00:04:01.659> for<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> price<00:04:02.920> i<00:04:03.599> would<00:04:04.599> think<00:04:05.019> that

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
step for the price i would think that

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.440 
step for the price i would think that
they'd<00:04:05.409> be<00:04:05.620> really<00:04:05.829> minimal<00:04:06.400> shedding<00:04:06.760> that's

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
they'd be really minimal shedding that's

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.210 
they'd be really minimal shedding that's
one<00:04:07.689> thing<00:04:07.870> with<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.139> goddess<00:04:08.500> sensation<00:04:09.069> now

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
one thing with the goddess sensation now

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.819 
one thing with the goddess sensation now
they<00:04:09.430> do<00:04:09.489> have<00:04:09.909> other<00:04:10.150> colors<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:11.560> other

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
they do have other colors that other

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.800 
they do have other colors that other
we've<00:04:12.250> companies<00:04:12.879> don't<00:04:13.209> have<00:04:13.480> necessarily

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
we've companies don't have necessarily

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.839 
we've companies don't have necessarily
so<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.950> was<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.220> other<00:04:15.250> reason<00:04:15.459> why<00:04:15.819> I

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
so that was the other reason why I
