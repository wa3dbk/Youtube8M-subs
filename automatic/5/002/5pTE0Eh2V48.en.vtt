which are just a 720p screen and was
released<00:00:55.940> last<00:00:56.149> year<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.899> design

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
released last year so the design

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.660 
released last year so the design
elements<00:00:57.590> it's<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.809> little<00:01:00.219> similar<00:01:01.219> to<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.990 
elements it's a little similar to the
galaxy<00:01:02.239> f2<00:01:02.539> not<00:01:02.840> not<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.980> same<00:01:04.160> as<00:01:04.369> galaxy<00:01:04.879> no

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
galaxy f2 not not the same as galaxy no

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880 
galaxy f2 not not the same as galaxy no
to<00:01:05.059> attack<00:01:05.330> which<00:01:05.539> had<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.930> much<00:01:06.440> more<00:01:06.619> curves

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
to attack which had a much more curves

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.690 
to attack which had a much more curves
on<00:01:07.789> the<00:01:07.850> four<00:01:08.119> sides<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.770> anyway<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:09.830> that's

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
on the four sides and anyway so that's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.109 
on the four sides and anyway so that's
that's<00:01:11.149> one<00:01:11.470> small<00:01:12.470> difference<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.160> it<00:01:13.700> still

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
that's one small difference and it still

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.510 
that's one small difference and it still
have<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.420> Fox<00:01:14.690> metal<00:01:15.140> on<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.950> sides<00:01:16.190> over
