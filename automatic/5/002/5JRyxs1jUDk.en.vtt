00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.210
 back the world we end up 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.980
 now for the second map that is 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.230
 vertigo then we'll see what they 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 give it here I really know them 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.430
 first seconds when these discover these 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 maps 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:31.550
 then the spawn that are still 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:34.019
 the same since we do not have here the case 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.989
 what are we going to do that I discover a 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.980
 little huh also it seems that this plane 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.359
 I'm not going on the same amount as this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.800
 plane I had seen it in the trailer of 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.539
 bo I think that maybe you can 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 to say something 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:50.519
 it was like a plane being transported at the beginning 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:55.379
 I do not know so I try to get around 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:59.069
 all this ok so well so this map she 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 is at first sight pretty nice but not 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.699
 spectacular to turn before I 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.699
 say nonsense I'm going to check 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.560
 his future behind you saw I had 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.290
 said no damage I was sure I was going 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.000
 coming from behind in addition we will try 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.620
 to go see the exhibition we are but 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.710
 this is a map that makes me think 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.960
 a little bit at a hotel in black ops 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.470
 one that was already basic in 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.900
 dlc 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.300
 we could think a little bit we could 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.040
 believe a little there is something to 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.780
 damn i know it's not serious cc to 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.100
 its excellent so I still like 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.250
 to tell you something is that 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.290
 in these little test videos 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.610
 discovery we dream of dlc that's what 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.130
 I do every month I knew it was 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.570
 not my specialty but for the dlc I 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.619
 have always done 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.119
 even though they usually have not 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.759
 someone who makes commented videos 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.340
 like that and it's just without debate 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.800
 or anything and it's good 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.259
 special today and it's special a 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.250
 times a month by the way then justice has 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.619
 still to clarify that I will also 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.690
 make a discovery are bi because 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.970
 I really am not a big fan 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.910
 of zombies I usually themes the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.440
 black ops first name but that's it 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.060
 will really make me want that I have 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.769
 since it was a little prison 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.269
 alcatraz and stuff me anyway 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.600
 really wanted to test then we 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.650
 will see what this gives and their second 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.650
 be careful the bar 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:46.240
 ouh there I fall good stick and I am 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:46.240
 fell that's how it is ok 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.510
 I was lucky there it's still 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:59.530
 fun little must say me something 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.530
 thing here apparently nothing 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:24.080
 ok rival no mama or not here to do 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.150
 something there even though I think that 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.730
 things will change 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.290
 yeah however changed go here it is 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.820
 this is this little video salsa 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.290
 also lets you see if you're going 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.200
 buy or not the dlc me 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.310
 personally I have given it 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.480
 that I do not know zone because I know 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.910
 that beats everyone can afford 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.990
 to buy them and so down each 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.880
 time well see small videos 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.350
 discoveries also happened it's 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.260
 mainly for that I want to do 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.940
 I want us to be aware of it 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.459
 especially for you to have an image 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.170
 first of the map that you can 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.550
 you say then is it worth the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.410
 hardly I buy it really want 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.570
 have fun on it or not it's true that there 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.060
 with the arrival of zombies that it can 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.770
 to be interesting since it has 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.840
 the air of really changed after the 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.540
 perfumer the map I do not know if a little 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.520
 perplexed for the moment because I 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.260
 see here you are studio you are really 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.820
 excellent 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.430
 but it's there for example I'm not I 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.959
 I'm not here it's good and it's 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.729
 pretty cool not that makes us another 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.820
 maps but it's not the one I prefer 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.169
 let's say will have to see afterwards but 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.210
 I often feel that for this 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:34.100
 who are dlc we have how we have 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.330
 waiting for his cowardice to test him but after 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.680
 we do not really tend to play it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.910
 a lot on it so it's clear that that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.630
 serves a little nothing 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.320
 you see things like that a pity 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.360
 that's why it's a little bit 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.160
 pity then we will end up 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.960
 directly after ben for the next 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.500
 map not what makes sense we were going to 2 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.930
 out of 4 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.030
 I can not wait to see what is going 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.340
 to give magma and I do not know how 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.590
 is called the other magma and I shake 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.570
 here it is again it is magma and again 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.870
 I think we'll see what happens 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.790
 looking forward to it anyway so that's 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.870
 we will find ourselves directly for the 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.870
 third map immediately
