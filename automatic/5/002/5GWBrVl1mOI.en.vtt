yet because it just got back but it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.410 
yet because it just got back but it
looks<00:02:28.690> pretty<00:02:28.959> good<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:30.610> usual<00:02:30.910> there<00:02:31.390> are

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
looks pretty good and as usual there are

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.009 
looks pretty good and as usual there are
the<00:02:31.629> amazing<00:02:31.959> pictures<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.810> here's<00:02:34.810> one

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
the amazing pictures in it here's one

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.819 
the amazing pictures in it here's one
it's<00:02:35.680> Isabelle<00:02:36.660> their<00:02:37.660> dance<00:02:38.079> class<00:02:38.440> i<00:02:38.620> guess

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
it's Isabelle their dance class i guess

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.020 
it's Isabelle their dance class i guess
i'm<00:02:39.099> not<00:02:39.190> really<00:02:39.310> sure<00:02:39.430> what<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:39.879> but

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
i'm not really sure what this is but

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.970 
i'm not really sure what this is but
that's<00:02:40.540> definitely<00:02:40.959> isabel<00:02:41.620> because<00:02:41.829> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that's definitely isabel because the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.080 
that's definitely isabel because the
performance<00:02:42.489> set<00:02:42.700> these<00:02:43.569> are<00:02:43.720> other<00:02:43.870> dancers

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
performance set these are other dancers

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.670 
performance set these are other dancers
then<00:02:46.090> here's<00:02:46.780> another<00:02:47.049> one<00:02:47.349> which<00:02:47.650> is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
then here's another one which is

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.699 
then here's another one which is
actually<00:02:47.980> her<00:02:48.610> in<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.690> pose<00:02:49.930> right<00:02:50.200> here

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
actually her in the pose right here

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.289 
actually her in the pose right here
which<00:02:50.950> i<00:02:51.040> think<00:02:51.099> is<00:02:51.310> kind<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.640> ironic<00:02:51.790> because

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
which i think is kind of ironic because

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.229 
which i think is kind of ironic because
it's<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:52.690> random<00:02:53.680> guys<00:02:53.890> I'm<00:02:54.790> assuming

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
it's like random guys I'm assuming

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.849 
it's like random guys I'm assuming
that's<00:02:55.359> her<00:02:55.629> sister<00:02:55.870> or<00:02:56.109> something<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.560> friend

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
that's her sister or something or friend

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.720 
that's her sister or something or friend
and<00:02:57.069> then<00:02:57.700> it's<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.120> like<00:02:58.540> yeah<00:02:59.349> and<00:02:59.730> then

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and then it's just like yeah and then

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.240 
and then it's just like yeah and then
it's<00:03:01.420> here<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:02.230> her<00:03:02.410> out<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.799> bar<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:04.019> this
