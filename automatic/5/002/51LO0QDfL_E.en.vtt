00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it's a chisel cabinet this basically

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.249 
it's a chisel cabinet this basically
came<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.669> necessity<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.210> I've<00:00:30.779> got<00:00:31.050> all

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
came out of necessity that I've got all

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.140 
came out of necessity that I've got all
my<00:00:31.320> chisel<00:00:31.860> scattered<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.400> over<00:00:32.430> shop<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
my chisel scattered all over shop and

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.030 
my chisel scattered all over shop and
needed<00:00:33.329> places<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.720> put<00:00:33.840> them<00:00:34.050> at<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.860> same

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
needed places to put them at the same

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.220 
needed places to put them at the same
time<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.730> had<00:00:36.030> also<00:00:36.360> been<00:00:36.540> working<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> design

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
time I had also been working on a design

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.250 
time I had also been working on a design
for<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.400> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> river<00:00:39.059> shape<00:00:39.510> down

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
for this kind of river shape down

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830 
for this kind of river shape down
through<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> center<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.370> table<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.970> so<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
through the center of a table and so I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.710 
through the center of a table and so I
did<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> mock-up<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.980> basically<00:00:44.970> had<00:00:45.269> some

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
did a mock-up and basically had some

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.400 
did a mock-up and basically had some
some<00:00:46.290> chestnut<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.780> maple<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.019> I<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.230> using

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
some chestnut and maple that I was using

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.130 
some chestnut and maple that I was using
for<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.800> mock<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.580> it<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.780> happens

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
for the mock up on it it just happens

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
for the mock up on it it just happens
that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.710> size<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> length<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that the size of it and the length of it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
that the size of it and the length of it
worked<00:00:54.719> out<00:00:54.870> perfect<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.710> cabinet<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
worked out perfect for this cabinet so I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.400 
worked out perfect for this cabinet so I
just<00:00:56.910> basically<00:00:57.329> used<00:00:57.629> those<00:00:57.870> dimensions

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
just basically used those dimensions

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.310 
just basically used those dimensions
built<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> frame<00:00:59.489> around<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.539> panel<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
built the frame around the the panel so

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.549 
built the frame around the the panel so
I've<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> panel<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.050> door<00:01:04.050> like<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
I've got a panel you know door like that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.710 
I've got a panel you know door like that
and<00:01:04.800> then<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.850> built<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> cabinet<00:01:06.479> around

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and then just built the cabinet around

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
and then just built the cabinet around
it<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.619> cabinet<00:01:08.160> I<00:01:08.340> wanted<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.509> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it the cabinet I wanted to do kind of a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.010 
it the cabinet I wanted to do kind of a
chrono<00:01:09.930> style<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:10.800> it's<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.670> top<00:01:12.539> and<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
chrono style so it's the top and the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.160 
chrono style so it's the top and the
bottom<00:01:13.259> are<00:01:13.820> flush<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.149> outside<00:01:15.270> face

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
bottom are flush with the outside face

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
bottom are flush with the outside face
of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.440> door<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> outside<00:01:17.520> face<00:01:17.789> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
of the door and then the outside face is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.690 
of the door and then the outside face is
flush<00:01:18.300> with<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.539> outsides<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:20.610> like

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
flush with the outsides on it just like

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
flush with the outsides on it just like
that<00:01:20.820> look<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.500> gives<00:01:22.649> it<00:01:22.800> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that look on it and it just gives it a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
that look on it and it just gives it a
nice<00:01:23.039> clean<00:01:23.399> clean<00:01:23.789> look<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.179> it<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:25.229> corners

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
nice clean clean look to it the corners

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.940 
nice clean clean look to it the corners
on<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.970> corners<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> are<00:01:30.689> dovetailed

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
on this the corners on it are dovetailed

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
on this the corners on it are dovetailed
you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.280> another<00:01:32.520> view<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
they go in the kind of drop in place and

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.389 
they go in the kind of drop in place and
they'll<00:01:56.340> fall<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.170> use<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.590> chest<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.250> on

the<00:01:59.520> back<00:01:59.700> side<00:01:59.909> also<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.720> some

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the back side also just for some

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170 
the back side also just for some
contrast<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.470> match<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> front<00:02:02.220> side<00:02:02.430> put

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
contrast to match on the front side put

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.030 
contrast to match on the front side put
a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.360> shelf<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> bottom<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.680> some

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
some more storage on the door that's one

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.960 
some more storage on the door that's one
of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.560> reasons<00:02:16.890> i<00:02:17.010> use<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> piano<00:02:17.549> hinge<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
of the reasons i use the piano hinge is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.400 
of the reasons i use the piano hinge is
because<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.329> much<00:02:18.540> stronger<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.170> i<00:02:19.200> didn't

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
because it's much stronger so i didn't

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.289 
because it's much stronger so i didn't
have<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.650> worry<00:02:19.799> about<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.459> was<00:02:20.579> i<00:02:21.180> need

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
have to worry about it if it was i need

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.710 
have to worry about it if it was i need
to<00:02:21.450> use<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.690> later<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.329> thing<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.570> i

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
to use it later on the one thing that i

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.570 
to use it later on the one thing that i
did<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:25.260> far<00:02:25.290> as<00:02:25.709> hanging

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
did as far as hanging

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.150 
did as far as hanging
on<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> wall<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.870> typically<00:02:28.470> i'll<00:02:28.620> use<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
on the wall is typically i'll use a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.090 
on the wall is typically i'll use a
French<00:02:29.880> cleat<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.720> back<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.170> usually<00:02:31.410> will

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
French cleat on the back I usually will

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.150 
French cleat on the back I usually will
use<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.670> use<00:02:32.820> wood<00:02:33.440> however<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.590> time<00:02:34.830> I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
use just use wood however this time I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.330 
use just use wood however this time I
had<00:02:35.790> basically<00:02:36.510> put<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> rabbit<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.650> depth<00:02:38.160> of

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
had basically put a rabbit the depth of

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.190 
had basically put a rabbit the depth of
the<00:02:38.460> box<00:02:38.700> once<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.150> made<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.630> decided<00:02:39.990> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the box once I made it I decided it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.530 
the box once I made it I decided it
wasn't<00:02:40.380> quite<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.580> deep<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.060> wanted<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.390> keep

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
wasn't quite as deep I wanted to keep

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.680 
wasn't quite as deep I wanted to keep
all<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.990> depth<00:02:43.170> i<00:02:43.320> could<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.280> only<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:45.300> just

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
all the depth i could so I only I just

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.300 
all the depth i could so I only I just
basically<00:02:45.990> flushed<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.590> back<00:02:46.770> out<00:02:47.010> with<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
basically flushed the back out with the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940 
basically flushed the back out with the
edge<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> rabbit<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.450> wanted<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.680> keep

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
edge and a rabbit so I wanted to to keep

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.310 
edge and a rabbit so I wanted to to keep
this<00:02:50.250> French<00:02:50.730> cleat<00:02:50.940> as<00:02:51.150> narrow<00:02:51.600> as<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:52.020> could

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
this French cleat as narrow as I could

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.340 
this French cleat as narrow as I could
so<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:53.040> low<00:02:53.220> profile<00:02:53.840> woodcraft<00:02:54.840> carries

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
so it's low profile woodcraft carries

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.800 
so it's low profile woodcraft carries
