line running through the mid foot
section<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.330> kind<00:04:34.539> of<00:04:34.599> give<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:34.930> more

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
section to kind of give you more

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.730 
section to kind of give you more
stability<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.900> little<00:04:37.900> more<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.560> a

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
stability this is a little more of a

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.790 
stability this is a little more of a
rigid<00:04:39.039> soleplate<00:04:40.440> especially<00:04:41.440> right<00:04:41.620> out<00:04:41.770> of

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
rigid soleplate especially right out of

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.700 
rigid soleplate especially right out of
the<00:04:41.979> box<00:04:42.190> as<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.639> can<00:04:42.789> see<00:04:43.030> very<00:04:43.780> hard<00:04:44.259> to<00:04:44.530> bend

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
the box as you can see very hard to bend

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.219 
the box as you can see very hard to bend
so<00:04:45.520> if<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.940> want<00:04:46.150> more<00:04:46.389> of<00:04:46.419> a<00:04:46.539> flexible<00:04:47.020> sole

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
so if you want more of a flexible sole

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.469 
so if you want more of a flexible sole
plate<00:04:47.379> this<00:04:47.770> probably<00:04:48.129> isn't<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.819> shoe<00:04:49.180> for

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
plate this probably isn't the shoe for

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.170 
plate this probably isn't the shoe for
you<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:50.409> talk<00:04:50.560> about<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.919> fit<00:04:51.099> of<00:04:51.129> the<00:04:51.340> shoe<00:04:51.550> it

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
you to talk about the fit of the shoe it

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.700 
you to talk about the fit of the shoe it
is<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.379> very<00:04:53.830> very<00:04:54.430> similar<00:04:54.849> fit<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.409> nike

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
is a very very similar fit to the nike

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.089 
is a very very similar fit to the nike
mercurial<00:04:56.830> vapor<00:04:57.870> but<00:04:58.870> also<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.919> main

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
mercurial vapor but also the main

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.890 
mercurial vapor but also the main
difference<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.639> this<00:05:01.180> has<00:05:01.419> an<00:05:01.539> off-center

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
difference is this has an off-center

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.589 
difference is this has an off-center
lacing<00:05:02.199> system<00:05:02.349> while<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:04.030> nike<00:05:04.479> mercurial

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
lacing system while the nike mercurial

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.959 
lacing system while the nike mercurial
vapor<00:05:04.960> has<00:05:05.500> a<00:05:05.560> central<00:05:06.069> lacing<00:05:06.460> system<00:05:06.610> so

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
vapor has a central lacing system so

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.029 
vapor has a central lacing system so
this<00:05:07.120> is<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.270> bit<00:05:07.479> less<00:05:07.750> customizable<00:05:08.560> but

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
this is a bit less customizable but

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.969 
this is a bit less customizable but
that's<00:05:09.219> okay<00:05:09.639> because<00:05:09.960> although<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.860> is

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
that's okay because although it is

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.800 
that's okay because although it is
similar<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.669> vapor<00:05:12.819> it's<00:05:13.150> not<00:05:13.389> exactly

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
similar to the vapor it's not exactly

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.520 
similar to the vapor it's not exactly
the<00:05:13.930> same<00:05:14.229> it<00:05:14.469> is<00:05:15.129> a<00:05:15.159> bit<00:05:15.669> wider<00:05:16.090> in<00:05:16.479> this<00:05:16.810> for

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
the same it is a bit wider in this for

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.719 
the same it is a bit wider in this for
foot<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:18.430> heal<00:05:18.460> area<00:05:19.469> this<00:05:20.469> mid-foot<00:05:20.979> kind<00:05:21.610> of

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
foot to heal area this mid-foot kind of

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.469 
foot to heal area this mid-foot kind of
area<00:05:22.030> actually<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.750> in<00:05:23.319> the<00:05:23.409> forefoot<00:05:23.889> it

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
area actually and in the forefoot it

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.300 
area actually and in the forefoot it
it's<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.569> bit<00:05:25.780> thinner<00:05:26.199> especially<00:05:27.039> right

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
it's a bit thinner especially right

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.820 
it's a bit thinner especially right
around<00:05:27.460> here<00:05:28.180> it's<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:29.020> bit<00:05:29.139> thinner<00:05:29.380> than<00:05:29.590> the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
around here it's a bit thinner than the

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.550 
around here it's a bit thinner than the
vapors<00:05:30.219> and<00:05:30.719> that's<00:05:31.719> about<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:31.990> for<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.319> fit

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
vapors and that's about it for the fit

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.249 
vapors and that's about it for the fit
you<00:05:33.009> know<00:05:33.130> if<00:05:33.340> pretty<00:05:34.180> much<00:05:34.360> everyone<00:05:34.990> will<00:05:35.139> be

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
you know if pretty much everyone will be

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.499 
you know if pretty much everyone will be
able<00:05:35.289> to<00:05:35.469> fit<00:05:35.680> into<00:05:35.800> these<00:05:36.150> unless<00:05:37.150> you<00:05:37.300> have

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
able to fit into these unless you have

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.870 
able to fit into these unless you have
excessively<00:05:38.139> wide<00:05:38.469> feet<00:05:38.889> then<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.400> would<00:05:39.580> stay

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
excessively wide feet then I would stay

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.730 
excessively wide feet then I would stay
away<00:05:40.000> from<00:05:40.150> these<00:05:40.449> but<00:05:41.020> if<00:05:41.139> you<00:05:41.259> have<00:05:41.409> a<00:05:41.440> little

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
away from these but if you have a little

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.070 
away from these but if you have a little
bit<00:05:41.919> of<00:05:41.949> a<00:05:42.069> wide<00:05:42.219> foot<00:05:42.520> or<00:05:42.759> a<00:05:42.789> tall<00:05:43.479> foot<00:05:43.779> or

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
bit of a wide foot or a tall foot or

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.260 
bit of a wide foot or a tall foot or
flat<00:05:44.469> feet<00:05:44.770> it's<00:05:45.190> okay<00:05:45.490> because<00:05:45.669> the<00:05:45.940> Nike

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
flat feet it's okay because the Nike

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.580 
flat feet it's okay because the Nike
skin<00:05:46.509> upper<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.409> very<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:48.610> stretches<00:05:49.479> so<00:05:50.169> if

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
skin upper is a very it stretches so if

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.019 
skin upper is a very it stretches so if
it<00:05:50.830> doesn't<00:05:51.099> fit<00:05:51.190> right<00:05:51.250> out<00:05:51.520> of<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.669> box<00:05:51.819> if

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
it doesn't fit right out of the box if

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.700 
it doesn't fit right out of the box if
it<00:05:52.120> feels<00:05:52.270> tight<00:05:52.599> don't<00:05:52.990> worry<00:05:53.229> give<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.650> a

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
it feels tight don't worry give it a

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.529 
it feels tight don't worry give it a
couple<00:05:53.889> hours<00:05:54.159> of<00:05:54.460> break<00:05:54.669> in<00:05:54.879> time<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.419> it

couple hours of break in time and it

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.740 
couple hours of break in time and it
will<00:05:55.719> fit<00:05:56.080> like<00:05:56.650> a<00:05:56.680> sock<00:05:57.099> quick<00:05:57.819> on<00:05:57.969> feet<00:05:58.509> I
