 classics endurance test there concours condition 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.810
 not really it's a bit of a project 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.740
 car but just as well 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.360
 we already have a few thousand 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.640
 driven a kilometer there are busy 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.110
 better to make a nice story but 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.970
 we also thought would like a really beautiful one 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.470
 taxis and see the affects of the received 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.340
 an email from classics this case how 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.360
 we 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.430
 let go for a ride with this one 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.930
 taxi and colleen escape the is with us

 and if someone in the car week 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.360
 action that understands the old 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.040
 English troops I mean old ones 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.040
 english cars that he has it 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.780
 Well 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.020
 well no so welcome aboard this 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.180
 beautiful English taxi on the license plate 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.280
 that for a 1974 arises so a while 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.570
 ago and welcome to it a bit 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.890
 the obvious question just go 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 anyway it was well for his 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.510
 time a little modern car 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.760
 to actually not been 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.619
 of course a bit of the functionality 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.420
 was paramount and yes most people in 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.060
 he had to be compact and too high 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.470
 agile and in a way it is 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.170
 year and many other things 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.759
 not there so yes that 's all 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.710
 less developed where not necessary 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.759
 just say how view that was in the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.590
 practice 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.750
 it's just a rigid rear axle and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.420
 separation action from a real ladder 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.850
 cecil cinderella on top 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.280
 diesel engine yes that she is wearing around 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.230
 but no more than that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.239
 really awful 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.890
 animal use yes you call the word god 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.030
 will him that I typify that car 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.040
 I also have some feeling of it 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.280
 amelsfort den hage reason and that is 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.720
 the feeling that has remained but we 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.760
 say give me a pack i look all hope 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.260
 gone because you and I are my only one 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.570
 leave the car at our address late 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.080
 because it has to be fine 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.690
 to tell 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.920
 as if as protests of how does it feel 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.630
 car where must go 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.040
 yes it is a bit of a conscious one 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.140
 of course you already step into nostalgia 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.820
 a yes anyway ride token to tell you 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.040
 invested with their vintage cars and there on the 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.720
 corridor 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.510
 running would say modern words 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.200
 for no meter it actually fluctuates 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.160
 either way it will not forward 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.890
 mess 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.900
 you feel the car and you go out 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.550
 can really keep the car under control 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.080
 hold without being a fat one 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.330
 sports car that is of course on 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.250
 also a challenge 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.290
 a coach has a coachman invite in 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.490
 thing that I am very special about 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.440
 find out about the action that does 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.640
 very good he really has a turning circle 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.040
 you can in a manner of speaking 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.000
 put a dime around 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.930
 how does distance do that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.480
 got 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.640
 they get their crazy steering results 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.050
 biology we can almost be at odds with the 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.420
 Session can be set when you reach the corner 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.010
 and a crab street to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.030
 times or whatever 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.290
 And yes , that old is of course for that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.290
 conceived city center 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.690
 but of course little space is one 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.190
 few long turns and you have to 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.510
 almost turn the square meter 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.870
 with such a car from the feet along to 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.030
 being able 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.090
 yes and that's there it comes at the expense 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.640
 of the stability at a higher speed 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.380
 but yes you do not see it so that 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.700
 is not the point either 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.070
 well i have a short turning circle london 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.480
 try it out really great hey you have 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.250
 slide it you also the heading it was 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.590
 all in stock at classics too 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.790
 this month again and very appropriate it 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.170
 is about what is called the patch 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.600
 engineering 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.799
 bit apart it there but means oak 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.780
 car brands player loan neighbor together 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.280
 or in orcas warehouses 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.040
 everything is used interchangeably 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.140
 and if there is a car that is a good one 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.420
 example of that concept then it is 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.860
 after this taxi you will of course really find it 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.810
 the most crazy things back on that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.280
 other cars are too original 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.510
 introduced 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.250
 It is now logical in itself 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.780
 declare they knew in advance all the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.640
 this was not going to be the car from 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.020
 they were going to sell the millions so yes 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.600
 develop everything new for this car 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.490
 which together could make them too expensive to 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.150
 just start a round of the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.740
 properties run from 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.050
 what can we get and straighten out 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.500
 well that went with engines 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.790
 resins the smallest details come true 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.320
 other cars of its empire is the 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.820
 critical takes really unique to this 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.680
 car 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.930
 And yes over the years you see it too 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.210
 more and more influence from others 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.640
 manufacturers in the car is on and I give up 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.320
 the other manufacturers built and those 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.490
 of course free to other we 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.880
 yet other manufacturers 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.710
 shop 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.930
 doorknobs for a train seat and 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.170
 backwards from a front tranzit 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.910
 nissan diesel engine yes you name it 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.630
 so it's really given up 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.630
 with after work 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.240
 yes 2014 is what laman museum and out 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.800
 turned out to be a good year 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.540
 yesterday we were the 100,000th 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.860
 welcome this year's visitor to it 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.630
 museum 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.670
 last year also have no fewer than 7 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.040
 cars added to our collection 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.920
 including this very special american 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.620
 and the smart is a car 1914 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.620
 of this model model 6 4 springs there are 6 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.900
 3 over and yes this is actually best 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.850
 automobile is built in America 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.100
 from before the first world war 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.270
 only built cars between 1998 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.980
 14 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.330
 is the clever name and thanks to legislation 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.460
 because the feather package 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.440
 as were above czech republic is making that 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.790
 putting away very low also has a low 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.410
 entry 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.810
 but on the other hand what they ate without 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.890
 large wheels under car-free 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.690
 the road 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.950
 if you look closely at the considerations see 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.330
 you actually know how good the car is 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.160
 for example this becomes the light 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.950
 is actually incorporated in the bodywork 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.630
 what talks about 1914 I don't know a single car 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.090
 at least not in our collection 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.740
 who already has it and also a beautiful one 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.950
 designed clocks that, as it were 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.450
 placed outside the body 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.740
 again it is one of the top pieces now 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.740
 our collection 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.130
 the new auto classic stash and the mg 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.450
 biji 3 against the full for 18 wolves s2 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.000
 sports coupes but with a practical 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.340
 Edge we are going to drive and Plymouth 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.320
 American brand but this one is made in 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.450
 the netherlands we are going to taxi him 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.890
 drive in london with this car 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.600
 that and many more this new through 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.720
 from carweek classics thanks for it 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.720
 look 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.420
 nor was there but only three left 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.810
 a good boy 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.810
 my mother
