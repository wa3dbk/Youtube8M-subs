00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello and welcome to the skirts 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.349
 broad tips your type issue 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.189
 centris dedicated to league of legends 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.750
 today we will talk about a point 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.610
 crucial in league of legends the map 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.380
 control to have a good mapcontrol 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.360
 you have to have a good harding so we go 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.519
 see 2 3 tips to keep in all 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.570
 security and make sure you have a vision 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.730
 sufficient on the movements of 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.370
 the opposing team and that will prevent your 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.610
 carry ad to do a tech wholesaler or 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.989
 two to be well placed if there is 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.730
 something primordial in one 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.110
 control is to give vision to one's 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.360
 team taking the least risk 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.580
 possible for this several instructions 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.739
 already always look at his mini map before 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.089
 to go black then ask in case of 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.159
 doubt if the opponents are 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.949
 by the way not on the mini map always 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.540
 favorite a world through a wall that 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.970
 will allow you to recover the vision 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.379
 without taking any risk precisely one can 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.699
 imagine for example that we suspect 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.519
 strongly the opposing team to be in 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.200
 Africa we're going to go rather than go 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.640
 in the river we will go through the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.380
 jungle but you have us behind and hop 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.110
 we recover the information no more 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.250
 doubt is not possible to work hard 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.200
 always in order to perfect the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.460
 map control while taking the least 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 possible risk you have to know that it is 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.899
 possible to pose ward farther than 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.850
 the maximum reach for that just 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.929
 t of plants and black of in a wall the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 war can not be planted in a 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.049
 wall it will be projected outside the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.429
 best of the most points side that 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.060
 dupont indeed to ask this time we 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.710
 go watch I stick to a wall we see 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.299
 well there the delimiting slider of the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.369
 warnes zone i'm trying to put to ward 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.289
 in the middle of the wall and hop she is 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.789
 projected outside 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.380
 there are several spots where this 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.149
 trick is particularly effective 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.859
 we're going ministers in pictures for 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.689
 better to retain them we will start with 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.159
 two very very simple at the beef 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.409
 red which is very useful at the beginning of 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.780
 part to avoid flying over the beef 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.189
 red on android 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.380
 then we will still bind with 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.819
 rather simple ward at the level of the Boche 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.950
 top line and botlane 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.420
 what is useful when this data does not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.039
 will be cornered by the opponents for 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.850
 take the vision on the river in 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.829
 all security 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.959
 and finally we'll look at both 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.340
 lastest recel or tank and a small 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.709
 little more we do not try the sea yet 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.580
 drink and a drake who has traitors 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.620
 and god will have to stall at 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.620
 millimeter like this 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.420
 and here are the jus characters plus it's 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.829
 already finished for today I hope that 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.670
 you enjoyed it and as for us we get 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.670
 will find for next time
