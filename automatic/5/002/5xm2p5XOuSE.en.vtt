so<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:48.600> why<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.230> lead<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> youtube

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so I you know why don't lead to youtube

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.560 
so I you know why don't lead to youtube
looking<00:00:50.579> around<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.480> was

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
looking around to see if there was

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
looking around to see if there was
anything<00:00:51.870> any<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.039> type<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
anything any way that you can type the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
anything any way that you can type the
top<00:00:53.640> curling<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.300> would<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.480> acceptable<00:00:54.920> well

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
top curling it would be acceptable well

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
top curling it would be acceptable well
apparently<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:57.109> everything<00:00:58.109> on

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
apparently not because everything on

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.430 
apparently not because everything on
there<00:00:58.440> has<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> top<00:00:59.010> straight<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> decided

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there has the top straight so I decided

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.200 
there has the top straight so I decided
to<00:01:01.559> try<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.160> own<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.199> make<00:01:04.700> the<00:01:05.700> bottom

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to try it on my own and make the bottom

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
to try it on my own and make the bottom
straight<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> top<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.590> leave<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> wavy

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
straight and the top just leave it wavy

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.690 
straight and the top just leave it wavy
and<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.900> worked<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.830> bottom<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.189> extension

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and it worked the bottom are extension

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.899 
and it worked the bottom are extension
so<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.000> were<00:01:12.060> already<00:01:12.299> straight<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:14.340> my

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so they were already straight but my

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.260 
so they were already straight but my
hair<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.540> top<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.350> natural<00:01:16.409> hair<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
hair up top is my natural hair and all I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
hair up top is my natural hair and all I
did<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> same<00:01:19.770> thing<00:01:19.979> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
did really was just the same thing you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.570 
did really was just the same thing you
would<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.689> with<00:01:21.689> stray<00:01:21.990> hairs<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.380> tease<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
would do with stray hairs just tease the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.749 
would do with stray hairs just tease the
roots<00:01:23.610> lots<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> hair<00:01:24.869> spray<00:01:25.070> nice<00:01:26.070> bow<00:01:26.310> and
