00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
could use bigger bowl I suppose and then

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.140 
to get sir p so you stir this around
until<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.590> sugar<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:04.010> completely<00:03:04.520> dissolved

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
until the sugar is completely dissolved

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.000 
until the sugar is completely dissolved
and<00:03:05.750> you'll<00:03:05.870> know<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.140> by<00:03:06.530> looking<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.950> the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and you'll know that by looking in the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.430 
and you'll know that by looking in the
bottom<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.490> pan<00:03:07.790> it'll<00:03:08.750> look<00:03:08.870> clear

bottom of the pan it'll look clear

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.280 
bottom of the pan it'll look clear
instead<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> cloudy<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.600> once<00:03:11.870> all<00:03:12.050> of<00:03:12.080> the

instead of cloudy but once all of the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.410 
instead of cloudy but once all of the
sugar<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.860> mixed<00:03:13.160> in<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.670> bring<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.390> a

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
sugar is mixed in you bring this to a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.160 
sugar is mixed in you bring this to a
boil<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:15.530> watch<00:03:15.770> it<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:17.750> takes<00:03:18.050> about

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
boil you watch it and it takes about

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.400 
boil you watch it and it takes about
five<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.459> seven<00:03:19.760> minutes<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:21.140> get<00:03:21.350> syrupy<00:03:23.410> when

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
five to seven minutes to get syrupy when

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.090 
five to seven minutes to get syrupy when
your<00:03:24.739> mixture<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.580> somewhat<00:03:26.420> syrupy<00:03:27.380> that's

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
your mixture is somewhat syrupy that's

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.600 
your mixture is somewhat syrupy that's
when<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.940> take<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:29.420> off<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:31.489> know

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
when you can take it off and you know

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.810 
when you can take it off and you know
those<00:03:31.790> rinds<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.290> have<00:03:33.650> here<00:03:34.010> we're<00:03:34.640> going

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
those rinds that I have here we're going

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.380 
those rinds that I have here we're going
to<00:03:34.910> infuse<00:03:35.510> them<00:03:35.900> with<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:37.070> syrup<00:03:37.459> so<00:03:38.330> you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
to infuse them with the syrup so you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.740 
to infuse them with the syrup so you
pour<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.810> syrup<00:03:39.220> right<00:03:40.220> over<00:03:40.700> all<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.600> those

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
pour the syrup right over all of those

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.250 
pour the syrup right over all of those
rinds<00:03:42.820> pour<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:43.910> right<00:03:44.060> over<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.600> now<00:03:45.230> you

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
rinds pour it right over it and now you

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.580 
rinds pour it right over it and now you
allow<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.850> cool<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.780> want<00:03:47.989> this<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.320> cool

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
allow this to cool you want this to cool

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.310 
allow this to cool you want this to cool
down<00:03:48.640> before<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:50.090> add<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.989> juice

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
down before you add it to the juice

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.440 
down before you add it to the juice
because<00:03:51.860> then<00:03:52.280> you're<00:03:52.489> going<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.209> freeze

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
because then you're going to to freeze

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.479 
because then you're going to to freeze
this<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:53.900> would<00:03:54.110> say<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:55.010> know<00:03:55.130> do<00:03:55.310> this

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
to let this cool in this mixture for

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.880 
to let this cool in this mixture for
about<00:04:02.840> one<00:04:03.530> hour<00:04:04.720> now<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.989> these<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.530> rinds

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
about one hour now that these the rinds

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.110 
about one hour now that these the rinds
are<00:04:07.480> cooled<00:04:08.480> in<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.160> sugar<00:04:10.459> syrup<00:04:10.760> we

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
are cooled in the in the sugar syrup we

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.800 
are cooled in the in the sugar syrup we
can<00:04:11.330> strain<00:04:11.750> this<00:04:11.959> out

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.069 

and<00:04:16.810> then<00:04:17.109> just<00:04:17.949> kind<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.220> push<00:04:18.489> on<00:04:18.729> it<00:04:19.079> to

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
and then just kind of push on it to

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.390 
and then just kind of push on it to
extract<00:04:20.650> any<00:04:21.270> extra<00:04:22.270> juice<00:04:23.160> oranges<00:04:24.160> and

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
extract any extra juice oranges and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.810 
extract any extra juice oranges and
lemons<00:04:24.729> cheap<00:04:25.720> right<00:04:26.610> remember<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:27.760> is

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
lemons cheap right remember this is

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.939 
lemons cheap right remember this is
frugal<00:04:28.470> not<00:04:29.470> cheap<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.300> now<00:04:31.300> we<00:04:31.360> have<00:04:31.949> the

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
frugal not cheap so now we have the

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.580 
frugal not cheap so now we have the
sugar<00:04:33.220> syrup<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.880> we<00:04:34.000> add<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:35.199> juice<00:04:37.590> you

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
sugar syrup and we add the juice you

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.740 
sugar syrup and we add the juice you
could<00:04:38.770> do<00:04:38.889> this<00:04:39.010> with<00:04:39.220> other<00:04:39.430> fruit<00:04:40.150> juices<00:04:40.540> as

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
could do this with other fruit juices as

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.500 
could do this with other fruit juices as
well<00:04:41.050> but<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.100> think<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.610> orange<00:04:42.790> is<00:04:43.180> going<00:04:43.419> to

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
well but I think the orange is going to

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.890 
well but I think the orange is going to
go<00:04:43.600> very<00:04:43.810> nice<00:04:44.110> with<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:46.060> particular<00:04:46.449> dinner

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
go very nice with this particular dinner

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.120 
go very nice with this particular dinner
stir<00:04:47.289> that<00:04:47.500> around<00:04:47.650> so<00:04:48.479> it's<00:04:49.479> well<00:04:49.780> mixed<00:04:50.130> now

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
stir that around so it's well mixed now

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.450 
stir that around so it's well mixed now
this<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.850> need<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.210> freeze<00:04:52.870> for<00:04:53.560> about<00:04:53.919> four

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
this you need to freeze for about four

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.920 
this you need to freeze for about four
hours<00:04:54.960> until<00:04:55.960> it's<00:04:56.320> slushy<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:58.180> just<00:04:58.510> scrape

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
hours until it's slushy you just scrape

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.670 
hours until it's slushy you just scrape
it<00:04:59.729> really<00:05:00.729> give<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.060> good<00:05:01.300> scrape<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.500> it's

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
it really give it a good scrape so it's

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.900 
it really give it a good scrape so it's
in<00:05:03.150> small<00:05:04.150> uniform<00:05:05.250> little<00:05:06.250> crystallized

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
in small uniform little crystallized

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.140
