 occur and s1 of the products over the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.570
 I never think negative 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.699
 heard feedback 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.949
 it is not clear to the tournament player 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 with the chains legacy collection but for 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.890
 every other one of the beginnings 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.720
 wants to improve his card collection 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.759
 It is actually a very good product 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 and is reflected in the references 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
 again if it would not believe it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.450
 it no longer knows prin behaves 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.090

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.870
 that is the white with the youth where 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.870
 installed 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.180
 we do not have that right now 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.289
 or already a need something 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 Everything in it is there I can do the best 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.000
 say I forget nothing 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.280
 Random cards are just that 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.430
 related card packages the the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.900
 base for six farmers two stalls without 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.799

 stories a lot booster pack from 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.799
 different current magic the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 gathering is because we have now times 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.390
 Take a look at 100 standard countries 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.939

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.420
 countries are a guide 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 reference card and one again 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.909
 However, it is useful to use the underground shaft 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.369
 actually is pretty good to me 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.700
 Stable parking has such a calf 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.579
 Closure they have in everyday life as 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.439
 food very well won bit of space 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:53.490
 because that must be, however , then 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:56.070

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.619

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.420

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.799
 deck picture is going to be here it is like this 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.799

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.300
 which we have with us for the first time 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.930

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.940
 change that I find very good 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.910
 even if not quite symmetrical 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.180
 one or the other maybe pushes open 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.739

 So that's a green-red mid range 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.690
 tech I would think now 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.060

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.879
 that's what an area should do with it 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.129

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.870
 employ 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.580

 that you 're paying to hop stars of 270 and 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.379
 although the edition has only 269 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:52.000
