00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
cross pins on the inside go ahead and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.990 
cross pins on the inside go ahead and
and<00:00:17.060> move<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.020> dipper<00:00:18.260> out<00:00:18.410> at<00:00:18.890> all<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.250> air

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
and move the dipper out at all the air

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.720 
and move the dipper out at all the air
bubbles<00:00:20.539> out<00:00:20.769> set<00:00:21.769> it<00:00:21.859> back<00:00:21.980> down<00:00:22.039> it<00:00:22.519> should

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
bubbles out set it back down it should

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.380 
bubbles out set it back down it should
fill<00:00:23.090> in<00:00:23.330> a<00:00:23.359> little<00:00:23.630> bit<00:00:23.929> back<00:00:24.259> above<00:00:24.619> that<00:00:24.890> pin

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
fill in a little bit back above that pin

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.939 
fill in a little bit back above that pin
okay<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.570> then<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:26.689> have<00:00:26.929> my<00:00:27.170> blue<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.679> have<00:00:27.710> my

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
okay and then I have my blue I have my

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.509 
okay and then I have my blue I have my
air<00:00:28.130> my<00:00:28.519> bleeder<00:00:28.789> screw<00:00:28.910> out<00:00:29.300> up<00:00:29.539> here<00:00:30.189> so<00:00:31.189> when

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
air my bleeder screw out up here so when

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.460 
air my bleeder screw out up here so when
I<00:00:31.550> put<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:32.000> two<00:00:32.180> together<00:00:32.330> I<00:00:32.660> just<00:00:33.080> let<00:00:33.290> the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
I put the two together I just let the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.350 
I put the two together I just let the
air<00:00:33.620> out<00:00:33.650> of<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.130> diff<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:34.760> way<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.150> aren't

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
air out of the diff that way we aren't

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.410 
air out of the diff that way we aren't
creating<00:00:35.570> any<00:00:36.020> pressure<00:00:36.379> in<00:00:36.710> there<00:00:37.149> so<00:00:38.149> we're

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
creating any pressure in there so we're

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.369 
creating any pressure in there so we're
going<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.570> slip<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:38.989> right<00:00:39.020> together<00:00:39.379> like<00:00:39.800> so

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
going to slip it right together like so

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.110 
going to slip it right together like so
put<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.500> bleeder<00:00:42.770> screw<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.910> make<00:00:47.090> sure

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
put the bleeder screw in and make sure

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.389 
put the bleeder screw in and make sure
that<00:00:47.420> little<00:00:47.660> o-ring<00:00:47.989> doesn't<00:00:48.590> squirt<00:00:49.190> out

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
that little o-ring doesn't squirt out

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.270 
that little o-ring doesn't squirt out
the<00:00:49.640> side<00:00:49.879> of<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:50.149> bleeder<00:00:50.510> screw<00:00:51.280> then

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
the side of that bleeder screw then

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.060 
the side of that bleeder screw then
you're<00:00:52.460> going<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.609> go<00:00:52.789> on<00:00:52.820> with<00:00:53.000> your<00:00:54.070> drive

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
you're going to go on with your drive

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.490 
you're going to go on with your drive
gear<00:00:55.519> shift<00:00:56.180> gear<00:00:56.420> whatever<00:00:56.809> gear<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:57.260> want

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
gear shift gear whatever gear you want

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.020 
gear shift gear whatever gear you want
to<00:00:57.620> call<00:00:57.800> it<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.039> goes<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.399> transmission

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
to call it that goes in the transmission

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.650 
to call it that goes in the transmission
here<00:00:59.410> and<00:01:00.410> then<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.620> put<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:00.949> screw<00:01:01.219> gun<00:01:01.370> on<00:01:01.579> a

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
here and then I put the screw gun on a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.790 
here and then I put the screw gun on a
on<00:01:02.660> a<00:01:02.719> light<00:01:03.170> port<00:01:03.620> setting<00:01:04.690> so<00:01:05.770> we're<00:01:06.770> just

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
on a light port setting so we're just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.330 
on a light port setting so we're just
going<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.250> Snug<00:01:07.520> them<00:01:07.730> all<00:01:07.880> up<00:01:09.220> before<00:01:10.220> we

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
going to Snug them all up before we

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.649 
going to Snug them all up before we
torque<00:01:10.640> them<00:01:10.820> down<00:01:12.820> another<00:01:13.820> thing<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.270> do<00:01:14.330> when

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
torque them down another thing I do when

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.200 
torque them down another thing I do when
I<00:01:14.689> have<00:01:14.810> this<00:01:15.170> apart<00:01:15.560> as<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:15.890> change<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.580> drive

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
I have this apart as I change the drive

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.140 
I have this apart as I change the drive
gears<00:01:17.659> if<00:01:17.900> there's<00:01:18.110> any<00:01:18.520> wear<00:01:19.520> marks<00:01:19.939> in<00:01:20.119> your

gears if there's any wear marks in your
drive<00:01:20.570> gears<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.200> you're<00:01:21.320> going<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.500> want<00:01:21.680> to

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
drive gears and you're going to want to

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.740 
drive gears and you're going to want to
flip<00:01:21.950> flop<00:01:22.340> them<00:01:22.579> before<00:01:22.909> they<00:01:23.060> wear<00:01:23.299> too<00:01:23.509> deep

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
flip flop them before they wear too deep

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.609 
flip flop them before they wear too deep
if<00:01:24.020> they<00:01:24.170> were<00:01:24.560> too<00:01:24.799> deep<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.310> your<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.659> your

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
if they were too deep and your and your

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.840 
if they were too deep and your and your
diff<00:01:27.920> has<00:01:29.860> will<00:01:30.860> take<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.220> beating<00:01:31.729> because

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
diff has will take a beating because

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.300 
diff has will take a beating because
you're<00:01:32.210> dry<00:01:32.479> your<00:01:32.930> bone<00:01:33.320> will<00:01:33.619> be<00:01:33.649> pulling<00:01:34.189> in

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
you're dry your bone will be pulling in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.789 
you're dry your bone will be pulling in
and<00:01:34.460> out<00:01:34.579> on<00:01:34.790> your<00:01:34.970> dip<00:01:35.439> so<00:01:36.439> you're<00:01:36.619> going<00:01:36.770> to

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
and out on your dip so you're going to

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.450 
and out on your dip so you're going to
want<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.240> switch<00:01:38.240> those<00:01:38.540> up<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:39.079> usually<00:01:39.430> take<00:01:40.430> a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
want to switch those up I usually take a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.580 
want to switch those up I usually take a
dremel<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.119> grind<00:01:41.390> all<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.750> sharp<00:01:42.020> marks<00:01:42.380> off

dremel and grind all the sharp marks off

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.200 
dremel and grind all the sharp marks off
them<00:01:42.860> in<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.100> way<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> forward<00:01:43.820> rotation

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.100 
them in that way the forward rotation
part<00:01:44.689> of<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.869> fit<00:01:45.159> looks<00:01:46.159> really<00:01:46.549> good<00:01:46.759> so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
part of the fit looks really good so

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.870 
part of the fit looks really good so
there<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.229> go<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.439> got<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.770> belt<00:01:49.100> dip<00:01:49.369> should

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
there you go you got a belt dip should

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.999 
there you go you got a belt dip should
be<00:01:50.030> smoother<00:01:50.479> than<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.750> was<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.619> guys<00:01:51.740> can
