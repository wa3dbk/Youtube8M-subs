 the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.730

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.589
 6 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 the city 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.700
 Unfortunately 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 He is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 nick heidfeld according to sports 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.560
 before I thought it was necessary that I had been suspended separately 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 one of the throat 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 the last euro for the boat 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.230
 And when I express my emotions the book is actually

 react 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 the Hague 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.790
 to care 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 r 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.059
 a 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.799
 4 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.799
 I think so 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.070
 they peck 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.929
 so too 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.989
 you don't have the umpteenth 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.679
 it is the ultimate conflict 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.409
 the neighborhood itself 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.729
 and get rid of you with the bar high and an oblique variant and helps to speed 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:56.559
 to have 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.349
 combinations and 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.579
 yes this time I have you 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.739
 that feels good of course 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.270
 And then the other side of the churches is actually not always the same too 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.299
 are like you what the consequences were 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.699
 that your life is just shaken awake 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.699
 So 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.009
 if it actually 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.009
 the hits of 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.590
 ears rr 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.590

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.389
 if only not that 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.370
 it is nice to be able to execute the plans

 and if you don't promise that it is a work of art from Halderberge anyway 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.440

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.479
 rouÃ© feather stop once 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.969
