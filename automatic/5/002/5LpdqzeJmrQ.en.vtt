00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
like let's say dynamite I believe well

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.330 
like let's say dynamite I believe well
if<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> figure<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.800> may<00:00:34.950> ban<00:00:35.100> them

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
if we can figure it out we may ban them

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.830 
if we can figure it out we may ban them
just<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.760> spawn<00:00:36.090> region<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:36.719> want

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
just in spawn region but we don't want

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840 
just in spawn region but we don't want
people<00:00:36.930> blowing<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.980> crap<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> spawn<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850

Ethan Ethan is actually the guy who put

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.580 
Ethan Ethan is actually the guy who put
together<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.430> server<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.600> head

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

administrator<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> server<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.580> going

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
administrator on the server we're going

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.890 
administrator on the server we're going
to<00:01:17.759> start<00:01:17.939> splitting<00:01:18.240> up<00:01:18.420> our<00:01:18.509> servers

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to start splitting up our servers

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.510 
to start splitting up our servers
between<00:01:19.170> staff<00:01:19.500> members<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.130> we're<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
between staff members so we're going to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.830 
between staff members so we're going to
have<00:01:20.640> different<00:01:20.850> staff<00:01:21.180> members<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
have different staff members kind of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140 
have different staff members kind of
running<00:01:22.140> each<00:01:22.290> server<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.909> we<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
running each server because we have a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
running each server because we have a
little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.229> four<00:01:25.470> servers

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
little bit they have like four servers

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.469 
little bit they have like four servers
so<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.610> kind<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.820> getting<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> hard<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
so it's kind of getting kind of hard to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
so it's kind of getting kind of hard to
get<00:01:27.960> everyone<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> active<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.340> every

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
get everyone kind of active on every

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.789 
get everyone kind of active on every
server<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.450> people<00:01:30.930> only<00:01:31.110> usually<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
server and people only usually like to

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.249 
server and people only usually like to
be<00:01:31.920> active<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> server<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.360> did<00:01:34.170> they

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
be active on the server that did they

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.690 
be active on the server that did they
like<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> play<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.100> Ethan<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> be
