hello<00:00:04.410> budhana<00:00:05.009> here<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.490> today<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.330> have<00:00:06.390> a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
hello budhana here and today I have a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.740 
hello budhana here and today I have a
bit<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.930> theory<00:00:07.560> craft<00:00:07.890> I've<00:00:08.250> had<00:00:08.849> quite<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.540> few

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
bit of theory craft I've had quite a few

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.230 
bit of theory craft I've had quite a few
questions<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.679> bleed<00:00:11.219> duration<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.940> lot

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
questions on bleed duration I have a lot

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.940 
questions on bleed duration I have a lot
of<00:00:12.269> specs<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.840> bleed<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.349> people<00:00:13.830> don't

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
of specs with bleed and people don't

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.519 
of specs with bleed and people don't
really<00:00:14.660> understand<00:00:15.660> why<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.379> much

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
really understand why I have so much

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.670 
really understand why I have so much
bleed<00:00:16.859> duration<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.080> decided<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.289> test<00:00:19.529> that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
bleed duration so I decided to test that

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.090 
bleed duration so I decided to test that
out<00:00:19.740> tonight<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.990> these<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.619> tests<00:00:23.039> that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
out tonight and these are the tests that

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.330 
out tonight and these are the tests that
I<00:00:23.279> did<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.210> test<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.140> have

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
I did in this first test I just have

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.419 
I did in this first test I just have
zero<00:00:26.340> bleed<00:00:26.730> duration<00:00:27.269> modifiers<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.429> feel

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
zero bleed duration modifiers and feel

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
zero bleed duration modifiers and feel
free<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> count<00:00:30.119> these<00:00:30.330> bleed<00:00:30.750> tix<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.230> you'd

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
free to count these bleed tix if you'd

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500 
free to count these bleed tix if you'd
like<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.160> will<00:00:32.340> display<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> number<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
like but I will display the number of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.940 
like but I will display the number of
tix<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> end<00:00:35.719> obviously<00:00:36.719> each<00:00:37.290> tick<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
tix at the end obviously each tick is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
tix at the end obviously each tick is
the<00:00:38.100> same<00:00:38.340> amount<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> damage<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.719> set

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the same amount of damage that first set

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.889 
the same amount of damage that first set
was<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.440> 20<00:00:41.100> ticks<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.820> time<00:00:42.570> ten

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
was just 20 ticks and this time ten

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.150 
was just 20 ticks and this time ten
percent<00:00:43.290> condition<00:00:43.860> duration<00:00:45.530> I'm<00:00:46.530> using<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
percent condition duration I'm using the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.209 
percent condition duration I'm using the
number<00:00:47.430> three<00:00:47.879> skill<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.930> thief's<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.770> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
number three skill for thief's and it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.299 
number three skill for thief's and it's
going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> apply<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.379> fairly<00:00:52.379> long<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.800> believe

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
going to apply to fairly long I believe

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
going to apply to fairly long I believe
the<00:00:53.460> base<00:00:53.640> duration<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.300> 10<00:00:54.510> second<00:00:55.050> duration

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the base duration is 10 second duration

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590 
the base duration is 10 second duration
bleeds<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> number<00:00:56.730> three<00:00:56.940> ability<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bleeds for this number three ability and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.020 
bleeds for this number three ability and
that<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.649> 22<00:00:59.219> tix<00:00:59.840> now<00:01:00.840> I've<00:01:01.109> added<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
that was 22 tix now I've added a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
that was 22 tix now I've added a
15-percent<00:01:03.030> bleed<00:01:03.600> duration<00:01:04.199> rune<00:01:04.979> set

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.120 

and<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:19.250> 24<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.680> added

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and that one is 24 so now I added

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.999 
and that one is 24 so now I added
another<00:01:23.820> fifteen<00:01:24.810> percent<00:01:25.170> bleed<00:01:25.500> duration

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
another fifteen percent bleed duration

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
another fifteen percent bleed duration
set<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.420> might<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.960> since<00:01:28.409> those

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
set and you might think that since those

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
set and you might think that since those
are<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.860> same<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.220> might<00:01:29.399> might<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.149> stack

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
are the same they might might not stack

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.490 
are the same they might might not stack
however<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.610> actually<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.909> wrong<00:01:33.659> what

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
however it is actually very wrong what

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
however it is actually very wrong what
happens<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.310> hit<00:01:35.700> essentially

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
happens here is I hit essentially

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.810 
happens here is I hit essentially
another<00:01:37.020> bleed<00:01:37.530> threshold<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.399> could<00:01:38.580> call

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
another bleed threshold you could call

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.929 
another bleed threshold you could call
them<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:40.110> actually<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.799> quite<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.460> bit<00:01:41.729> more

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
them and I actually get quite a bit more

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.560 
them and I actually get quite a bit more
tix<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.679> see<00:01:44.030> 28<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
tix here as you can see 28 so that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.249 
tix here as you can see 28 so that
jumped<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:45.929> 24<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> 28<00:01:47.270> where<00:01:48.270> before<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.110> was

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
jumped from 24 to 28 where before it was

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.800 
jumped from 24 to 28 where before it was
only<00:01:49.470> jumping<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.459> what<00:01:51.209> happened<00:01:51.630> there

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
only jumping to and what happened there

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.830 
only jumping to and what happened there
was<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.440> duration<00:01:52.950> got<00:01:53.159> long<00:01:53.459> enough<00:01:53.789> that<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
was the duration got long enough that it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.449 
was the duration got long enough that it
basically<00:01:55.470> worked<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.399> another<00:01:56.700> tick<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.459> your

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
basically worked in another tick so your

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.010 
basically worked in another tick so your
your<00:01:59.850> bleed<00:02:00.179> damage<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.049> actually<00:02:02.569> it's<00:02:03.569> given

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
your bleed damage is actually it's given

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.080 
your bleed damage is actually it's given
a<00:02:04.110> duration<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.069> takes<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.549> conditioned

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
a duration and it takes in conditioned

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.380 
a duration and it takes in conditioned
damage<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.289> longer<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> duration<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
damage and the longer the duration you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.509 
damage and the longer the duration you
have<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.140> basically<00:02:10.380> get<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
have you have to basically get to

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.610 
have you have to basically get to
certain<00:02:12.000> points<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.630> duration<00:02:12.989> before<00:02:13.560> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
certain points of duration before it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
certain points of duration before it
will<00:02:13.769> tick<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> right<00:02:15.269> there<00:02:15.480> with<00:02:15.599> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
will tick again and right there with the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.570 
will tick again and right there with the
ten<00:02:15.930> percent<00:02:16.319> on<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> weapon<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.099> actually

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
ten percent on the weapon it actually

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.809 
ten percent on the weapon it actually
did<00:02:18.030> dirty<00:02:18.420> tick<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:20.069> was<00:02:20.220> more<00:02:20.400> normal

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
did dirty tick so that was more normal

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.560 
did dirty tick so that was more normal
and<00:02:21.890> right<00:02:22.890> now<00:02:23.070> i'm<00:02:23.310> adding<00:02:23.519> thirty<00:02:24.120> percent

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
and right now i'm adding thirty percent

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.250 
and right now i'm adding thirty percent
condition<00:02:25.320> duration<00:02:26.250> from<00:02:26.519> traits<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.260> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
condition duration from traits and that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.060 
condition duration from traits and that
as<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.920> would<00:02:29.400> expect<00:02:29.519> would<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.209> lot<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:31.769> i

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
as you would expect would a lot but i

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.880 
as you would expect would a lot but i
mean<00:02:32.970> anyway<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:34.190> these<00:02:35.190> thresholds<00:02:35.760> are

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
mean anyway the these thresholds are

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.490 
mean anyway the these thresholds are
essentially<00:02:37.890> what<00:02:38.220> drives<00:02:39.209> condition<00:02:40.049> damage

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
essentially what drives condition damage

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.130 
essentially what drives condition damage
at<00:02:40.829> least<00:02:41.069> from<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.430> bleeds<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.120> don't<00:02:42.989> believe

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
at least from the bleeds I don't believe

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.830 
at least from the bleeds I don't believe
poisons<00:02:43.890> or<00:02:44.100> burns<00:02:44.850> work<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.390> way<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.660> there

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
poisons or burns work that way and there

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.800 
poisons or burns work that way and there
was<00:02:46.019> thirty<00:02:46.380> six<00:02:46.680> tix<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:48.269> bleeds<00:02:48.540> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
was thirty six tix but for bleeds it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.809 
was thirty six tix but for bleeds it
I've<00:02:49.109> definitely<00:02:49.440> confirmed<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> right<00:02:50.670> now

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
I've definitely confirmed and right now

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.309 
I've definitely confirmed and right now
what<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.150> doing<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.810> I'm<00:02:52.230> testing<00:02:56.209> my<00:02:57.319> weapons

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
what I'm doing is I'm testing my weapons

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.220 
what I'm doing is I'm testing my weapons
the<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:59.299> signals<00:03:00.299> on<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.569> weapons<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.109> that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
the the signals on my weapons and that

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.559 
the the signals on my weapons and that
was<00:03:01.380> five<00:03:01.709> ticks<00:03:02.069> with<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.700> one<00:03:02.940> weapon<00:03:03.389> and

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
was five ticks with just one weapon and

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.110 
was five ticks with just one weapon and
here's<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.440> same<00:03:04.769> room<00:03:05.010> set<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.639> now<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> have

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
here's the same room set and now I have

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.770 
here's the same room set and now I have
two<00:03:06.420> signals<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.989> agony<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:09.510> you're

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
two signals of agony and now you're

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.990 
two signals of agony and now you're
going<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> see<00:03:10.260> six<00:03:10.680> ticks<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.609> reason<00:03:11.910> I

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
going to see six ticks and the reason I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.740 
going to see six ticks and the reason I
set<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.510> like<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:14.060> because<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.269> needed

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
set it up like this is because I needed

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.289 
set it up like this is because I needed
to<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.440> amount<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.519> hit<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.970> next

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
to have that amount to hit the next

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.330 
to have that amount to hit the next
threshold<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.410> couldn't<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.069> have

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
threshold so I couldn't just have

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.330 
threshold so I couldn't just have
pistols<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.060> needed<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.540> armor<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.230> reach<00:03:23.069> that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
pistols I needed the armor to reach that

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.850 
pistols I needed the armor to reach that
threshold<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:24.180> now<00:03:24.750> I'm<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.260> show<00:03:25.530> you

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
threshold and now I'm going to show you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.640 
threshold and now I'm going to show you
some<00:03:26.189> tooltip<00:03:26.700> stuff<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.360> right<00:03:28.170> there<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.439> see

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
some tooltip stuff I right there you see

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.309 
some tooltip stuff I right there you see
300

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
300

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.880 
300
66<00:03:29.920> damage<00:03:30.370> over<00:03:30.579> fool<00:03:31.049> 4.75<00:03:32.049> seconds<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
66 damage over fool 4.75 seconds and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.849 
66 damage over fool 4.75 seconds and
this<00:03:33.849> is<00:03:33.999> with<00:03:34.180> all<00:03:34.389> my<00:03:34.659> armor<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.680> can

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
this is with all my armor and you can

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.709 
this is with all my armor and you can
see<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.280> actually<00:03:36.730> did<00:03:36.939> quite<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.420> bit<00:03:37.510> of

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:37.719 
see it actually did quite a bit of

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.770 
see it actually did quite a bit of
damage<00:03:37.749> and<00:03:38.459> now<00:03:39.459> here's<00:03:39.760> with<00:03:39.939> all<00:03:40.150> my<00:03:40.420> armor

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
damage and now here's with all my armor

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.220 
damage and now here's with all my armor
all<00:03:41.469> my<00:03:41.709> signals<00:03:42.129> however<00:03:42.670> i<00:03:42.790> added<00:03:43.120> a

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
all my signals however i added a

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.679 
all my signals however i added a
30-percent<00:03:44.230> condition<00:03:44.739> duration<00:03:45.249> and<00:03:45.510> as<00:03:46.510> you

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
30-percent condition duration and as you

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.979 
30-percent condition duration and as you
see<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.530> damage<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.430> time<00:03:48.730> went<00:03:49.060> up<00:03:49.209> quite<00:03:49.959> a

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
see the damage in time went up quite a

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.069 
see the damage in time went up quite a
bit<00:03:50.290> now<00:03:51.219> if<00:03:51.489> you<00:03:51.700> are<00:03:51.730> naked<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.810> would<00:03:52.989> have

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
bit now if you are naked you would have

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.379 
bit now if you are naked you would have
seen<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.620> same<00:03:53.920> exact<00:03:54.340> tooltip<00:03:54.849> as<00:03:55.060> that

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
seen the same exact tooltip as that

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.229 
seen the same exact tooltip as that
first<00:03:55.659> time<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.379> mean<00:03:57.010> more<00:03:57.189> or<00:03:57.280> less<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.669> time

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
first time I mean more or less the time

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.869 
first time I mean more or less the time
on<00:03:58.599> the<00:03:58.870> on<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.319> bleed<00:04:00.280> would<00:04:00.489> have<00:04:00.579> been<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
on the on the bleed would have been the

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.059 
on the on the bleed would have been the
same<00:04:00.909> so<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:02.079> just<00:04:02.349> shows<00:04:02.439> you<00:04:02.859> that

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
same so that just shows you that

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.789 
same so that just shows you that
condition<00:04:03.790> damage<00:04:04.209> doesn't<00:04:04.599> really<00:04:05.079> get

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
condition damage doesn't really get

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.830 
condition damage doesn't really get
taken<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.400> account<00:04:06.669> properly<00:04:07.269> in<00:04:07.329> tooltips

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
taken to account properly in tooltips

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.979 
taken to account properly in tooltips
the<00:04:08.829> stuff<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.579> get<00:04:09.790> from<00:04:09.849> your<00:04:10.180> armor<00:04:10.629> your

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
the stuff you get from your armor your

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.990 
the stuff you get from your armor your
runes<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.469> signals<00:04:11.919> they<00:04:12.099> are<00:04:12.250> not<00:04:12.459> going<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
runes and signals they are not going to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.229 
runes and signals they are not going to
show<00:04:13.540> up<00:04:13.780> in<00:04:13.989> your<00:04:14.049> actual<00:04:14.439> tool<00:04:14.709> tip<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.280> you

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
show up in your actual tool tip so you

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.539 
show up in your actual tool tip so you
really<00:04:16.630> have<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.870> take<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.769> on<00:04:17.979> your<00:04:18.190> own<00:04:18.310> but

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
really have to take it on your own but

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.789 
really have to take it on your own but
pretty<00:04:19.180> much<00:04:19.239> everything<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.199> gives<00:04:20.590> you

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
pretty much everything that gives you

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.980 
pretty much everything that gives you
bleeding<00:04:21.310> duration<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.090> going<00:04:22.449> to<00:04:22.630> improve

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
bleeding duration is going to improve

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.800 
bleeding duration is going to improve
bleed<00:04:23.349> damage<00:04:23.970> assuming<00:04:24.970> your<00:04:25.300> bleed<00:04:25.599> will

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
bleed damage assuming your bleed will

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.379 
bleed damage assuming your bleed will
hit<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.169> threshold<00:04:26.500> in<00:04:27.090> from<00:04:28.090> class<00:04:28.360> to

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
hit that threshold in from class to

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.510 
hit that threshold in from class to
class<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:28.780> just<00:04:29.169> gotta<00:04:29.380> go<00:04:29.830> ahead<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.220> test

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
class you just gotta go ahead and test

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.120 
class you just gotta go ahead and test
those<00:04:30.820> if<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.630> really<00:04:32.050> want<00:04:32.259> a<00:04:32.320> min<00:04:32.500> max<00:04:32.770> but

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
those if you really want a min max but

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.939 
those if you really want a min max but
it<00:04:33.610> seems<00:04:33.970> like<00:04:34.180> every<00:04:34.630> 1<00:04:35.110> second<00:04:35.650> or<00:04:35.740> so

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
it seems like every 1 second or so

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.560 
it seems like every 1 second or so
you're<00:04:36.159> going<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.370> get<00:04:36.460> another<00:04:36.699> tick<00:04:37.060> not

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
you're going to get another tick not

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.110 
you're going to get another tick not
sure<00:04:37.840> on<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> exact<00:04:38.470> math<00:04:38.680> but<00:04:39.009> it<00:04:39.250> seems<00:04:39.940> like

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
sure on the exact math but it seems like

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.240 
sure on the exact math but it seems like
all<00:04:40.330> bleeds<00:04:40.720> take<00:04:41.050> at<00:04:41.199> the<00:04:41.289> same<00:04:41.500> time<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.130> if

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
all bleeds take at the same time and if

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.080 
all bleeds take at the same time and if
you<00:04:42.699> can<00:04:42.909> get<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.150> duration<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.110> ticks

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
you can get a duration that ticks

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.430 
you can get a duration that ticks
immediately<00:04:46.090> at<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.690> end<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.110> you're

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
immediately at the end of it you're

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.920 
immediately at the end of it you're
going<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.889> benefit<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.550> as<00:04:49.180> always<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.780> hope

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
going to benefit and as always I hope
