you know do away with your your wrist
straps<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.620> know<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> risks<00:00:35.010> cups<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
then wrap it around the dumbbell makes

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.690 
then wrap it around the dumbbell makes
it<00:00:39.600> easier<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> grip<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:41.100> away<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.399> that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it easier to grip do away with that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
it easier to grip do away with that
you'll<00:00:42.329> work<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.719> forearms<00:00:43.079> harder<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.620> would

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you'll work your forearms harder I would

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
you'll work your forearms harder I would
only<00:00:44.430> use<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.940> maybe<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> very<00:00:46.020> end<00:00:46.230> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
only use it maybe at the very end of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
only use it maybe at the very end of
your<00:00:46.500> workouts<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:47.820> your

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
your workouts when you just your your

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
your workouts when you just your your
grip<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.930> too<00:00:49.079> fatigued<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.469> hold<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
grip is just too fatigued to hold on to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.869 
grip is just too fatigued to hold on to
the<00:00:50.129> weight<00:00:52.010> second<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:55.520> grab<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> towel

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the weight second way is to grab a towel

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.160 
the weight second way is to grab a towel
small<00:00:57.390> towel<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> wrap<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.579> around

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
small towel you want to wrap it around

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.250 
small towel you want to wrap it around
the<00:01:01.170> dumbbell<00:01:01.530> handle<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.449> basically<00:01:04.110> you're

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the dumbbell handle and basically you're

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.649 
the dumbbell handle and basically you're
making<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> thicker<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.299> thick<00:01:06.510> as

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
making it thicker make it as thick as

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.750 
making it thicker make it as thick as
you<00:01:07.170> know<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.439> too<00:01:07.619> big<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:07.920> picking<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you know not too big but picking up to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.260 
you know not too big but picking up to
work<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.479> thicker<00:01:09.750> where<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:11.189> muscles<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
work or thicker where your muscles in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.969 
work or thicker where your muscles in
your<00:01:12.360> form<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> work<00:01:13.320> harder<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.799> grip

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
your form have to work harder to grip

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.700 
your form have to work harder to grip
the<00:01:14.130> weight<00:01:14.310> that's<00:01:15.030> another<00:01:15.240> easy<00:01:15.509> way<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.560> do

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the weight that's another easy way to do

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
the weight that's another easy way to do
to<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.280> increase<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> strength<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.390> your

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to really increase the strength in your

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.580 
to really increase the strength in your
forms<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:20.369> another<00:01:20.820> way<00:01:21.030> third<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
forms and another way third way this is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
forms and another way third way this is
pretty<00:01:22.950> advanced<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:25.310> for<00:01:26.310> example<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.790> when

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
pretty advanced is for example like when

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.620 
pretty advanced is for example like when
you're<00:01:27.119> doing<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.920> pull-up<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.369> even<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.700> row<00:01:29.880> use

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you're doing a pull-up or even a row use

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.560 
you're doing a pull-up or even a row use
a<00:01:30.659> rope<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> thick<00:01:32.159> some<00:01:33.090> kind<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> thick

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
a rope or a thick some kind of thick

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.859 
a rope or a thick some kind of thick
handle<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:35.189> harder<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> grab<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.420> grape

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
handle that's are harder to grab a grape

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.410 
handle that's are harder to grab a grape
and<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.610> work<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.820> form<00:01:39.180> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and that will really work your form so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.560 
and that will really work your form so
for<00:01:39.630> example<00:01:39.720> instead<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.710> doing<00:01:41.360> pull<00:01:42.360> up

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
for example instead of doing pull up

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.950 
for example instead of doing pull up
with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> regular<00:01:44.340> bar<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.600> even<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
with a just a regular bar or even just

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.069 
with a just a regular bar or even just
the<00:01:46.350> towel<00:01:46.590> wrapped<00:01:47.040> around<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.430> bar<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.930> can

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the towel wrapped around the bar you can

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.740 
the towel wrapped around the bar you can
do<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.770> example<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> big<00:01:50.430> towel

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
do it like for example with a big towel

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.950 
do it like for example with a big towel
over<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.020> bar<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> rope<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.180> thick<00:01:54.689> rope

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
over the bar or like a rope a thick rope

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.940 
over the bar or like a rope a thick rope
preferably<00:01:55.909> grab<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
preferably grab it here and just do a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.510 
preferably grab it here and just do a
pull-up<00:02:01.130> just<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:03.409> seen<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.829> now

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
pull-up just like that seen this way now

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
pull-up just like that seen this way now
