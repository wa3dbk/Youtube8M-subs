00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.070 
with this thing it's really like
no<00:03:33.500> biggie<00:03:33.739> like<00:03:34.190> it's<00:03:34.970> not<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.390> problem<00:03:35.660> at<00:03:35.930> all

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
no biggie like it's not a problem at all

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.949 
no biggie like it's not a problem at all
um<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.769> think<00:03:36.830> that<00:03:37.310> was<00:03:37.489> all<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> wanted<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.570> say

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
um I think that was all I wanted to say

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.780 
um I think that was all I wanted to say
I<00:03:38.989> actually<00:03:39.700> just<00:03:40.700> recorded<00:03:41.180> this<00:03:41.269> video

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
I actually just recorded this video

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.250 
I actually just recorded this video
right<00:03:43.790> before<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.269> one<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:44.750> noticed<00:03:45.140> when

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
right before this one and I noticed when

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.620 
right before this one and I noticed when
I<00:03:45.320> went<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.620> go<00:03:45.829> you<00:03:46.340> know<00:03:46.459> edit<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.510> it

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
I went to go you know edit it that it

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.240 
I went to go you know edit it that it
wasn't<00:03:47.780> there<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.410> guess<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:48.920> didn't<00:03:49.160> hit

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
wasn't there so I guess I didn't hit

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.410 
wasn't there so I guess I didn't hit
record<00:03:49.610> or<00:03:49.670> something<00:03:49.970> like<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:50.390> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
record or something like that so I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.740 
record or something like that so I
really<00:03:50.780> hope<00:03:50.930> I'm<00:03:51.110> not<00:03:51.310> forgetting<00:03:52.310> anything

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
really hope I'm not forgetting anything

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.479 
really hope I'm not forgetting anything
oh<00:03:53.780> also<00:03:55.870> instead<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:56.989> using<00:03:57.320> my<00:03:57.560> Listerine

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
oh also instead of using my Listerine

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.490 
oh also instead of using my Listerine
that<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.239> was<00:03:59.390> doing<00:03:59.660> after<00:03:59.810> like<00:04:00.079> every<00:04:00.320> meal

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
that I was doing after like every meal

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.410 
that I was doing after like every meal
I've<00:04:00.650> just<00:04:00.799> been<00:04:00.920> doing<00:04:01.070> salt<00:04:01.489> water<00:04:01.730> just

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
I've just been doing salt water just

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.780 
I've just been doing salt water just
because<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:03.560> don't<00:04:03.860> really<00:04:03.950> like<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.459> taste<00:04:04.640> of

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
because I don't really like the taste of

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.190 
because I don't really like the taste of
like<00:04:04.940> minty<00:04:05.269> things<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.660> my<00:04:05.780> mouth

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
like minty things in my mouth

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.770 
like minty things in my mouth
so<00:04:06.380> um<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.489> salt<00:04:07.730> water<00:04:08.000> kind<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.660> know

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
so um the salt water kind of you know

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.270 
so um the salt water kind of you know
obviously<00:04:09.260> gives<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.709> same<00:04:09.890> effect

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
obviously gives it the same effect

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.759 
obviously gives it the same effect
without<00:04:10.519> that<00:04:10.910> nasty<00:04:11.480> mint<00:04:11.690> taste<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.500> just

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
without that nasty mint taste so I just

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.140 
without that nasty mint taste so I just
you<00:04:12.950> know<00:04:12.980> kept<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.400> in<00:04:13.519> my<00:04:13.610> little<00:04:13.850> apron

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
you know kept that in my little apron

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.940 
you know kept that in my little apron
pocket<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.989> know<00:04:15.079> whenever<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.440> ate<00:04:15.709> or

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
had a snack or something I would just

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.940 
had a snack or something I would just
swish<00:04:17.359> -<00:04:17.390> wrong<00:04:17.660> really<00:04:17.959> quick<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.859> know

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950
