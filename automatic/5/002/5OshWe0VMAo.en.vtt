of us had and he's saying that for two

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.379 
of us had and he's saying that for two

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
years work they have changed very very

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.780 
years work they have changed very very
little<00:03:52.810> yes<00:03:53.560> they've<00:03:53.799> got<00:03:53.980> rid<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.190> bullshit

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790

but<00:03:55.569> it's<00:03:55.930> still<00:03:56.200> modern<00:03:56.620> warfare<00:03:56.769> two<00:03:57.040> point

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
but it's still modern warfare two point

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.430 
but it's still modern warfare two point
five<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:58.090> think<00:03:58.180> he's<00:03:58.690> couple<00:03:59.049> of<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> slight

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
five and I think he's couple of a slight

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.440 
five and I think he's couple of a slight
forward<00:03:59.680> but<00:03:59.889> you<00:03:59.980> know<00:04:00.100> what<00:04:00.280> he's<00:04:01.209> played

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
forward but you know what he's played

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
forward but you know what he's played
he's<00:04:02.079> telling<00:04:02.380> us<00:04:02.470> his<00:04:02.620> perspective<00:04:03.190> he<00:04:03.310> has

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
he's telling us his perspective he has

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.710 
he's telling us his perspective he has
his<00:04:03.579> own<00:04:03.670> opinion<00:04:04.090> that's<00:04:04.269> just<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.540> way<00:04:04.660> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
his own opinion that's just the way it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.140 
his own opinion that's just the way it
is

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.190 
is
and<00:04:07.150> we<00:04:07.269> have<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.510> remember<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.870> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and we have to remember that the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.020 
and we have to remember that the
difference<00:04:08.590> between<00:04:08.680> world<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.489> bra<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.909> black

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.630 
difference between world a bra and black
ops<00:04:10.390> was<00:04:10.629> massive<00:04:11.079> now<00:04:11.290> trai<00:04:12.010> they<00:04:12.310> made<00:04:12.519> the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
ops was massive now trai they made the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.610 
ops was massive now trai they made the
step<00:04:12.879> they<00:04:13.269> pick<00:04:13.540> their<00:04:13.689> game<00:04:13.930> up<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.319> they

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
step they pick their game up and they

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.650 
step they pick their game up and they
knew<00:04:14.769> they<00:04:14.920> had<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:17.549> think<00:04:18.549> obviously<00:04:19.239> black

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
knew they had to I think obviously black

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.560 
knew they had to I think obviously black
ops<00:04:19.840> wasn't<00:04:20.229> a<00:04:20.289> great<00:04:20.560> game<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.039> but<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.449> know

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
ops wasn't a great game and but you know

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.110 
ops wasn't a great game and but you know
that's<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.560> risk<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.830> take<00:04:23.919> they<00:04:24.460> try<00:04:25.060> to

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
that's the risk you take they try to

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.779 
that's the risk you take they try to
expand<00:04:25.570> they<00:04:25.780> tried<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:25.990> make<00:04:26.199> it<00:04:26.229> better<00:04:26.789> they

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
expand they tried to make it better they

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.029 
expand they tried to make it better they
trying<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.120> change<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.509> up<00:04:28.630> what<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.590> war<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:29.919> it

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
trying to change it up what a war and it

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.680 
trying to change it up what a war and it
definitely<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.550> different<00:04:31.000> from<00:04:31.210> what<00:04:31.419> at<00:04:31.539> war

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
definitely is different from what at war

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.300 
definitely is different from what at war
nobody<00:04:32.229> can<00:04:32.410> question<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.919> I<00:04:33.449> think<00:04:35.310> you

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
nobody can question that I think you

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.529 
nobody can question that I think you
know<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> difference<00:04:36.789> between<00:04:36.820> Claude<00:04:37.270> four

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
know the difference between Claude four

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.270

and<00:04:37.660> one<00:04:37.750> warfare<00:04:38.110> two<00:04:38.320> was<00:04:38.740> massive<00:04:39.130> that

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
and one warfare two was massive that

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.860 
and one warfare two was massive that
step<00:04:39.580> they<00:04:39.759> took<00:04:39.910> was<00:04:40.180> absolutely<00:04:40.660> massive

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
step they took was absolutely massive

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.439 
step they took was absolutely massive
and<00:04:41.169> did<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.250> improve<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.789> some<00:04:43.000> people<00:04:43.240> tell

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
detection was great even with stopping

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.290 
detection was great even with stopping
power<00:05:02.410> they<00:05:02.650> candidate<00:05:03.160> with<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.910> candidate

with<00:05:04.330> juggernaut<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:06.070> good<00:05:06.250> thing<00:05:06.280> about

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
with juggernaut and the good thing about

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.580 
with juggernaut and the good thing about
that<00:05:06.699> was<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.330> was<00:05:07.509> it<00:05:07.720> was<00:05:07.840> evenly<00:05:08.169> balanced

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
that was it was it was evenly balanced

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.080 
that was it was it was evenly balanced
it<00:05:08.800> wasn't<00:05:09.250> like<00:05:09.370> stopping<00:05:09.610> power<00:05:09.849> was

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
it wasn't like stopping power was

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.570 
it wasn't like stopping power was
overpowered<00:05:10.630> if<00:05:11.620> you<00:05:11.800> would<00:05:12.039> jog<00:05:12.310> or<00:05:12.430> not<00:05:12.550> I

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
overpowered if you would jog or not I

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.760 
overpowered if you would jog or not I
think<00:05:12.729> stopping<00:05:13.090> power<00:05:13.330> gave<00:05:13.659> you<00:05:13.840> twenty

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
think stopping power gave you twenty

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.450 
think stopping power gave you twenty
five<00:05:14.979> percent<00:05:15.010> more<00:05:15.610> damage<00:05:16.300> or<00:05:16.419> whatever<00:05:16.690> and

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
five percent more damage or whatever and

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.350 
five percent more damage or whatever and
juggernaut<00:05:18.460> gave<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:18.820> twenty<00:05:19.150> five<00:05:19.330> percent

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
juggernaut gave you twenty five percent

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.719 
juggernaut gave you twenty five percent
World<00:05:19.780> Health<00:05:19.960> so<00:05:20.380> it<00:05:20.620> was<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:21.039> was<00:05:21.159> even<00:05:21.400> it

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729
