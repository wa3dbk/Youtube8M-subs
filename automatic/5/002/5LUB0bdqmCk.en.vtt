00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.570
 when the curse of the flesh was not yet

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.580

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.210
 from mortals 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.700

 complicated culture without war strong walls 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 become 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.530
 and some stone just for seeing them 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.470
 take the tauren behind him their rumbling 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.560
 animals but in reality this is one of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.780
 the most intelligent races tauren live so 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.729
 primitive life not because too 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.979
 stupid to build yourself big 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.770
 cities and enclose them with a stone wall 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.250
 they just want to live like they live 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.640
 now it is their conscious choice and for them 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.799
 This way of life has meaning can not be 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.689
 say that taurine and are race 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.119
 pacifists since there are them 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.490
 disturb they become the most dangerous 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.530
 opponents who uses each 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.600
 an ounce of your strength to crush your enemies 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.960
 the leader of the tribe bears the title of supreme 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.930
 leader 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.640
 he and other elders are watching 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.410
 for safety and spiritual development 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.470
 of your community 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.580
 taurine and in one word the most resistant 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.410
 race embodying a strong and calm spirit 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.480
 other residents of Azeroth are 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.770
 taurine as to the wise and worthy 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.390
 respect the creation of tauren believe that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.360
 all life and nature 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.310
 are sacred in their own way they 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.160
 believe that nature is alive 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.500
 so she according to their philosophy 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.340
 falls into the category of life and is 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.400
 sacred even have stones alive for 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.010
 tauren life doesn't just mean breathing and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.490
 have blood all that is pierced 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.150
 spiritual energy is considered such 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.130
 one big spirit is mother earth 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.570
 less and perfume dwell in stones 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.630
 trees and water 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.690
 that's why taurine and do not dig mines 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.790
 and do not cut down the forest is in their beliefs 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.860
 kills spirits and destroys mother earth 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.930
 who really mother earth is not 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.750
 nobody knows 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.720
 perhaps this is an aspect of life alextraz or 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.489
 its creator is titanium and anar 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.560
 perhaps this word was called the whole 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.410
 pantheon titans who were hard 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.870
 realize primitive taurine and litera 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.110
 Zana Elemental Stone Despite Her 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.570
 chaotic nature and may itself firmament 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.030
 azeroth is not that simple and 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.720
 soulless stone for tauren 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.420
 nature is the mother of the world they feel off the ground 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.000
 and their ancestors they communicate with these 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.340
 spirits for gaining wisdom and knowledge 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.890
 this connection is manifested in their they 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.060
 mystical culture where druids and shamans 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.040
 stand side by side with warriors and hunters 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.010
 taurine and do not see the difference between 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.430
 veneration of nature and hunting hunt 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.470
 it means respecting the spirit of nature tauren live 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.500
 rendering as little as possible 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.110
 change in the environment for example 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.209
 they respect animals that are hunted 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.150
 never killing them more than they need 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.650
 and at the same time they use every particle 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.410
 dead animal 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.840
 they don't think hunting is bad 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.060
 because their ancestors were taught by great spirits 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.150
 which according to their beliefs gave rise to 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.580
 Mother Earth Tauren since ancient times hunt for 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.330
 powerful code and also tame them for 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.150
 their needs 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.250
 they don't like bloodshed since in 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.979
 their deep spiritual beliefs no 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.290
 places for war take away her alien life 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.510
 whether she is human or 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.340
 animal act filled for tauren 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.080
 great value in tauren exists 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.590
 many stories and legends 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.210
 this is another cultural feature 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.000
 although they are literate and they have 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.090
 writing taurine and do not believe the annals 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.020
 and documents they pass on their traditions 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.800
 verbally telling stories they make them 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.680
 alive thereby getting closer 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.000
 to the young and point out to them the importance 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.729
 the stories of their people 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.430
 so young taurine and respect 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.970
 traditions of their ancestors and live by following them 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.130
 already very long preserved 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.630
 legends lift the veil of secrecy about 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.360
 the origin of the tauren 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.490
 this knowledge is contained in the old 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.160
 scrolls albeit old and young 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.090
 knows these legends from birth for heard 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.090
 many times 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:24.850
 sunrises and fogs before the days that we 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.820
 remember mother earth created her breath 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.640
 golden mist and dawn where these 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.290
 amber clouds touched the ground 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.620
 endless wheat appeared 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.820
 each mine fields it was bowls and and 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:42.040
 creations great cup of life and hope 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.430
 very mother earth looked down on 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.030
 the lands she created and the right eye 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:53.410
 Ange and the sun gave warmth and light throughout 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.150
 the earth and the left husband and the moon brought peace 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.180
 and dream of the heyday children 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.860
 the strength of her gaze was such that for now 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.890
 one about her frame is not enough 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.560
 the sky turned the other side and and 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.860
 loving look turned day to night and 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.170
 on the contrary looking with the right eye on the golden 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.260
 dawn mother earth spread her 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.540
 gentle hands over golden plains there 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.990
 where the shadow of her hands came from the ground 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.600
 the noble people rose it shu halu 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.880
 dubbed this arenas came to ascend 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.450
 thanks and prayers 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.120
 mothers there in the endless fields of dawn 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:36.780
 the children of the land have sworn to praise her name 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.529
 until the end of time mother earth escort 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.989
 [music] 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:43.689
 wandering through the fields of flourishing children of the earth 

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:46.539
 heard a dark whisper from the depths of the underground 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:49.719
 this whisper told them about the war and 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:52.719
 cheating many zhuhala fell under his spell 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:55.179
 and let evil in their souls they 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:58.299
 turned away from their good brothers and 

00:06:55.179 --> 00:07:00.399
 lost their pristine purity after seeing 

00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:01.839
 the fall of their children mother earth is not 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:05.049
 endured such grief 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:08.499
 she pulled out her eyes and threw them on 

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:10.779
 the endless sky since he is a neck husband 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:13.029
 from as if wanting to comfort each other 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:16.779
 chasing each other across the sky 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:19.149
 Therefore, the day and replaces the night but even 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:22.299
 blinded mother earth could not stay 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:24.579
 an indifferent wind carried to her ears 

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:27.459
 lead about everything that happened on 

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:30.639
 the dawn plains her loving heart 

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:34.989
 always stayed with her children like her 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:36.969
