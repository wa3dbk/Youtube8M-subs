00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
agents all have in common is that we

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.280 
agents all have in common is that we
really<00:02:12.070> we<00:02:12.400> truly<00:02:13.000> enjoy<00:02:13.360> our<00:02:13.480> jobs<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.020 
really we truly enjoy our jobs and it
and<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.590> shows<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.370> personally<00:02:15.820> I've<00:02:16.000> never

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.509 
and it shows and personally I've never
worked<00:02:16.600> with<00:02:16.780> group<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.260> people<00:02:17.560> more<00:02:18.010> well

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
worked with group of people more well

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.360 
worked with group of people more well
intentioned<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.630> my<00:02:19.810> life<00:02:20.079> so<00:02:20.709> my<00:02:20.890> favorite

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
I guess they would have to be first of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.720 
I guess they would have to be first of
all<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.540> actual<00:02:25.990> physical<00:02:26.710> location<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.550> have
