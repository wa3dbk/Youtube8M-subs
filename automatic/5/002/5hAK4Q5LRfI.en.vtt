00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.840
 I'm Jordi Perez we're in the barbershop 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.550
 of grace and we are going to make you mark a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.200
 Trend cutting is going to take a lot 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.550
 throughout 2015 as it goes 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.460
 leading these last seasons that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 consists of lowering a lot of the sides and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.440
 back to get an extremely measure 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.539
 short by creating a gradient that starts 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.820
 from zero as we go up by 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 the far side gets longer until 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.160
 get to the top part 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.500
 frontal 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.750
 the longer measurement will be combed like 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.970
 if it were a pompadour but instead of being 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 a pompadour all back in this 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.500
 case let's make a streak next to and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 we will think with a kind of toupee and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.149
 visor to complete the image of the sea 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.010
 what we are going to do is respect the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.899
 mustache progress of the beard we are going to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.739
 remove for what we're going to use the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.739
 contour machine 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.240
 usually use carbon pins because 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.010
 not only are they more pleasant to me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
 as a professional for touch but 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.100
 even for the customer at the time of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 pass it on does not scratch it does not bother him lame 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 the new nixon ether machine and I put 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.600
 the cutting head to the position of 19 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.920
 millimeters would be the equivalent to say 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.920
 that I put it to zero and a half 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.120
 this 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.179
 now I have finished in the work of 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.980
 machine and what's left is work from 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.800
 scissors comb 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.860
 a pompadour would be all backwards but 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.870
 the trend tells us that if the hamas 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.050
 side hair that does not but all towards 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.050
 behind 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.380
 this is a cut that really requires 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.240
 of technique very barrier then we are 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.650
 at a time when trends have 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.390
 put on the side of those who luckily 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.700
 we are barbers or we dominate the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.290
 male hairdressing techniques and I'm 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.270
 very proud to have done this 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.100
 video for thermal and pretty density my 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.410
 I work for everyone that is a 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.020
 work I want that very representative of 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.880
 the current time 2015 that is living 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.590
 the barbershop in general not only here 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.030
 but this is a global phenomenon is 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.350
 happening in london in new york in 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.350
 helsinki and in tokyo 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.130
