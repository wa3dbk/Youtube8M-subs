 the new era games playstation games 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.090
 3 playstation 4 and xbox one in media 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.849
 digital 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:23.700
 the good talk, hey, how are you? 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.430
 originating again with another 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.800
 Commented video for you guys in this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.960
 Today's video is no longer a video of today 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.880
 I would like to talk about a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.519
 matter that we say is very exciting 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.050
 This is what I'm talking about because we're going 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:45.329
 talk about nothing less than gta 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.539
 6 because it is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.839
 Several rumors came out talking about it. 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.370
 of gta 6 for a long time there a 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:58.530
 some time ago too 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.489
 but they were rumors kind of pretty weak is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.309
 it's nothing like a super rehearsal spoke 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.880
 but there will be no rumors that he spoke 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.549
 so it's ok there we'll see in the future more 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.509
 now it has been confirmed 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.119
 rockstar confirms grantia auro sic que 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.680
 already in development 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.740
 the little boy 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 the new gta 6 was confirmed by route 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.860
 even before the release of the version of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.140
 gta5, which was postponed until March 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 this year as you can imagine 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.420
 gta 6 will be created 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.409
 specifically for consoles next 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 edition ie for xbox in the year and ps4 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 during interview by the triton in some 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.320
 something k now that we're talking 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.479
 the president of rockstar games leslie 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.390
 Benze explained 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.460
 actually in a low and did not count anything 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.619
 but he like the following I'll read here 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.020
 I already told you about this 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.109
 it's time it developed finally let's go there 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.960
 first comes the idea where the 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:12.120
 first question to be answered then 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.300
 if the missions are decided 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.540
 you are doing things 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.070
 ahead in los angeles than in new 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.290
 york or miami 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.130
 map and history need to work 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.040
 together and history is a basic flow of 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.550
 how does this work so you can 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.340
 adding the layered missions was 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.950
 words of him from the president of 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.980
 rockstar this from here I just read 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.230
 The game is still subjective without any 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.870
 information on how it will 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.840
 or the novelties they will have in relation to 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.450
 but his information that the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.820
 game will already have a sequence already 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.340
 aficionados of one of the most famous 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.820
 games of the present time 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.850
 Good people, let's talk about it. 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.310
 of this gta 6 ad is already gone 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.310
 at least 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.320
 from what will be the ideas 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.420
 game is already confirmed by the 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.990
 rockstar president 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.260
 Then you will do more gta5 yet 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.680
 There's a kind of life still ahead of you. 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.650
 has a long shelf life for gta5 is 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.220
 from now on it counts a lot 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.220
 ability of rockstar what is what 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.090
 can do with gta5 this life that the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.270
 gta5 has what it will take for the game 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.370
 between forgetting that if one day 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.000
 happened which I highly doubt 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 This is worth a lot for the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.510
 by the discipline that rockstar has in 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.430
 keep the game alive keep the game active 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.280
 because if you go to a certain side 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.430
 GTA5 old already has a time he was 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.400
 released by the year is delayed this year 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.640
 is already going to complete two years of life 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.430
 gta5 is no small deal if you look 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.340
 to one side and ubisoft of life say 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.670
 well, two years later, 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.980
 in two games if you will see for a 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.560
 side and life's ubisoft or if we are not going 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.690
 There we go and get another one is another. 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.450
 producer there Developer way by 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.510
 example a night dog dog usually Anori 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.270
 do works of art that really kind 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.120
 you see 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.169
 who has a job on top of that well 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.389
 big right 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.050
 such as whistleblower own vans 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.139
 which has been developing times but 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.780
 which was released in the same year as gta5 and 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.039
 already announced another game of the same 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.840
 producer in the case of the daughter- in- law and dog who is the 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.940
 manchester of 4 that will be released this 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.810
 year then if you go looking for one side 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.319
 and ubisoft of life as I said you see 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.069
 two years for them to announce another 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:04.800
 game is something very time-consuming really is and 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.110
 also get caught as I have already said it is 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.169
 like companies like nokia and dog 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.569
 you see also that two years ago they already 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.050
 they will launch another game 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:19.169
 or gt just like you do not have 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.840
 this notion of time because the game is 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.259
 very big and the game is very great 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.159
 to talk so fucking guy gta 6 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.710
 damn bro but is no longer but I want 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:35.550
 saying it's time they announced 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.860
 not gt a 6 but the rockstar is already on 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.949
 time to announce another game be gt a 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.289
 cei be new red bull inside a new 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.479
 It's smaller I do not know, man, some game, she already 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.840
 You have to resign because you stay two years. 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:52.110
 like I said it's time but that time is not 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.669
 seems to be so great when it comes to 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.250
 a game as alive as it is gta 5 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.130
 while the character story is 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.770
 very superficial was only spoken here 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.229
 they already have the idea in his head 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:11.460
 of how it will be but the development 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:14.039
 It's okay at first, there's no way to talk 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.279
 character terms maps something 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:19.259
 yes then take away all speculations yet 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:21.630
 then any other news year 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:25.139
 I'll come and talk again, here we go. 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.229
 wait for e3 because usually on e3 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.300
 that companies advertise great games 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.389
 So how do you see if something 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.690
 from gta 6 at e3 this year we'll see 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:38.220
 remains to be expected and I, in particular, 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.530
 I do not know if I'm happy. 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:46.410
 The sad to lose my dream is still to see a 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.900
 wÃ©dson two let's say so is 12 mi for no 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.260
 red dead redemption to crazy to see 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.410
 how is ours and head is very top 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.590
 Also I not know I wanted the two to 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.730
 60 to fetch everything a note is can 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.530
 so it's good 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.810
 we expect any other news I 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.550
