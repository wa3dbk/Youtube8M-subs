00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.700
 today is January 12 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:18.900
 half past five in the evening finished him beams and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.760
 put the first two upper parts with 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 this side of my beams go 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:35.989
 completely everything from here will be one gable 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:39.050
 the window from here will be from the front of the house 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.820
 I get here where the beams go 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.149
 here will go the roof go on 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.460
 translation where the beams do not go this 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.460
 it turns out will go gable in front 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.300
 somewhere around five meters 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.809
 gable wide front will be on the bottom and 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:07.200
 ships will bevel these roofs ahead here 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.070
 also the gable will be one window with this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 The parties are now already visible as it goes 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.689
 there will be rooms inside 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.299
 get three rooms beams exposed 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:24.509
 shot down pulled exposed 2 extreme beams 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.750
 pulled a fishing line japan put all 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:33.810
 the rest of the beams, as it were, stand exactly 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.200
 vertical stands themselves banks we 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.409
 shot down three boards 50 by 150 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.360
 it turns out to be done here it turned out 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.110
 I have a joint 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 cans the next one goes the whole junction goes to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.189
 the other side and here through one like this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.189
 So we got knocked out tough 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.060
 that's where the bulkhead goes also 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.250
 will rise u up the partition it will be 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:21.900
 470 from this side of the front and one window 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:52.800
 ahead of the street when I hit the beams 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:56.730
 noticed than here here is more dense you 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.310
 would be shot down danced under 90 degrees 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.950
 the denser it will be shot down the less 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.700
 and leads vibration beams 1 from me 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.920
 It turned out a small gap and there may 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.920
 a little more vibration than she rest 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.850
 over here through the rooftops 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.330
