00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.649
 the ideal line many words for understanding in racing 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.380
 and that is quite right because the ideal line is essential for it 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.199
 fast lap time 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.339
 when i say outside legs outside 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.109
 the will probably make a light on 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.809
 what that means exactly is not going to tell me outside of abroad 

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.759
 extremely sicily 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.199
 the morning phone was still about 180 degrees 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.639
 he goes to the left in that case starting all the way to the right of 

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:32.510
 the job they came here to expand 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.700
 Outside 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.100
 in the bend the wheel after which he was in the wrong side of the track 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.640
 that is approximately 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.990
 are we inside? 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.730
 can from here 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.920
 where do we talk at all but the other side of the basel send it to the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 exterior 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.620
 why booty the legs off to it is about the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.490
 the shortest and the smoothest right are the bend 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.530
 however, it is not symmetrical so it is not pretty round 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.120
 why is it like that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.640
 we actually want 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.040
 rule in fear as straight as possible out of fear, as I said earlier 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.970
 what matters is that you go out of the bend and go a little cheaper out of the bend 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 how do you realize that? 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.030
 you actually crystallize for a long time to drive to the top of the bend 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.220
 at three-quarters of the turn the time the chicken impresses 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.970
 such an important temple returned much more often 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 and from that clipping lives 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 actually the straight line would be possible so this is a point is quite 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 important because here you build the speed for the part that follows 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.640
 so actually or more in this part of the bend 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.310
 a little speed up 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.520
 from this obligation for three quarters of the turn 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.720
 to accelerate a line as hard as possible in as straight as possible 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.630
 feeling says maybe 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.630
 have to steer 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.230
 so you should not do that what happens 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.800
 that was already half the turn in on the cliff import and there 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.500
 from 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.290
 delta to win outside 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.590
 that means that you come outside at this point and this is an area in which 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.840
 the problems just do not go gas because you have one here 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.499
 steering correction must make to make those turns 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.459
 and hatch on the ideal line 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.569
 actually already 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.949
 I'm still sending the gas publisher here 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.290
 the board and gas at the same time it usually goes nothing that means me 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.639
 here just gradually learn to listen 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.159
 therefore the ideal line the basis of the ideal line outside inside and outside that 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.609
 basically applies to every turn 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.139
 however this time around 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.349
 that differs a little per turn 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.349
 it is always between three-quarters and half of the turn 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.579
 but it is shifting towards three-quarters after all 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.989
 the moment the radius of the bend increases with the bock becoming faint 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.539
 you actually go in earlier 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.539
 where 80 km per hour 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.770
 heerenveen 90 degrees 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.049
 part two thirds within the town hall 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.919
 what is it still fixed 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.799
 about that 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 in the middle of the bend, halfway into the bend 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.569
 so the ideal line outside inside outside 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.889
 the costs go to the left 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.259
 so i start on the right side of the job 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.189
 deco more votes than switching back 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.889
 then from the right side next to the windmills there is some three-quarters of the turn 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.459
 is on the inside 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.609
 more than I am involved in 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.389
 then I go to the outside of the track again 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.499
 where I go abroad 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.479
 that is the ideal line
