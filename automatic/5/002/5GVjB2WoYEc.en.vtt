00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
was the worst thing about turning 70

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.260 
was the worst thing about turning 70
thinking<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.010> he<00:00:50.190> would<00:00:50.370> probably<00:00:50.579> say

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.560 

aches<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.660> pains<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.469> being<00:00:55.770> able<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.149> do<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
aches and pains not being able to do the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.779 
aches and pains not being able to do the
all<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.289> things<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.129> could<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.489> when

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
all the things that you could do when

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.180 
all the things that you could do when
you<00:00:59.910> are<00:00:59.940> much<00:01:00.239> younger<00:01:00.649> because<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.890> sort

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
you are much younger because that's sort

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
you are much younger because that's sort
of<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.409> about

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of what I think about when I think about

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.520 
of what I think about when I think about
turning<00:01:05.070> 70<00:01:05.750> although<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.350> in

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
turning 70 although I think I'm in

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.480 
turning 70 although I think I'm in
remarkable<00:01:08.310> shape<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.970> being<00:01:09.150> 70<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:11.040> his

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
remarkable shape for being 70 but his

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.050 
remarkable shape for being 70 but his
response<00:01:12.060> was<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.520> think<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.850> worst

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
response was well I think the worst

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.370 
response was well I think the worst
thing<00:01:15.180> about<00:01:15.540> turning<00:01:15.840> 70<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> being<00:01:16.920> 70<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.380> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
thing about turning 70 is being 70 and I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.410 
thing about turning 70 is being 70 and I
guess<00:01:19.590> he's<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
guess he's right because really and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.789 
guess he's right because really and
truly<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.890> state<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.670> mind<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.799> don't

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
truly it's all a state of mind I don't

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
truly it's all a state of mind I don't
