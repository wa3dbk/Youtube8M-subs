00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
for a Muslim superhero who's the target

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
for a Muslim superhero who's the target
audience<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.479> Muslim

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
audience here is it is that Muslim

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
audience here is it is that Muslim
immigrant<00:01:22.320> community<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> first-generation

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
immigrant community and first-generation

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.510 
immigrant community and first-generation
Muslims<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> wider<00:01:25.619> population<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Muslims or is it the wider population of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.999 
Muslims or is it the wider population of
the<00:01:26.610> u.s.<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.170> think<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.439> way<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:28.829> about

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the u.s. I think the way to think about

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.620 
the u.s. I think the way to think about
it<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.490> when<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> vaccine<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it is like when you get a vaccine that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.179 
it is like when you get a vaccine that
you<00:01:30.869> always<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> bit<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> something<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you always get a bit of something and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.440 
you always get a bit of something and
then<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.400> body<00:01:32.549> reacts<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> become

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
then your body reacts and you become

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
then your body reacts and you become
stronger<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.189> having

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
stronger and I think you know having

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.370 
stronger and I think you know having
different<00:01:36.180> superheroes<00:01:36.840> from<00:01:37.020> different

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380

don't think there's a way to cater to
everybody<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.270> think<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.080> other<00:02:19.230> day

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
everybody I think if the other day

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.920 
everybody I think if the other day
whether<00:02:19.830> people<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.460> or<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.720> world

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
whether people like it or not the world

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.750 
whether people like it or not the world
is<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> diverse<00:02:22.440> place<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.010> walls<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.460> fallen

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
is a diverse place the walls have fallen

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.700 
is a diverse place the walls have fallen
down<00:02:23.790> we're<00:02:24.270> all<00:02:24.360> part<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.690> one<00:02:25.260> growing

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
down we're all part of one growing

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.840 
down we're all part of one growing
culture<00:02:26.130> that's<00:02:26.250> growing<00:02:26.460> in<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> same

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
culture that's growing in the same

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.670 
culture that's growing in the same
direction<00:02:27.080> although<00:02:28.080> some<00:02:28.290> people<00:02:28.410> don't

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
direction although some people don't

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920 
direction although some people don't
like<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:28.980> idea<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.390> so

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
like that idea it is what it is and so

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.600 
like that idea it is what it is and so
just<00:02:31.080> having<00:02:31.320> different<00:02:31.740> representations<00:02:32.460> is

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
just having different representations is

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.090 
just having different representations is
the<00:02:32.730> only<00:02:32.880> way<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.960> breed<00:02:34.410> acceptance<00:02:34.950> and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
the only way to breed acceptance and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.040 
the only way to breed acceptance and
diversity<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.850> think<00:02:36.120> maybe<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.810> one

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
diversity so I think maybe this one

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.360 
diversity so I think maybe this one
doesn't<00:02:37.290> wear<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.410> hijab<00:02:37.560> maybe<00:02:37.950> next<00:02:38.160> one

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
doesn't wear the hijab maybe next one

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.590 
doesn't wear the hijab maybe next one
will<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.940> end<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.270> about<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
will and in the end it's about the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.930 
will and in the end it's about the
average<00:02:40.160> well<00:02:41.160> what<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.490> think<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.760> role

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
average well what do you think the role

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.120 
average well what do you think the role
of<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.360> comic<00:02:42.720> book<00:02:42.750> should<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.260> when<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.800> start

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
of a comic book should be when you start

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.370 
of a comic book should be when you start
getting<00:02:44.280> into<00:02:44.790> those<00:02:44.940> issues<00:02:45.420> though<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:46.080> it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
getting into those issues though is it

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.620 
getting into those issues though is it
simply<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.520> inform<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.060> educate<00:02:48.150> people

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
simply to to inform and educate people

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.040 
simply to to inform and educate people
or<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.050> propagate<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:50.480> think<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.600> know<00:02:51.720> comic

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
or to propagate I think you know comic

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.540 
or to propagate I think you know comic
books<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.380> media<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.740> general<00:02:52.770> can<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.520> of

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
books or media in general can do one of

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.400 
books or media in general can do one of
two<00:02:53.670> things<00:02:53.820> they<00:02:54.270> can<00:02:54.420> either<00:02:54.570> reflect<00:02:55.170> what

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
two things they can either reflect what

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.620 
two things they can either reflect what
exit<00:02:55.890> with<00:02:56.040> what's<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.370> existence<00:02:56.910> or<00:02:57.300> can

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
exit with what's in existence or can

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.150 
exit with what's in existence or can
show<00:02:57.810> people<00:02:57.990> at<00:02:58.320> tomorrow<00:02:58.680> that's<00:02:58.950> better

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
show people at tomorrow that's better

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.490 
show people at tomorrow that's better
than<00:02:59.310> today<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.910> can<00:03:00.209> create<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> reality<00:03:01.350> that

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
than today it can create a reality that

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.380 
than today it can create a reality that
sits<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> future<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.090> think<00:03:03.180> by

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
sits in the future and so I think by

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.390 
sits in the future and so I think by
taking<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.290> step<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.650> creating<00:03:05.280> an

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
taking that step and creating an

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040 
taking that step and creating an
alternative<00:03:05.880> universe<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:06.840> people

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
alternative universe you have people

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.720 
alternative universe you have people
trying<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> gravitate<00:03:08.010> towards<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.610> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
trying to gravitate towards it and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.670 
trying to gravitate towards it and
people<00:03:09.150> need<00:03:09.510> role<00:03:09.720> models<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.230> been<00:03:10.470> it's

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
people need role models it's been it's

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.740 
people need role models it's been it's
been<00:03:10.770> there<00:03:11.070> since<00:03:11.100> time<00:03:11.459> immemorial<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.209> the

been there since time immemorial and the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.020 
been there since time immemorial and the
more<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:12.959> can<00:03:13.230> create<00:03:13.440> characters<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.670> media

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
more you can create characters and media

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.270 
more you can create characters and media
that<00:03:15.630> show<00:03:16.020> how<00:03:16.380> tomorrow<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:16.890> better<00:03:17.190> than

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
that show how tomorrow is better than

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.740 
that show how tomorrow is better than
today<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:18.150> more<00:03:18.330> you'll<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:18.570> people

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
today the more you'll have people

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.479 
today the more you'll have people
thinking<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.260> direction<00:03:19.380> all<00:03:20.310> right

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
thinking in that direction all right
