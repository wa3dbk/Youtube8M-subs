00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
what's interesting about this particular

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
what's interesting about this particular
unit<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:11.970> Core<00:01:12.330> i7<00:01:12.570> based<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
unit is that it is Core i7 based it is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.760 
unit is that it is Core i7 based it is
the<00:01:13.500> core<00:01:13.770> i7<00:01:13.890> 55<00:01:14.790> 57<00:01:15.450> u<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.590> still<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the core i7 55 57 u so it is still a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.580 
the core i7 55 57 u so it is still a
dual<00:01:17.070> core<00:01:17.340> hyper<00:01:17.610> threaded<00:01:18.000> part<00:01:18.380> but<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> has

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
dual core hyper threaded part but it has

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.830 
dual core hyper threaded part but it has
significantly<00:01:20.310> higher<00:01:20.610> clock<00:01:20.909> speeds<00:01:21.270> than

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
significantly higher clock speeds than

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.480 
significantly higher clock speeds than
the<00:01:21.960> previous<00:01:22.409> Nook<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:22.979> looked<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.280> for

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the previous Nook that we looked at for

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
the previous Nook that we looked at for
example<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.060> base<00:01:24.600> clock<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.140> model<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
example the base clock on this model is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
example the base clock on this model is
3.1<00:01:26.369> gigahertz<00:01:26.700> compare<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> base

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
3.1 gigahertz compare that to the base

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.399 
3.1 gigahertz compare that to the base
clock<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.619> 1.6<00:01:29.400> gigahertz<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.960> core<00:01:31.259> i5

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
clock of 1.6 gigahertz on the core i5

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.530 
clock of 1.6 gigahertz on the core i5
model<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> huge<00:01:32.579> difference<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.180> even

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
model that's a huge difference and even

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
model that's a huge difference and even
if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> look<00:01:33.900> at<00:01:34.049> turbo<00:01:34.320> speeds<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:35.159> will<00:01:35.369> go

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
if you look at turbo speeds this will go

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.370 
if you look at turbo speeds this will go
up<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> 3.4<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> previous<00:01:36.810> model<00:01:37.079> only<00:01:37.140> went

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
up to 3.4 the previous model only went

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.219 
up to 3.4 the previous model only went
up<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.560> 2.7<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> pay<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> TDP<00:01:39.780> area

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
up to 2.7 now you pay on the TDP area

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
up to 2.7 now you pay on the TDP area
for<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.770> has<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> TDP<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.700> processor

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
for that this has a TDP the processor

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.210 
for that this has a TDP the processor
itself<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.600> should<00:01:42.780> say<00:01:42.899> has<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> TDP<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.560> 28

951<00:03:36.200> PCI<00:03:37.200> Express<00:03:37.530> nvme<00:03:38.720> SSD<00:03:39.720> now<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.470> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
951 PCI Express nvme SSD now this is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.560 
951 PCI Express nvme SSD now this is
actually<00:03:40.950> interesting<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.580> this<00:03:42.300> marks

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
actually interesting because this marks

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.330 
actually interesting because this marks
