00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.920 
and when you coming up in this curve
that's<00:02:06.430> for<00:02:06.729> mostly<00:02:07.090> resistance<00:02:07.690> your

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
that's for mostly resistance your

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.440 
that's for mostly resistance your
resistance<00:02:08.380> come<00:02:08.619> from<00:02:08.920> once<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.610> pass<00:02:09.850> here

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
resistance come from once you pass here

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.970 
resistance come from once you pass here
it's<00:02:10.869> really<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> lot<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.560> stress<00:02:11.800> on<00:02:11.830> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's really a lot of stress on the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.670 
it's really a lot of stress on the
joints<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.000> they<00:02:13.150> say<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:14.050> use<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> cable

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
and that keeps more tension on the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.270 
and that keeps more tension on the
shoulder

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
