this lesson I will illustrate the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.560 
this lesson I will illustrate the
horizontal<00:00:16.139> size<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> brain<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.570> can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
horizontal size of the brain and you can

already<00:00:21.869> see<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.289> cortex<00:00:23.100> being<00:00:23.519> illustrated

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
already see the cortex being illustrated

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.990 
already see the cortex being illustrated
cortex<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:26.330> has<00:00:27.330> dark<00:00:27.750> color<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
cortex is has dark color because that is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.179 
cortex is has dark color because that is
the<00:00:30.090> place<00:00:30.240> where<00:00:30.359> mostly<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> neuron<00:00:31.800> bodies

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the place where mostly the neuron bodies

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.970 
the place where mostly the neuron bodies
are<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.809> why<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.170> called<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.680> gray

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
are so that's why it's called the gray

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.030 
are so that's why it's called the gray
matter<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:36.180> other<00:00:36.360> part<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.350> white<00:00:37.800> matter

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
matter the other part the white matter

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
matter the other part the white matter
is<00:00:38.989> white<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:41.010> contains<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.629> axons

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is white because it contains the axons

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.130 
is white because it contains the axons
with<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> myelin<00:00:44.640> sheet<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.960> white

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
with the myelin sheet and the white

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.709 
with the myelin sheet and the white
molecules<00:00:46.770> inside<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.460> myelin<00:00:47.850> sheath<00:00:48.090> give

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
molecules inside of myelin sheath give

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.619 
molecules inside of myelin sheath give
it<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.020> brighter<00:00:49.320> color<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.329> probably

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it a brighter color you can probably

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
it a brighter color you can probably
notice<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> temporal<00:00:53.399> lobe<00:00:53.670> over

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
notice this is the temporal lobe over

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.770 
notice this is the temporal lobe over
here<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> frontal<00:00:56.520> lobe<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here and this is the frontal lobe of the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
here and this is the frontal lobe of the
brain<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.190> anzhela

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
brain the anzhela

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.900 
brain the anzhela
the<00:01:00.149> insular<00:01:00.600> cortex<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.410> enclosed<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the insular cortex is enclosed here and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
the insular cortex is enclosed here and
you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.290> pull<00:01:04.589> down<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you can see it if we pull down this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
you can see it if we pull down this
temporal<00:01:06.180> lobe<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.290> able<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> see

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
temporal lobe we would be able to see

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.359 
temporal lobe we would be able to see
the<00:01:08.479> insula<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.740> lift<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the insula or if we can lift up the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.609 
the insula or if we can lift up the
frontal<00:01:11.880> lobe<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:14.119> here<00:01:15.119> right<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.960> being

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
frontal lobe so here right this being

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.910 
frontal lobe so here right this being
Illustrated<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.509> talus<00:01:19.110> after

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
Illustrated right now is the talus after

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.700 
Illustrated right now is the talus after
thalamus<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> pallidum<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.229> pallidum

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
thalamus there is pallidum the pallidum

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310 
thalamus there is pallidum the pallidum
can<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.040> divided<00:01:23.400> into<00:01:23.790> medial<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
can be divided into medial one and the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.070 
can be divided into medial one and the
lateral<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> lateral

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
lateral one so this is the lateral

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
lateral one so this is the lateral
pallidum<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.890> medial<00:01:29.310> pallidum<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
pallidum the medial pallidum and the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.469 
pallidum the medial pallidum and the
talus<00:01:31.400> then<00:01:32.400> comes<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> putamen<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:35.479> after

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
talus then comes the putamen and after

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
talus then comes the putamen and after
the<00:01:36.600> putamen<00:01:37.049> comes<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> claustrum<00:01:39.920> Mura

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the putamen comes the claustrum Mura

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.210 
the putamen comes the claustrum Mura
ventral<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.299> find<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.899> caudate<00:01:43.619> nucleus

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.600 
nucleus so caudate nucleus goes like
this<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.810> goes<00:02:37.019> more<00:02:37.290> cranial<00:02:37.920> cranial<00:02:38.459> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
this it goes more cranial cranial and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.390 
this it goes more cranial cranial and
then<00:02:38.790> goes<00:02:39.000> again<00:02:39.390> caudal<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> kind<00:02:41.310> of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
then goes again caudal so it kind of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.460 
then goes again caudal so it kind of
like<00:02:41.550> if<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:41.910> look<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.209> from<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.599> lateral

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
like if we look it from the lateral

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.650 
like if we look it from the lateral
point<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.920> view<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:45.000> goes<00:02:45.330> like<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.630> okay

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.009 

just<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.269> lateral<00:02:51.269> ventricle<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
just like the lateral ventricle the

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.850 
just like the lateral ventricle the
lateral<00:02:52.650> ventricle<00:02:53.130> also<00:02:53.549> has<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.540> same

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
lateral ventricle also has the same

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.030 
lateral ventricle also has the same
curvature<00:02:57.260> okay<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> lateral

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
curvature okay this is the lateral

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.030 
curvature okay this is the lateral
ventricle<00:02:59.610> with<00:02:59.940> its<00:03:00.120> anterior<00:03:00.510> horn

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040

kobold<00:04:27.449> were<00:04:27.600> fibers<00:04:28.190> now<00:04:29.190> now<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.790> will<00:04:29.970> write

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
kobold were fibers now now I will write

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.050 
kobold were fibers now now I will write
this<00:04:30.600> all<00:04:30.840> down<00:04:30.889> this<00:04:31.889> was<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.340> answer<00:04:32.520> of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
this all down this was the answer of

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.260 
this all down this was the answer of
your<00:04:33.090> horn<00:04:33.449> of<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.690> lateral<00:04:34.169> ventricle<00:04:35.270> then

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
your horn of the lateral ventricle then

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.469 
your horn of the lateral ventricle then
the<00:04:36.449> lateral<00:04:36.810> ventricle<00:04:37.290> goes<00:04:37.500> like<00:04:37.770> this

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
the lateral ventricle goes like this

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.450 
the lateral ventricle goes like this
this<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.750> cranial<00:04:40.530> cranial<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:41.310> then

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
this is the cranial cranial and then

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.180 
this is the cranial cranial and then
again<00:04:41.760> coddle<00:04:42.300> coddle<00:04:42.540> part<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.620> we<00:04:43.889> reach

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
again coddle coddle part and we reach

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.620 
again coddle coddle part and we reach
the<00:04:45.020> posterior<00:04:46.020> horn<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:47.090> again<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:48.449> also

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
the posterior horn and again it also

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.689 
the posterior horn and again it also
goes<00:04:48.900> more<00:04:49.169> caudal<00:04:49.770> which<00:04:50.280> we<00:04:50.400> cannot<00:04:50.639> see

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
goes more caudal which we cannot see

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.060 
goes more caudal which we cannot see
because<00:04:51.060> this<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:51.479> just<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.810> slice<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.350> it

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
because this is just a slice and it

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.210 
because this is just a slice and it
creates<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.790> inferior<00:04:54.360> horn<00:04:54.600> so<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:56.010> the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
creates the inferior horn so this is the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.290 
creates the inferior horn so this is the
posterior<00:04:56.790> horn<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.690> lateral<00:04:58.110> ventricle

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
posterior horn the lateral ventricle

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.640 
posterior horn the lateral ventricle
okay<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:01.289> over<00:05:01.620> here<00:05:02.010> was<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.990> insula<00:05:03.990> or

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
okay this over here was the insula or

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.890 
okay this over here was the insula or
the<00:05:04.919> insular<00:05:05.370> cortex<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:07.620> we<00:05:08.039> had<00:05:08.310> the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
the insular cortex then we had the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:17.350 
the insular cortex then we had the
temporal<00:05:09.900> lobe<00:05:11.479> and<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:14.060> frontal<00:05:15.060> lalo<00:05:15.690> here

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
temporal lobe and the frontal lalo here

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.510 
temporal lobe and the frontal lalo here
this<00:05:18.360> was<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:19.430> claustrum<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:22.280> this<00:05:23.280> white

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
this was the claustrum and this white

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.409 
this was the claustrum and this white
part<00:05:23.820> was<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.419> extreme<00:05:24.990> capsule<00:05:26.000> then<00:05:27.000> we<00:05:27.180> had

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
part was the extreme capsule then we had

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.560 
part was the extreme capsule then we had
the<00:05:28.100> putamen<00:05:29.100> and<00:05:31.010> now<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.039> will<00:05:32.340> read<00:05:32.940> more<00:05:33.389> on

the putamen and now I will read more on

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.909 
the putamen and now I will read more on
the<00:05:33.750> other<00:05:33.870> side<00:05:34.200> because<00:05:34.530> I<00:05:34.620> don't<00:05:34.830> have

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
the other side because I don't have

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.379 
the other side because I don't have
space<00:05:35.160> anymore<00:05:36.710> this<00:05:37.710> was<00:05:37.889> the<00:05:38.010> pallidum<00:05:38.520> this

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
space anymore this was the pallidum this

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.230 
space anymore this was the pallidum this
over<00:05:39.690> here<00:05:40.370> was<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:41.690> lateral<00:05:42.690> pallidum<00:05:43.229> and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
over here was the lateral pallidum and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.480 
over here was the lateral pallidum and
this<00:05:45.240> over<00:05:45.570> here<00:05:45.630> was<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.380> medial<00:05:46.889> pallidum

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
this over here was the medial pallidum

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.990 
this over here was the medial pallidum
we<00:05:50.490> had<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:53.360> caudate<00:05:54.360> nucleus<00:05:55.760> then<00:05:56.760> on<00:05:56.880> the

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
we had the caudate nucleus then on the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.320 
we had the caudate nucleus then on the
back<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:57.840> over<00:05:58.199> here<00:05:58.470> was<00:05:59.070> also<00:05:59.370> the<00:06:00.000> caudate

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
back this over here was also the caudate

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.909 
back this over here was also the caudate
nucleus<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:02.539> was<00:06:03.539> the<00:06:03.840> posterior<00:06:04.650> horn

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
nucleus and this was the posterior horn

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.250 
nucleus and this was the posterior horn
the<00:06:05.550> lateral<00:06:05.940> ventricle<00:06:06.449> as<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:06.780> mentioned

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
the lateral ventricle as I mentioned

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.279 
the lateral ventricle as I mentioned
before<00:06:08.960> this<00:06:09.960> was<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.760> talus<00:06:11.760> and<00:06:12.110> this<00:06:13.110> was

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
before this was the talus and this was

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.800 
before this was the talus and this was
the<00:06:13.440> lesson<00:06:13.650> about<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.610> horizontal<00:06:15.330> slice<00:06:15.570> of

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
the lesson about the horizontal slice of
