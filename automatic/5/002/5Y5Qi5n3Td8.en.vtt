know finding ourselves out of the fore
and<00:00:33.510> sitting<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.260> sixes<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.250> leaves<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and sitting at sixes you know leaves a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.600 
and sitting at sixes you know leaves a
bitter<00:00:35.820> taste<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.329> mouth

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.680 

maybe<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.880> was<00:00:41.910> still<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> little<00:00:42.329> bit<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
maybe there was still a little bit of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.560 
maybe there was still a little bit of
last<00:00:42.899> match<00:00:43.230> lingering<00:00:43.800> over<00:00:44.390> think<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
last match lingering over think if you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.880

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
loved the play sort of felt like we're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.600 
loved the play sort of felt like we're
almost<00:00:47.040> robbed<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.760> game<00:00:49.400> probably<00:00:50.400> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
almost robbed in that game probably the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.720 
almost robbed in that game probably the
worst<00:00:50.820> end<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> conditions<00:00:51.720> and<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> had

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
worst end of the conditions and and had

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400 
worst end of the conditions and and had
that<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.449> had<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.260> been

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that you know that had it not have been

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
that you know that had it not have been
a<00:00:55.440> rain<00:00:55.649> effect<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> match<00:00:56.339> but<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
a rain effect of match but you know

a rain effect of match but you know
there's<00:00:57.030> plenty<00:00:57.150> of<00:00:57.360> things<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:57.900> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there's plenty of things there's a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.420 
there's plenty of things there's a
couple<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.290> games<00:00:58.440> earlier<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> season

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
couple of games earlier in the season

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
couple of games earlier in the season
that<00:00:59.699> went<00:00:59.879> down<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> last<00:01:00.510> ball<00:01:00.839> as<00:01:01.019> well

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that went down to the last ball as well

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.950 
that went down to the last ball as well
and<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.550> sort<00:01:02.790> of<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.150> think<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.690> one

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and you know we sort of I think was one

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
and you know we sort of I think was one
of<00:01:04.050> those<00:01:04.199> scenes<00:01:04.409> where<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.769> look<00:01:05.009> back<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.519> go

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of those scenes where we look back we go

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
of those scenes where we look back we go
you<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.509> what<00:01:07.170> could<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.500> been<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.890> guess<00:01:09.290> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
you know what could have been I guess it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.529 
you know what could have been I guess it
killed<00:01:10.530> us<00:01:10.650> losing<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.130> first<00:01:11.400> two<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:12.270> early

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
killed us losing our first two as early

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.120 
killed us losing our first two as early
as<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.259> then<00:01:13.350> coming<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:13.979> from

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
as we get and then coming back from

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
as we get and then coming back from
there<00:01:14.369> would<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.640> always<00:01:14.970> been<00:01:15.210> tough<00:01:15.450> from

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there would have always been tough from

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
there would have always been tough from
that<00:01:15.750> wicket<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:16.670> unfortunately<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.789> know<00:01:17.910> we
