00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.230
 if I call myself a credit card a 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.750
 rovigo rolling pin we make fires 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.030
 fireworks from three generations of 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.370
 production come to factories where 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.040
 there are technicians based on certain ideas 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.620
 with a certain creativity it is manufactured yes 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.790
 these are the heart fireworks 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.470
 palm shape multiple bombs to give the 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.270
 forms a firework 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.240
 this is art this is the art of 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.530
 pyrotechnic each now in his own way 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.289
 to think about building it are born 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.749
 secrets before we send quote with 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.769
 various designs and we want to propose then 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:48.039
 go precisely this quote the 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:51.519
 company or committee decides which 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.350
 take quote based amounts e 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.359
 then after we build it in the factory 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.850
 show when we come on the plate 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.969
 they are only performing the show 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.899
 then do all the preparation 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.040
 plant that are all 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.960
 cannoncini take a look and then later 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.380
 place the fireworks inside 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.050
 the cannons the ics hour you do it 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.670
 show what is very important 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.090
 be in good standing with all 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.300
 authorizations and if in order with the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.300
 insurance 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.290
 some special work is needed 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.320
 many preparatory courses to me many authorizations 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.960
 once positioned we launch i 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.570
 fireworks high damage of 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.450
 room at a safe distance so 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.950
 such that we have everything under control and 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.780
 at any time we can stop 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.640
 in case there should be any 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.200
 accident or something that gets driven 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.960
 artifices to be 100 percent 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.010
 there is no way we can work 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.790
 on safety 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.070
 it is therefore necessary to work in safety 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.750
 using electronics if we have one 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.510
 certain security as far as the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.790
 operators and the public itself 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.800
 you must then wear professions 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.550
 particular but to the protections yes for 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.910
 law should 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.280
 the helmets life caps over because and it is 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.020
 important for people too 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.960
 respect the limits in this case 100 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.700
 exact meters according to the calibers that you 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.200
 they want to distance themselves from the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.480
 public of 100 meters then 125 as 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.940
 tablets may be the conditions 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.680
 atmospheric conditions that put them in 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.600
 difficulty the wind the wind because in 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.410
 in case you manage to position it 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.290
 show we discover why it comes 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.450
 all protected and in case of rain not 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.220
 put them a problem by shooting the only one 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.980
 selen event all had land to 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.450
 the public cannot be fired by law 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.850
 but besides the law also common sense 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.600
 same Gaddafi son in theory are 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.840
 all balls 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.120
 all balls that once you get to 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.640
 a certain height burst and igniting 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.460
 the colors inside these balls that you 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.980
 they form the various flower of saint remy 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:08.020
 willows whistle something present a 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.239
 plant and we still fill it and 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.580
 i in here are then positioned i 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.280
 fireworks 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.530
 all rigorously inclined towards evil 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.209
 apart from some battery that does n't 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.570
 we support that if here 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.570
 remain 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.690
 as it should be 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:35.260
 they are in the process of housing these 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.700
 a charge is already placed 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.160
 electric and then after this charge 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:48.700
 this goes into a control unit 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.100
 fireworks we have a 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.790
 connection electrical connection that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.900
 it is given by an explosive charge that comes 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.380
 then connected to a control unit that 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.380
 we have a 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.480
 and someone pushbutton you start from 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.860
 firework another a delay 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.780
 so that over time this will 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.530
 salerno to break thoughts of all 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.170
 hill and with a delay we said that 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.220
 what is this data loaded less color 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.040
 gives us a chance to shoot of 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.010
 launch more fireworks at once 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.340
 unfortunately timed in this now 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.860
 moment here emerge companies that 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.650
 they improvise to make follies they do n't have 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.210
 plus the permissions then one 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.510
 unfair competition clearly 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.910
 in the non-pyrotechnic sector 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.490
 having sufficient deposits to feel 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.220
 saying material come on the squares 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.690
 then maybe miss for any reason not 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.510
 you can for example make one 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.270
 show and have to admit theirs 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.160
 material in places where not for reasons 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.340
 of weight and quantity fail to 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.860
 then detain all the violations 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.270
 unfortunately, Liguria is one of those places 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.190
 that these things happen from that 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.100
 now he is guarding the territory 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.860
 the various printed choice is important that 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.650
 no one is very important 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.630
 it is also the whole machine of the stage with 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.940
 track and square help from the brigade 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.969
 we always say that he then added it 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.929
 we specify it is not all day 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:33.799
 so we also had fans like that 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:33.799
 exploded tonight
