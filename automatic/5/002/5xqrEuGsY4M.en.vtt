00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.120
 good as some must know my friend 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.130
 to mister chiche chincha also known 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.590
 like the gentleman that is called a tag of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.540
 anime manga and video games because they do not 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.230
 I have nothing to do because we do not do 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.340
 this start with the manga and anime 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.679
 keep in mind that my knowledge of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.880
 these issues is almost nil so I do not know 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.570
 angry if they come together are not so 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.570
 satisfactory 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.789
 anime I prefer to see more the action 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.829
 feeling on screen that having to 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.480
 read it per page is not that there is something 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.170
 bad with reading manga but I prefer 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.170
 have encouraged him 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.870
 toru watanabe of excelsa then as the 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.590
 that I'm also easily irritable and 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.590
 I'm surrounded by idiots 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.010
 Mr. Pedro de excelsa this character 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.010
 It is street 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 of retro form excel and canet in two and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.690
 recent is this and this one for its 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.140
 person 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.600
 m 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.030
 the final fight against kid book in 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.890
 dragon ball z I know that many like it 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 more the fight against freezer but to me 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.250
 this was much more epic 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 and then 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.570
 jakub with stealth of retirement and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.570
 watanabe and they already expel you 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.110
 health in dragon ball zy excelsa 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.060
 above half Berbers 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.950
 I only read twenty century 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.950
 boys so s 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.440
 a friend taught me blue exorcist and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.480
 it was ok 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.480
 ok now let's talk about what he says 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.740
 according to my mom at 7 years old 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.950
 time is already 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.590
 sides of portal 1 and 2 to be able to achieve 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.590
 be intimidating and funny at the same time 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.069
 the first game that someone bought me 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.170
 It was the star wars for whom I will be 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.750
 the first game I buy with my money 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.750
 it was really the road show 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.520
 that looks funny point even if it's 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.380
 of a genre that I do not like very much or of 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.480
 the company that did it is not so good 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.370
 I will not mind if you see a trailer 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.920
 gameplay of your game and it looks fun 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.080
 that will make me buy your body now 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.420
 have a good story and character 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.490
 is creative and original are things that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.380
 they would bring more to your body but the 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.700
 priority number one for me is that it be 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.540
 a game that I think will give me 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.540
 hours of fun 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.489
 I'm sorry but I can not decide my 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.650
 favorite console all I've had 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.650
 I like them and I can not decide in one 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.060
 bulger cel points more and that's why I wrote 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.060
 fandango brütal legend and bayonetas 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.380
 not at stake many difficult games by 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.860
 be like that so I'll have to say me 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.860
 they call 2 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.030
 from masculine rasputín to 4 trevor 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.700
 phillips and the beige of feminine 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.700
 bayonet sides and rifle bytes 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.599
 could not finish mario and luigi 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.760
 bowser's inside story reach a boss 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.280
 as a very low level and I could not 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.890
 beat juarez 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.670
 also person 3 but it is better laziness 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.670
 that for smoking man 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.640
 I played the super smash bros brawl by 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.640
 approximately 900 hours 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.750
 nine hundred whores hours 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.370
 ok I do not know if it counts as a horror game 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.979
 but it's the one that I've played so 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.210
 go away or maybe I should call it silent 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.800
 hill after we will never see the game 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.800
 full thanks konami 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.680
 I've said it a thousand times but my saga 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.680
 favorite and videogames is pokemon 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.080
 I guess the arkham batman yes 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.280
 by night at the fire of shit that never 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.000
 they're going to finish because this is a 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.000
 whores hours 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.870
 the one I like the most is the one 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.710
 plataformeros and the one that I like the least is 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.710
 the sports 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.320
 this is the only correct answer 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.490
 I have already said it a thousand times for 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.410
 tired of many but I'm you know 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.450
 my favorite game the gameplay is 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.460
 excellent the design of levels is very 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.980
 Creative the characters are memorable 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.110
 the humor is great the concept is 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.330
 original the story is very good and the 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.770
 music is great is not perfect but 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.480
 He has so many things that I love 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.580
 videogames that makes it stand out among 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.690
 any other video game for me is a 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.770
 game that everyone should play 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.770
 at least once 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.570
 well that was all for the tav this 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.700
 is the part where you should guide others 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.390
 people to do this so 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.270
 tagged 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.420
 If they want to do it fine, it did not force them 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.840
 nothing good that's all for now 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.840
 we see
