00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
goes up and then it will go back down

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.110 
goes up and then it will go back down
again<00:05:53.139> so<00:05:53.680> see<00:05:54.039> it's<00:05:54.279> a<00:05:54.370> little<00:05:54.580> tough<00:05:54.759> to<00:05:54.789> time

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
again so see it's a little tough to time

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.760 
again so see it's a little tough to time
but<00:05:55.360> you'll<00:05:55.479> get<00:05:55.599> used<00:05:55.659> to<00:05:55.900> it<00:05:55.960> riding<00:05:56.680> around

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
but you'll get used to it riding around

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.170 
but you'll get used to it riding around
and<00:05:57.129> if<00:05:57.219> you<00:05:57.310> want<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.550> get<00:05:57.639> off<00:05:57.759> your<00:05:57.789> horse

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
and if you want to get off your horse

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.079 
and if you want to get off your horse
the<00:05:58.870> sneak<00:05:59.349> key<00:05:59.680> is<00:05:59.889> the<00:06:00.099> default<00:06:00.490> which<00:06:00.909> is

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.089 
the sneak key is the default which is

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.600 
the sneak key is the default which is
the<00:06:01.300> left<00:06:01.629> shift<00:06:01.960> so<00:06:02.319> BAM<00:06:02.529> came<00:06:03.099> off<00:06:03.250> my<00:06:03.400> horse

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
the left shift so BAM came off my horse

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.610 
the left shift so BAM came off my horse
there<00:06:03.849> and<00:06:04.060> you<00:06:04.719> can't<00:06:04.960> just<00:06:05.169> right<00:06:05.349> click<00:06:05.589> to

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
there and you can't just right click to

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.600 
there and you can't just right click to
get<00:06:05.800> off<00:06:05.919> that's<00:06:06.189> probably<00:06:06.400> going<00:06:06.550> to

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
get off that's probably going to

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.490 
get off that's probably going to
frustrate<00:06:07.029> most<00:06:07.240> people<00:06:07.539> but<00:06:07.930> that<00:06:08.139> is<00:06:08.289> that's

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500
