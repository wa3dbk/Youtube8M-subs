00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
for storage but also that's in here is

the<00:01:49.330> rain<00:01:49.570> cover<00:01:49.810> as<00:01:49.990> well<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:50.260> when<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
the rain cover as well so when the

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.679 
the rain cover as well so when the
heavens<00:01:50.710> do<00:01:50.890> open<00:01:51.250> pull<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.850> up<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.240> pull

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
heavens do open pull that up and pull

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.060 
heavens do open pull that up and pull
that<00:01:52.780> over<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.320> front<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.710> bag<00:01:53.890> and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
that over the front of the bag and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.410 
that over the front of the bag and
that's<00:01:54.220> going<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.430> keep<00:01:54.580> all<00:01:54.820> your<00:01:55.000> gear<00:01:55.240> and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
noise and dry so the bag itself does

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.320 
noise and dry so the bag itself does
have<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.720> really<00:01:59.020> nice<00:01:59.350> adjustment<00:02:00.220> system<00:02:00.520> for

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
the back paneling so rather than using

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.679

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
like frames or anything like that it

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.630 
like frames or anything like that it
just<00:02:04.720> uses<00:02:05.200> good-old<00:02:05.530> velcro<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.430> just

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640
