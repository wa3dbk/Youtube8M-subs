00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.680
 entry journal entry 1 I'm 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.710
 about to embark on one of the 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.440
 great challenges of my scientific career 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.589
 teach physics to penny 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.589
 I'm going to call it a gorilla experiment 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.480
 hello sheldon happens sit the subject has 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.890
 come read 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:30.439
 with a friendly and carefree greeting 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.439
 ready to start a moment 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.770
 the subject seems to be rested and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.930
 enthusiastic 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.930
 happiness is in ignorance 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.850
 it's good to start 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.230
 and your notepad I do not have and how 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.510
 you will take notes and a notebook 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.270
 notes I have to take notes and how 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.790
 if you are not going to study for exams 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.790
 to see an examination of tests 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.319
 take with the rules of the university 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.820
 I hope it does not intimidate you 

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.729
 [Laughs] 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.870
 thank you very well introduction to the 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.900
 physics that means physical physics 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.770
 comes from the ancient Greek word 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 physical 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.990
 Now is when you have to start 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.930
 take notes 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.659
 physics means the science of things 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.060
 natural and it's there in ancient greece 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.350
 where our story begins in the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.690
 ancient greece if you have any questions 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.790
 raise your hand 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.220
 It's a warm summer afternoon towards the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.800
 year 600 before Christ you have finished your 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.920
 shopping in the local market I do 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.920
 now 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.180
 look at the night sky and suddenly you see 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.680
 that some stars seem to be 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.680
 move and flames planets or wandering 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.220
 has this something to do with work 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.850
 of lion this is the beginning of a trip 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.190
 of 2600 years that we are going to perform 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.310
 the ancient Greeks going through isaac 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.660
 newton niels bohr and erwin schrÃ¶dinger 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.770
 until the Dutch researchers to 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.770
 those that leonard is plagiarizing 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.010
 2600 years I am more or less but how was 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.100
 saying it was a warm summer afternoon 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.550
 in ancient greece 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.320
 yes penn and I have to go to the bathroom you can not 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.320
 endure 2600 years 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.490
 gorilla experiment entrance 2 I'm 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.490
 exhausted 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.299
 remember that newton discovered that 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.040
 Aristotle was wrong and not 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.340
 force was necessary to maintain the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.110
 movement so we use the 98 meters 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.540
 per second to the square of the constant 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.730
 of what it turns out is the strength of the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.590
 gravity is equal to the mass by 98 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.470
 meters per second squared then 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.860
 emea is equal amgy that we deduce from 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.860
 that 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.709
 we deduce that Newton was a very uncle 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.709
 ready 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.050
 and that I invented an apple pie 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.570
 not the newton who made pies was from a 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.540
 small town of massachusetts not you 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.040
 happen to count that 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.079
 well yes m what does it imply not what 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.150
 I know but how can you not know it? 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.730
 I just said it has suffered a blow 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.950
 recent in the head 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.840
 and you do not have to be like that 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.740
 I feel you have suffered a recent blow 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.890
 in the head 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.740
 [Music] 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.450
 you're not a disastrous teacher like that 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.580
 those two explanations what do you think the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.620
 most likely 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.260
 shelton I'm trying to understand you but 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.490
 you go too fast you can go back a 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.890
 little backwards it 's fine 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.550
 It's a warm summer afternoon in the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.049
 ancient Greece 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.900
 at what points did you begin to feel 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.790
 lost I do not know then we were 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.650
 looking at the night sky greece 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.380
 look, you do not have to feel 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.640
 frustrated people learn at their pace to 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.480
 opposite of the objects in the vacuum that 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.720
 fall 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.320
 ma same amg 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.320
 do not 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.320
 do not 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.670
 why are you crying because I'm stupid 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.670
 that's no reason to cry 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.170
 one cries because he is sad for example 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.400
 I cry because others are stupid 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.400
 and that makes me sad 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.530
 well let's forget about all this 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.820
 extra information and tell me just what is it 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.050
 that makes the lion according leonard is 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.820
 trying to figure out why the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.300
 subatomic particles move how they 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.010
 They move seriously, that's all, so I do not 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.600
 It seems that it is so complicated and it is not 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.600
 that's why he studies it slowly 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.430
 good just one question that are 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.720
 exactly the subatomic particles 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.090
 very good question 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.270
 thank you to answer it before we should 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:41.850
 ask ourselves what is fission 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.850
 It's a warm afternoon in ancient Greece 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.860
 reig you should have seen in this 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.389
 Lion food to the interface has been 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.370
 spectacular when connecting the beam of 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.960
 electrons I'm glad you'll like the 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.050
 people are not usually very interested in what 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.050
 I make 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.400
 in reality that is not true leonard of 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.139
 done now I'm thinking that given the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.610
 transport experiment parameters 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.139
 of electrons through the opening of 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.789
 new metal rings do not really 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.139
 has no qualitative difference with 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.590
 the experiment carried out in the 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.590
 Netherlands 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.170
 there he observed the phase change in 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.730
 electrons inside the metallic arch and 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.230
 therefore it was more than patent 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.900
 the quantum effect of aaron or bong with 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.080
 Interface 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:30.490
 [Laughs] 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.490
 and they were already high and plateau 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.980
 the apple pie is from one of 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.460
 massachusetts sign of the scientist 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.460
 newton
