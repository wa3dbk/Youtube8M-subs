 p 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.650
 the Swedish brand has launched the family body variant of the saloon s60 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.619
 and as usual the so-called pune 60 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.480
 this new public comes to join the v50 that are based on the s40 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.480
 and v70 based on the s80 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.479
 The main differences between the v60 and the s60 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.360
 estimate that the first offers a greater height in the rear seats 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:36.940
 and a larger capacity trunk 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.949
 with 430 versus 380 liters which means that it is a vehicle more 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.120
 practical and functional 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.340
 with equal motor and finishing level 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.270
 the v60 have a price superior in 1,500 euros to the fish 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.550
 the size of the relative is identical to that of the saloon 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.050
 with a length of 4 as 63 meters a width of 1 as 87 meters and a height 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.930
 from 1 to 48 meters 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.150
 the tested version 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.350
 It has a gasoline engine of 2 liters of displacement with four 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.250
 Inline cylinders and double overhead camshaft 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.040
 to operate four valves per cylinder 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.100
 uses a turbocharger coupled to an inter culer 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.250
 and a direct injection system 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.780
 the maximum power of 203 horses at 6 thousand revolutions per minute 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.009
 and the maximum thrust torque reaches the figure of 300 minutes per meter 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.749
 that remain constant between one thousand 754 thousand revolutions per minute 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.430
 the available force reaches the front wheels through a change 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.310
 automatic or double clutch 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.210
 six-speed power shift 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.060
 and allows the thousand 715 kilograms weighing the car to accelerate from zero to one hundred 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.640
 kilometers per hour in 8 to four seconds and reach 230 kilometers 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.150
 per hour 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.440
 the aerodynamics is good with a penetration coefficient c xtc or as 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.600
 29 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.390
 the average consumption approved by the brand the g8 as to three liters per 100 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.090
 kilometer 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.660
 and in our test we have held eleven as to 4 liters per 100 kilometers a 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.979
 rather less convincing figure 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.199
 the fuel tank has a capacity of 68 liters 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:17.409
 the tested version has a passenger compartment of amplitude comparable to that of 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.000
 other models of the segment 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.600
 although it is worth noting that materials and finishes enjoy a remarkable 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.129
 perceived quality 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.540
 the test unit had leather upholstery and inserts 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.039
 decorative aluminum 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.990
 two 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.860
 it also includes the optional multimedia prizes package that costs a thousand 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.320
 533 euros that includes a dvd multimedia player with color screen 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.770
 7-inch and bedroom surround sound undefeated 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.790
 with a 5-percent 30-watt amplifier and 12 speakers 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.079
 the option of digital television also costs 511 euros 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.949
 the sound is of very good quality and connection is available spits headquarters and still 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:58.590
 ciliary 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.590
 as well as products for hands-free mobile phone 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.389
 The headrests of the rear seats can be folded from the 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.489
 front seats 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.590
 by means of an electric control mechanism 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.230
 and this prevents them from taking visibility away from the driver when they are not busy 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.230
 the rear seats 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.149
 there are adjustable air vents on the sides and how is it 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.779
 habitual to the rear central plaza is noticeably more uncomfortable than 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.239
 exterior 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.650
 the 430 liters of the trunk 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.349
 they are not a remarkable figure in a family of this size although under the 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.000
 floor of a hidden compartment of 30 liters and the volume can be increased 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.379
 folding down the rear seats 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.729
 there is no spare wheel available only from a puncture repair kit 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.199
 the gate does not have electric assistance which makes its 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.199
 Drive especially when the car is very dirty 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:55.510
 but of 60 it offers a little capacity of turn 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.979
 what harms its agility the city especially at the moment of parking 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.969
 the rear view camera is a good help in parking lots but it is a 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.969
 option that costs 800 98 euros 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.160
 an interesting option that the test unit had 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.949
 is the active chassis 11 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.139
 which has a price of one thousand 647 euros 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.749
 there are three programs of operation that are called comfort and bread 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.370
 the first offers the most comfortable unemployed 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.320
 in the second only something harder although without penalizing much comfort and in 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.539
 the third poverty is remarkable with a minimum rolling of the body 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.629
 the abbas program is only advised that when you want to circulate Paris 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.629
 showed fast on roads with many curves 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.699
 the flying posture is well resolved by the comfortable seats and that suffers 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:50.819
 also the body 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.560
 Equipped with electrical regulation the test unit the support platform 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.559
 for the left foot is correct although a little short 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.039
 the direction is quite fast with two like 58 turns of steering wheel between 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:04.550
 caps 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.860
 and enjoys remarkable precision and brakes with four discs the 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.860
 self-ventilated strips do their mission well 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.669
 security is one of the hallmarks of the Swedish brand and the pubic 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.249
 60 series account with device 6 and if you 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.939
 which can detect an obstacle and brake the car automatically 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:27.689
 to avoid the shock 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.439
 if it circulates paul spoke city less than 35 kilometers per hour 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:36.339
 this system avoids the commission and in case the speed is greater the 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.509
 braking reduces speed to decrease the effects of shock 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.130
 Electronic stability control is state-of-the-art and can 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.130
 intervene in the trajectory before the car loses grip 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.680
 previously fernando the appropriate wheel which provides greater agility
