00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.660
 we were super young then 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.139
 like I had to complement it from 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.180
 the school then like it was coming 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.240
 used from school to what 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.960
 it's like studying and being a mother the Augustinian 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 is 3 years and 3 months is a girl but 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.719
 exquisite the decision to change 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.059
 move on to this career at the university 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:34.120
 of the pacifico should be a decision 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.430
 something too responsible than 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.950
 I will not regret in the background being 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.710
 mom and take him study is an effort 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.899
 double then be here and see that 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.909
 I'm really happy with the race 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.879
 that I am satisfied in the background with the 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.859
 decision I make makes me happy 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.780
 with the university because in the background 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.909
 they met all my expectations everything 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.300
 what I thought the university was 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.300
 fulfilled 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.690
 the difference that 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.760
 What was more noticeable in this 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.040
 university are the branches that others 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.560
 universities do not value much 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.000
 the whole issue of having branches over 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.380
 entrepreneurship and that really 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.500
 deliver the tools as 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.560
 commercial engineer to go out and be able 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.540
 say ya like I'm really ready 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.390
 for the labor field I'm really 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.119
 prepared to undertake to have a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.490
 project and be really good what it is 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.150
 what I at the moment enter engineering 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.150
 commercial wanted 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.770
