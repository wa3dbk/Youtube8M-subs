00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.539
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.930
 channel video today I bring you Europe from 

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:07.930
 month of January 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.770
 I am but I bring a little with rejection but 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.869
 I have not had time to do it before 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.810
 but it is here of the first 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.290
 levels that speak are after extreme 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.180
 pieces and art lost souls good as 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.160
 I see you with these three books all the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.700
 I'm going to leave the soul here because 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.190
 they weigh an egg so I'm going to take one 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.989
 I think you go laws the first three 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.300
 books of this saga during January already 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.680
 it only remains is in the room has 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.720
 understood a lot the books have me 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.719
 liked and I made a video giving my 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.000
 opinion about doing that I leave you here and 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.710
 well I do not see that to extend much not only 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.929
 best books in the world but if you 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.359
 I want to relax for a while and read something 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.780
 Fast and fresh are highly recommended 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.579
 I gave them a good grade between a 3 and 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.159
 a 4 in goodreads so 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.989
 They were not bad, we will go a lot 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.830
 times in the room the next reading 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.270
 faith the second part of a trilogy that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.970
 started and I'm really enjoying it and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 I'm throwing the end and she's the queen 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.700
 crystal two of alonso and javier 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.119
 pelegrin in December I read his first 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.360
 part is a very fantasy story 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.880
 different than what we are used to 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 normally it's very simple is about 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 mermaids but it's really a sirens 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.350
 very different from everything we've heard 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.470
 talk about them I liked a lot 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.479
 the plot that takes this saga is super 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.119
 simple no doubt wishing to read the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.009
 outcome I would read both books four of 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.319
 five stars in cutris because of 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.539
 true that fascinated me especially the 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:54.149
 second was wow I can not believe that 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.899
 this is happening so if you feel like it 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.569
 read some fantasy of these books 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.299
 the following reading is great 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.940
 I had a great discovery and I 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.550
 loved it was black thread scholarships and it 's 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.379
 patrick had never read but alone and in 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.629
 first the truth that I liked the most 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.580
 a lot but he did not study to continue with the saga 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.470
 because I never took it from the library 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.269
 and in the library there were not 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.700
 next and then I always get lazy 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.769
 buy me because I'm sorry to buy 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.629
 my first because I had already read and it gives me 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.120
 lets you buy me the others if I do not 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.250
 I buy first dilemmas of life like this 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.920
 how good I decided this one is 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.349
 autoconclusivo is a juvenile thriller 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.330
 that I thought was a pass, I did not 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.040
 I could believe what was happening every moment 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.720
 I was reading tits on some 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 girls to spend the weekend of the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.519
 mountain but the snow prevents them from arriving 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.409
 at their destination they are kidnapped and they do not know 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.959
 the nightmare that you are going to find 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.019
 I thought it was great the turns are 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.110
 I really amazing if you think 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.599
 you liked hush hush you must ice black and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.790
 if we liked it, I think that comes face father and 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.549
 it improves a lot in this novel I say it from 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.379
 truth and certainly you have to read it on 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.510
 five-star meeting in guthrie 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:11.629
 and in topics you will not see what 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.920
 and if you like great leader it is the 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.989
 teacher in the iron test left 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.269
 free and cassandra clare did not know what 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.939
 wait for this book my god has 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.370
 delighted delighted delighted but 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.739
 delighted if it turns out that at the beginning 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.840
 I was going to be a fanfic fan if I left the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.579
 power that the authors were doing and 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.170
 that principle shows a little but 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.329
 undoubtedly the bleeding world of these two 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.760
 authors has nothing to do with harry 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.260
 potter have created something totally new 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.450
 and that my god 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.909
 we create expectation for the next 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.639
 awesome book is to create a world of 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.290
 more than totally new there are no wands 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.480
 the image is used totally 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.459
 different than what we are used to 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.450
 and I'm definitely looking forward to the 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.069
 second part and I suffer because it does not come out 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.170
 up for a long time and over 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.389
 so I see it going out a book each 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.810
 year and this is going to be an ordeal and a 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.810
 suffering 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.930
 well this book has been a little 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.450
 childish but I think it's because 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.360
 protagonists are quite small the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.549
 twist that has the ending is amazing and 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.510
 I was left with my mouth open I think what 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.850
 weakest in history are the 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.520
 characters but especially that there 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.000
 some who try to give importance 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.250
 and an attempt remains there and they do not reach 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.530
 do what they have to be but good 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.050
 I think the second part the little ones 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.229
 failures that vampires have for 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.850
 improve because with that end I'm 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:41.030
 very sure that it will be wow 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.100
 so I certainly encourage you a lot 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.500
 read teaching in the iron test 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.870
 I gave him a four and a half five 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.790
 stars in cutris good a picture of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.950
 five pesos four thousand and finally 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.360
 I also read a red smile with the 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.910
 blood the truth of the story of 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.560
 hansel and gretel from adam gatwick good yo 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.690
 outside or I asked for it because it calls me 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.840
 attention but I never thought that I was going to 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.820
 I loved so very much like to 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.200
 cesc unofficial history of hansel and 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.900
 gretel and if you like brothers grimm 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.310
 and this is going to like an edition 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.950
 precious to notice is the details in the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.500
 pages are super pretty 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.770
 this book I marvel is an hour of 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.170
 as of my treasures because despite 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.610
 be childish in the child because 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.040
 they have super bloody moves 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.870
 totally recommended also in 45 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.270
 God is simply the pictures of 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.610
 five stars in gray and the truth that 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.710
 this month you have readings that the truth 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.870
 that I enjoyed it all did not have 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.880
 no bad reading so I'm super 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.680
 happy and that's all for today I 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.360
