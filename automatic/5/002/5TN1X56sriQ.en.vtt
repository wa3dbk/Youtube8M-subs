00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.890
 Vladimir Putin today gave a big 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.839
 interview topic was only one situation 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.880
 in Ukraine in the country occurred 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.800
 coup d'état of the new government 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.259
 Russia does not recognize and considers them 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.750
 illegitimate these are the words that uttered 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.350
 the president and he also talked about entering 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.510
 troops heard Dmitri Tarkhov on colleague 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 put the president of russia looks no 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.230
 neither surprised more likely we have no task 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.670
 the prospect of war from Ukraine and and not 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
 maybe because it can't be 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 wars between fraternal nations even though 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 will take place in the notes of the Russian troops on 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.230
 eastern Ukraine by the way this is not yet 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.660
 of necessity 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.370
 if we make such a decision only for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.129
 protect ukrainian citizens and let 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 will try one of the soldiers 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.570
 shoot your people who are behind 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.340
 which we will stand tighten in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.520
 move don't let not try 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 shoot women and children i'll see 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.730
 on those who give such an order to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 Ukraine and the impossible potential 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.390
 Western reaction that threatens 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.190
 economic sanctions against Russia 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.109
 just in modern closely related 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 the world any sanction against such a country 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.189
 how our threatens to turn global 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.990
 tea problems and not even threats not 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.299
 arrive at the G8 summit in 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.850
 soup by internet we are preparing for 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.770
 eights are ready to host 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
 our colleagues if they want to come to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.170
 it is not necessary outwardly this is the main question 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 why in a country where the opposition is actually 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 chemistry has come to power 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.350
 signing by President Yanukovych and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 supporters of euromaidan in the presence of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.500
 three European ministers and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 Russian representative January 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070
 agreements begins to gush and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.070
 there can be only one estimate 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.009
 this is an anti-constitutional coup and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.990
 armed grip west power 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 it was beneficial to a weak president 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.259
 Yanukovych who obviously hasn't 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.960
 political future 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.570
 I want to understand why it is done and so 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.939
 passed essentially all power and he I 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.229
 I think and I told him about it was not 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.560
 no chance of re-election 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.630
 and all agree with this all my colleagues with 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 whom i talked in last for 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.979
 days on the phone why was it necessary 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 engage in illegal anti 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.060
 constitutional actions and introduce 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.590
 the side 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.179
 pull the country into 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.729
 the chaos she turned out to be today 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.870
 until now, after all, militants are roaming around Kiev 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.819
 masked with weapon in hand 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.830
 maybe then the position of ordinary citizens 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.290
 who wanted a country mired in 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.730
 corruption and crime change i understand 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.810
 nonetheless those people on Independence 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:30.349
 which still require no no 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.760
 some repairs there facade power 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:37.160
 requires cardinal changes namely 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.739
 why they demand because they already 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.590
 accustomed that some crooks change to 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.360
 other crooks and rogues but then 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.980
 elections were called and the world seemed to be 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.900
 imprisoned and even the police 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.599
 it is derived from the territory of Kiev by 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.849
 order essentially surrendered to yanukovich and 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.010
 right after that, chaos began 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.379
 which for some reason in the west consider 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.970
 the triumph of democracy and the people of power 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.230
 when they captured the building of the party of regions 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.519
 you know what happened there at all 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.670
 nobody was spoiled 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:12.579
 two three technical staff members came out 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.810
 staff one engineer out and said 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.030
 let your guys attack us 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.950
 women miss please i am an engineer i 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.630
 I don’t even have any politics 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.569
 it’s nothing from ours and right there on 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.220
 eyes of the crowd shot the second such 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.459
 same person from the technical staff 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.099
 driven into the basement and showered with bottles 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.810
 ground cocktails ate alive 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.579
 it is also a manifestation of democracy there is no 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.349
 ordinary citizens of Ukraine did not do they 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.540
 just burned under the police uniform 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.940
 shaved with incendiary mixture or killed 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.459
 under the bullets of unknown snipers by the way 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.310
 perhaps not so unknown that 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.410
 Now there is opinion including among on 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.620
 recently your rally that it was 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.459
 provocateurs with one of the opposition 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.599
 parties and you heard about it if here 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.150
 look at this stuff they have in 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.870
 open source means therefore that 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.430
 it is very hard to understand there now 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.420
 but you and I saw beautifully when 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.120
 Golden Eagle fighters stood combination and in them 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.739
 shot from the bottom of the pneumatic from 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.930
 combat weapons shooting through them on 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.159
 the speed here is exactly seen and then 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.530
 on the streets of Kiev began to appear 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.660
 swastika to be nazis for some reason entered into 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.150
 fashion because the heroes of the coup became 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.590
 out of nowhere people who know 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.690
 urban battle tactics 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.419
 able to handle weapons between 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.800
 fights shouting out 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.449
 nationalistic slogans if we 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.520
 see that this mess begins 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.470
 Eastern regions if they see by asking 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.510
 us for help and official appeal 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.580
 acting in legitimate president 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.680
 you already have something we reserve 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.010
 the right to use all available 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.990
 means to protect these citizens 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.789
 people in the east of the country basically began 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.770
 to unite the same Crimea is similar to 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.020
 fortified own army and combat 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.810
 technique and yet if the protection will be 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.210
 need Russian army come but hope 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.100
 this does not happen at all there is a big 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.229
 just need to stop the wave 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.270
 nationalism and hate which 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.130
 swept over Ukraine and which for some reason 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.750
 so actively supports the west 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.849
 our western partners do it on 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.740
 Ukraine and the first time I sometimes became 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.849
 one impression what's behind the big puddle 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.849
 sit somewhere in america such 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.539
 employees whose lab and how 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.979
 over rats there for some are held 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:29.020
 experiments do not understand later 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.789
 what is not done 6 due to 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.620
 really terrible economy in ruins 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.509
 Ukraine has nothing to pay for Russian 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.460
 gas by the way because of this today she 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.500
 lost discounts that gave her 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.449
 dissipated power can hardly be called 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.909
 only partly legitimate 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.430
 supreme glad this one is only partly and 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.169
 the main wild social tension is 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.330
 hope for presidential elections which 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.400
 must pass this year true what 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.189
 they will rightly require 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.550
 fundamental policy changes and withdrawal 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:06:01.090
 on on new absolutely fresh people 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.009
 top power patterns there is danger 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.990
 what the hell can of a snuffbox 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.930
 pop this bit nationally to the floor 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.580
 fascist elements and we see that 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.680
 traveling people walking around Kiev 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.840
 resembling a swastika any 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.849
 anti-semite such danger too 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.710
 exists and yet Ukraine was and is 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.089
 friendly state for Russia 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.460
 the truth is how relations will develop 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:23.500
 further it is difficult to say while the power is there 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.870
 illegitimate and participation in political 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.949
 only western and 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.199
 central regions 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.539
 and full contacts can hardly 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.819
 be talking and bye people 9 by the principle 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.729
 new or language they use in 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.979
 communicating with each other too dmitri is 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.180
 and sprints never occurred to me 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.370
 Vladimir Putin has just discussed 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.039
 situation in Ukraine from the head of China si 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.589
 Jinping essentially Beijing supported 10 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.050
 Russia in the Crimea there expressed the hope that 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:51.909
 they will help reduce publicly 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.560
 political tensions provide 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.560
 security and Russian-speaking citizens
