off I've experimented around with it
quite<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.420> half<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.619> time<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.130> will

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
quite a bit half the time that will

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.290 
quite a bit half the time that will
start<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.610> its<00:01:44.790> own

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
start on its own

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.070 
start on its own
you<00:01:47.080> know<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.230> never<00:01:47.440> know<00:01:47.590> which<00:01:47.950> now<00:01:49.080> the

you know you never know which now the
direction<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.710> started<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.310> right<00:01:51.490> now<00:01:51.700> I've

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
direction I started it right now I've

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.430 
direction I started it right now I've
got<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.270> time<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.690> little<00:01:52.780> bit<00:01:52.900> retarded

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
got the time and a little bit retarded

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.890 
got the time and a little bit retarded
going<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.890> direction<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.640> engine<00:01:55.030> will

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
going that direction is this engine will

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.410 
going that direction is this engine will
run<00:01:56.050> either<00:01:56.320> way<00:01:56.470> your<00:01:56.680> nose<00:01:56.860> now<00:01:57.730> this<00:01:57.940> way<00:01:58.180> it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
run either way your nose now this way it

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.820 
run either way your nose now this way it
will<00:01:58.510> get<00:01:58.630> up<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:58.900> run<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.050> little<00:01:59.200> faster<00:01:59.680> that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
will get up and run a little faster that

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.500 
will get up and run a little faster that
does<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.220> other<00:02:00.340> way<00:02:00.520> because<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.330> you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
does the other way because of that you

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.230 
does the other way because of that you
have<00:02:01.630> less<00:02:01.930> low-end<00:02:02.410> torque<00:02:02.730> you<00:02:03.730> can<00:02:03.880> adjust

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
have less low-end torque you can adjust

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.020 
have less low-end torque you can adjust
the<00:02:04.390> timing<00:02:04.810> on<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:05.050> engine<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:06.700> what<00:02:06.910> it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
the timing on the engine that's what it

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.310 
the timing on the engine that's what it
11<00:02:09.240> that's<00:02:10.240> getting<00:02:10.630> going<00:02:10.810> up<00:02:10.930> pretty<00:02:11.110> good

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
11 that's getting going up pretty good

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.750 
11 that's getting going up pretty good
right<00:02:11.530> there<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> math<00:02:14.110> I've<00:02:14.440> done<00:02:14.760> by

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
right there from the math I've done by

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.030 
right there from the math I've done by
using<00:02:16.150> my<00:02:18.420> icon<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:20.110> check<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:20.680> meter<00:02:20.890> this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
using my icon to check you on meter this

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.390 
using my icon to check you on meter this
parity<00:02:21.490> parts<00:02:21.850> four<00:02:22.090> times<00:02:22.390> per<00:02:22.660> red<00:02:23.220> most<00:02:24.220> of

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
parity parts four times per red most of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.130 
parity parts four times per red most of
the<00:02:24.520> time<00:02:24.820> this<00:02:25.240> little<00:02:25.390> engine<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:25.930> run

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the time this little engine will run

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.010 
the time this little engine will run
right<00:02:26.440> at<00:02:26.620> about<00:02:26.890> 350<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.760> 400<00:02:28.300> Hertz<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.870> it's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
right at about 350 to 400 Hertz so it's

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.930 
right at about 350 to 400 Hertz so it's
actually<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:30.040> needles<00:02:30.400> probably<00:02:30.760> only

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
actually the needles probably only

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.160 
actually the needles probably only
moving<00:02:31.180> at<00:02:31.330> about<00:02:32.340> 1650<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.640> 16<00:02:34.300> maybe<00:02:34.600> 70

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
moving at about 1650 to 16 maybe 70

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.600 
moving at about 1650 to 16 maybe 70
Hertz<00:02:35.350> sometimes<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.100> get<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.310> tuned<00:02:36.520> just

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
Hertz sometimes you get it tuned just

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.980 
Hertz sometimes you get it tuned just
right<00:02:36.790> around<00:02:37.360> 6<00:02:37.750> volts<00:02:38.260> if<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.660> run<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.810> much

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
right around 6 volts if you run it much

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.810 
right around 6 volts if you run it much
more<00:02:41.260> than<00:02:41.320> about<00:02:41.530> 6<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> half<00:02:42.130> volts<00:02:42.490> and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
more than about 6 and a half volts and

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.210 
more than about 6 and a half volts and
probably<00:02:43.150> heat<00:02:43.300> up<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:44.500> mostly<00:02:44.950> just

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
probably heat up it's mostly just

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.070 
probably heat up it's mostly just
something<00:02:45.550> neat<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.880> look<00:02:45.910> at<00:02:46.240> anyhow<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:46.840> yes

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
something neat to look at anyhow but yes

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.780 
something neat to look at anyhow but yes
you<00:02:47.320> could<00:02:47.530> tattoo<00:02:47.770> with<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.250> mean<00:02:48.430> obviously

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
you could tattoo with I mean obviously

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.760 
you could tattoo with I mean obviously
I've<00:02:48.910> gotta<00:02:49.090> meet<00:02:49.270> loads<00:02:49.570> up<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.500> will

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
I've gotta meet loads up in it it will

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.470 
I've gotta meet loads up in it it will
tattoo<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:52.360> some<00:02:53.880> motion<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:54.970> looks<00:02:55.239> cool

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
tattoo it some motion this looks cool

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.940 
tattoo it some motion this looks cool
yeah<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.050> one<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.290> those<00:02:56.380> things<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.800> like

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
yeah this is one of those things I like

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.520 
yeah this is one of those things I like
to<00:02:56.980> build

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.680 

like<00:03:00.620> what<00:03:00.830> else<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.130> could<00:03:01.310> say<00:03:01.340> about<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:02.209> take

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
like what else I could say about it take

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.090 
like what else I could say about it take
a<00:03:02.720> look<00:03:02.930> at<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.080> points<00:03:03.500> they're<00:03:03.680> working<00:03:04.040> but

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
a look at the points they're working but

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.559 
a look at the points they're working but
you<00:03:04.220> don't<00:03:04.370> see<00:03:04.550> any<00:03:04.670> spark<00:03:04.970> blowing<00:03:05.270> off<00:03:05.390> of

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
you don't see any spark blowing off of

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.210 
you don't see any spark blowing off of
them<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:05.840> there<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> capacitor<00:03:06.770> inside

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
them because there is a capacitor inside

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.660 
them because there is a capacitor inside
it<00:03:07.810> takes<00:03:08.810> care<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:10.040> can<00:03:10.190> adjust<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
it takes care of that we can adjust the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.480 
it takes care of that we can adjust the
timing<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.180> little<00:03:12.640> back<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.880> down<00:03:14.030> more<00:03:14.690> of

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
timing a little back it down more of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.360 
timing a little back it down more of
course<00:03:16.490> not<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.000> I'm<00:03:17.090> barely<00:03:17.780> getting<00:03:18.370> adjust

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
course not so I'm barely getting adjust

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
course not so I'm barely getting adjust
it<00:03:19.520> down

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.080 

you<00:03:22.569> have<00:03:22.750> some

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.400 

pretty<00:03:28.750> strong<00:03:29.140> right<00:03:29.410> there

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
pretty strong right there

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.610 
pretty strong right there
but<00:03:32.070> that's<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.550> that's<00:03:33.180> my<00:03:33.390> newest<00:03:34.020> electric

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
but that's it that's my newest electric

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.060 
but that's it that's my newest electric
engine<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:36.290> don't<00:03:37.290> know<00:03:37.440> what<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.740> I<00:03:37.830> say

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
engine it's I don't know what can I say

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.110 
engine it's I don't know what can I say
it's<00:03:38.310> new<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.790> know<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.660> rotary<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.380> I'm

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
it's new you know it's a rotary that I'm

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.970 
it's new you know it's a rotary that I'm
any<00:03:42.120> tattoo<00:03:42.690> artist<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.530> know<00:03:43.650> messes

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
any tattoo artist that you know messes

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.010 
any tattoo artist that you know messes
around<00:03:44.010> with<00:03:44.250> machines<00:03:44.640> much<00:03:45.020> maintaining

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
around with machines much maintaining

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.870 
around with machines much maintaining
keep<00:03:46.200> going<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.740> got<00:03:46.890> ball<00:03:47.160> bearings<00:03:47.640> on

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
keep going it's got ball bearings on

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.470 
keep going it's got ball bearings on
both<00:03:48.060> ends<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.630> shaft<00:03:48.870> here<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:51.270> only

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
both ends of the shaft here the only

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.030 
both ends of the shaft here the only
parts<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:51.960> we're<00:03:52.260> out<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.590> something<00:03:52.950> like

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
parts really we're out on something like

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.910 
parts really we're out on something like
this<00:03:53.340> would<00:03:53.670> be<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.970> spring<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.410> contact

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
this would be the spring and the contact

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.020 
this would be the spring and the contact
screws<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.370> not<00:03:56.640> going<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.820> read<00:03:57.000> your

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
screws just not going to read your

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.970 
screws just not going to read your
tattoo<00:03:57.480> machine<00:03:57.840> well<00:03:58.020> it's<00:03:58.200> got<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> cam<00:03:58.650> lobe

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
tattoo machine well it's got a cam lobe

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.310 
tattoo machine well it's got a cam lobe
but<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.520> hardened<00:04:00.210> this<00:04:00.390> cam<00:04:00.690> low<00:04:00.960> but<00:04:01.200> it

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
but I hardened this cam low but it

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.520 
but I hardened this cam low but it
should<00:04:01.500> last<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:02.300> long<00:04:03.300> long<00:04:03.540> time<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:04.320> should

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
should last a long long time it should

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.040 
should last a long long time it should
last<00:04:04.740> no<00:04:04.920> problem<00:04:05.490> well<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.120> guess<00:04:06.360> that's<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.840> I

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
last no problem well I guess that's it I
