gonna do is I'm going to use a single
male<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.260> male<00:00:10.440> servo<00:00:11.540> cable<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.019> I'm<00:00:13.200> gonna

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
male to male servo cable and I'm gonna

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.510 
male to male servo cable and I'm gonna
split<00:00:13.860> those<00:00:14.219> out<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> there<00:00:15.960> each<00:00:16.770> individual

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
split those out of there each individual

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.779 
split those out of there each individual
one<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.810> gonna<00:00:18.990> heat<00:00:19.320> shrink<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
one and then I'm gonna heat shrink the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.970 
one and then I'm gonna heat shrink the
little<00:00:21.539> pin<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> end<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.380> stop<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
little pin in the end or stop it in the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.540 
little pin in the end or stop it in the
end<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.170> to<00:00:25.170> create<00:00:25.560> three<00:00:25.920> separate

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
end with that to create three separate

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
end with that to create three separate
single<00:00:30.380> signal<00:00:31.380> cables<00:00:32.809> she's<00:00:33.809> actually

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
single signal cables she's actually

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.750 
single signal cables she's actually
quite<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.500> easy<00:00:34.649> thing<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.610> get

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
quite an easy thing to do if you can get

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.600 
quite an easy thing to do if you can get
her<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.930> stand<00:00:37.290> blade<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.460> ease

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
her with a stand blade you just ease

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.790 
her with a stand blade you just ease
that<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:42.270> if<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.320> ease<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that up there and then if that ease that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100 
that up there and then if that ease that
you<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.370> pull<00:00:44.640> those<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:45.059> they're<00:00:45.899> really

there's a favor I'm gonna do is split
these<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:17.880> take<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:18.930> out<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> other<00:01:19.290> end

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
these down take them out the other end

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.870 
these down take them out the other end
too<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.759> three<00:01:24.570> separate

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
too and then we will have three separate

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.359 
too and then we will have three separate
individual<00:01:26.880> cables<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.590> could<00:01:28.799> use<00:01:29.070> as

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
individual cables and we could use as

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.719 
individual cables and we could use as
signal<00:01:29.909> wires<00:01:30.710> we<00:01:31.710> should<00:01:31.890> only<00:01:32.009> need<00:01:32.250> two<00:01:32.700> of

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
signal wires we should only need two of

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
signal wires we should only need two of
them<00:01:33.470> just<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> replace<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:36.530> Mazzilli<00:01:37.530> one

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
them just to replace the Mazzilli one

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.840 
them just to replace the Mazzilli one
channel<00:01:38.850> which<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.310> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> receiver

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
channel which is the on the receiver

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.960 
channel which is the on the receiver
that<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> receiver<00:01:43.970> which

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that is a very one on the receiver which

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330 
that is a very one on the receiver which
is<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> channel<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.899> controls<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.070> flight

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
is the channel that controls the flight

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.420 
is the channel that controls the flight
modes<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.689> that's<00:01:48.899> essential

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
modes on there that's essential

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.770 
modes on there that's essential
just<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.420> being<00:01:52.880> proper<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.090> should<00:01:54.600> also

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
just for being proper I should also

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.100 
just for being proper I should also
replace<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.450> auxilary<00:01:57.450> three<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
replace the auxilary three on the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.310 
replace the auxilary three on the
receiver<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.159> actually<00:01:59.820> links<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
receiver which is actually links to the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.520 
receiver which is actually links to the
auxilary<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.219> dial<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.570> control<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
auxilary to dial on the control and the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.840 
auxilary to dial on the control and the
minute<00:02:04.829> obviously<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.369> does<00:02:05.579> nothing

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
minute obviously that does nothing

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.399 
minute obviously that does nothing
anyway<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.570> gonna<00:02:06.689> put<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.020> back<00:02:07.049> in

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
anyway but I'm gonna put it back in

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.100 
anyway but I'm gonna put it back in
place<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.330> where<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.660> went

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
place and just so we know where it went

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.100 
place and just so we know where it went
for<00:02:10.619> future<00:02:11.009> reference<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.750> never<00:02:12.930> know

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
for future reference you never know

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.080 
for future reference you never know
someone<00:02:13.410> might<00:02:13.680> want<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.920> 3-axis<00:02:14.490> gimbal<00:02:14.700> and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
someone might want a 3-axis gimbal and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.680 
someone might want a 3-axis gimbal and
be<00:02:15.210> able<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.540> control<00:02:16.490> your<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.090> gimbal<00:02:18.510> as

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
be able to control your on the gimbal as

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.210 
be able to control your on the gimbal as
well<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.140> could<00:02:19.320> then<00:02:19.500> make<00:02:19.920> use<00:02:20.190> of

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
well they could then make use of

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.090 
well they could then make use of
auxiliaries<00:02:20.900> knob<00:02:21.900> 2<00:02:22.260> which<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.740> auxilary

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
auxiliaries knob 2 which is auxilary

it<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.780> simply<00:03:40.440> tape<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.190> back<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.700> itself

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
it you can simply tape it back on itself

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.670 
it you can simply tape it back on itself
with<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:43.200> small<00:03:43.620> piece<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:43.950> insulating<00:03:44.760> tape

with a small piece of insulating tape

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.030 
with a small piece of insulating tape
should<00:03:46.680> be<00:03:46.830> fairly<00:03:47.130> simple<00:03:48.380> then<00:03:49.380> taken<00:03:49.830> out

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
should be fairly simple then taken out

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.310 
should be fairly simple then taken out
how<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.310> showed<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.760> before<00:03:53.120> sorry<00:03:54.120> back

that was a little bit low on the camera
but<00:05:10.420> um<00:05:10.780> here<00:05:11.590> we<00:05:11.650> go<00:05:11.920> what<00:05:12.430> I've<00:05:12.550> done<00:05:12.700> is<00:05:12.850> I've

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
but um here we go what I've done is I've

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.840 
but um here we go what I've done is I've
decided<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.930> use<00:05:14.650> both<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.310> pitch<00:05:15.550> and

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
decided to use both of the pitch and

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.650 
decided to use both of the pitch and
roll<00:05:16.500> channels<00:05:17.500> on<00:05:17.830> here<00:05:18.220> so<00:05:18.940> on<00:05:19.120> here

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
roll channels on here so on here

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.700 
roll channels on here so on here
auxilary<00:05:20.760> one<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.090> auxilary<00:05:22.480> two<00:05:22.930> three<00:05:23.440> one

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
auxilary one and auxilary two three one

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.550 
auxilary one and auxilary two three one
controls<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.610> pitch<00:05:24.820> of<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.270> gimbal<00:05:25.600> zero

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
controls the pitch of the gimbal zero

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.980 
controls the pitch of the gimbal zero
two<00:05:26.950> controls<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.700> role<00:05:27.880> that<00:05:28.420> allow<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:28.840> to

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
two controls the role that allow you to

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.360 
two controls the role that allow you to
fine-tune<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:31.350> roll<00:05:32.350> angle<00:05:32.560> of<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:32.980> gimbal

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
fine-tune the roll angle of the gimbal

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.840 
fine-tune the roll angle of the gimbal
if<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.610> need<00:05:33.790> to<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:35.500> also<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.370> Y's<00:05:36.550> are

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
if you need to and also the Y's are

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.800 
if you need to and also the Y's are
there<00:05:37.030> if<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.300> want<00:05:37.450> to<00:05:37.540> use<00:05:37.660> it<00:05:37.780> for

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
there if you want to use it for

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.000 
there if you want to use it for
something<00:05:38.080> else<00:05:38.380> instead

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
something else instead

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.860 
something else instead
so<00:05:39.610> we've<00:05:39.760> got<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:40.030> already<00:05:40.210> hanging<00:05:40.660> out

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
so we've got that already hanging out

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.960 
so we've got that already hanging out
the<00:05:41.020> bottom<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.850> we<00:05:42.850> see<00:05:43.840> X<00:05:44.020> 20<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:45.490> as<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.820> can

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
the bottom of we see X 20 and as you can

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.970 
the bottom of we see X 20 and as you can
see<00:05:46.210> they<00:05:46.390> come<00:05:46.630> out<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.990> nice<00:05:47.200> cool

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
see they come out that nice cool

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.460 
see they come out that nice cool
slop<00:05:48.250> they're<00:05:48.520> above<00:05:48.790> the<00:05:48.970> gimbal<00:05:49.360> go<00:05:50.050> through

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
slop they're above the gimbal go through

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.830 
slop they're above the gimbal go through
the<00:05:50.680> between<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.640> two<00:05:51.820> plates<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.420> gimbal

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
the between the two plates the gimbal

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.220 
the between the two plates the gimbal
and<00:05:53.200> plug<00:05:53.950> in<00:05:54.160> to<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.150> gimbal<00:05:55.360> control<00:05:55.660> board

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
and plug in to the gimbal control board

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.190 
and plug in to the gimbal control board
right<00:05:57.130> there<00:05:57.340> your<00:05:57.730> policy<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.930> will<00:05:59.020> get

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
right there your policy you will get

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.930 
right there your policy you will get
more<00:05:59.410> control<00:05:59.770> board<00:06:00.160> might<00:06:00.640> have<00:06:00.910> a

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
more control board might have a

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.460 
more control board might have a
different<00:06:01.270> place<00:06:01.630> for<00:06:01.900> them

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
different place for them

mine are there what I intend to do to

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.600 
mine are there what I intend to do to
power<00:06:06.160> it

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
power it

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.630 
power it
instead<00:06:07.210> of<00:06:07.330> wiring<00:06:08.140> up<00:06:08.290> power<00:06:09.070> from<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.460> main
