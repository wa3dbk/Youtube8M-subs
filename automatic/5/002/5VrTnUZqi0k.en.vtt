Doctor Who two weeks today I will be
doing<00:00:19.700> a<00:00:20.090> regeneration<00:00:20.960> effect<00:00:21.470> in<00:00:21.650> a<00:00:21.740> program

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
doing a regeneration effect in a program

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.810 
doing a regeneration effect in a program
I<00:00:22.490> have<00:00:22.790> previously<00:00:23.090> used<00:00:23.779> called<00:00:24.880> GIMP<00:00:27.550> okay

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
I have previously used called GIMP okay

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.840 
I have previously used called GIMP okay
so<00:00:29.300> first<00:00:30.199> we're<00:00:30.470> gonna<00:00:30.619> start<00:00:30.710> off<00:00:31.100> by

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
so first we're gonna start off by

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.410 
so first we're gonna start off by
getting<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.599> picture<00:00:33.699> we're<00:00:34.699> then<00:00:34.879> gonna<00:00:35.120> go

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
getting this picture we're then gonna go

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.689 
getting this picture we're then gonna go
to<00:00:35.480> filters<00:00:38.050> light<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:39.530> shadow<00:00:41.170> supernova<00:00:42.699> we

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
to filters light and shadow supernova we

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.360 
to filters light and shadow supernova we
choose<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.149> supernovae<00:00:44.809> color<00:00:45.079> we<00:00:46.070> want<00:00:46.280> it

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
choose the supernovae color we want it

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.709 
choose the supernovae color we want it
to<00:00:46.489> be<00:00:46.610> a<00:00:46.640> sort<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.300> Oh<00:00:48.969> want<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.120> be<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.239> sort<00:00:50.600> of

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
to be a sort of Oh want to be a sort of

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:02.889 
to be a sort of Oh want to be a sort of
orangey<00:00:51.680> yellow<00:00:53.829> almost<00:00:57.430> like<00:00:58.430> that<00:01:01.360> then<00:01:02.360> we

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
orangey yellow almost like that then we

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.150 
orangey yellow almost like that then we
make<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.350> as<00:01:03.770> big<00:01:04.220> as<00:01:04.399> you<00:01:04.550> want<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:05.030> be

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
make it as big as you want it to be

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.670 
make it as big as you want it to be
until<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.190> just<00:01:07.880> about<00:01:08.119> fits<00:01:08.479> place<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.500> over

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
until it just about fits place it over

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.180 
until it just about fits place it over
the<00:01:09.979> head<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.460> your<00:01:10.640> person<00:01:11.210> click<00:01:11.840> OK<00:01:12.320> that

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
the head of your person click OK that

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.900 
the head of your person click OK that
will<00:01:13.340> give<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.670> effect<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.979> didn't<00:01:15.979> quite

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
will give you that effect I didn't quite

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.719 
will give you that effect I didn't quite
get<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.300> right

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.899 

that's<00:01:23.799> then<00:01:24.799> we're<00:01:25.069> also<00:01:25.249> going<00:01:25.579> to<00:01:25.640> need<00:01:25.729> to

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
that's then we're also going to need to

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.300 
that's then we're also going to need to
do<00:01:26.060> them<00:01:26.270> for<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.659> hands<00:01:27.140> now<00:01:27.409> but<00:01:27.619> you've<00:01:28.039> got

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
do them for the hands now but you've got

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.999 
do them for the hands now but you've got
the<00:01:28.429> two<00:01:28.640> options<00:01:29.119> for<00:01:29.359> their<00:01:29.509> hands<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.859> can

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
the two options for their hands you can

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.550 
the two options for their hands you can
either<00:01:31.310> do<00:01:32.859> our<00:01:33.859> filters<00:01:34.490> lighting<00:01:34.850> shadows

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
either do our filters lighting shadows

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.449 
either do our filters lighting shadows
supernova<00:01:37.299> through<00:01:38.299> their<00:01:38.479> hand<00:01:39.189> like<00:01:40.189> that

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:51.190 

and<00:01:43.459> we'll<00:01:43.700> just<00:01:43.880> do<00:01:49.539> another<00:01:50.539> one<00:01:50.810> for<00:01:50.840> that

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
and we'll just do another one for that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.539 
and we'll just do another one for that
hand<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.119> there's<00:01:53.679> technique<00:01:54.679> one<00:01:55.189> done

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
hand but so there's technique one done

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:05.020 
hand but so there's technique one done
and<00:01:56.649> now<00:01:57.649> I'm<00:01:58.039> gonna<00:01:58.159> go<00:01:58.369> file<00:01:58.670> save<00:01:58.810> as<00:02:04.030> one

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
and now I'm gonna go file save as one

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.999 
and now I'm gonna go file save as one
eight<00:02:05.799> just<00:02:06.799> gonna<00:02:06.979> add<00:02:07.129> a<00:02:07.159> one<00:02:07.489> to<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.879> end

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
eight just gonna add a one to the end

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.470 
eight just gonna add a one to the end
save<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.429> my<00:02:10.459> desktop<00:02:12.970> closing<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.180> I'm

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
save it to my desktop closing that I'm

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.440 
save it to my desktop closing that I'm
then<00:02:14.750> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.989> open<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.410> one<00:02:15.650> again<00:02:15.859> and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
then going to open this one again and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.530 
then going to open this one again and
show<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.780> second<00:02:18.170> technique<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:20.390> know

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
show you the second technique you know

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.740 
show you the second technique you know
goes<00:02:23.859> over<00:02:24.859> to<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.099> brushes<00:02:25.549> and<00:02:25.819> choose<00:02:26.450> this

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
goes over to the brushes and choose this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.780 
goes over to the brushes and choose this
brush<00:02:27.970> ain't<00:02:28.970> gonna<00:02:29.150> just<00:02:29.959> sort<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.760> use<00:02:31.760> that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
brush ain't gonna just sort of use that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.379 
brush ain't gonna just sort of use that
to<00:02:32.329> shoot<00:02:32.690> out<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.079> hand<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.790> like

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
to shoot out of the hand like that like

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:51.839 
to shoot out of the hand like that like
the<00:02:38.540> energy<00:02:38.959> shown<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.560> show

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
lightening shadow supernova and place

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:24.319 
lightening shadow supernova and place
your<00:03:13.239> supernova<00:03:16.290> over<00:03:17.290> each<00:03:17.590> please<00:03:22.620> there

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329

your supernova over each please there
their<00:03:32.340> shadow<00:03:33.449> supernova<00:03:35.939> there's<00:03:36.939> wrong<00:03:37.209> for

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
their shadow supernova there's wrong for

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.610

the other hand I mix the effects around

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.379 
the other hand I mix the effects around
of<00:03:41.620> course<00:03:41.889> for<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.609> bit<00:03:42.879> you<00:03:42.909> can<00:03:43.239> do

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
gonna go back to paint brushes and paint

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.280 
gonna go back to paint brushes and paint
a<00:03:50.230> bit<00:03:50.379> more<00:03:51.329> energy<00:03:52.329> coming<00:03:52.540> out<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.049> hand

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
a bit more energy coming out of the hand

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:01.499 
a bit more energy coming out of the hand
you<00:03:58.139> can<00:03:59.139> just<00:03:59.349> use<00:03:59.829> supernovas<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.909> can<00:04:01.090> just

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:01.509 
you can just use supernovas you can just

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.960 
you can just use supernovas you can just
use<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.959> sparkly<00:04:02.680> paintbrush<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.579> kind<00:04:03.849> of

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
use the sparkly paintbrush but I kind of

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.129 
use the sparkly paintbrush but I kind of
like<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:05.009> mixed<00:04:06.629> doesn't<00:04:07.629> look<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:07.930> good<00:04:08.109> on

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
like it mixed doesn't look so good on
