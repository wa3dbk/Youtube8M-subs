00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.439
 very Christmas that everyone loves 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.590
 because everyone gives me chocolate 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.029
 It is also super simple and excellent 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.379
 to give so you will love them 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.379
 let's make chocolate truffles 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.149
 you know that all the ingredients 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.710
 they're down here in the little box 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.629
 description there is everything if they have 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.660
 Can you ask me questions on facebook? 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.250
 and you can also follow me on twitter 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.199
 they always ask me what chocolate I use 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.120
 this is the chocolate pastry that I use 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.579
 either on the tablet complete water to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.989
 Bulk is very good chocolate and always 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.500
 it's like the semi bitter although there's 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.010
 bitter milk and white but the semi 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.670
 bitter is ideal for this 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.150
 and we are also going to use milk cream 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 sweet cream whipping cream are 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.259
 all the names by which they are 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 know this is a very good brand and of 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.610
 fact is the best known does not have 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.110
 sugar and this time is perfect 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.250
 Sometimes you have to add sugar to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.799
 some recipes 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.799
 we are going to use amaretto which is liqueur 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.530
 almonds smell delicious but can 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.310
 use any other kalu adecco liquor 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.289
 with rum even kitsch that is a liquor 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.289
 traditional German that is made to 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.899
 cherry base that is also ideal for 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.020
 Toppings can use almonds with using 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.909
 cocom can use nuts can use 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.330
 anything you want 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.520
 granillo pellets with paint what 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.380
 you want to decorate it and good 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.140
 let's start this recipe is super 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.049
 very good I'll show you how 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.810
 is done let's start I have a 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.810
 another cream 30 seconds to the micro 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.250
 let's undo our late 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.709
 chocolate we can even grate it with 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.290
 a grater for cheese but also the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.209
 they can make small pieces with their hands and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.730
 when our chocolate is chopped 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.100
 let's add the little cream 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.450
 shake 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.550
 that is already hot 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.800
 and with this we are going to start to melt 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.739
 our chocolate to finish it off 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.000
 melt we're going to put it 15 seconds in 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.610
 the microwave 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.190
 when they have the vacuum we are going to add 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.190
 a little bit of liquor 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.630
 and they already did half the work now 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.080
 we're just going to leave this in the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.360
 freezer all night here is this 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.620
 after having rested in the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.209
 freezer and they have to scrape a little 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.370
 apparently it's a pretty mix 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.380
 hard but as soon as they start 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.780
 handle is going to put like a paste 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.630
 soft so they have to have cold water 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.610
 to be cooling your hands 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.320
 because as soon as his hands start to 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.750
 heat this is going to start melting 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.420
 very fast and it will not work out so well 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.310
 so 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.990
 they have to have enough hands 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.430
 cold 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:28.820
 let's take a little bit of the dough as 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.520
 come it's pretty soft even though it looks 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.160
 it lasts in the middle we are going to put a hazelnut 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.830
 they can put 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.900
 a cherry 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.450
 You can put some nougat inside 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.880
 what you want any kind of 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.830
 seed that you like will be fine 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.830
 and we're going to start making little ball 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.800
 when we have a little ball more or less 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.849
 uniform then we went through some of 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.840
 our toppings the typical the typical 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.840
 truffle with the cocoa 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.820
 It is ideal for chocolate lovers 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.820
 and we put her in disability like this 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.060
 apart they look divine this we are going to 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.830
 roll in toasted almonds for this 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.289
 what if we put a little bit of 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.490
 white chocolate on the top 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.490
 to hit him 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.930
 the constituted 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.490

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.950

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.170
