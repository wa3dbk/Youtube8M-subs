puzzles if you get them wrong they
randomized<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.590> puzzle<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.609> even<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> had

a<00:01:03.480> chance<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.989> figuring<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> were

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
a chance of figuring it out if you were

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
a chance of figuring it out if you were
like<00:01:05.100> off<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.030> can't<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.420> slowly

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
like off by one you can't like slowly

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
like off by one you can't like slowly
guess<00:01:07.200> check<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.340> goes<00:01:08.549> oh<00:01:08.700> no<00:01:08.729> you're

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
guess check it it just goes oh no you're

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
guess check it it just goes oh no you're
wrong<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.900> gives<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> another<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.619> it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
wrong and gives you another one it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.920 
wrong and gives you another one it's
kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.000> did<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> pseudo<00:01:12.720> cou

number on the pseudo cool puzzle it

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
number on the pseudo cool puzzle it
immediately<00:01:17.729> reset<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> pseudo<00:01:18.630> kupaza

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
immediately reset the pseudo kupaza
