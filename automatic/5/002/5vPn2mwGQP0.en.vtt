00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.830
 the whole little man we are going to move 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 to take all our things to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.240
 barquisimeto so you do not have to 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.519
 move from your city without you remember the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.509
 31 but this Thursday the 18th with all of you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.509
 with everything 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.300
 Molina and she is teaching us to put together 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.329
 they are many thousands of miles I insist 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 in which the way to arm in the fletero 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.239
 what I want to tell you friends is that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.100
 they will work the same and when they make a 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.899
 emphasis now where big and if the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 rejected show in squares 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.089
 we must respect the margins we must 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.089
 respect 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.730
 the size of the euro piece this 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.040
 macro you are going you want it if you are 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.340
 life-size do not have to put 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.900
 clinical line and the part of the sun for 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.820
 all of you who is arrested and without 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.119
 But here such that the fletero 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.640
 I must have after design 6 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.480
 centimeters and 6 centimeters so that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.390
 you can work ok 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 I wanted to bring this checkered fabric 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.630
 because it's very easy to work with her if 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.060
 the pattern I will guide you through the pattern 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.030
 of course to respect the margin and 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.520
 well I really wanted to make it strong 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.220
 about I do not know if you can see the life of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.590
 you are I also tell the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.050
 friends who get used to it and if I could 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.660
 do we use this fabric 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.600
 pictures because simply taking in 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.090
 count those measurements and in each box 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.400
 of whites we have white squares and 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.220
 pink a little stronger in each 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.100
 when and white tone I marked in all 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.040
 the machines one indicated why not 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.010
 we need to mark the x that what I 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.400
 indicates how to carry the thread in 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.920
 cross way this what does it mean 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.660
 analysis in england then they are not going to 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.060
 get used because many times we have 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.910
 very beautiful fabrics very transparent and if 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.970
 we handle with the pencil 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.130
 the color is passed with these gentlemen 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.070
 they had to from friends who get used to 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.710
 and I know that if they manage to do it to mark 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.220
 just the points so they can elaborate 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.010
 the project then all the projects 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.510
 of the steak to the friends do not spend more 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:42.810
 60 centimeters of fabric per 25 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.810
 centimeters that is a reality 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.330
 of course then as your think 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.670
 very tiny say here if we have to 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.470
 use fabrics very soft to me really me 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.680
 like to always use the heart because they are 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.450
 very bright very nice but if you 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.700
 bring the edges of the lack you 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.260
 see that if you can work , you already have 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.390
 thicker they are already is how it is very 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.550
 small the design is not the same when 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.710
 working with larger pieces and it's 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.400
 that already of the fabric can be values or in 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.900
 this case because the fabric is very light and 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.560
 greater in its headquarters 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:23.010
 when the 0 was to make a subway 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.010
 The bosses 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:49.240
 well alright be well in the photo 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:52.480
 referential obviously to fill the 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.540
 brand fabric of the marked feeling 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.190
 all designs this is useful to say 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.900
 to the friends that give me those of the brand 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.700
 only the shipper will say because really 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.920
 They are looking at the photo and as you know 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.260
 these pieces are also great only 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.530
 the pincushion miranda which the patron 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.530
 as is 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:22.660
 all this is here 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:24.490
 here with us right now it's coming for 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.220
 here and we will be with you until the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.980
 midday accompanied by days problems no 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.870
 this point there are many points that you 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.360
 can go to fly I'm convinced 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.970
 that you are very creative and in the 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.680
 as one goes fattening or thinking 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.080
 that's really why they're called 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.600
 draped and you can elaborate 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.240
 anything me here in this case 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.130
 I wanted to bring a black thread and I want 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.470
 tell you that yarn is not used 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.120
 courses in thread the color of the fabric that 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.920
 we have and this stretch of this color 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.870
 because I want you to see what it is 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.000
 the step that I will do then if I 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.860
 for example I have this white fabric with 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.770
 Pink can naturally use the yarn 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.300
 white a very pale pink then 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.780
 notice, I have only two 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.889
 lines 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.729
 Here indicate the reasons 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.319
 if I wanted to and in fact the pattern that 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.840
 comes with the marked fabric I put the 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:20.800
 easy for the friends that 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.420
 they have never done this you grab the 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.550
 points are already crossed 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.550
 I look for the other little dot down here 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.750
 the back of my kitchen is because it 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.870
 I want to say something when you want 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.570
 make the little flower point think this is 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.450
 this would be the front because already very good 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:48.350
 meeting of doubles ok or any point 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:51.410
 so here I am grabbing the other 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.500
 with what I did was cross they are already 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.170
 the only ones to me I want to tell you the 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.890
 goal of the night they gave there is formed the 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:03.140
 outgoing little flower then 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.450
 unquestionably here I do have to 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.430
 cut the thread the point we make that 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.700
 we do not bring drunk here yes you have to 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.650
 cut the hates I repeat I did and 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.710
 black so that you can achieve 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.080
 see it here yes you have to cut every time 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.139
 that I make a reason 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.849
 I must cut friends when you go 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:27.650
 to do this is going to be very easy 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:32.090
 draw the whole project know if 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:34.569
 they want to understand once for 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.569
 save them
