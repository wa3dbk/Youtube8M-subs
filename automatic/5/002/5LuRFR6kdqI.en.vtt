market round about three days ago and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.849 
market round about three days ago and
since<00:00:15.780> then<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.109> lot<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.410> people<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.830> been

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
yeah it's not easy to get merely because

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.179

market you see that is worth well over 1
million<00:00:26.010> coins<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.420> expensive

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
million coins so it's really expensive

teachers<00:01:26.159> got<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> 78<00:01:26.850> piece<00:01:27.180> Suarez<00:01:28.110> 83<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
teachers got a 78 piece Suarez 83 the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.690 
teachers got a 78 piece Suarez 83 the
only<00:01:29.759> difference<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.659> 5<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:32.250> really

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
only difference here is 5 so it's really

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
only difference here is 5 so it's really
close<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> being<00:01:33.390> similar<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
close to being similar with the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.069 
close to being similar with the
dribbling<00:01:34.860> once<00:01:35.130> again<00:01:35.490> five<00:01:36.000> different<00:01:36.540> 83

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
dribbling once again five different 83

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
288 shooting 82 to 87 and they're the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
288 shooting 82 to 87 and they're the
ones<00:01:41.850> you're<00:01:42.180> probably<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> want<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
ones you're probably going to want to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440 
ones you're probably going to want to
worry<00:01:43.020> about<00:01:43.140> most<00:01:43.820> Suarez<00:01:44.820> has<00:01:45.119> more

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
worry about most Suarez has more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170 
worry about most Suarez has more
physical<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.770> game<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.280> Jovetic<00:01:47.850> he

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
physical but in game with Jovetic he

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
physical but in game with Jovetic he
actually<00:01:48.360> tends<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.049> push<00:01:49.290> past<00:01:49.590> players<00:01:49.860> more

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
actually tends to push past players more

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160 
actually tends to push past players more
than<00:01:50.490> you'd<00:01:50.640> expect<00:01:51.210> we're<00:01:51.720> told<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
than you'd expect we're told here that

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
than you'd expect we're told here that
you<00:01:52.409> only<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.770> 70<00:01:53.100> physical<00:01:53.520> /<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.880> game<00:01:54.210> from

the higher than that their passing is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.289 
the higher than that their passing is
pretty<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.710> similar<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.490> their<00:02:02.700> strikers

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
pretty much similar but their strikers

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.730 
pretty much similar but their strikers
they<00:02:03.570> don't<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.990> worry<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.619> as

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
they don't have to worry about that as

they don't have to worry about that as
much<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.189> yet<00:02:05.610> they're<00:02:06.030> great<00:02:06.329> players<00:02:06.539> to

these<00:02:20.280> guys<00:02:20.670> are<00:02:21.030> similar<00:02:22.019> in<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.709> many<00:02:22.970> ways

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
these guys are similar in so many ways

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.720 
these guys are similar in so many ways
which<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.480> why<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.690> think<00:02:25.410> Jovetic<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.430> this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
which is why I think Jovetic is this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.059 
which is why I think Jovetic is this
cheap<00:02:27.330> Suarez<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.349> if<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.500> haven't<00:02:28.769> used<00:02:28.950> them

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
cheap Suarez so if you haven't used them

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.280 
cheap Suarez so if you haven't used them
already<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:30.030> try<00:02:30.390> them<00:02:30.540> out<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.900> you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
already go try them out and you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.229 
already go try them out and you
definitely<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:32.130> one<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.430> me<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.580> moving<00:02:33.120> like

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
definitely see one of me and moving like

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.390 
definitely see one of me and moving like
that<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.660> game<00:02:33.989> stats<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.590> put<00:02:35.069> them<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
that in game stats I put them on the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400 
that in game stats I put them on the
screen<00:02:35.640> there<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.630> take<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> closer<00:02:37.230> look

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
screen there you can take a closer look

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.740 
screen there you can take a closer look
if<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:38.069> want<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.209> some<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.569> them

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
if you want but you can see some of them

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.710 
if you want but you can see some of them
are<00:02:39.840> fairly<00:02:40.260> similar<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:41.310> Suarez<00:02:41.700> has<00:02:42.000> 84

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
are fairly similar like Suarez has 84

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.509 
are fairly similar like Suarez has 84
shooting<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.530> bet<00:02:43.769> as<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.190> can<00:02:44.310> see

shooting as you can bet as you can see

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.690 
shooting as you can bet as you can see

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
their job petition 8 to be shooting so

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.289 
their job petition 8 to be shooting so
shooting<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.720> fairly<00:02:49.200> similar<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.299> overall

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
shooting is fairly similar and overall

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.140 
shooting is fairly similar and overall
Suarez's<00:02:51.959> that's<00:02:52.260> go<00:02:52.500> up<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.739> 4<00:02:53.040> 58<00:02:53.430> with<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
Suarez's that's go up to 4 58 with the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.319 
Suarez's that's go up to 4 58 with the
Java<00:02:54.660> teaches<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.380> at<00:02:55.650> 420<00:02:56.640> now<00:02:56.849> which<00:02:57.150> is

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
Java teaches that at 420 now which is

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.229 
Java teaches that at 420 now which is
not<00:02:57.660> far<00:02:58.019> off<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:59.010> these<00:02:59.250> are<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.970> similar

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
not far off so these are really similar

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.780 
not far off so these are really similar

there<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.389> scoring<00:03:43.350> job<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
there and scoring job at it is a

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.910 
there and scoring job at it is a
complete<00:03:45.000> striker<00:03:45.420> very<00:03:46.200> very<00:03:46.470> similar<00:03:46.889> to

Suarez so if you ever used them already
