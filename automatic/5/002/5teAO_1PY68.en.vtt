00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
because I'm always intimidated by

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.770 
because I'm always intimidated by
actually<00:01:10.979> making<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.490> real<00:01:11.760> cheat<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
actually making a real cheat like a you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
actually making a real cheat like a you
know<00:01:12.810> full-fledged<00:01:13.619> cheese<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.460> plus

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
know full-fledged cheese can and plus

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
know full-fledged cheese can and plus
it's<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.299> got<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.049> tons<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.439> calories

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's also got you know tons of calories

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.109 
it's also got you know tons of calories
so<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> probably<00:01:17.460> well<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.030> make

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so this is probably well you can make

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.359 
so this is probably well you can make
this<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.509> skim<00:01:18.810> milk<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.189> if
