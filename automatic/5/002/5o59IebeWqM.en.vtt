 the creation of free range chickens is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.830
 practiced with an activity of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.990
 subsistence and provides sources 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.289
 protein alternatives in food 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 income and family income 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.390
 is a very good income option 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.430
 but if you do not have some basic care 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 it becomes injury 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 the hick- 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.809
 advantages as higher osh resistance 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.980
 city ​​low cost easy adaptation 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.460
 providing a return in a period 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 relatively short because of the low 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.059
 cost of production, the raising of chickens 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.890
 in the hickory system is mostly 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.080
 by family farmers 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.990
 in this property the delight martins 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.560
 started raising henbane 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 after many attempts and between 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
 errors and hits 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 the family farmer decided to seek the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.860
 emater as she had income from 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 nothing started to create the country chicken pa 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.479
 if it is the penitentiary it is until today 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.509
 I still do chicken for girl in the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.810
 penitentiary and went to buy a chair 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.670
 and invest Prohibition liking and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.960
 very badly leaving now with the help of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.060
 matter I think now I will 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.579
 to be able to fight the plague 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.409
 and I'm going to go to the fair and hunt and 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 Fun give me just to invest. 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.680
 a little more this think there is a 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.090
 good help a good choice for those who are 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.979
 living here right? 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.280
 without income from other income 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.770
 while following the guidelines of the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.810
 the results in the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.960
 property are other 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.229
 the number of deaths decreased 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.360
 today understands that the management with the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.149
 chicks is primordial 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.810
 everything here is simple it does not have 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.300
 expensive infrastructure but the recommendations 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.390
 are strictly followed 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.330
 be born from the mother 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.480
 place where it will remain 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.120
 the 30 days during the 30 days it goes 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.790
 receiving the initial feed will receive water and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.730
 should also be heated both can be 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.070
 with cardboard as can be with the lamp 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.190
 and he will also receive the first 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.710
 doses of vaccine that is amilca if the disease 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.570
 very common in chickens and chickens 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.020
 then he receives the first dose of 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.930
 vaccine that is full - time newcastle 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.700
 a disease of high mortality there is no 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.330
 remedy for healing 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.510
 the ideal is prevention although the vaccine 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.120
 water can be used to better 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.180
 exploitation is indicated by the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.690
 nostril or in the eyes respecting the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.500
 indicated the first dose of 8 to 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.150
 12 days of life being a drop in the eyes 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.230
 the second dose from 30 to 35 days 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.739
 dose of 80 to 90 days in hens and chickens 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.459
 laying administer the vaccine is given 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.360
 every four months thanks to the work 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.610
 team and the results achieved 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.250
 today the property receives other 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.430
 producers who want to start 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.430
 activity in emater's theoretical class 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.959
 the focus was on sanitation and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.780
 prophylaxis 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.989
 The first lesson of the day was about the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.840
 worm control in birds 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.890
 well the one that is a red in the deal 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.010
 of the proverb he is recommended to see me 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.140
 nor verminose in birds in general. 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.770
 It is important that this control be 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.920
 Zetas input because the old guys 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.720
 cause so much trouble in birds. 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.090
 other diseases 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.610
 I should be diluted in the base water of a 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.750
 envelope for 12 liters of water and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.720
 provided to one hundred chickens or 200 years 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.270
 the twenties should not receive this red 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.470
 another vaccine applied during class 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.530
 practice went against the bomb 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.710
 the area is also known as popcorn 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.900
 for application it can perforate the skin 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.760
 with a brush or even a needle 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.400
 this is a vaccine against the disease 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.620
 that calls silly it is characteristic of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.470
 lump c 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.880
 some call smallpox around the beak 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.620
 of birds is a disease that causes 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.620
 mortality in chicks 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.680
 and the application must be 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.680
 subcutaneous way so that you do more 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.410
 qualification on skin drips without a drop 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.320
 of the vaccine and gives a 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.260
 make sure the vaccine was effective 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.080
 the last activity of the day was to minister 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.990
 also the cholera vaccine or the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.380
 typhus which may be responsible for 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.510
 by a high mortality rate in 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.940
 birds 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.240
 This is one of the scenes that we're going to see. 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.730
 here today in practice it is suitable for 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.090
 copper and had a very common disease fan 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.480
 in poultry and it should be applied 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:38.020
 dosage of 6 ml for chickens and 1 ml 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.710
 for chickens and 1 ml and a half for 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.640
 cocks 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.040
 she is injected into the thigh and also has a 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.520
 grace period of five days 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.990
 the day was very productive to prepare 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.930
 the new creators 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.530
 the hen breeding is a 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.320
 activity whose market is very promising 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.169
 since the supply of this 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.010
 product is lower than demand 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:09.419
 in addition that its marketing can 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.419
 be carried out directly from the producer 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.419
 consumer
