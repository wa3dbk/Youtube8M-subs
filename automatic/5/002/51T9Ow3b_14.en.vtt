 We put the dough in a dessert bag and in two plates we draw a 20 cm diameter biscuit and another 18 cm 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.480
 Spread the biscuits with fine sugar and place in a preheated oven with 180 degrees of 12 minutes

 We take a little of this mixture and add melted gelatin in the microwave 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.460
 Let's put it back on the first mixture 

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:47.225
 And we mix again 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.920

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.700

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.460

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.940
 In a round mold with a diameter of 20 centimeters 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.120

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:21.260
 Coordinate biscuits with coffee 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.900
 We put the mascarpone mousse 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.220
 Place the biscuits and tie the coffee 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:58.100
 Cover it with Muscarbon 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.700
 Finally, we cherish the rest of the holy 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.580
 And put it in the freezer for an hour or a few sajt in the refrigerator 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.900
 After the tiramitsu relaxes, we take it out and sprinkle it with cocoa 

00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:41.403
