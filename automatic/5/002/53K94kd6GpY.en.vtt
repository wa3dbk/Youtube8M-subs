00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.699
 can discover in world exclusive 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 downright the samsung galaxy note 10 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.060
 samsung on september the 25th 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.550
 then in terms of characteristics 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.830
 techniques submitted themselves a little bit 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.230
 his copy concerning this tablet on 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 is still on a screen that is 10.1 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 inches a screen always with a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.910
 superb quality r I show you the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.610
 bike 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.840
 so 10.1 inch screen 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 we also had 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.760
 1 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.370
 quad core processor at 2.3 gigahertz 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 and 3 gig of ram so that's 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.660
 the big novelty you can see it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.390
 it is archi fluid well no lag 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.830
 it's super fast, it reacts very well 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.300
 and that's really the 3 giga ram 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.630
 which helps enormously 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.150
 we are under android 4.3 jelly bean so 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 the latest version of android 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.660
 always we have the spn with almost 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.330
 all the same features as 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.860
 for the galaxy note 3 then to find out if 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.870
 you tap like this you 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 point and you're doing there wait 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.840
 it's something to take but you do 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840
 like this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710
 music 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.880
 I fucked my neck it's a trick to caen 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.590
 he maintains 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.719
 when you take 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.340
 I still can not do it I'm not coming 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.380
 still to take the hit this thing there 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.560
 in any case the pen allows you to 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 to do a lot of 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.640
 small hacks presented you 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.520
 on the galaxy note 3 the new version 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.990
 then we have a battery of 8,220 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 million towards which is pretty range 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.619
 therefore we have connectivity or wifi 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.729
 bluetooth is also 4g on this model 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.619
 there for other to false regarding the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.049
 cameras so I'm going to make you fast 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.259
 the storer does not have a camera in front of 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.259
 2 megapixels 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.689
 and especially Bordeaux is so that's 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.579
 something we really want to emphasize 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.579
 this part there we have a camera of 8 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.620
 megapixels with autofocus 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.349
 it was really good and then on everything 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.749
 which is super awesome is that 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.760
 you just have here we pick up 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.459
 exactly the same idea as samsung 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.230
 galaxy note 3 just see it's a 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.719
 kind of leather stitching is there that is 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.030
 really hyper joly is hyper respect one 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.230
 can say that samsung is really in 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.599
 train 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.760
 in front of it's really his main 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.530
 competitor that is apple with his ipad 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.659
 there really we have a noble father product 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.940
 and hyper breaks it's really pretty 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.700
 very nice to touch otherwise in 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.980
 terms of knee class dimensions 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.630
 will also make the price the jack here 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.140
 for 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.260
 the first jack or 5 then small flax 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.230
 note the oakland issued here also 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.700
 until that was good enough because 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.470
 that when you give the tablet you 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.680
 do not hide 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.880
 the speakers here always the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.940
 traditional taking good there go 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.750
 hide but it's a micro usb socket 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.700
 and we will continue right here with here the 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.190
 sim card right there that can be put 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.370
 for 4g connectivity that's right there 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.560
 and here the micro SD card that we can 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.330
 put it right there so it's still 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.760
 super convenient is a tablet hyper 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.310
 complete in terms of 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.909
 micro sd we can go up to 64 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.480
 GB 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.579
 and finally we have the wifi version 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.150
 only that will make 5 135 grams and the 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.379
 version 4g that will make 5 145 g so it's 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.840
 a very very beautiful tablet I you 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.530
 not just find the camera 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.530

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.830
 beautiful resolution 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.990
 so here really is a great tablet 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.370
 of from its extent 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.730
