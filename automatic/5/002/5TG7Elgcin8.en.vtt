00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.750
 and well everyone hears there we are in the 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.990
 bancada and good in today's chapter 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.600
 we are going to finish the broadcast of the saga 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.550
 penguin on the part of the good ones since 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.810
 well after passing me I've 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.770
 discovered that he is also by 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.580
 part of the bad 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.000
 so 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.130
 in short if you were listening to this is 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.210
 because I already recorded a few days ago 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 it's just because I do not have a line in 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.099
 my house I do not know what has happened 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.320
 reuters broke and protect others and not 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.990
 connect and blah blah blah blah blah 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.210
 but good 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.400
 let's go to the heart this is going to be a 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.690
 relatively short chapter I say is 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.740
 relative because to get to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.830
 penguins in a short time 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.870
 the only thing that will defeat good penguin is 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.500
 more than anything, think a little bit because 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.300
 you have to play with some things 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.940
 so let's go let's go let's go 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.670
 got what is the real euro and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.330
 all that stuff so I'll be at least 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 possible in this area 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.760
 again it is achieved now recording 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.760
 bars playing with my brother 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.369
 since finally because for something that 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.369
 I would like you to do with me power 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.369
 take it 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.240
 out those cables 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.530
 good thing the positive now I do not have almost 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.320
 nobody here 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.330
 fuck is that written lavaste or 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.890
 recording 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.500
 nothing happens 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.320
 that is me in my quiet house does not pass 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.810
 nothing to record and all this happens to me 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.810
 Logic does not but good 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.450
 let's go here here the last one is worth now 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.270
 buy a very life-saving spice 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.310
 I miss that this half rancid 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.180
 but then van suit where google 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.049
 I was costing them a little 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.049
 spaces 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.000
 fuck and so much patience 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.010
 Well, this one has to be given 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.660
 and in a kind of thermostat 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.349
 they have rescued yours 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.920
 santa 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.220
 why 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.130
 where was he 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.130
 there 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.190
 here there are also bad pagan wicked 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.190
 for the bad guys 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.519
 and if we are already with the bad but good 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.010
 this the two times I've done it 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.260
 time that almost ten minutes here for the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.670
 type back 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.200
 the other one was only 4 449 so good 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.959
 I hope that you are very long and 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.390
 based on that no other is the kitten the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.420
 kitten 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.810
 free spider spider that fast 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.630
 low ascarica 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.840
 it cracked it cracked the kitten cracked and it 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.849
 has suffered if we look pointed 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.130
 science where point they are species are 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.050
 generators that turn it purple 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.340
 but not everything gone crazy paper a 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.340
 heart then still with plaster 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.450
 how weird here only because we have 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.700
 that move this green so that 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:06.660
 penguins enjoy the other side 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.700
 as you see here it is a good shot one 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.440
 little more but that's worth everyone put on 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.440
 in half intelligence not found 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.210
 but good 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.620
 I am here is worth this here each one 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.620
 It is up there is rubber outside 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.140
 ok grandfather throw penguin the room blah 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.140
 blah blah another heart that loses 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.440
 nothing 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.230
 - go beyond the fleet that I 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.230
 exploits that does not exploit that less costs 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.230
 almost 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.430
 that's how it ended but in 2002 for nothing 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.360
 fuck is not that I am, this is going to be 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.060
 more than anything concentration 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.580
 and luck we go this placed already pays 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.780
 right here 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.780
 not the other way around, maybe not 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.660
 not quite the least of the woman's wait 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.559
 worth one less 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.500
 where is he dear 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.990
 OK 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.260
 if you see the way tip 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.070
 if robinson other accounts where to 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.070
 surround and that occupies 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.139
 calculating the effect now you are in 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.830
 the pain 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.830
 cool 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.470
 back I have to do not know where it's going to go 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.470
 it's going to be like that 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.300
 but with the latter I can do it 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.300
 because if it's not worth it 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.820
 yes sir the world saw that that was 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.820
 Completely adrede 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.300
 for that fails blah blah blah blah blah 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.300
 blah 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.800
 and now kobler penguin roberto baja there 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.289
 that make him yours is to fly 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:10.119
 simple will kill where you think 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.119
 I 'm just going to put the drugs 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.390
 you have me going so fast 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.390
 and this one 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.590
 yes yes farruco gets 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:32.350
 and this one 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.350
 I'm sorry I'm just this is typical 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.729
 I accept coal starts to cry we are going to 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.050
 I forget 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:40.420
 well it's not like a movie 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.190
 exactly but good 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.010
 I think they did not have too many penguins 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:50.620
 of masses guns pistols but more than 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:53.449
 nothing like everyone went to the square and 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:56.569
 while waking up but hey 

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:58.189
 it has been erased such that the kitten that 

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:01.190
 so much we had to die in the first 

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:03.170
 chapter of this saga can destroy 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.780
 and colorÃ­n colorado the kitten pulled out what 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:09.730
 I put aside what I liked live 

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.730
 favorites and more the other
