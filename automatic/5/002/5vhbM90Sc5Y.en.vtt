but<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.930> haven't<00:01:46.110> gotten<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> chance<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.860> try<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
but I haven't gotten a chance to try the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.530 
but I haven't gotten a chance to try the
version<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> 4<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.409> we'll<00:01:50.310> check<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:53.509> ok

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
version of 4 so we'll check this out ok

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.950 
version of 4 so we'll check this out ok
that<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.630> best<00:01:57.810> 4x4<00:01:59.360> I've<00:02:00.360> ever<00:02:00.600> used

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
that is the best 4x4 I've ever used

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.860 
that is the best 4x4 I've ever used
that<00:02:02.620> is<00:02:02.740> extremely<00:02:03.460> good<00:02:03.820> my<00:02:04.600> first

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
that is extremely good my first

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.290 
that is extremely good my first
impressions<00:02:05.440> is<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.890> feels<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.250> bit<00:02:06.280> loose

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
impressions is that it feels a bit loose

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
impressions is that it feels a bit loose
I<00:02:07.360> might<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.500> tighten<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.490> little<00:02:09.910> bit

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
I might have to tighten it a little bit

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.470 
I might have to tighten it a little bit
but<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.420> extremely<00:02:13.420> extremely<00:02:13.840> good

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
but that is extremely extremely good

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.270 
but that is extremely extremely good
that<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.780> way<00:02:17.350> better<00:02:17.740> than<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.130> version<00:02:18.340> two

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
that was way better than the version two

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.790 
that was way better than the version two
corner<00:02:21.280> cutting<00:02:22.230> corner<00:02:23.230> cuts<00:02:23.410> pretty<00:02:23.560> good

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
corner cutting corner cuts pretty good

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.240 
corner cutting corner cuts pretty good
so<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.820> be<00:02:24.970> adjusted<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.990> we'll<00:02:26.860> see<00:02:27.070> how

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
so it can be adjusted so we'll see how

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.130 
so it can be adjusted so we'll see how
this<00:02:27.430> woman<00:02:27.790> comes<00:02:28.090> apart<00:02:28.510> oh<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.050> actually

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
this woman comes apart oh that actually

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.490 
this woman comes apart oh that actually
comes<00:02:29.530> out<00:02:29.709> really<00:02:30.640> easily

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
comes out really easily

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.430 
comes out really easily
