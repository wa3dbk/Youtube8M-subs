rehabilitation<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.089> course<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.509> huge<00:00:07.200> topic

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
rehabilitation is of course a huge topic

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
rehabilitation is of course a huge topic
which<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.429> pure<00:00:08.730> approached<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.599> many<00:00:09.870> ways

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
which is a pure approached in many ways

which is a pure approached in many ways
eventually<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.790> most<00:00:12.540> important<00:00:13.110> part

eventually the most important part
whatever<00:00:13.590> way<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.309> find<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:15.139> supporting

whatever way we find of supporting
rehabilitation<00:00:17.190> obviously<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:19.050> actual

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
rehabilitation obviously is the actual

rehabilitation obviously is the actual

all<00:00:37.500> actually<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.579> cognitive<00:00:39.270> training<00:00:39.809> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
all actually the cognitive training is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.950 
all actually the cognitive training is
something<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.309> only<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.329> use<00:00:42.570> pretty

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
something I'm only going to use pretty

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.500 
something I'm only going to use pretty
much<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> parameter<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.280> which<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.420> evaluate

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
much as a parameter on which to evaluate

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.900 
much as a parameter on which to evaluate
whether<00:00:46.440> exercise<00:00:47.039> whether<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> fiscal

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
whether exercise whether the fiscal

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.779 
whether exercise whether the fiscal
activation<00:00:48.450> stimulation<00:00:49.289> actually<00:00:50.160> works<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
activation stimulation actually works so

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.389 
activation stimulation actually works so
what<00:00:51.270> we're<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.840> talk<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
what we're going to talk about now is a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.970 
what we're going to talk about now is a
supportive<00:00:54.090> role<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.960> physical<00:00:55.350> training

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
supportive role of the physical training

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.760 
supportive role of the physical training
relative<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.629> rehabilitative<00:00:58.379> training

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
relative to the rehabilitative training

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.130 
relative to the rehabilitative training
of<00:00:58.859> course<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.730> replacing<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
of course it's not replacing it I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
of course it's not replacing it I
usually<00:01:01.890> make<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.340> same<00:01:02.520> remarks<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
usually make the same remarks when I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.789 
usually make the same remarks when I
talk<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.629> our<00:01:03.870> pharmacological<00:01:04.769> research

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
talk about our pharmacological research

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.030 
talk about our pharmacological research
when<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.970> try<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> develop<00:01:06.689> drugs<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.619> support

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
when we try to develop drugs to support

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.679 
when we try to develop drugs to support
the<00:01:08.340> rehabilitative<00:01:09.180> training<00:01:09.540> obviously

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the rehabilitative training obviously

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.170 
the rehabilitative training obviously
it's<00:01:10.350> again<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> idea<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.939> give

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it's again not the idea that you give

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.750 
it's again not the idea that you give
the<00:01:12.420> patient<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> shot<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.500> appeal<00:01:14.490> or

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the patient a shot or appeal or

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.020 
the patient a shot or appeal or
something<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.310> believe<00:01:17.310> magically

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
something and then we believe magically

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
something and then we believe magically
language<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.900> attention<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:19.979> whatever<00:01:20.369> will

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
language or attention or whatever will

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390 
language or attention or whatever will
return<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> patient<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.979> might<00:01:23.189> be

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
return to the patient but we might be

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.240 
return to the patient but we might be
able<00:01:23.520> able<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> briefly<00:01:25.830> show

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
able able and I'm going to briefly show

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.399 
able able and I'm going to briefly show
you<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.030> data

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
you a little bit of data

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.649 
you a little bit of data
pharmacologically<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> support<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
pharmacologically to support that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.940 
pharmacologically to support that
rehabilitation<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.470> completely

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
rehabilitation and that's a completely

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.130 
rehabilitation and that's a completely
different<00:01:32.400> issue<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.850> course<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> side

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
different issue of course the side

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
different issue of course the side
effects<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> physical<00:01:35.130> activation<00:01:35.700> are

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
effects of physical activation are

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.179 
effects of physical activation are
likely<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.659> far<00:01:37.200> less<00:01:37.530> than<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
likely to be far less than the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789 
likely to be far less than the
pharmacological<00:01:39.030> side<00:01:39.509> effects<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.229> what

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
pharmacological side effects so what

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.620 
pharmacological side effects so what
we're<00:01:40.979> talking<00:01:41.520> about<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.420> work

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
we're talking about now if it can work

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
we're talking about now if it can work
is<00:01:42.899> something<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.950> probably<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> lot

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
is something that probably is a lot

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.929 
is something that probably is a lot
safer<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.990> cleaner<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:47.280> its<00:01:47.909> use<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.790> first<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
safer and cleaner in its use so first of

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.929 
safer and cleaner in its use so first of
all<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:51.960> reason<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.189> approach

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
all is there reason at all to approach

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.800 
all is there reason at all to approach
this<00:01:54.210> well<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.460> set<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.850> data<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.479> I'm

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
this well here is a set of data that I'm

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.740 
this well here is a set of data that I'm
going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> present<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.009> couple<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> times

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
going to present a couple of times

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
going to present a couple of times
partly<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.350> presents<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
partly because it presents I think a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.520 
partly because it presents I think a
challenge<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.880> partly<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.570> these<00:02:04.200> are

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
challenge and partly because these are

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
challenge and partly because these are
some<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> our<00:02:05.250> data<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.240> quite<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> bit

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
some of our data that I like quite a bit

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.520 
some of our data that I like quite a bit
so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.889 
so
well<00:02:07.979> any<00:02:08.250> scientist<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.179> encounter<00:02:09.810> would

bit baffled by this yes I do know that
immobilization<00:04:37.960> seems<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:38.680> be<00:04:38.800> acting<00:04:39.250> a

immobilization<00:05:15.640> is<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.850> procedure<00:05:16.420> used<00:05:17.050> in

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
immobilization is a procedure used in

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.440 
immobilization is a procedure used in
many<00:05:17.410> instances<00:05:17.800> in<00:05:18.250> experiments<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.150> induce

many instances in experiments to induce

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.420 
many instances in experiments to induce

quite stressed and they are fighting to
get<00:05:24.490> out<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:24.880> they<00:05:25.060> are<00:05:25.120> morally<00:05:25.630> activated

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140

this box being activated one of these

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.490 
this box being activated one of these
groups<00:05:44.260> had<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.790> procedure<00:05:46.300> for<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.230> first

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
groups had that procedure for the first

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.070 
groups had that procedure for the first
week<00:05:47.830> after<00:05:48.070> they<00:05:48.700> got<00:05:48.850> brain<00:05:49.120> injury<00:05:49.480> they

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
week after they got brain injury they

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.440 
week after they got brain injury they
actually<00:05:50.560> had<00:05:50.680> their<00:05:50.830> first<00:05:51.070> session<00:05:51.760> as<00:05:51.880> soon

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
actually had their first session as soon

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.530 
actually had their first session as soon
as<00:05:52.690> they<00:05:52.870> came<00:05:53.080> out<00:05:53.140> of<00:05:53.500> anesthesia<00:05:54.390> after<00:05:55.390> the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
as they came out of anesthesia after the

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.110 
as they came out of anesthesia after the
surgery<00:05:55.780> when<00:05:56.380> they<00:05:56.800> had<00:05:57.310> their<00:05:57.520> brain<00:05:57.760> injury

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
surgery when they had their brain injury

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.360 
surgery when they had their brain injury
so<00:05:58.420> they<00:05:58.660> went<00:05:58.840> basically<00:05:59.800> straight<00:06:00.190> from

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
so they went basically straight from

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.100 
so they went basically straight from
brain<00:06:00.580> injury<00:06:00.910> into<00:06:01.210> this<00:06:01.540> kind<00:06:01.810> of<00:06:01.930> regime

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
brain injury into this kind of regime

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.130 
brain injury into this kind of regime
the<00:06:03.010> other<00:06:03.130> group<00:06:03.400> had<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.420> same<00:06:04.660> treatment

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
the other group had the same treatment

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.010 
the other group had the same treatment
for<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.680> last<00:06:05.920> week<00:06:06.250> before<00:06:06.570> they<00:06:07.570> got<00:06:07.750> brain

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
for the last week before they got brain

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.820 
for the last week before they got brain
injury<00:06:08.440> so<00:06:09.400> one<00:06:09.940> group<00:06:10.150> had<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.110> before<00:06:11.440> they

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
injury so one group had it before they

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.950 
injury so one group had it before they
got<00:06:12.010> the<00:06:12.130> brain<00:06:12.310> injury<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:13.000> other<00:06:13.120> one<00:06:13.390> after

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
got the brain injury the other one after

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.800 
got the brain injury the other one after
and<00:06:14.400> statistically<00:06:15.400> there<00:06:15.700> is<00:06:15.910> no<00:06:16.270> difference

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
and statistically there is no difference

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.970 
and statistically there is no difference
whatsoever<00:06:17.520> so<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.790> point<00:06:19.000> is<00:06:19.270> in<00:06:20.020> case<00:06:20.380> you

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
whatsoever so the point is in case you

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.250 
whatsoever so the point is in case you
are<00:06:21.010> to<00:06:21.370> get<00:06:21.490> brain<00:06:21.730> injury<00:06:22.090> actually<00:06:23.080> you

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
are to get brain injury actually you

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.740 
are to get brain injury actually you
should<00:06:23.500> be<00:06:23.680> rather<00:06:24.220> well<00:06:24.790> exercised<00:06:25.360> at<00:06:25.690> the

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
should be rather well exercised at the

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.860 
should be rather well exercised at the
moment<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:27.340> other<00:06:27.370> point<00:06:27.730> obviously<00:06:28.030> is<00:06:28.570> that

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
moment the other point obviously is that

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.890 
moment the other point obviously is that
you<00:06:29.770> can<00:06:30.040> obtain<00:06:30.550> quite<00:06:31.210> significant

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
you can obtain quite significant

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.129 
you can obtain quite significant
therapeutic<00:06:32.830> effects

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
therapeutic effects

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.830 
why this is something that is of
importance<00:06:41.699> well<00:06:41.879> beyond<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.419> clinical

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
importance well beyond the clinical

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.839 
importance well beyond the clinical
implications<00:06:43.259> is<00:06:43.830> something<00:06:44.430> I'm<00:06:44.550> going<00:06:44.699> to

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849 
implications is something I'm going to

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:47.300 
implications is something I'm going to
return<00:06:45.120> to<00:06:45.330> a<00:06:45.360> couple<00:06:45.779> of<00:06:45.840> times<00:06:46.139> because<00:06:46.889> this

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
return to a couple of times because this

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.369 
return to a couple of times because this
