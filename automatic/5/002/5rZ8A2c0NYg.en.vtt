00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:05.804
 The story of Barça according to Crackòvia 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.177
 "Barça's story is full of embarrassing moments." 

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:12.121
 "A finger in the eye of Tito, the presidency of Gaspart." 

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.634
 "4-0 with Milan in the final in Athens." 

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:16.204
 "Presidency of Gaspart." 

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.412
 "I know I repeat, but it was a massacre." 

00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:21.388
 "But among them was the moment that changed the course of history." 

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:22.993
 "It's about Figo's pig head." 

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:24.830
 E, a little respect, huh? 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.350
 "I meant a pig's head that was cast in Figo." 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.947
 Unless... 

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:36.557
 "Many of you have asked how it happened at all." 

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:39.546
 "Well, to understand this, you have to go back in time." 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.367
 This is the first goal in the history of Barcelona! 

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:47.584
 "Not so much, a little less ..." 

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:55.301
 "Here! Season 1999/00. At that time, Guardiola was already thinking about leaving. " 

00:00:55.807 --> 00:01:03.124
 What if I go to Brescia? There I will definitely have peace, without any slanders and sanctions by doping or something. 

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:06.977
 But I do not want to learn Italian ... 

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:18.282
 "That's why Figo was the eye in the fans' head." 

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.885
 Figo is the best player we've ever had! 

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:25.815
 Neither Kubala, nor Cruyff, nor none! 

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:27.780
 See here! ("Figo forever in our heart") 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.471
 Brilliant! Figo represents our values. 

00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:33.810
 Not like Guardiola, which will leave us unceasingly. 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.442
 Asshole! Donkey! 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.015
 Maybe this Brescia is not such a stupid idea ... 

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:42.790
 "As you can see, Figo had many devotees." 

00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:45.540
 "Among them was the presidential candidate of Real Madrid ..." 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.420
 Madrid, llorón, saluda al campeón! * 

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:56.050
 Youth, would not you like to participate in my new galactic project? 

00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:03.016
 Never! My cheese is blaugrana. For me, you can go to sing la la la .... 

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:07.410
 Hala Madrid! 

00:02:07.843 --> 00:02:10.508
 What are you doing, Figo? You can not leave the age-old rival! 

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:15.540
 Think about Barça, think about the fans, think ... 

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:18.600
 Think about sending us a postcard from Madrid. 

00:02:21.738 --> 00:02:25.590
 "And in this way, the story of love between Socis and Figo turned into ..." 

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:28.590
 Traitor! Traitor! 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.020
 Figo is the biggest traitor we've ever had! 

00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:33.060
 Neither Laudrup nor Schuster nor any! 

00:02:33.062 --> 00:02:34.680
 You one of you salesmen! 

00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:38.355
 Barça's values ​​are represented here only by Guardiola! 

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:39.780
 You are crack! 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.960
 Now, yes, what? Now yes... 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 Look, look ... 

00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:46.946
 What do you need this piggy head for? 

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:50.740
 We beat the pig today, my head would do me some good. 

00:02:54.534 --> 00:02:57.030
 "That's how the pigskin head was on the turf, 

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.730
 and Figo became one of the most hated figures in Barça's history. " 

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:04.740
 # Skurw son! Q gave the #! Idiot! 

00:03:05.238 --> 00:03:07.899
 And you will finally stop censoring because you do not hear curses? 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:08.970
 # Skurw son.
