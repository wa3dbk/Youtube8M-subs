00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
made me it's literally shave down a lot

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.140 
made me it's literally shave down a lot
more<00:01:08.970> either<00:01:09.180> side<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:11.310> assist<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.850> getting

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
more either side to assist you getting

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.350 
more either side to assist you getting
under<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.540> levers<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.240> reason<00:01:15.240> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
under more levers and the reason this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.380 
under more levers and the reason this
works<00:01:15.659> well<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.860> security<00:01:17.490> solutions<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
works well on the security solutions is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.760 
works well on the security solutions is
I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.110> lever<00:01:19.500> three<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.700> quite<00:01:21.119> low

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
I think it's lever three is quite low

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
I think it's lever three is quite low
and<00:01:22.770> you've<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:24.450> gonna<00:01:24.960> what's<00:01:25.170> up

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
I didn't want to fully lock it because

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.190 
I didn't want to fully lock it because
you<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.519> quite<00:03:48.030> bad<00:03:48.269> issues<00:03:48.689> of<00:03:49.049> getting
