together<00:01:54.209> in<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:55.170> scripture<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.100> would

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
together in one scripture you would

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.669 
together in one scripture you would
imagine<00:01:56.459> that<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.929> need<00:01:58.109> one<00:01:58.139> gospel
