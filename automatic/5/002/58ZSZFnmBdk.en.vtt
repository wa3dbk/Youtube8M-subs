00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.150
 hello this time made a hello pi単ata 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.420
 kitty is not a makeup 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 It is made of cardboard and used paper of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.640
 colors to make eyes successful 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.119
 if you have 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.980
 I used crepe paper to make like a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.660
 kind of fringe hair 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.660
 delineated and made the little mustaches 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.050
 on the back I've put only 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.079
 white crepe paper 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.940
 I have painted a bit the most part 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.579
 he would haul cardboard he painted him in black 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.860
 but that suits more and I've made two 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.860
 holes to hang the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 and an athlete species to be able 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 put the surprises of the pi単ata 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.100
 and well I'm the pi単ata and now I tell them 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.100
 how it is done 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.620
 for this used duplex paperboard can 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.440
 use cardboard from a box a box 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.580
 television paper crepe paper or cardboard 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.610
 colored drawn wing kit and a 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.450
 Duplex card made to the eyes 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.020
 nose to be able to have the guides 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.259
 and I cut him by the contour 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.719
 and I made him a community circle for 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.729
 put to be able to put this kind of 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.340
 strip so to speak that it serves as 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.219
 bra for for candies or 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.329
 surprises I made a few cuts like 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:55.829
 folds to be able to put it in 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:59.310
 circular I put him in scotch tape and then 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.060
 I put silicone with a gun 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.880
 silicone 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.620
 then I made this kind of strips with 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.190
 the crepe paper 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.370
 like fringes on the remaining strips 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.540
 as well as a little skirt as a starting 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.800
 of fringes I hit him and I've done him the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.800
 outline of it in black 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.780
 and I used the colored paper for 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.990
 namely he cited and nose and eyes 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.710
 and well that's the pi単ata I hope that 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.810
 have liked and can do it 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.480
 but what I forgot was that for the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.660
 little gate only cut a piece of the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.990
 strip smaller and what in great pa one of 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.690
 the sides 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.380
 and do not hit him so he can 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.380
 open and close
