 on television more also more than 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.460
 never the Huicholes mexicaneros and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.960
 Tepehuanos from the sierra nayarita fight 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.300
 against the construction of the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 hydroelectric crosses this 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.199
 would affect sacred places and the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.970
 ecosystem of the place this is the first 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.529
 part of a special job of my 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.529
 Ernesto Mendez 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:47.110
 and the defense of much grief grows in 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.760
 social networks and pint to become 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.530
 in a national movement and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.920
 international like the cry of salvemos 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.390
 wirikuta in 2012 2013 against the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.400
 concessions granted to mining companies 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.850
 Canadians in sacred lands of the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.850
 Huichol people 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.159
 now in 2014 the fight of coras 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.750
 Mexicaneros of Peruvians and Huichols is 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.820
 against the hydroelectric project the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.920
 crosses that drives the federal commission 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.840
 of electricity on the San Pedro River 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.690
 mezquital and that would affect more than 10 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.700
 thousand hectares in the sierra de nayarit 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.920
 including 14 sacred sites like the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.470
 many had where life is celebrated 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 physical and spiritual associated with the source 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.800
 with rituals and religious ceremonies and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.220
 now they want to impound us yet 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.830
 of what is the mountain what 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.340
 it is our sacred water they want 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.940
 remove and do what we are 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.800
 felt the river san pedro mezquital 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.110
 flows into the Pacific in the reserve 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.000
 of the national biosphere marshes home 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.250
 of 20 percent of the mangroves that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.440
 exist in Mexico and are a refuge 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.630
 a great diversity of barrier species 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.330
 naturally against hurricanes and sink 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.429
 of carbon dioxide the Mexican center 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.560
 of environmental law warns that the 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.179
 hydroelectric crosses would accept a 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.880
 key ecosystem for the mitigation of 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.509
 climate change the migration of birds and 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.599
 the generation of resources 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.500
 at the time of your putting a curtain of 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.840
 Water 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.819
 your basin above affects only what is 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.060
 the cable calls the ecological flow 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.280
 then the dam and it works like a 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.350
 sediment trap 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.260
 the nutrient and mineral sediments 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.310
 that carries the river san pedro mezquital 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.520
 keep fertile farmland 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.160
 from at least 20 communities the floods 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.319
 between July and October they also serve to 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.959
 that the grass grows and there is food 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.450
 enough for the cattle the water that 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.040
 It naturally descends from this tributary 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.319
 It also preserves the salt balance in 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.209
 marshes and offers conditions 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.140
 suitable for fishing and practice 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.610
 of the handset 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.709
 conditions are given so that the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.080
 options at that time the two tender 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.860
 adults as it is watched as it is 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.019
 option begins to spawn to add voices 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.540
 by nature warns that the 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.920
 floods of the river san pedro mezquital 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.890
 have an annual value in services 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.080
 environmental of 1250 million pesos 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.290
 which are the main source of income 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.390
 of 12,000 families in contrast the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.280
 Federal electricity commission speaks 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.720
 an investment of nearly 8 billion 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.019
 of weights for the hydroelectric project 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.580
 and the generation of 5000 jobs in the 5 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.430
 years that the construction of the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.799
 you cross the economic offer that the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.970
 Project will say are 8 mil 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.560
 millions of pesos 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.470
 in 5 years the same amount is generated by 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.190
 San Pedro river running freely in 6 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.910
 years yes with the difference that here the 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.680
 work finishes and the investment is finished 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.060
 tomorrow the requirement of the consultation 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.970
