00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.500 
not sure but I think it could be hacked
lobbies<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:10.979> model<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.000> don't

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
lobbies and model for two now I don't

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
lobbies and model for two now I don't
think<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.780> cuz<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.140> went<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> week<00:01:14.250> ago

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
think so cuz I went on like a week ago

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.679 
think so cuz I went on like a week ago
or<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:15.060> wasn't<00:01:15.210> no<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.509> hacked

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
or so and there wasn't no one hacked

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
or so and there wasn't no one hacked
lobbies<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> seen<00:01:16.890> some<00:01:17.070> common<00:01:17.460> saying

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
lobbies but I seen some common saying

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
lobbies but I seen some common saying
there's<00:01:17.850> hacked<00:01:18.090> lobbies<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:18.630> among<00:01:18.960> 42<00:01:19.350> so

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
there's hacked lobbies now among 42 so

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.140 
there's hacked lobbies now among 42 so
hopefully<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> case<00:01:20.729> because<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
hopefully that's not the case because I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
hopefully that's not the case because I
don't<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.780> hacked<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:23.070> yeah<00:01:23.189> in

think one thing if i had to improve on

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.100 
think one thing if i had to improve on
in<00:02:31.430> my<00:02:31.549> call<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.909> duty<00:02:32.120> game<00:02:32.299> would<00:02:32.810> be<00:02:32.840> my

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
amazing look at this like I'm not

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.750 
amazing look at this like I'm not
amazing<00:02:36.890> at<00:02:36.950> shooting<00:02:37.310> some<00:02:37.459> long<00:02:37.610> distance

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
amazing at shooting some long distance

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.390 
amazing at shooting some long distance
um<00:02:38.329> is<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.140> something<00:02:39.470> I'm<00:02:39.590> not<00:02:39.769> not<00:02:40.190> really

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
um is this something I'm not not really

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.729 
um is this something I'm not not really
used<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.700> force<00:02:41.269> of<00:02:41.390> its<00:02:41.510> close<00:02:41.720> range<00:02:42.049> i'll<00:02:42.530> be

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
used to force of its close range i'll be

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.250 
used to force of its close range i'll be
taking<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.099> out<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.579> second<00:02:44.030> but<00:02:44.750> i<00:02:44.810> don't

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
taking you out in a second but i don't

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.680 
taking you out in a second but i don't
know<00:02:45.379> it<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:46.060> long-range<00:02:47.060> i<00:02:47.209> guess<00:02:47.359> could<00:02:47.599> be

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
know it just long-range i guess could be

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.030 
know it just long-range i guess could be
my<00:02:47.810> sensitivity<00:02:48.170> because<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.709> get<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:48.859> better

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
my sensitivity because you get a better

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.890 
my sensitivity because you get a better
shot<00:02:49.190> if<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:50.030> had<00:02:50.150> if<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.359> rock<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.720> on

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
shot if you had if you rock like on

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.170 
shot if you had if you rock like on
tooth<00:02:51.230> sensitivity<00:02:51.440> which<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.430> cannot<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:53.030> it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
tooth sensitivity which I cannot do it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.479 
tooth sensitivity which I cannot do it
all<00:02:53.359> I'm<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.230> used<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.620> rocking<00:02:55.099> with<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.340> now

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
all I'm so used to rocking with this now

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.190 
all I'm so used to rocking with this now
if<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.790> go<00:02:55.819> into<00:02:56.090> sensitivity<00:02:56.810> I'll<00:02:56.930> blow<00:02:57.140> my

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
if I go into sensitivity I'll blow my

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.300 
if I go into sensitivity I'll blow my
brains<00:02:57.379> out<00:02:58.510> too<00:02:59.510> hard<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.930> play<00:03:00.079> on<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.440> me<00:03:00.530> so

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
brains out too hard to play on for me so

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.490 
brains out too hard to play on for me so
I<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.879> know<00:03:01.909> go<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.569> nine<00:03:03.079> eight

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500

I just you know go with the nine eight
or<00:03:03.650> nine<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:04.220> then<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:04.430> good<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.819> go<00:03:05.049> but<00:03:06.049> yeah

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
or nine and then I'm good to go but yeah

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.229 
or nine and then I'm good to go but yeah
I<00:03:06.680> always<00:03:07.010> want<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.340> work<00:03:07.489> on<00:03:07.609> my<00:03:07.730> long<00:03:07.909> shot

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
I always want to work on my long shot

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.599 
I always want to work on my long shot
like<00:03:08.450> get<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.109> better<00:03:09.319> shot<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.859> but<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.430> think

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
like get a better shot on but I think

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.430 
like get a better shot on but I think
it's<00:03:10.700> harder<00:03:10.970> now<00:03:11.000> because<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.480> an<00:03:11.599> HDTV<00:03:11.959> I

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
it's harder now because I have an HDTV I

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.490 
it's harder now because I have an HDTV I
swear<00:03:13.099> it's<00:03:13.280> way<00:03:13.670> harder<00:03:14.060> now<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.599> if<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:15.319> had<00:03:15.470> a

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
swear it's way harder now and if I had a

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.409 
swear it's way harder now and if I had a
choice<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.829> play<00:03:16.159> on<00:03:16.430> standard<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.180> finishing

move a lot faster and your aim is a lot
better<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.739> was<00:03:28.489> thinking<00:03:28.760> about<00:03:28.819> hooking<00:03:29.269> up

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
better I was thinking about hooking up

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.900 
better I was thinking about hooking up
my<00:03:29.450> standard<00:03:29.780> definition<00:03:30.200> TV<00:03:30.470> up<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.069> then

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
my standard definition TV up and then

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.849 
my standard definition TV up and then
playing<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.629> on<00:03:32.780> black<00:03:33.019> ops<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.500> if<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.680> want

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
playing that on black ops and if I want

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.430 
playing that on black ops and if I want
to<00:03:33.919> record<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.310> gameplay<00:03:34.730> I'll<00:03:34.879> put<00:03:35.780> on<00:03:35.810> my<00:03:35.930> HD

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440

so my machine over video came out i'm on
0<00:04:23.120> for<00:04:23.360> 2<00:04:23.539> I<00:04:23.690> think<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.409> think

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
0 for 2 I think I think

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.309 
0 for 2 I think I think
more<00:04:25.250> people<00:04:25.400> want<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:25.819> see<00:04:26.000> mono<00:04:26.870> or<00:04:27.050> for<00:04:27.199> two

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
videos instead of black off I think

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.800 
videos instead of black off I think
people<00:04:28.699> think<00:04:28.909> black<00:04:29.180> op<00:04:29.360> videos<00:04:29.659> are<00:04:29.780> boring
