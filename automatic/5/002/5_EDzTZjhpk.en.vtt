years to continue the course of driving
in<00:06:31.930> Japan<00:06:32.229> that's<00:06:32.860> how<00:06:33.009> you<00:06:33.099> do<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.219> I'll<00:06:33.430> cut

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
in Japan that's how you do it I'll cut

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.070 
in Japan that's how you do it I'll cut
away<00:06:33.819> now<00:06:34.029> is<00:06:34.210> this<00:06:34.330> beautiful<00:06:34.750> tree<00:06:34.899> behind

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
away now is this beautiful tree behind

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.079 
away now is this beautiful tree behind
us<00:06:35.349> I'll<00:06:35.740> cut<00:06:35.919> away<00:06:36.099> now<00:06:36.250> to<00:06:36.310> a<00:06:36.459> shot<00:06:36.849> of<00:06:36.969> the

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.089 
us I'll cut away now to a shot of the

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:39.059 
us I'll cut away now to a shot of the
actual<00:06:37.419> driving<00:06:37.599> course<00:06:37.930> he<00:06:38.469> come<00:06:38.649> to<00:06:38.770> Japan

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
actual driving course he come to Japan

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.650 
actual driving course he come to Japan
and<00:06:39.339> good<00:06:39.490> luck<00:06:39.610> get<00:06:40.120> your<00:06:40.270> neural

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
and good luck get your neural

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.120 
and good luck get your neural
since<00:06:40.900> check<00:06:41.140> into<00:06:41.350> it<00:06:41.380> you<00:06:41.530> may<00:06:41.650> feel<00:06:41.830> from<00:06:42.010> a

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
since check into it you may feel from a

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.550 
since check into it you may feel from a
country<00:06:42.520> that<00:06:43.090> that<00:06:43.600> has<00:06:43.780> the<00:06:43.990> streamlined

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
country that that has the streamlined

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.190 
country that that has the streamlined
process<00:06:44.920> you<00:06:45.040> don't<00:06:45.160> be<00:06:45.280> a<00:06:45.310> much<00:06:45.940> easier<00:06:46.200> take

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
process you don't be a much easier take

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.330 
process you don't be a much easier take
care<00:06:47.320> of<00:06:47.380> it<00:06:47.530> oh<00:06:48.240> and<00:06:49.240> here's<00:06:49.390> the<00:06:49.450> course<00:06:50.340> and

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
care of it oh and here's the course and

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.570 
care of it oh and here's the course and
here's<00:06:51.610> a<00:06:51.670> view<00:06:52.330> of<00:06:52.390> the<00:06:52.570> driving<00:06:53.290> range<00:06:54.070> this

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
here's a view of the driving range this

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.180 
here's a view of the driving range this
is<00:06:54.730> where<00:06:54.940> you<00:06:55.090> actually<00:06:55.300> do<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:55.900> test<00:06:56.190> it's

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
is where you actually do the test it's

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.480 
is where you actually do the test it's
actually<00:06:57.550> a<00:06:57.610> pretty<00:06:57.670> extensive<00:06:58.120> course<00:06:59.490> they

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
actually a pretty extensive course they

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.310 
actually a pretty extensive course they
have<00:07:00.970> similar<00:07:01.360> ranges<00:07:01.810> like<00:07:01.960> this<00:07:02.140> all<00:07:02.290> over

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
have similar ranges like this all over

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.320 
have similar ranges like this all over
the<00:07:02.620> city<00:07:02.860> for<00:07:03.070> the<00:07:03.250> private<00:07:03.760> driving<00:07:04.060> schools

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
the city for the private driving schools

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.570 
the city for the private driving schools
where<00:07:04.600> you<00:07:04.750> can<00:07:05.020> go<00:07:05.470> to<00:07:05.530> learn<00:07:05.800> your<00:07:06.130> course

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
where you can go to learn your course

where you can go to learn your course
and<00:07:06.700> they<00:07:06.790> have<00:07:06.910> exactly<00:07:07.300> basically<00:07:07.900> the

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
and they have exactly basically the

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.710 
and they have exactly basically the
identical<00:07:08.440> course<00:07:08.650> and<00:07:09.270> lots<00:07:10.270> of<00:07:10.390> different

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
identical course and lots of different

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.200

you<00:07:11.290> know<00:07:11.410> obstacle<00:07:12.310> areas<00:07:12.610> there<00:07:12.850> to<00:07:13.090> get

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
you know obstacle areas there to get

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.390 
you know obstacle areas there to get
through<00:07:13.510> difficult<00:07:14.290> challenging<00:07:14.980> sections

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
through difficult challenging sections

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.720 
through difficult challenging sections
here<00:07:15.550> bridges<00:07:16.360> signals<00:07:17.310> there's<00:07:18.310> a<00:07:18.400> barrier

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
here bridges signals there's a barrier

coming<00:07:24.100> down<00:07:24.430> it's<00:07:25.360> a<00:07:25.480> pretty<00:07:25.690> tough<00:07:25.870> course

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.170 
coming down it's a pretty tough course

or four different courses and it's it's

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.070 
or four different courses and it's it's
a<00:07:33.040> rough<00:07:33.220> it's<00:07:33.490> a<00:07:33.580> rough<00:07:33.730> one<00:07:33.850> but<00:07:34.150> very
