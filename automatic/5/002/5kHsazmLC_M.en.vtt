00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.889 
about let's just round it off so from
five<00:02:04.229> cards<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.009> bought<00:02:06.829> it's<00:02:07.829> gone<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
five cards I bought it's gone up to that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.790 
five cards I bought it's gone up to that
so<00:02:10.679> yeah

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
so yeah

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.840 
so yeah
that<00:02:12.220> verifies<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.480> technique<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.850> a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
that verifies that this technique is a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.420 
that verifies that this technique is a
very<00:02:16.180> good<00:02:16.540> technique<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.440> terms<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.890> how

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
very good technique in terms of how

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.410 
very good technique in terms of how
you're<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.790> do<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.060> because<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.300> just

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
you're going to do it because you just

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.280 
you're going to do it because you just
got<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.750> hover<00:02:19.990> around<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.620> 50<00:02:21.420> 58<00:02:22.420> 59<00:02:22.840> minute

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
got to hover around the 50 58 59 minute

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.170 
got to hover around the 50 58 59 minute
mark<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.860> see<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.790> keep<00:02:25.030> hovering

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
mark and you see you keep hovering

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.570 
mark and you see you keep hovering
between<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.630> two<00:02:25.750> pages<00:02:25.990> where<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.580> thing

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
between the two pages where the thing

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640 
between the two pages where the thing
splits<00:02:27.940> between<00:02:28.600> an<00:02:28.900> hour<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.170> 59<00:02:29.500> minutes

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
splits between an hour and 59 minutes

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.880 
splits between an hour and 59 minutes
and<00:02:29.980> then<00:02:30.130> they<00:02:30.250> will<00:02:30.400> show<00:02:30.820> up<00:02:30.970> immediately<00:02:31.150> I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and then they will show up immediately I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.470 
and then they will show up immediately I
