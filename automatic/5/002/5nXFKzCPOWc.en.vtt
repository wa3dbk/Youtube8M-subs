I think that some people might be

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.550 
I think that some people might be
concerned<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.019> woulda<00:03:46.229> made<00:03:46.349> their

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
concerned that that woulda made their

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.379 
concerned that that woulda made their
save<00:03:46.799> file<00:03:47.129> but<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.639> don't<00:03:47.790> think<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.209> to

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
save file but I don't think you have to

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.050 
save file but I don't think you have to
worry<00:03:48.590> they<00:03:49.590> are<00:03:49.620> saved<00:03:50.009> separately<00:03:50.489> at<00:03:50.909> least

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
worry they are saved separately at least

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.749 
worry they are saved separately at least
with<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> xbox<00:03:51.540> 360<00:03:52.049> so<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.650> would<00:03:53.099> assume<00:03:53.189> that

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:53.759 
with the xbox 360 so I would assume that

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.129 
with the xbox 360 so I would assume that
it<00:03:53.819> would<00:03:53.909> be<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> same<00:03:54.299> with<00:03:54.509> the<00:03:54.569> xbox<00:03:54.900> one

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
it would be the same with the xbox one

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.319 
it would be the same with the xbox one
but<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:55.979> course<00:03:56.280> we<00:03:56.819> don't<00:03:57.030> know<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.150> for

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
but of course we don't know that for

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.059 
but of course we don't know that for
sure<00:03:57.479> I'm<00:03:57.870> sure<00:03:58.049> we'll<00:03:58.169> find<00:03:58.199> out<00:03:58.500> closer<00:03:58.829> to

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
sure I'm sure we'll find out closer to

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.159 
sure I'm sure we'll find out closer to
launch<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.699> but<00:03:59.909> I<00:04:00.120> would<00:04:00.329> be<00:04:00.449> surprised<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:01.049> it

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
launch it but I would be surprised if it

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.259 
launch it but I would be surprised if it
worked<00:04:01.409> any<00:04:01.650> other<00:04:01.859> way<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.819> you're<00:04:03.180> either

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
worked any other way so you're either

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.189 
worked any other way so you're either
going<00:04:03.449> to<00:04:03.509> have<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.720> be<00:04:03.810> pretty<00:04:03.930> vigilant

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
going to have to be pretty vigilant

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.629 
going to have to be pretty vigilant
about<00:04:04.500> deleting<00:04:04.979> games<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.489> no<00:04:05.609> longer

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
about deleting games that you no longer

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.149 
about deleting games that you no longer
play<00:04:06.150> or<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:07.199> having<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.949> think<00:04:08.069> about

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
play or just having to think about

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.309 
play or just having to think about

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
sizes of the next generation games are

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.759 
sizes of the next generation games are
looking<00:04:12.449> pretty<00:04:12.599> mighty<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.439> say<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.739> least

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
of course for the ps4 we have killzone

of course for the ps4 we have killzone
shadow<00:04:16.859> fall<00:04:16.949> which<00:04:17.280> apparently<00:04:17.489> comes<00:04:17.940> in

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
shadow fall which apparently comes in

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.360 
shadow fall which apparently comes in
around<00:04:18.299> 50<00:04:18.780> gig<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.380> they're<00:04:19.620> not<00:04:20.190> messing

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
around 50 gig so they're not messing

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.760 
around 50 gig so they're not messing
around<00:04:20.609> with<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.180> install<00:04:21.539> sizes<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.440> I

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
around with the install sizes and I

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.339 
around with the install sizes and I
think<00:04:23.279> broad<00:04:23.700> bands<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.270> some<00:04:24.570> countries<00:04:25.110> is

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
think broad bands in some countries is

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.930 
think broad bands in some countries is
going<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.800> be<00:04:25.919> struggling<00:04:26.279> to<00:04:26.460> keep<00:04:26.610> up<00:04:26.760> for

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
going to be struggling to keep up for

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.440 
going to be struggling to keep up for
digital

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
digital

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.750 
digital
versions<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.990> these<00:04:28.140> games<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.250> think<00:04:29.490> that

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
versions of these games so I think that

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.360 
versions of these games so I think that
until<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:30.750> see<00:04:31.020> an<00:04:31.110> improvement<00:04:31.370> disk-based

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
until we see an improvement disk-based

until we see an improvement disk-based

sales are going to be pretty high not

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.750 
sales are going to be pretty high not
that<00:04:34.680> they<00:04:34.800> aren't<00:04:34.830> already<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.520> there<00:04:35.640> might

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that they aren't already but there might

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.010 
that they aren't already but there might
be<00:04:35.790> higher<00:04:36.090> than<00:04:36.240> they<00:04:36.390> normally<00:04:36.540> otherwise

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
be higher than they normally otherwise

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.040

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
so there will just be like oh okay I'll

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.090 
so there will just be like oh okay I'll
just<00:04:48.180> get<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.600> box<00:04:48.930> version<00:04:49.200> then<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.800> at

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
least ill just install and be done with

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.930 
least ill just install and be done with
it<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:52.320> be<00:04:52.590> surprised<00:04:52.950> if<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.220> few<00:04:53.400> people<00:04:53.460> have

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
it so be surprised if a few people have

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.140 
it so be surprised if a few people have
to<00:04:54.450> relent<00:04:55.020> on<00:04:55.200> that<00:04:55.500> anyway<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.700> is<00:04:56.730> me<00:04:56.970> done
