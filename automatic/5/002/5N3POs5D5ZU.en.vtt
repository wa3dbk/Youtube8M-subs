they're<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:07.700> was<00:01:08.620> well<00:01:09.620> honestly<00:01:09.860> was<00:01:10.640> and

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
they're so I was well honestly was and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.120 
they're so I was well honestly was and
still<00:01:11.120> am<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.330> bit<00:01:11.600> pissed<00:01:11.840> off<00:01:12.020> about<00:01:12.170> that

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.700 

people<00:01:16.130> tend<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:17.560> take<00:01:18.560> your<00:01:19.660> generosity<00:01:20.710> for

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710
