00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.000
 The blexer is back on again 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 the spliss sound beautiful to another 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.940
 yes before I go to the gameplay 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.890
 Gameplay come what is running in the background 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.100
 I would like to briefly something for swiss cup 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:53.470
 We wanted to say the week before 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.409
 again apologize for that with the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.309
 stream did not quite work though 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:05.409
 was so ok now i have everything okay empire 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.960
 won in the final against tactics and 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.900
 as far as we know, the empire has 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.310
 clear then resolved again for 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.850
 a pity 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.430
 they were pretty good and then 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 I'll come back to the stream what is there 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.460
 everything is so wrong 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.200
 why could not we stream important 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.159
 Although it was supposed to be the gianluca 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.859
 stream 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.640
 but in the stream is then somehow be 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.380
 laptop broke in addition to power supply 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.130
 network partly gone half-broken 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.009
 really shit on the 12 because of that 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.950
 I had to scream too 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.009
 thanks to my laptop and my little one 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.380
 I was not good at streaming 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.289
 and you saw her 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.090
 the quali was so shitty and me 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.469
 I've tried a few times the quali 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.109
 to do better but then it has 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.230
 Just licked and after that I had 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.420
 then do not bother anymore 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.400
 are of course again care for that 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.010
 maybe but maybe just do it 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.960
 we again a head-but that must 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.560
 we'll look at everything else than he does 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.090
 told 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.700
 the patterns and look but at all 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.020
 still want to make a head 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.920
 that was it already 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.930
 to the stream 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.200
 then I'll come to you now 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.690
 gameplay and indeed it is a cd is he 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.180
 on melzer from reckless against the team 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.040
 legacy but as before that thinks it 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.710
 some run the clear or 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.080
 randy team is actually quite right 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.270
 and not at all because they are in sex 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.920
 had come to the semi-finals and 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.830
 who then lost narrowly went 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.800
 the team effect so they are on everyone 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.680
 If you have a really good team you have to 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.800
 already say and respect in any case 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.290
 to you direction filter you have the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.760
 Nuclear packed , such a good team 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.710
 Of course, you do not always succeed 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.630
 the view member the goods were then too 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.300
 still on the 20 o'clock are then all 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.360
 it was also hidden at the end 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.190
 a 32 very lazy looking two kids 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.330
 had still done after the nuclear then 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.120
 died too 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.140
 yes and because of the nokia we show that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.000
 Of course everything only from his view yes 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.650
 you can just look up 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.970
 I slipped this claire I have 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.190
 already looked at a few times 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.230
 In any case, cluster had seen that 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.540
 Just look like he's on top of us 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.830
 She just wanted to have it and in the end 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.050
 she still had 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.420
 So I'm really interested now 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.650
 how he was very happy 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.240
 or was then just one of the says 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.170
 gomez 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.380
 it is a pity but creates so real 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.950
 leather against such a blatant cvp nokia too 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.900
 tear 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.530
 As I said, respect for you respectfully 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.740
 then it was already the gameplay for 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.840
 Gameplay comments ok to the gameplay 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.080
 Now I come to the few infos 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.370
 We still have a new one 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.020

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.780

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.780

 We are also looking for men 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.940
 though we are looking for gameplay players and 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.850
 Commentators are just one of them 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.120
 two people but if you are interested 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.060
 the little one wants to apply then 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.970
 our clear homepage there is so 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.010
 I would like to submit an application form 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.280

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.410

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.630
 look if you like the gameplay too 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.750
 Of course you played it naturally 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.050
 even so which schlawiner think this 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.780

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.310
 In that case we will have it in 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.400

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.630

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.870

 Although it is first of the beats and me 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.700
 So that's up to plextor we'll take care of it 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.800

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.870
 it can not boss yes to everything 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.690
 Take care and I can understand that 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.190
