assemble a water-cooling system or they

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.429 
assemble a water-cooling system or they
don't<00:00:27.599> want<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.199> through<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
don't want to have to go through the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
don't want to have to go through the
hassle<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> increased<00:00:29.279> cost<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.609> doing<00:00:29.789> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
hassle in the increased cost of doing so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.959 
hassle in the increased cost of doing so
it<00:00:30.810> rings<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.170> between<00:00:31.470> 75<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.250> 100<00:00:32.579> dollar<00:00:32.759> so

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it rings in between 75 to 100 dollar so

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.220 
it rings in between 75 to 100 dollar so
it's<00:00:33.090> meant<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> compete<00:00:33.570> more<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it's meant to compete more with the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
it's meant to compete more with the
higher<00:00:34.530> end<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.219> air<00:00:35.610> cooling<00:00:36.000> solutions

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
higher end of the air cooling solutions

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.750 
higher end of the air cooling solutions
and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.260> wouldn't<00:00:37.920> say<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.399> meant<00:00:38.670> for

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and I wouldn't say it's meant for

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
and I wouldn't say it's meant for
serious<00:00:39.450> overclockers<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.710> we're<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
serious overclockers so we're going to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
serious overclockers so we're going to
open<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.460> check<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.210> assemble<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> in

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
open it up check it out assemble it in

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.150 
open it up check it out assemble it in
our<00:00:43.140> system<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.920> kind<00:00:44.100> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
our system and see what kind of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.670 
our system and see what kind of
improvements<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.469> all<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
improvements we can get all right so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.560 
improvements we can get all right so
we're<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> obligatory

we<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> unit<00:01:20.040> itself<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:20.909> does

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
we have the unit itself now what does

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
we have the unit itself now what does
cool<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.479> unit<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.200> cpu<00:01:22.920> block<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
cool is this unit is a cpu block and a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.940 
cool is this unit is a cpu block and a
pump<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.350> makes<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> really

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
pump all in one that makes it really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.190 
pump all in one that makes it really
simple<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.729> two<00:01:27.030> piece<00:01:27.420> operation

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
simple it's just two piece operation

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.359 
simple it's just two piece operation
which<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.619> notice<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
which will notice here is there is a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.830 
which will notice here is there is a
copper<00:01:29.729> base<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.150> already<00:01:30.360> has<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
copper base and it already has the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.370 
copper base and it already has the
thermal<00:01:31.170> grease<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:32.810> what<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.110> here

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
thermal grease on it what we have here

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
thermal grease on it what we have here
is<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> radiator<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.150> said

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
is the radiator which is like I said

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.819 
is the radiator which is like I said
it's<00:01:36.450> very<00:01:36.720> simple<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> radiator

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it's very simple you have the radiator

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's very simple you have the radiator
here<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> foot

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
here you have your it's about a foot

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
here you have your it's about a foot
long<00:01:39.450> worth<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.229> tubing<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> have

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
long worth of tubing and then you have

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
long worth of tubing and then you have
the<00:01:41.579> block<00:01:41.790> /<00:01:42.119> /<00:01:42.750> pump<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> top<00:01:43.680> now

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the block / / pump up at the top now

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.600 
the block / / pump up at the top now
it's<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.670> powered<00:01:44.939> by<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.960> cpu<00:01:46.649> fan<00:01:47.100> header<00:01:47.430> the

molex connector also in the packaging we

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.999 
molex connector also in the packaging we
have<00:01:51.930> our<00:01:52.140> fans<00:01:52.439> screws<00:01:54.530> we<00:01:55.530> also<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.890> all

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
have our fans screws we also have all

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.800 
have our fans screws we also have all
the<00:01:56.100> mounting<00:01:56.579> hardware<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.780> of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the mounting hardware here for all of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.569 
the mounting hardware here for all of
your<00:01:57.990> different<00:01:58.110> socket<00:01:58.740> types<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.340> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
your different socket types so that is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.940 
your different socket types so that is
what<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.420> included<00:02:00.689> very<00:02:01.140> simple<00:02:01.500> packaging

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
what is included very simple packaging

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
what is included very simple packaging
now<00:02:02.100> let's<00:02:02.280> find<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.610> how<00:02:02.820> tough<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
now let's find out how tough it is to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.530 
now let's find out how tough it is to
actually<00:02:03.899> install<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:05.149> for<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> instructions

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
actually install as for the instructions

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.540 
actually install as for the instructions
we<00:02:06.810> attach<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.259> plastic<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:07.920> plate<00:02:08.250> which

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
we attach the plastic back plate which

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.100 
we attach the plastic back plate which
is<00:02:08.700> much<00:02:09.000> easier<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> case<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
is much easier if you have a case with a

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.479 
is much easier if you have a case with a
rear<00:02:10.319> cut<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> metal

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
rear cut out and then the metal

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.050 
rear cut out and then the metal
retaining<00:02:11.910> ring<00:02:12.090> gets<00:02:12.300> screwed<00:02:12.629> in

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
retaining ring gets screwed in

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.510 
retaining ring gets screwed in
the<00:02:13.180> cpu<00:02:13.690> socket<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:15.040> after<00:02:15.220> getting<00:02:15.400> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
the cpu socket so after getting the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.040 
the cpu socket so after getting the
bracket<00:02:15.940> installed<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.420> next<00:02:16.630> step<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.020> to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
bracket installed the next step is to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.690 
bracket installed the next step is to
figure<00:02:17.410> out<00:02:17.590> exactly<00:02:18.069> where<00:02:18.370> we're<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
figure out exactly where we're going to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.820 
figure out exactly where we're going to
put<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.910> radiator<00:02:19.270> actually<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.650> is

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
put the radiator actually this is

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.930 
put the radiator actually this is
something<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.190> probably<00:02:21.459> should<00:02:21.849> have

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
something you probably should have

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.880 
something you probably should have
figured<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.360> before<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.840> even<00:02:22.959> buy<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.349> unit

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
figured out before you even buy the unit

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.530 
figured out before you even buy the unit
but<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.580> best<00:02:24.700> part<00:02:24.819> is<00:02:25.030> usually<00:02:25.239> going<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.390> be

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
but the best part is usually going to be

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.630 
but the best part is usually going to be
over<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> rear<00:02:26.020> 120<00:02:26.680> millimeter<00:02:27.010> exhaust<00:02:27.370> fan

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
over the rear 120 millimeter exhaust fan

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.930 
over the rear 120 millimeter exhaust fan
which<00:02:27.880> most<00:02:28.239> cases<00:02:28.599> do<00:02:29.020> have<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.790> course

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
which most cases do have now of course

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.070 
which most cases do have now of course
they're<00:02:31.120> actually<00:02:31.510> recommends<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:31.989> you

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
they're actually recommends that you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.170 
they're actually recommends that you
install<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.620> fan<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:33.010> an<00:02:33.190> intake<00:02:33.640> fan<00:02:33.910> so

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
install the fan as an intake fan so

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.970 
install the fan as an intake fan so
you'll<00:02:34.330> have<00:02:34.480> their<00:02:34.720> logo<00:02:35.080> pointing<00:02:35.560> towards

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
you'll have their logo pointing towards

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.250 
you'll have their logo pointing towards
the<00:02:36.130> radiator<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> screws<00:02:38.110> are

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the radiator and because the screws are

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.900 
the radiator and because the screws are
only<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.709> long<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.400> why<00:02:39.519> you<00:02:39.550> can't

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
only this long that is why you can't

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.520 
only this long that is why you can't
install<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.360> larger<00:02:40.900> fan<00:02:41.140> than<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.380> one

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
install a larger fan than the one

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.530 
install a larger fan than the one
they've<00:02:41.680> provided<00:02:42.099> because<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.120> goes<00:02:43.269> right

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
they've provided because it goes right

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.059 
they've provided because it goes right
through<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> case<00:02:44.110> straight<00:02:44.709> through<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
through the case straight through the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.680 
through the case straight through the
fan<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.640> into<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.030> radiator<00:02:46.330> without

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
fan and into the radiator without

00:02:46.690 --> 00:03:00.100 
fan and into the radiator without
damaging<00:02:47.260> any<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.769> fins

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.230 

as<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.280> see<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.550> process<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.000> installing

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
as you can see the process of installing

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.730 
as you can see the process of installing
the<00:03:02.450> radiator<00:03:02.810> isn't<00:03:03.260> all<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.380> difficult

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
the radiator isn't all that difficult

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.350 
the radiator isn't all that difficult
it's<00:03:04.160> just<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.400> matter<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.670> making<00:03:04.850> sure<00:03:05.180> that

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
it's just a matter of making sure that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.060 
it's just a matter of making sure that
you<00:03:05.450> properly<00:03:05.840> line<00:03:06.110> up<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.380> screws<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.890> you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
you properly line up the screws and you

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.130 
you properly line up the screws and you
don't<00:03:07.250> damage<00:03:07.460> any<00:03:07.820> fins<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.780> radiator

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
don't damage any fins on the radiator

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.220 
don't damage any fins on the radiator
make<00:03:09.770> sure<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.070> secured<00:03:10.730> tight<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.330> from

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
make sure it's secured tight and from

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.170 
make sure it's secured tight and from
there<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> next<00:03:12.710> step<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.310> install<00:03:13.550> the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
there the next step is to install the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.840 
there the next step is to install the
pump<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.720> water<00:03:15.170> block<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:16.550> in<00:03:16.640> order<00:03:16.730> to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
pump and water block so in order to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.100 
pump and water block so in order to
actually<00:03:17.000> install<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:17.480> block<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.870> clip

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
actually install the block the clip

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.390 
actually install the block the clip
should<00:03:18.350> be<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> little<00:03:18.770> loose<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.220> what<00:03:19.310> it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
should be a little loose and what it

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.610 
should be a little loose and what it
actually<00:03:19.520> uses<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:20.210> a<00:03:20.240> sort<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.990> teeth<00:03:21.230> style

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
actually uses is a sort of a teeth style

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.530 
actually uses is a sort of a teeth style
system<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.180> going<00:03:23.270> to<00:03:23.360> make<00:03:23.510> sure

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
system and you just going to make sure

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.120 
system and you just going to make sure
that<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.960> teeth<00:03:24.140> match<00:03:24.470> up<00:03:24.680> with<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.830> holes

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
that the teeth match up with the holes

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.610 
that the teeth match up with the holes
in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.640> block<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.270> then<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.410> take<00:03:27.590> your

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
in the block and then you take your

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.860 
in the block and then you take your
screwdriver<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.490> you<00:03:28.790> secure<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:29.300> all<00:03:29.540> down

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870

and<00:03:30.110> that's<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.650> there<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.100> it

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.860 

so<00:03:41.939> for<00:03:42.090> our<00:03:42.120> stress<00:03:42.359> test<00:03:42.390> we're<00:03:42.719> using

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
so for our stress test we're using

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.050 
so for our stress test we're using
prime95<00:03:43.590> eight<00:03:44.099> iterations<00:03:44.730> because<00:03:44.909> it's

prime95 eight iterations because it's

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.869 
prime95 eight iterations because it's

we're<00:03:48.329> using<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.629> core<00:03:48.900> i7<00:03:49.739> 920<00:03:50.489> CPU<00:03:51.359> which

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
we're using the core i7 920 CPU which

the<00:04:28.310> corsair<00:04:28.639> water<00:04:28.879> cooler<00:04:29.120> will<00:04:29.330> test<00:04:29.539> it

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
the corsair water cooler will test it

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.420 
the corsair water cooler will test it
out<00:04:29.749> at<00:04:29.930> stock<00:04:30.199> speeds<00:04:30.499> and<00:04:30.770> then<00:04:30.889> overclock

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
out at stock speeds and then overclock

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.649 
out at stock speeds and then overclock
it<00:04:31.460> as<00:04:31.699> well<00:04:31.849> and<00:04:32.029> see<00:04:32.150> what<00:04:32.300> kind<00:04:32.449> of<00:04:32.509> benefits

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
it as well and see what kind of benefits

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.670 
it as well and see what kind of benefits
we<00:04:33.050> can<00:04:33.080> get

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.960 

so<00:04:36.680> even<00:04:36.949> just<00:04:37.100> with<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.280> stock<00:04:37.520> clogs<00:04:37.819> we

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
so even just with the stock clogs we

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.159 
so even just with the stock clogs we
managed<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.240> drop<00:04:38.449> our<00:04:38.630> temperatures<00:04:38.900> by

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
managed to drop our temperatures by

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.930 
managed to drop our temperatures by
about<00:04:39.319> 10<00:04:39.620> degrees<00:04:39.740> hopefully<00:04:40.669> that<00:04:40.819> will

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
about 10 degrees hopefully that will

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.670 
about 10 degrees hopefully that will
carry<00:04:41.150> over<00:04:41.240> when<00:04:41.569> we<00:04:41.720> overclock<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.229> will<00:04:42.530> see

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
carry over when we overclock it will see

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.170 
carry over when we overclock it will see
just<00:04:43.009> as<00:04:43.130> much<00:04:43.280> if<00:04:43.460> not<00:04:43.490> more<00:04:43.639> of<00:04:44.090> an
