so<00:02:28.610> Microsoft<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.720> adopting<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.440> new

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
so Microsoft that is adopting a new

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.830 
so Microsoft that is adopting a new
design<00:02:30.980> language<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:32.090> know<00:02:32.180> Windows<00:02:32.480> 8<00:02:32.690> you

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
design language you know Windows 8 you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.890 
design language you know Windows 8 you
can<00:02:32.959> see<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.410> style<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.129> flat<00:02:34.810> lots<00:02:35.810> of

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
can see that the style is flat lots of

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.130 
can see that the style is flat lots of
colors<00:02:36.319> big<00:02:36.830> squares<00:02:37.519> tiles<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:38.540> moving

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
colors big squares tiles it's moving

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.009 
colors big squares tiles it's moving
it's<00:02:39.680> such<00:02:40.069> big<00:02:40.580> typography<00:02:41.540> actually<00:02:41.930> it's

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
it's such big typography actually it's

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.890 
it's such big typography actually it's
not<00:02:42.110> really<00:02:42.170> flat<00:02:42.680> its<00:02:42.950> gradients<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:44.720> can

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
not really flat its gradients you can

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900 
not really flat its gradients you can
understand<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.590> Microsoft<00:02:46.069> is<00:02:46.099> going<00:02:46.489> into

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
understand that Microsoft is going into

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.660 
understand that Microsoft is going into
a<00:02:47.150> certain<00:02:47.690> place<00:02:47.959> draw<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> whole<00:02:48.950> company

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
a certain place draw the whole company

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.550 
a certain place draw the whole company
so<00:02:49.849> you<00:02:49.940> can<00:02:50.060> see<00:02:50.180> what<00:02:50.299> Xbox<00:02:50.840> Windows<00:02:51.260> Phone

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
so you can see what Xbox Windows Phone

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.880 
so you can see what Xbox Windows Phone
Bing<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:53.269> Windows<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.959> course<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.680> they're

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
Bing and Windows of course that they're

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.039 
Bing and Windows of course that they're
going<00:02:55.220> with<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.549> certain<00:02:55.970> style<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:56.690> we<00:02:56.900> need

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
going with to a certain style so we need

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.539 
going with to a certain style so we need
to<00:02:57.170> respect<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.590> style<00:02:57.950> because<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.430> is

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
to respect that style because this is

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.030 
to respect that style because this is
one<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.819> Microsoft's<00:02:59.000> laws<00:02:59.599> law<00:03:00.530> number<00:03:00.680> three

it<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.829> have<00:03:21.920> myself<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:23.269> surface<00:03:24.049> pro<00:03:24.410> 2<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:25.430> this

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
it I have myself a surface pro 2 so this

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.129 
it I have myself a surface pro 2 so this
is<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> tablet<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.079> I<00:03:27.109> can<00:03:27.350> just<00:03:27.560> switch<00:03:27.859> it<00:03:27.889> to

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
is a tablet but I can just switch it to

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.569 
is a tablet but I can just switch it to
whatever<00:03:30.139> I<00:03:30.230> won't<00:03:30.590> see<00:03:30.859> there's<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.160> tablet

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
whatever I won't see there's a tablet

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.879 
whatever I won't see there's a tablet
either<00:03:32.299> it's<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.630> laptop<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.440> plug<00:03:33.590> in<00:03:33.769> it

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
either it's a laptop and plug in it

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.250 
either it's a laptop and plug in it
becomes<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.220> whole<00:03:34.450> workstation<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:35.930> can't

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
becomes a whole workstation so I can't

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.370 
becomes a whole workstation so I can't
really<00:03:36.410> have<00:03:36.560> two<00:03:36.769> OSS<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.549> boot<00:03:37.790> on<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:39.200> that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
really have two OSS to boot on so that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.319 
really have two OSS to boot on so that
doesn't<00:03:39.590> really<00:03:39.709> work<00:03:40.040> but<00:03:40.430> Windows<00:03:41.120> they

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
doesn't really work but Windows they

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.180 
doesn't really work but Windows they
need<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.900> work<00:03:42.079> on<00:03:42.290> those<00:03:42.530> two<00:03:42.799> types<00:03:43.010> of

need to work on those two types of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.400 
need to work on those two types of
devices<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:44.420> is<00:03:44.630> where<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.019> confusion

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
devices this is where the confusion

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.659 
devices this is where the confusion
begins<00:03:45.889> with<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.160> current<00:03:46.400> version<00:03:46.609> of
