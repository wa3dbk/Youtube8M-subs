00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280 
down think of it logically hopefully and
come<00:03:32.909> up<00:03:33.030> with<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.209> better<00:03:33.419> solution<00:03:33.629> I'm<00:03:34.079> just

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
come up with a better solution I'm just

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
come up with a better solution I'm just
saying<00:03:34.530> there's<00:03:34.889> no<00:03:35.129> reason<00:03:35.549> why<00:03:35.669> Brock

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
saying there's no reason why Brock

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.740 
saying there's no reason why Brock
Lesnar<00:03:36.359> should<00:03:36.569> not<00:03:36.840> or<00:03:37.139> should<00:03:37.949> walk<00:03:38.159> out

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
Lesnar should not or should walk out

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.619 
Lesnar should not or should walk out
there's<00:03:39.750> no<00:03:39.870> reason<00:03:40.139> why<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.319> lesser<00:03:40.620> should

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
there's no reason why a lesser should

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.159 
there's no reason why a lesser should
not<00:03:42.629> walk<00:03:42.870> out<00:03:43.109> as<00:03:43.409> the<00:03:44.400> champion<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.180> I

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169
