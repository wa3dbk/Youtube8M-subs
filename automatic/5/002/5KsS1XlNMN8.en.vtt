00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 You do not have to go much for the VW passat 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 say it has been around for 40 years now 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.240
 seven generations means that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.490
 and 22 million car buyers have joined 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 for this car in the world time 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.720
 decided now generation 8 comes up 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.250
 the market yes and the question is what 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.199
 distinguishes the generation respect 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.180
 generation seven answer completely 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.500
 basically everything vw has one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 completely new car on the wheels 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.899
 posed 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.059
 and that with certainty 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.559
 bestseller will become why that is so 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.250
 that look at us now in one 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250
 small driving report 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 already at first glance is the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.390
 new passat and a fresh design 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 stains 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 Of course he falls immediately 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 Italian police in the eye clear that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.280
 the new passat in the future again 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.260
 a proven police car will be 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.750
 at least the two Italians have 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.059
 The law enforcer determines her in the evening 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.400
 boss a new company request 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.260
 laid the desk 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 Without question, the new wolfsburger is one 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 optical blast 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.150
 he looks fresh and very athletic 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.189
 however, the designers have that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.509
 get the car a timeless 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.460
 to give elegance 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.860
 the optical appearance is that even 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.080
 driver of a bmw threesome or one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.380
 mercedes c class can convince and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.880
 becomes the completely newly developed suspension 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.520
 contributes to the increased 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.770
 driving fun no matter if empty or full 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.850
 laden is the new passat and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.740
 sovereign on the street 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.750
 could take in a clear 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.119
 bigger and heavier car on the road 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.729
 the passat knows how to be 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.409
 predecessor whole 85 kilo lighter 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.759
 become 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.710
 the assumption that one in one 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.600
 upper class car is still on the way 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.880
 bigger when the many assistant systems 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.799
 on board, these cares are more 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.200
 but also for a lot more 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.810
 comfort, for example, is the first time 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.759
 trailer it is available from the beginner 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.190
 and trailer professionals the annoying 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.140
 reversing decisively relieved 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.000
 when an airbus with a joystick 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.190
 can control why then actually 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.170
 not a trailer team excited that 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.610
 you really just stand up the park 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.610
 decide wizards 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.209
 we go there or not we look 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.840
 leave the foot very light on the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.519
 brake the vehicle wagon normally 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.780
 rest that fits really great or 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.590
 imaginable with our forest exactly that 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.590
 wanted to bring eco 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.090
 with the four- wheel drive 4motion is the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.280
 new passat also on snowy 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.490
 mountain roads and lanes in his 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.400
 element 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.870
 Whom that still matters in all terrain 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.970
 is not enough until the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.500
 next year wait then matures vw 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.670
 the ontrack variant with more 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.050
 Ground clearance after it is noticeable that it 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.240
 the developers made it again 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.960
 have the quality impression in the cockpit 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.580
 to improve 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.130
 the materials would be repeated 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.290
 higher quality than the predecessor for 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.390
 families was the huge space 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.220
 a very important selling point 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.660
 the engineers actually have it there 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.790
 managed with the same external dimensions 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.300
 noticeably more space in the interior too 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.280
 create 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.550
 possible is the space gain by a 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.930
 grown wheelbase there is the passat 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.630
 continue, of course, in two 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.400
 Body variants next to the variant 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.590
 is a hatchback in the program 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.280
 both differ only by one 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.810
 another tail and room for luggage 586 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.380
 liters of cargo space are on one 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.380
 side 650 liters of luggage on the other 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.670
 that was our departure with the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.340
 new passat in sardinia 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.049
 Well, my resume is number 8 can 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.879
 actually everything at least one piece 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.799
 better than number seven so in mine 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.640
 eyes, this passat is the most complete 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.640
 passat that ever existed
