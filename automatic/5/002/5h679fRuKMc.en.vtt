practice<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.689> pretty<00:01:06.840> clear

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
practice well I think it's pretty clear

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
practice well I think it's pretty clear
that<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.950> need<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.369> doing<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.820> taking

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that what we need to be doing is taking

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
that what we need to be doing is taking
a<00:01:09.330> hard<00:01:09.540> look<00:01:09.810> at<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.200> student<00:01:10.710> data<00:01:10.950> tells

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a hard look at what student data tells

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 
a hard look at what student data tells
us<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.790> our<00:01:11.970> own<00:01:12.000> needs<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> making<00:01:13.439> sure

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
us about our own needs and making sure

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260 
us about our own needs and making sure
that<00:01:13.830> our<00:01:13.890> professional<00:01:14.640> development<00:01:14.670> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that our professional development is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
that our professional development is

now<00:01:17.970> these<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.420> two<00:01:18.659> bullets<00:01:19.110> seem<00:01:19.320> pretty

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
now these first two bullets seem pretty

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.440

of<00:03:40.900> systemic<00:03:41.470> change<00:03:41.770> is<00:03:42.160> all<00:03:42.550> teachers<00:03:42.940> using

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
of systemic change is all teachers using

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.390 
of systemic change is all teachers using

study professional learning in the
learning<00:04:21.989> profession<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.370> think<00:04:23.759> it's<00:04:24.000> an

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
learning profession and I think it's an

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.840 
learning profession and I think it's an
absolutely<00:04:25.080> wonderful<00:04:25.610> summary<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.729> the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
absolutely wonderful summary of the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.760 
absolutely wonderful summary of the
research<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.660> just<00:04:27.870> looked<00:04:28.169> at<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.470> the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
research that we just looked at on the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.620 
research that we just looked at on the
last<00:04:28.979> slide<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.580> why<00:04:30.120> don't<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.389> take<00:04:30.600> a

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
last slide so why don't you take a

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:41.129 
last slide so why don't you take a
second<00:04:31.139> now<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.620> read<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.370> quote

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:49.189 

you

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.320 

so<00:04:50.199> this<00:04:50.470> slide<00:04:50.830> really<00:04:51.129> gives<00:04:52.000> us<00:04:52.150> some

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
so this slide really gives us some

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.600 
so this slide really gives us some
insight<00:04:52.870> into<00:04:53.379> the<00:04:53.650> relationship<00:04:53.830> between

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
the kind of training or learning the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.960 
the kind of training or learning the
teachers<00:04:57.069> are<00:04:57.220> going<00:04:57.340> through<00:04:57.639> and<00:04:57.849> its

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
teachers are going through and its

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.420 
teachers are going through and its
impact<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.629> classroom<00:04:59.039> let's<00:05:00.039> start<00:05:00.310> on

the<00:05:00.550> left<00:05:00.759> hand<00:05:01.030> side<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.659> let's<00:05:01.930> look<00:05:02.169> at

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
the left hand side and let's look at

there's<00:05:07.720> some<00:05:07.960> exposure<00:05:08.349> to<00:05:08.680> theory<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.340> then

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
there's some exposure to theory and then

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.210 
there's some exposure to theory and then
some<00:05:10.539> opportunity<00:05:11.349> to<00:05:11.379> try<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:11.889> put<00:05:12.069> that
