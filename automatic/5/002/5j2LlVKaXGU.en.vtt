 the port of rotterdam is a cargo ship stuck at a stand of it 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.840
 due to the high load of gigantic crane and and the jobs themselves no longer 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.230
 getting away it is waiting for behind the wheel and the chinese ship's boats 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 can enter the port 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.260
 this is not only an eye catcher but due to the huge increase in the wind catch 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.160
 Sunday is different on the ground there was no stopping 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.070

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.550
 In addition, giving is that of these are thus a spokesperson 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.400

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.370
 he tries he is arrested and is by the state and that did not work 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.520

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.910
 Vlaardingen and the Netherlands is not permitted 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.359
 an employee of the technical requirements brought to the table 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.510
 to go through all this for a rescue attempt 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.080
 because the strongest activist keeps the 33 crew members on board safely 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.150
 according to later, the afternoon was not fully booked on the part of the sandbar 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.180
 to pull 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.360

 serious proposals this is a big problem to solve 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.650
 unfortunately 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.530
 on the other hand, the number of seats off the coast has been declining in recent years 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.580
 at least 17 people in traffic are system street where the mood of the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.340
 coast guard 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
