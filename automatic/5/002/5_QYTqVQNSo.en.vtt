00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.970
 snow and ice 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.110
 when the first snowflakes fall the parliament becomes very slippery 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.179
 when the snow freezes it becomes ice 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.970
 to improve the adherence and avoid the landslides we must 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.999
 have the tires and brakes in good condition 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.789
 circulate through the rolling of other vehicles 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 reduce speed increase the safety distance and drive smoothly without 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.100
 sudden movements on the direction 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.160
 on ascending slopes the sustained speed must be raised and in a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.840
 the highest gear ratio that can reasonably be employed 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.050
 on downward slopes it will slowly lower in a gear ratio 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.700
 shorter than usual for you to brake the engine and avoid thinking the brake 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.340
 service 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 to start the vehicle on snow the wheels skid psv so the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.800
 driver could bury the wheels in a straight line and start in a 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640
 Gear ratio as high as possible 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.799
 When the use of chains and other authorized devices is mandatory 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 tires with nails is convenient to place them on all wheels of the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.549
 vehicle 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.619
 although only its placement on the driving wheels is mandatory 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.140
 that is to say to each wheel of the motor shaft 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.060
 When the obligation to use these devices disappears, they must be 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.170
 remove because they damage the pavement the cushioning and deteriorate 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.980
 tires 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.430
 it can be expected the existence of ice when temperatures are very low 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.640
 during the night and early in the morning especially in shady areas 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.820
 humid and valleys with a lot of vegetation 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.810
 the existence of ice is observed because the direction becomes and cerati very 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.740
 soft 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.460
 in the case of ice the braking distance can increase up to 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.869
 ten times more than normal if you have and if you travel and you think you can 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.159
 deny it is convenient to take the full fuel tank 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.880
 food and warm clothes in case it gets blocked
