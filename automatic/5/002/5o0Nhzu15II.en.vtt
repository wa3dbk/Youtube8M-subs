00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 all we want too and how to checkmate and so 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.029
 small video how to edit 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.799
 customer core 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.050
 first we need to do so 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.570
 He reappeared on the desktop and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.660
 more precisely his hard drive on which he 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.910
 it is done very easily in that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.279
 pubs who call there 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.680
 Here is a text file called 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.660
 effe team 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.460
 enter the bottom one here is this command where in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.820
 terminal open the terminal here and just 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.370
 here we copy what we see we see 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 here the mapping of our hard drives and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 here we are interested in this efi disk 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.620
 or rather its markup here it is indicated 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.219
 Drive to 0 of 1 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.739
 remember this line and this line 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.629
 we have to copy here in this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.129
 gap 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.219
 then when we copied this line 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.219
 we completely select the whole team 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.109
 including our just copied 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.500
 markup volume and re-enter here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.689
 terminal and so what we see on our 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.640
 a hard disk appeared on the desktop and 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.640
 Finn open it open folder carpet 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.830
 open the cupcake folder I have little then 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.890
 one i open 10 8 who have maverick 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.049
 opens 10 9 what we see here we are 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.259
 see cake cake cake 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.610
 smc this cupcake supermarket it must 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.939
 for all and no matter what you have 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.060
 processor or motherboard and we see 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.220
 text for my network card let's say if 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.350
 you will need to put the text for 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.390
 sound card you will be like here for 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.579
 sound card for wi-fi and the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.880
 like that is, all save 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.009
 here is the first thing I want to say second 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.899
 last video I showed these 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.820
 drivers of choices drivers of efi 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.040
 I want to say that first they 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.469
 universal time no matter what you have 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.619
 motherboard asus gigabit other 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.240
 model gigabit on the drum they 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.390
 universal and not needed only for 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.450
 start poppy and so if you have any 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 modern board which has a biosphere 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.510
 with wi-fi support, you just stupidly choose 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.819
 like on my previous video video 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.790
 check the same checkboxes and I can 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.540
 quietly boot without problems so yet 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.980
 I want to say this file carpet 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.090
 config what I showed in the previous one 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.250
 I edited the video, too, two words here 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.459
 these are all one thousand and one tick stabbing 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.590
 so don't be afraid i am what i left i am 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.230
 indicated my previous video I consider 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.209
 what are these normal parameters which 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.720
 suitable for all the only thing 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.579
 the difference here is this multiplex value you 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.790
 will put your dependence on 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.140
 your processor and also the purity of your 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 cpu right here you'll be 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.610
 prescribe depending on frequency 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.630
 your processor to prescribe this data 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.690
 must necessarily 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.360
 otherwise the carpet will work let's say 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.849
 your processor will run at half strength 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.709
 it's available working one hundred percent no 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.560
 In no case should you write more than 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.150
 indicated on the manufacturer’s website either in 3 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.519
 programs that I showed we 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.030
 removed the report efficiency 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.620
 if you put and more either here or 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.170
 here you just hit this your 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.700
 the processor here it is not overclocking it is about 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.250
 ordinary regular settings here are the cupcakes 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.319
 we stored I showed where it is 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.630
 Basically anything with super well after 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.400
 edit again to open 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.950
 text editor enter this one 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.470
 last bottom command 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.769
 enter it again in the terminal hour I'll beat 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.410
 all drive disappeared desktop system 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.920
 again he doesn’t see him like that 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.560
 you can edit your carpet 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.819
 repeating muffins all universal 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.690
 the only thing is that in the cupcake folder you will 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.359
 add your own 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.200
 here and cupcakes for installation which in 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:04.280
 folder aired they are the same for everyone but here 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.280
 actually all thanks to all
