00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.140
 clint hello friends of systems uma in 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.169
 this time we are going to do the review 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:19.250
 of an ex spice team five models 55 2 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:23.090
 px 675 is a one 15.6 laptop 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.770
 inch touch screen as we can 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.890
 see indicator used keyboard 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.030
 complete is a model that comes in this 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 red color wine a very nice color 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.000
 we see that this new line continues 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 ve5 series models these tones 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.390
 metallic 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.670
 without becoming very beautiful bright 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.390
 well in the opposite we see that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.690
 it incorporates absolutely nothing of 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.860
 connectors 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.050
 It is a slim model 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.470
 It is heavy by size 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.180
 on the side we see that it has its 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.680
 audio connector sd card reader 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.620
 USB 2.0 port and we have it 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.480
 in the part of him 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.980
 this other side we see that here is 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.440
 hidden what is the button 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.080
 on I have my capable of not me 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.970
 like to be so hidden port usb 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.330
 2.0 also and in the back we see 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.640
 that has power sockets 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.110
 we see that it incorporates in this case two 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.360
 ventilation ventilation hdmi thunder 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.280
 bold usb 3.0 rj45 connector in this almost 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.550
 so clever here so little to connect the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.810
 cable and since it 's where bolt this 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.070
 model calls us special attention 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.480
 why 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.590
 incorporates its converter 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.590
 what is it 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.220
 of gea 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.490
 all right 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.730
 well as we can see is a keyboard 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.850
 backlit is a full keyboard 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:34.510
 with keyboard mexico has a good 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.470
 processor to gm 10 in this case a 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:45.200
 quad-core processor 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:52.459
 well at 2.5 gigahertz incorporates what is 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:56.470
 graphics radeon hd 86 50 g with 2 with 512 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.100
 of own video memory 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.100
 I dont know 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.720
 and as we see touch screen and like 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.569
 than in other models of this series of 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.849
 this size is very easy to use the 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.510
 video touch screen 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.920
 practically to the great size that has 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.580
 it's a good screen hd here we have the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.190
 specifications tells us 2.5 you arrive 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.730
 but using what is the mode that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.730
 have these devices reach the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.730
 3.5 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.670
 we see that it comes with six girls from 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.180
 war and obviously it's 64 operational 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.620
 bits 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:50.900
 these 64 well as far as the hard drive is 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.659
 a disk 29 750 GB and obviously includes 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.920
 wifi includes bluetooth in this case the 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:00.700
 vote assumes it is 4.0 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.360
 4 cell battery 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.360
 all right 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.830
 is 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:15.880
 the version that has windows comes with 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.680
 windows 8 not 8.1 bring 8.1 well as well 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.400
 than the other teams of 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.550
 of this brand incorporates access to the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.520
 cloud 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.230
 in the cloud of it I made some 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.810
 other apps 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.410
 that are pre-loaded 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.460
 as we see in all the equipment of 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:44.690
 respectfully that also windows 8 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.669
 well fine then as you said in the 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.229
 touch screen that responds very 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.229
 we have good 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.780
 the size is ideal and something that we liked 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.970
 is this here is to be power button and 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.850
 comes in this model in another model 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.289
 that verifies that we check that does not come 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:11.050
 truth presses and you're good to be 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.110
 power button because you are power button is a 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.900
 sensor is an application that is 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.800
 simply a direct access to 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.530
 options to turn off block suspend 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.599
 hibernate and restart and we can 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:31.300
 configure what the button can do 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:34.120
 leave it yes then it is very practical and 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.849
 takes away this question of having this 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.339
 April camps 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.629
 and up the chaos and the configuration and 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:42.559
 from there select what it is that 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:46.439
 we want to do is more practical to 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:48.419
 implement the solution that the 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:51.419
 most of the fact to greater all 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:55.469
 Windows 8 users want and 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:59.039
 they need quick way easy way 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:02.669
 Simple to turn off the computer incorporates 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:06.869
 obviously also what is 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:09.240
 the backup system in othÃ³n and many 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:11.419
 other applications that come by 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.419
 default 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.210
 it is a very good team very good 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:20.009
 characteristics is a very good 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.580
 investment too 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.580
 and 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.850
 and well then, all this happens 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.300
 team if we have opportunity to 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.930
 buy it from acquiring it well is a 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.240
 good option 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.450
 the security of the sound system and 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.760
 the dolby sound system if you really 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.850
 I do not have to pay for the sound system 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.710
 beats HP equipment but go and 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.790
 we have good sound quality 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:51.620
 well, well, it's more I'm going to pay 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.620
 from here he is very ready 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.910
 Well, that's all for the moment 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:01.400
 I hope you have served this video and 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.400
 Well, you know if 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:09.290
 if they are looking for a good team 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.970
 this is a good court until later and 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.630
 as always we wait for the doubts 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.630
