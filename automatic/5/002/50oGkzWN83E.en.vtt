building the basic projects in
traditional<00:00:26.710> woodworking<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:28.199> among<00:00:29.199> those

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
traditional woodworking so among those

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.939 
traditional woodworking so among those
in<00:00:29.830> this<00:00:30.039> video<00:00:30.910> is<00:00:31.240> a<00:00:31.720> miter<00:00:32.080> box<00:00:32.379> and<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.739> miter

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
in this video is a miter box and a miter

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.939 
in this video is a miter box and a miter
box<00:00:33.160> saw<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.600> what<00:00:35.019> is<00:00:35.110> what<00:00:35.530> does<00:00:35.620> this<00:00:35.710> do

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
box saw so what is what does this do

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.900 
box saw so what is what does this do
well<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.699> miter<00:00:37.330> box<00:00:37.570> is<00:00:37.960> really<00:00:38.650> useful<00:00:39.160> for

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
well a miter box is really useful for

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.620 
well a miter box is really useful for
cutting<00:00:40.390> wood<00:00:41.910> cross-cutting<00:00:42.910> wood<00:00:43.180> across

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
cutting wood cross-cutting wood across

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.209 
cutting wood cross-cutting wood across
the<00:00:44.290> grain<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.719> for<00:00:46.960> example<00:00:47.410> if<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:47.980> want<00:00:48.160> to

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
the grain so for example if you want to

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.279 
the grain so for example if you want to
cut<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> really<00:00:48.730> accurate<00:00:51.180> end<00:00:52.180> on<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:52.960> board

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
cut a really accurate end on this board

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.310 
cut a really accurate end on this board
you<00:00:53.829> would<00:00:54.730> use<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:54.940> miter<00:00:55.180> box<00:00:55.420> saw<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:56.020> set<00:00:56.200> it

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
you would use a miter box saw and set it

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.590 
you would use a miter box saw and set it
to<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.710> 90<00:00:57.100> degrees<00:00:57.460> but<00:00:58.030> then<00:00:58.210> it's<00:00:58.390> also

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
to the 90 degrees but then it's also

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.930 
to the 90 degrees but then it's also
really<00:00:59.020> useful<00:00:59.050> when<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.160> loosen<00:01:00.489> it<00:01:00.640> up<00:01:00.730> and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
really useful when you loosen it up and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.920 
really useful when you loosen it up and
you<00:01:01.000> can<00:01:01.120> set<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.510> another<00:01:02.199> another<00:01:03.010> angle

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you can set it to another another angle

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.230 
you can set it to another another angle
such<00:01:04.930> as<00:01:05.050> a<00:01:05.080> 45<00:01:05.649> degree<00:01:05.860> angle<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:07.090> can

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
such as a 45 degree angle and you can

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.570 
such as a 45 degree angle and you can
cut<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.479> miter<00:01:07.810> or<00:01:08.080> something<00:01:08.440> like<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:08.590> so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
cut a miter or something like that so

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.980 
cut a miter or something like that so
for<00:01:09.910> example<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.300> for<00:01:10.420> making<00:01:10.570> picture

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
for example you for making picture

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.480 
for example you for making picture
frames<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.500> it's<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.770> really<00:01:12.250> really

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
frames and it's a really really

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.760 
frames and it's a really really
excellent<00:01:12.970> tool<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.930> be<00:01:13.960> found<00:01:14.080> really<00:01:14.439> cheap

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
excellent tool can be found really cheap

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.000 
excellent tool can be found really cheap
