00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
finished so it's getting close but the

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.270 
finished so it's getting close but the
coolest<00:02:28.319> part<00:02:28.440> about<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.519> head

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
coolest part about this is the head

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.920 
coolest part about this is the head
it<00:02:35.280> looks<00:02:35.460> really<00:02:35.760> good<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.560> that's<00:02:37.560> not<00:02:37.740> it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
it looks really good but that's not it

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.670 
it looks really good but that's not it
because<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.380> did<00:02:40.950> install<00:02:41.190> an<00:02:41.370> LED<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
because I did install an LED in it and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.610 
because I did install an LED in it and
it<00:02:44.610> looks<00:02:44.819> really<00:02:45.180> nice<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:50.190> all<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.760> do<00:02:50.940> is

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
it looks really nice and all you do is

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.220 
it looks really nice and all you do is
you<00:02:52.620> press<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.010> button<00:02:53.280> right<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:54.540> turn

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410

mod<00:02:58.920> because<00:02:59.490> uh<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:01.350> chest<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.760> actually

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
mod because uh the chest of the actually

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.030 
mod because uh the chest of the actually
is<00:03:03.209> pretty<00:03:03.450> hollow<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.230> I'll<00:03:04.350> had<00:03:04.530> all<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.890> had

to do was drill away a couple of pegs

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.170 
to do was drill away a couple of pegs
that<00:03:11.280> hold<00:03:11.340> back<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.750> back<00:03:12.930> into<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:14.180> let

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
that hold back the back into it and let

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:25.479
