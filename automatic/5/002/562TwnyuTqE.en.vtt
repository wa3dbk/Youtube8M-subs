 and edifier and his professional press of the day

 lit and ends and now on this base I 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.449
 I will do block staining with bright 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.019

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.210
 color i am now for my hair and i will not 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.340
 use conditioner so how to paint 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.590
 I will be a petitioner power a power and 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.809
 applied on clean pre-washed 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.510
 wet hair today i will do 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.090
 block coloring in two colors is 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.700
 purple color is columbus here 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.219
 contains 20 percent pigment and 80 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.739
 percent care and dye power 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.860
 blue here is the opposite 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.500
 80 percent pigment and 20 percent 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.070
 departures I prepared head models and 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.560
 parting and zigzag lower part 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.609
 I will dye my hair blue above 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.189
 I'll repeat 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:11.679
 silhouette of parting and hair coloring 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.539
 purple so I 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.849
 get strands of two colors 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.759
 blue strand and it will overlap 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:21.609
 strand of pink and purple i 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.969
 squeezed dyes and the most pleasant in 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.020
 the fact that they really convey color 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.450
 finally that is if you want 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.179
 get purple he so juicy 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.849
 looks just like hair and blue 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.340
 The first thing I do is blue 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:39.039
 I apply the blue color to the previously highlighted 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.399
 zones paint needs to be applied as much as possible 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.649
 careful not foaming because back 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.840
 you can dilute the concentration 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.299
 pigment dye response must 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.460
 stay tight so i 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.799
 I paint over 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 not highlighted triangles on top i 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.960
 repeat the parting and about more beautiful 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.150
 only in a different color I covered earlier 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.860
 dyed foil hair to 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.740
 two colors are not imprinted 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.900
 and now I'll part the same 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.130
 silhouette of a triangle and caused the same 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.190
 purple dye 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.970
 I separated the new zone and this parting 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.610
 repeated 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.440
 previous staining zone but here i am 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.280
 working with another pigment it 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.239
 purple color and i'm very neat 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.239
 apply pigment 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.470
 Yes 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.730
 I remind you that caused the second zone 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 purple silhouette of the parting 2 zone 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.609
 exactly repeats the silhouette of the first zone 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.489
 the first zone was blue 2 pink 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:54.099
 purple now we are 15 minutes 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.670
 wash off without air conditioning and look at 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.549
 result 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.840
 than i like the color of the power cans here 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.060
 if he is purple 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.430
 it is clear that he purple you immediately 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.889
 you get the result exactly the same if he 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.519
 blue is immediately visible the color is really very 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:12.310
 bright blue is a big plus in 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.739
 staining at first I washed away purple a 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.290
 then already printed out and washed away and not me 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.569
 my head is just not using water 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.010
 shampoo or conditioner and then we 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.010
 look at the result 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.599
 I can say that I am very pleased 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.930
 because colors are cool and short 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.879
 haircuts they look even cooler and here 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.730
 really now that moment when i 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.310
 I understand that I am ready, I also want to now 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.659
 I'll twist my hair and the strands will open again 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.450
 more and we will have the opportunity 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.359
 see them moving i just lightly 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.549
 twisting the strands from the face strands not 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.340
 there should be such ironed 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.230
 smooth dome curls I wanted 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.560
