00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.299
 thank you very much for buying a product to reiterate 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.460
 inside the box have not coastal robocop which you have bought you will find 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.610
 nano cupper with double rotor built in material resistant to falls that 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.090
 they usually occur during flights 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.720
 an infrared control station a replacement elite rear rotor 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.280
 and an instruction manual in Spanish 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.920
 The Nano Coastal Rococo Perez is a micro remote control helicopter 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.080
 to fly inside mainly due to the station's 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.200
 infrared that is used for its control 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 Its use is recommended for boys and girls from 10 years old although it can 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.690
 be used by a younger child supervised by an adult 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 as a main feature this nanako but is controlled by a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.040
 two-channel station which allows to control the height in the direction 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 the robo copper station has two bands av 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.700
 this allows us to select the frequency of our helicopter and allows 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.090
 other helicopters of different frequencies can fly at the same time 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.200
 Different color in each model differentiates the frequency 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.570
 in the bottom of the helicopter in the plastic base you will observe next to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.080
 the letters ch the frequency that fernando lamb has is very important that 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.900
 do not remove is the plastic base of tunan the butler robber cooper since that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 would affect the stability and resistance of the helicopter 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.750
 before starting to fly tuna crazy but robocop erc and every time you fall to the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.250
 floor you must adjust the elites so that they do not collide with each other to adjust them 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.340
 you must grab each rotor with one hand and remove them until you align the two arrows 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.330
 that there are drawn in each of the blades the arrows of benestar 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.500
 pointing to each other 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.710
 When you have your narco but totally adjusted begin to perform the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.530
 first flights 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.040
 choose an area of ​​your house without hindrance to be able to fly final or 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 cupper and avoid drafts fans or lamps that would affect 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.130
 negatively the flight of it 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.010
 It is convenient to close the windows of the room where you are going to start 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.409
 to fly your first goal should be to try to have a cup by your side 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.500
 meter more or less from the ground only when you have achieved this starts to 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.739
 directing it to the left or right with the steering lever is 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.069
 lever that will serve for you nano cupper to move to the left or the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.129
 right 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.859
 the coastal nano robber cooper 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.539
 incorporates technology chase in the air this technology allows to 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.469
 through uleta bulb on the front of the helicopter emit a light 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.419
 infrared that when seen received by the receiver of the rival helicopter makes 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.299
 lost connection temporarily and went out of control for a brief period of time 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.089
 weather 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.219
 when receiving a second shot it returns to destabilize although during 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.979
 a few more seconds 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.439
 to the third shot 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.119
 the hit helicopter loses control completely and falls 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.569
 the adversary must turn off and on again his helicopter to restart 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.119
 the flight 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.879
 so that the shot has effectiveness in the rival the helicopter that shoots 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.729
 must be pointing to the rival facing him in front and the opponent does not 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:05.469
 must be more than two meters but it is advisable that it is not over 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.099
 one meter away 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.719
 as the shot is a beam of infrared light the proximity of the 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.719
 helicopters to other intense light sources can affect the effectiveness of the 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.909
 shot and sometimes not working properly 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.859
 the combat between helicopters pursuit must always be between a 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.650
 crazy but broadband and a no pandas b but if you can not fly both 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.449
 at the same time the ray after shot only current the coastal nano chase 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.950
 and does not affect other hand cupbearers in this system all nano cuppers with a 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.819
 persecution mode can fight each other as long as they are different 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.870
 bands like this a robocop erc can make a fight against the crazy but without 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.439
 falcon and city sects 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.689
 some practical tips for the correct operation of tuna loco 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.180
 but what little to do if you did not cooperate is charged the station 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.799
 turned on and in anaco but it does not work again check that the panda channel 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.099
 selected is the correct one 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.379
 Always keep the tulle's rear propeller clean and cup any 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.379
 little fluff can lower the performance of it 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.089
 In the case of breaking or cracking it you can easily change it 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.259
 extract the ancient elite carefully and introduce the new one in the same way 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.680
 you should let it rest for ten minutes it was short but since the completion 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.389
 of the homeland to make a new charge this advice so that the battery 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.220
 that lasts much longer 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.970
 You will be able to acquire all kinds of spare parts the icesi helicopters of 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.880
 Replacement on the web www dot turn toys dotcom you will find other tips from 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.880
 very important safety in the instruction manual 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 this bilateral appointment 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.799
 but this time
