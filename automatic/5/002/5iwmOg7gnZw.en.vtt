00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.400
 spent in three sets 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.400

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.990
 answer a match against milos or against 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.180
 any server of its caliber 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 against the few guys who serve 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.809
 as well as him after him there is no 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.210
 doubt is nerves and karlovic 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.480
 it's players who have a huge 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.449
 Extremely accurate service extremely 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 powerful and suddenly it's very difficult 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:58.170
 to do anything you have to be 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.239
 very regular very strong mentally and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.890
 to prepare for the first 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.850
 opportunities when they arise 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.250
 you have to know how to seize it was very 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 important to win the first set at 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 second it was very hooked on 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.310
 third set I felt more at 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.680
 comfortable and but overall even though 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.740
 it's a match in three sets it's 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.479
 played a few points and it was a bit 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.490
 what I was expecting I knew he 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.530
 was waiting for me on the court I knew he 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.119
 was going to serve with his very service 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.920
 powerful that I will not have much 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.270
 opportunities, but when it is 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.570
 would present I would have them 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:45.000
 immediately grasp question one says 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.640

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.590
 next match I do not want to think about 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.570
 a possible final I concentrate 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.069
 on gulbis he played a very beautiful one 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.069

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.750
 he is a formidable opponent but 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.709
 It's also true that I have a beautiful 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.200
 season on earth first in Rome and then 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.150
