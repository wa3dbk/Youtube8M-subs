00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 not only thinking about the game but 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.210
 because there are many conditioning factors 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.760
 from there it is logical that he say a 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 little what you think appropriate and take away a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.420
 little the pressure does not say that the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.690
 German players favorite though not 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.740

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.409
 In the net 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.410
 out there on the sides 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.410
 sometimes it is higher 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.819
 I really did not expect it to felix him 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.469
 could have done maybe play the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.090
 surprise to see what was coming to the network 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.709
 is forced to play lower than 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.489
 normal and now has the first serve 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.489

 his teacher but the call to the network

 yes but it's left denotes nerves in 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.210
 florian mayer what happens that after 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.830
 how he moves his hands there in the angle 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.540
 short here 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.350
 as you close your hands especially the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.600
 left 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.210
 Mayer is precipitated but he recovers 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.880
 a very hard situation 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.230
 and let's see now if you are surprised 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.470
 he plays them with the classic serve towards 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.470
 outside 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.859
 and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.290
 from inside to outside to line 40 to 30 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.800
 another match ball for Florian Mayer 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.449

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.400
 center of the track covering the 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.120
 right I think it has I think that 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.810
 has some florian Mayer cramps 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.770

 and the match is over 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.220
 how good the volley of him and what kind there is 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.220

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.610

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.889
 for celia it is more difficult to subtract from 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.389
 right that upside down with the reverse carries 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.310
