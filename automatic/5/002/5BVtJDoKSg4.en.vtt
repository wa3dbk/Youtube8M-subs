00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.460
 hi my dear followers my friends 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.150
 today I want to show you beautiful 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.519
 Autumn is a very topical type of manicure with 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.199
 using transfer foil is very 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:23.019
 interesting so no base needed 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.699
 the fixer here is such a little bit of it 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.859
 nacre like orange 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 golden glitter overflow for 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:37.239
 autumn manicure that's such a shade 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.190
 black lacquer is a glue for transferable 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.390
 foil 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.840
 such a bottle it is sold before 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.989
 gold color transfer foil so 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:55.089
 let's start now i will cover the base coat 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.899
 your marigolds recently you have me 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:03.579
 asked the difference in base coverage 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:06.790
 finish is the same thing or 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.630
 that is, the question is whether 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.610
 meaning different likes whether it is possible 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.040
 replace with one varnish so that it is and 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.500
 base fixer look when i 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 I work with clients for base use 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:30.490
 foundation it has wellness 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:33.729
 Strengthening properties after I paint 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.270
 nail polish and at the end I cover 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 I also finish the finish line separately 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.369
 my dries serves as drying 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.709
 fixer 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.970
 that is, it gives shine when it dries 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.440
 does not tarnish 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.289
 what is the base for and what is needed for 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.299
 fixer base needed for alignment 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.810
 surfaces if you need to have 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.079
 base properties 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.160
 how would strengthen the healing of marigold 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.880
 then you buy here at the pharmacy there 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.180
 moth clever 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.340
 and for fixer you can both 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.250
 professional fixer buy so 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.310
 the very same you can buy and the usual one 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.670
 I look Moravian clear varnish if 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.010
 you do not need the properties that I tell you 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.170
 I mean you just buy 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.330
 clear varnish and you still apply 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.310
 put it like a base and put it on 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.310
 stage i take 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.569
 beautiful our shade of varnish 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.299
 Now I will apply on the nails 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.670
 one ton 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.150
 the first layer as always i do not 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.470
 thick thin layer 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.430
 very beautiful shade butt area not 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.329
 forget overlaps and now we wait until 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.130
 full drying varnish I put the second 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.130
 varnish coat 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.500
 and now wait until complete drying 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.970
 lacquer and so my friends now i take 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.050
 black and darling ok I'll put 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.050
 middle striped 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:05.360
 I take a piece of paper put black 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:09.430
 a drop of varnish take doses well ka I put 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.430
 so here are two droplets 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.400
 and on the middle finger is also applied for 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.400
 droplets 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.150
 now my friends i will wait for good 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.450
 dried black 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.650
 i take the glue then look when i 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.410
 I open the glue 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.010
 I have to thoroughly wet the brush 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.010
 I put on 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:09.749
 in this way when I put it on 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:14.279
 white but after 30 seconds 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:20.710
 the glue dries out and becomes 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:26.830
 transparent wait 30 seconds to glue 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:29.400
 became transparent and will translate 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.400
 foil 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.060
 if you have as you see me 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:22.810
 get in such small as 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:27.000
 excess yes that's good here here 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:30.160
 a little bit means we take a cotton swab 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.500
 wet a little bit just a drop here 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.150
 no acetone vova means a bit 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:40.180
 and without pressing on the surface of the varnish 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.570
 just ate touching here you see they 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.310
 disappear 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:51.270
 we remove but by no means 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:55.090
 We press so that we do not succeed 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.540
 so that was not visible to the nails so little 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.430
 of books 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:04.590
 wiped away that is so here just barely 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.590
 touch everything 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.759
 So 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.850
 everything will set all levels and cover 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:19.850
 finish line 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.319
 and what do I want to say 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:31.319
 that when the foil we cover the finish 

00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:40.479
 the foil becomes a little bit like that 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:44.469
 like under the crack of this it is absolutely not 

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:49.979
 spoils the view looks very nice all 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:55.269
 very effectively there is a varnish in my orly 

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:56.649
 which does not give this effect here 

00:07:55.269 --> 00:08:00.639
 Here is a beautiful manicure 

00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:04.240
 I was glad to share this with you 

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:07.379
