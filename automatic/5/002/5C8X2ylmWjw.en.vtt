time<00:00:42.690> line<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.559> Nintendo<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
time line is Nintendo you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
time line is Nintendo you
should<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.399> said<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.789> damage<00:00:45.180> control<00:00:45.539> all

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that crap but I really don't think it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.090 
that crap but I really don't think it
can<00:00:49.710> fit<00:00:50.010> anyway<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:50.969> particular<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.320> the

so when we're looking at the focus on

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.010 
so when we're looking at the focus on
the<00:04:42.640> Triforce<00:04:43.180> when<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:43.360> comes<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.570> tri<00:04:43.780> Force

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
the Triforce when it comes to tri Force

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.170 
the Triforce when it comes to tri Force
heroes<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.560> think<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.400> tri<00:04:45.580> Force<00:04:45.820> heroes<00:04:45.849> is

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
heroes I think that tri Force heroes is

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.270 
heroes I think that tri Force heroes is
actually<00:04:46.599> going<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.780> take<00:04:46.900> place<00:04:47.110> once<00:04:47.740> again

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
actually going to take place once again

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.460 
actually going to take place once again
in<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.940> downfall<00:04:49.479> timeline<00:04:49.720> your<00:04:50.080> other<00:04:50.200> just

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
in the downfall timeline your other just

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.230 
in the downfall timeline your other just
stacking<00:04:50.740> game<00:04:51.010> stacking<00:04:51.550> games<00:04:51.729> tags<00:04:52.060> and

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
stacking game stacking games tags and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.750 
stacking game stacking games tags and
games<00:04:52.419> so<00:04:52.810> tri<00:04:53.710> Force<00:04:53.950> heroes<00:04:53.979> probably<00:04:54.580> take

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
games so tri Force heroes probably take

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.850 
games so tri Force heroes probably take
place<00:04:54.910> in<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.270> downfall<00:04:55.720> timeline<00:04:55.870> where<00:04:56.680> the
