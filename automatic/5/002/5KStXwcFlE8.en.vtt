00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 Today there is my current beauty 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.190
 favorites 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.709
 hello you love today I want to show 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.510
 which products I have so last month 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.920
 the last one and a half months like 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.349
 used already in the middle of september 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.180
 but are aware of some things anyway 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.590
 It was not really great and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.480
 I want you to meet today 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.300
 I'll start with a procedure that 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.619
 is essens the candy shop papa the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.880
 is already almost empty we can see 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.349
 I have it for a while 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.960
 but increasingly used this month 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.879
 actually that's almost the whole time 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.620
 a very sweetish smell and me 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.850
 suddenly much does not last so long 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.050
 but I will still be after many 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.670
 hours were also addressed 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.739
 I guess you get used to it 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.629
 they are not expensive 34 euros and 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.699
 because the fund is really hard 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.780
 what animal experiment price to find and that 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.790
 Essens is definite 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.229
 Cruelty free and there I can 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.129
 In any case recommend old watch 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.320
 because they are really right 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.299
 cheap the next product is one 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.799
 loose care of unique I have from 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.570
 a while get sent 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.640
 but think it's really cool because they just 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.260
 Different things do not do that 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.590
 for example, have no parabens in it 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.750
 no immediate surfactants no silicones 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.490
 mineral oils no synthetic 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.700
 dyes and fragrances no paraffin 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.140
 cave and no raw materials from chemistry and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.310
 In addition, the things are all vegan 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.770
 and here I'm trying what I right 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.780
 think cool and the ingredients are 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.429
 really good and I have that in too 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.469
 videos seen in food when I was at the 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.640
 opening was and the care I find 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.810
 In any case very very rich means 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.130
 when i'm having a shower i always have 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.869
 the feeling that my skin after that rather 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.609
 I'm dry at that now 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.649
 I do not usually have it, though 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.469
 even after that a care used so 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.749
 Skincare in the forest and that is on everyone 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.880
 very nurturing, though 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.219
 there is no special break of the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.229
 smell of it is more so citric i 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.640
 So do not break like that now 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.960
 is very artificial but just times 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.560
 so this citrus orange i would that 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.969
 describe 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.409
 and I'm good in any case and 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.780
 a lot of biological substances are there 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.460
 in there and also have a vegan symbol 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.689
 which I think is really good and that is up 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.450
 In any case , if you are recommended 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.039
 in a specially for example since 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.689
 then look for the there is the notice 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.399
 I do not know if she's with mÃ¼ller too 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.450
 There is no mÃ¼ller here at dm 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.130
 or I have that in any case 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.100
 unfortunately not yet seen as 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.730
 Although I weigh him just in the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.050
 Opening in Essen I have two 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.430
 lip care sticks bought that are 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.310
 both of crazy room is the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.590
 Lip Care I know I have you 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.800
 they are creative reent is also standing 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.000
 on it once in the taste direction 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.500
 with shock keeps a bit after 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.840
 at least if you still remember it 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.209
 remember and once barry babbel i 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.530
 also really really tasty find 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.120
 I think that's really good for you 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.200
 you wear in the evenings just me 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.670
 actually always before going to sleep 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.530
 lip care and the next morning is 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.640
 still a bit of it on and off 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.349
 the lips just feel awesome 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.090
 soft on and I really have a lot 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.130
 I also like to use one of them 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.319
 always in my pocket mostly denbury 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.239
 Babbel and I'm very happy with that 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.470
 cost about four euros and maybe 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.069
 you have also a noble he creates 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.630
 this crazy humor stuff leads to it 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.760
 two products from the field of 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.790
 hair care of because the coal would shine 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.260
 Rinse and shampoo and find 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.360
 I also really good from both the smell 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.950
 because I am my cosmetics culture 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.720
 sometimes so I think so 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.250
 not like mill break me quite as 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.000
 good but they are really important 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.340
 really delicious so very fruity 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.810
 I also like mango 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 every case really good and have that 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.319
 Feel that my hair is a bit 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.600
 The hair color is just washing directions 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.160
 you just want to very quickly 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.450
 And there I have the feeling that is up 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.250
 good for everyone and that is good too 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.100
 Of course, I'm still using a lot right now 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.750
 much more care because I just complete 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.070
 have leveled and what we mean 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.140
 by the way you can happen 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.579
 on my video channel I have since pursued 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.910
 I just the blonde teacher and then 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.680
 what sound filmed because I short yes 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.359
 Explanation I would like to 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.310
 have always change and that's why 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.569
 actually have blond hair 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.340
 where I always have a different color 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.600
 can do about it or just now 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.950
 for example this thing here 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.989
 and I have some already 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.569
 times washed and paint is also 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.930
 I think that's just fine, and it worked like that 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.450
 my case care product or hasch 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.459
 products in this month 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.870
 I'm a bit over me right now 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.850
 hope that is not too bad for 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.150
 I'll continue with my lips 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.670
 Products here are the two 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.930
 lipsticks front essens out of the tree 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.639
 last eclipse sticks series 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.820
 currently we are as you can see 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.169
 my hair has fit and there 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.700
 dark red lips no longer completely 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.590
 that's why so often mixes again 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.960
 Two colors or days only one of 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.570
 both this is once katen candy 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.150
 that's me the sun rosanna 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.580
 the pastel tone and blush lives on 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.710
 number two 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.479
 from nameable lips text that's me 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.889
 a bright bear to a lighter tone 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.240
 And in any case, I find that very much 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.430
 very nice together and watched 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.539
 any case very good to my hair 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.979
 I used the shelves and me 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.810
 I think it really takes a long time and she 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.430
 are very cheap that there is no 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.680
 beeswax or chimney or so in it 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.520
 because that's a big big one 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.199
 favourite 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.969
 I have my last drugstore 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.659
 Hall showed me some things 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:04.219
 bought the kaller among other things 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.960
 670 coffeeshops little at the moment almost 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.759
 every day wear on the movable lid 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.770
 and then with a dark color 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.199
 the edges under the eyes a bit 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.879
 walk and the colors I find very 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.400
 nicely pigmented these are the good ones 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:19.159
 relatively cheap and the series is up 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.870
 I started completely for two months 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.159
 Link my drogerie news times 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.599
 and in the video description will be 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.610
 shares the complete novelties and 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.779
 doubt the vegans are and that is 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.270
 I definitely very cool and 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.590
 of which of this case on the 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.449
 will still pick up some definitely 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.560
 and then the smallpox I liked that was 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.270
 not so much like one 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.849
 snapshot that's why I prefer that 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.139
 in palettes 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.120
 I will definitely do then 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.500
 a product that I find really cool 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.599
 because it is really difficult one 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.460
 vegan concealer to find with robbery 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.960
 at the same time as vegan 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.180
 it is declared very much on everyone 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.680
 case, the P2 archive is a perfect one 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.699
 concealer I find pretty good 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.710
 there are in the 20 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.360
 this is the clear one that lends itself 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.039
 to cover wonderful eyes as 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.770
 cover on the pimple and so on 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.870
 and he also has a job and 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.669
 sponge and is not too 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.389
 expensive is also new in the now 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.830
 assortment of p2 available and the b 34 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.719
 euro costs I do not quite remember 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.569
 That's exactly what I use almost every day 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.430
 and even if I do not make up 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.539
 use what seems to me most 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.550
 it is enough if I iphone that his 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.680
 Eye application here in the nose for 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.610
 article and so and then you are after 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.339
 rotation much brighter and that 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.990
 definitely a busy favorites 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.979
 Product is for the nails and that is 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.169
 also the nail polish I am here right now 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.900
 have it on that is the number 21 country 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.339
 with the p2 volume I think only 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.110
 It fits a very nice color now 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.909
 actually perfect now if I have something 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.250
 cooler is going towards autumn and 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.599
 winter and I think that's one 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.639
 neutral color actually somehow 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.610
 I like everything and I like it
