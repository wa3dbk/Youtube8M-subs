we're<00:00:12.360> back<00:00:12.510> to<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> dobro<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.500> open<00:00:14.100> G<00:00:14.309> tuning

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
we're back to the dobro in open G tuning

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.300 
we're back to the dobro in open G tuning
so<00:00:15.209> G<00:00:15.570> B<00:00:15.719> D<00:00:15.750> G<00:00:15.869> B<00:00:16.230> D<00:00:16.260> from<00:00:16.650> your<00:00:16.800> lowest<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.220> your

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.279 
so G B D G B D from your lowest to your
highest<00:00:17.609> string<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> be

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
highest string and this is going to be

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
highest string and this is going to be
volume<00:00:19.650> number<00:00:20.100> two<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:21.420> understanding

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
one we covered the key of G and in this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.010 
one we covered the key of G and in this
one<00:00:27.030> we're<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.360> covering<00:00:27.780> the<00:00:27.869> key

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
one we're going to be covering the key

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.189 
one we're going to be covering the key
of<00:00:28.170> D<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.800> D<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.369> dog<00:00:29.610> we're<00:00:30.270> gonna<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.570> going

know<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.190> two<00:00:41.520> different<00:00:41.670> keys<00:00:42.060> so<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:42.780> you're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
know in two different keys so if you're

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.500 
know in two different keys so if you're
ready<00:00:43.110> we've<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.579> four<00:00:44.579> pages<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> tablature

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
ready we've got four pages of tablature

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.660 
ready we've got four pages of tablature
it<00:00:45.600> looks<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.950> ahead<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.190> print<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it looks like this go ahead and print it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310 
it looks like this go ahead and print it
out<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:48.000> set<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> stand<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> front<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
out and set it on a stand in front of

out and set it on a stand in front of
you<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.590> we'll<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.399> with

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you and we'll get going with

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.209 
you and we'll get going with
understanding<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> fretboard<00:00:52.219> volume

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
understanding the fretboard volume

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.380 
understanding the fretboard volume
number<00:00:53.489> two<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.420> key<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.719> D<00:00:56.329> okay<00:00:57.329> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
number two in the key of D okay so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
number two in the key of D okay so
before<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.079> into<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> tablature<00:00:59.040> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
before we get going into the tablature I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.400 
before we get going into the tablature I
just<00:00:59.430> wanted<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> explain<00:01:00.000> why<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:01.079> it's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
just wanted to explain why I think it's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.340 
just wanted to explain why I think it's
important<00:01:01.950> to<00:01:02.070> learn<00:01:03.000> both<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> key<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.719> G<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
important to learn both the key of G and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
important to learn both the key of G and
the<00:01:04.829> key<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.009> D<00:01:05.399> as<00:01:05.729> two<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.780> first<00:01:07.020> keys

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the key of D as two of your first keys

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.289 
the key of D as two of your first keys
when<00:01:07.770> you're<00:01:07.920> trying<00:01:08.579> to<00:01:08.700> understand<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
when you're trying to understand the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.320 
when you're trying to understand the
fretboard<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> dobro<00:01:10.680> well<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.850> volume

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
fretboard on the dobro well in volume

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.180 
fretboard on the dobro well in volume
number<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.409> said<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.740> learned<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
number one like I said we learned the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.140 
number one like I said we learned the
key<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.460> G<00:01:14.729> well<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.680> use<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.830> capo<00:01:17.159> because

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
key of G well if you use a capo because

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.130 
key of G well if you use a capo because
this<00:01:19.110> tuning<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.680> G<00:01:19.979> B<00:01:20.159> D<00:01:20.190> G<00:01:20.400> B<00:01:20.790> D<00:01:20.940> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.810> dobro
