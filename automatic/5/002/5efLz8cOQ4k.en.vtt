so<00:02:03.760> dab<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.210> on<00:02:04.360> versus<00:02:04.900> painting

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.280 

and<00:02:11.099> when<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.180> your<00:02:12.330> next<00:02:12.629> color<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and when you get to your next color you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.680 
and when you get to your next color you
just<00:02:13.319> want<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.890> dab<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:15.000> well<00:02:15.299> and<00:02:15.569> you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
just want to dab it on as well and you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.289 
just want to dab it on as well and you
want<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.049> put<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.409> slightly<00:02:16.799> above<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.849> pink

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
want to put it slightly above the pink

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.530 
want to put it slightly above the pink
layer<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:19.349> way<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.769> do<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.190> or<00:02:21.060> give<00:02:21.299> it<00:02:21.420> a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
layer that way we do a or give it a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.039 
layer that way we do a or give it a
perfect<00:02:22.549> blending<00:02:23.549> effect<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.659> course<00:02:24.930> you

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
perfect blending effect of course you

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.220 
perfect blending effect of course you
will<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.709> repeat<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.220> step<00:02:26.459> at<00:02:26.670> least

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
will have to repeat this step at least

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.400 
will have to repeat this step at least
two<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.950> three<00:02:28.980> times<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.879> give<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.450> deep

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
two to three times to give it a deep

00:02:31.410 --> 00:03:17.580 
two to three times to give it a deep
color

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.720 

okay<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:18.650> for<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> sake<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.400> video<00:03:19.550> I

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
okay so for the sake of the video I

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.670 
okay so for the sake of the video I
already<00:03:20.240> have<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> finished<00:03:20.930> piece<00:03:21.140> as<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.440> can

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
already have a finished piece as you can

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.470 
already have a finished piece as you can
see<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.980> colors<00:03:22.310> are<00:03:22.400> blending<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.910> really

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
see the colors are blending in really

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.970 
see the colors are blending in really
nicely<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.080> yours<00:03:24.290> should<00:03:24.470> look<00:03:24.500> something

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
nicely and yours should look something

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.810 
nicely and yours should look something
like<00:03:25.010> this

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
like this

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.810 
like this
so<00:03:26.690> let's<00:03:27.200> get<00:03:27.350> started<00:03:27.830> with<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.070> next<00:03:28.370> step

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.340 

so<00:03:34.820> now<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.030> we're<00:03:35.360> done<00:03:35.510> with<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.780> now<00:03:36.290> you

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
so now that we're done with that now you

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.050 
so now that we're done with that now you
just<00:03:36.710> need<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:37.100> drill<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.370> hole<00:03:37.460> of<00:03:37.700> course<00:03:37.910> you

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
just need to drill a hole of course you

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.420 
just need to drill a hole of course you
should<00:03:38.330> do<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:38.720> step<00:03:38.990> before<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.950> paint<00:03:40.220> on

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
should do this step before you paint on

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.250 
should do this step before you paint on
anything<00:03:40.880> because<00:03:41.210> if<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.630> don't<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.990> paint

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
anything because if you don't the paint

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.590 
anything because if you don't the paint
will<00:03:42.470> get<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.800> little<00:03:42.980> mixed<00:03:43.190> up<00:03:43.520> but<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:44.060> decided

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
will get a little mixed up but I decided

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.150 
will get a little mixed up but I decided
to<00:03:44.750> show<00:03:44.960> you<00:03:45.020> how<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.320> drilled<00:03:45.740> in<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.010> hole

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
to show you how I drilled in a hole

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.420 
to show you how I drilled in a hole
anyway<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:48.170> there's<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.590> hole<00:03:48.800> as<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.280> can

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
anyway so there's the hole as you can

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.000 
anyway so there's the hole as you can
see<00:03:49.780> there's<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.960> back<00:03:51.140> of<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:51.830> came

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
see there's the back of it and it came

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.100 
see there's the back of it and it came
out<00:03:52.190> pretty<00:03:52.370> cool<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.060> second<00:03:53.450> hole<00:03:53.630> is

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
out pretty cool and the second hole is

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.910 
out pretty cool and the second hole is
for<00:03:54.740> a<00:03:54.980> dangly<00:03:55.880> charm<00:03:56.380> now<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:57.440> just<00:03:57.650> want<00:03:57.860> to

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
for a dangly charm now you just want to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.040 
for a dangly charm now you just want to
put<00:03:58.160> in<00:03:58.430> your<00:03:58.460> pinch<00:03:58.940> bail<00:03:59.210> which<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.540> super

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
put in your pinch bail which is super

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.140 
put in your pinch bail which is super
easy<00:04:00.230> which<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.650> why<00:04:00.830> I<00:04:00.860> love<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.280> use<00:04:01.520> pinch

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
easy which is why I love to use pinch

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.850 
easy which is why I love to use pinch
bails<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.720> course<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.140> pretty<00:04:03.320> hard<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.680> put

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
bails of course it's pretty hard to put

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.540 
bails of course it's pretty hard to put
on<00:04:03.980> if<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.220> have<00:04:04.370> long<00:04:04.580> nails<00:04:04.790> like<00:04:05.030> mines<00:04:06.550> and

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
on if you have long nails like mines and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.940 
on if you have long nails like mines and
then<00:04:08.480> all<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.810> have<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.020> do<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.440> stick<00:04:09.800> your

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
then all you have to do is stick your

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.420 
then all you have to do is stick your
chain<00:04:10.340> into<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.870> loop<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.980> pinch<00:04:13.190> bail

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
chain into the loop of the pinch bail

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.820 
chain into the loop of the pinch bail
and<00:04:13.730> that's<00:04:14.060> really<00:04:14.360> about<00:04:14.570> it<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.260> can<00:04:15.500> skip

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
and that's really about it you can skip

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.610 
and that's really about it you can skip
this<00:04:16.010> next<00:04:16.250> step<00:04:16.549> or<00:04:16.790> you<00:04:17.750> can<00:04:17.930> go<00:04:18.080> ahead<00:04:18.230> and

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
this next step or you can go ahead and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.580 
this next step or you can go ahead and
start<00:04:18.830> adding<00:04:19.220> some<00:04:20.209> triple-thick<00:04:20.960> onto<00:04:21.410> your

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
start adding some triple-thick onto your

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.990 
start adding some triple-thick onto your
piece<00:04:23.170> and<00:04:24.170> this<00:04:24.500> way<00:04:24.680> your<00:04:24.920> share<00:04:25.760> will<00:04:25.790> be

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
piece and this way your share will be

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.810 
piece and this way your share will be
super<00:04:26.750> shiny<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:28.190> don't<00:04:28.400> have<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.670> worry

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
super shiny and you don't have to worry

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.649 
super shiny and you don't have to worry
about<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.270> paint<00:04:29.540> flaking<00:04:30.050> off

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.239 

and<00:04:33.080> here's<00:04:33.349> just<00:04:33.469> another<00:04:33.679> one<00:04:34.069> that<00:04:34.129> I
