00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.220
 Hello guys 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.590
 chat seems boring but maintenance 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.390
 preventive medicine will greatly improve 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.039
 performance of your motorcycle and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.039
 mainly their safety 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.230
 it is basically recommended to change all 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.420
 oil from six months to one year 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.030
 even if the bike is little used 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.809
 now a good motorcycle head chat is a motorcycle 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.809
 well cared for 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.770
 the heats and cools of fluid brakes 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.870
 the brake pedal is lowering its 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.870
 boiling and not just in sports bikes 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.000
 any motorcycle style loaded with 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.000
 croup can be without brake 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.130
 new fluid also reduces 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 braking and do not forget to check the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.030
 disc wear 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.670
 alan beauty with beauty 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.290
 Did you know that in some tests that I 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.240
 I did with the same bike an old fluid 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.190
 then I replace the new fluid with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 six kilometers of zero difference in 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.210
 braking was almost two meters by 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.619
 This is important it can save your life. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.619
 in the case of film approval 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 the engine oil is the same as a 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.119
 person who is constantly changing can even 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.860
 to double the engine life without doubt 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.020
 oil has a function also of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.740
 lubricate and remove all dirt 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.270
 inside the engine then draining oil you 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.010
 removing dirt from the engine and 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.330
 putting on new hot briefing yes 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.640
 no doubt you're playing 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.620
 all he got from dirt from within 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.970
 throwing away and the new lubricant goes 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.580
 have a much better function 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.580
 so do not skimp on your motorcycle oil 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.400
 suspension oil is more viscous to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.910
 control the speed of compression and 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.239
 return offering cushioning use 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.350
 it becomes more liquid and leaves suspension 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.350
 uncontrolled, which affects the stability 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.720
 a person who neglects the final relationship 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.730
 can have a serious problem if the current 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.550
 break it can roll on the rear wheel 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.540
 locking up a situation well 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.780
 dangerous 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.060
 The tip is always just the slack and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.710
 mainly constant lubrication if 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.630
 you can do this by up to 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.160
 eight times the life of the final relationship 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.290
 besides lubricating you have to 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.240
 check that the clearance is not greater than 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.800
 recommended in what always reminds 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.230
 engine oil but forgets that 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.780
 suspension also has an oil the oil of 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.490
 brake also has to be replaced 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.670
 I think what else gives me the difference in 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.920
 performance on the track is an important 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.960
 motorcycle that brakes better than it has 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.940
 more stability and this I get 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.880
 influenced new maintenance staff 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.160
 is as important as you are. 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.700
 improve their riding skills and can 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.700
 save your life 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.189
 can not safely give mole pilot 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.189
 and enjoy freedom 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:13.409
 It's a slap in my face to wake you up. 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:17.670
 I'm hungry already being ae 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.670
 I'm wide-eyed 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.270
 Did you know that I already did several tests. 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.270
 of braking 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.160
 not a certain flight 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.490
 know now will not erase series 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.490
