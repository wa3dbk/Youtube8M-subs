00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.129
 hello how about this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.790
 teach how to weave this guardian also 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:14.770
 called gallon 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:19.090
 it is very easy it is knitted in high point and 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.570
 in the center fan with him you can 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.230
 perform many things for example 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.240
 bracelets cintos or simply guards 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.789
 to decorate 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.789
 some accessory or garment 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.059
 to weave this guard or gal 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.250
 we have to knit a row of knit 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.250
 chain a row of six chains 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:55.570
 here I already have the six chains woven and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.570
 now we are going to chop in the second 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.640
 and we knit a low 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:13.070
 now let's weave two chains 1 2 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 let's skip three base chains and in 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:21.950
 the next and last picamos 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.950
 and we knit a low 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 this is the first row we are going to turn 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.810
 and we weave 3 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.060
 chain points 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 12 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.200
 3 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.030
 inside this arch we are going to weave three 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.030
 high points 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.540
 one 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.100
 two 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:18.430
 3 now two chains 1 2 and we are going to weave 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:21.910
 3 other high points chopped in the same 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.750
 place or in the arch 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.750
 one 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.170
 two 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.689
 3 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.079
 and finally we are going to weave 1 high point 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:46.079
 chopped at the bottom of the row 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.079
 previous 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.550
 this is the second row now let's 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.560
 turn and we will always repeat the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.540
 second row 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.540
 let's weave three chains 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.580
 and then three high points chopped in the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.580
 arc 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.820
 one 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.600
 two 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:39.670
 32 chains and other 3 high points 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.150
 chopped also in the bow of two 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.150
 chains 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:04:00.530
 and we finished the row with 1 high point 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.130
 chopped on the third string counting 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.130
 from below 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.010
 and we will continue to knit 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.150
 respecting the second row 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:19.009
 let's repeat one more time 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.009
 we weave 3 chains 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.500
 and in the arc of two chains we are going to 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.930
 to knit 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.930
 three high points 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:52.550
 two chains and three other high points 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.550
 all chopped in the bow of 2 chains 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:03.729
 and finally we knit 1 stitched high point 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:08.849
 in the third chain counting from 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.849
 down 1 2 3 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:19.639
 we prick and we knit the high point 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:22.639
 this is all for knitting this guard in 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.970
 crochet fabric is very easy and can 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.229
 make from bracelets to decorate 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.229
 garments and accessories
