00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

I<00:00:00.299> feel<00:00:00.900> like<00:00:00.989> I've<00:00:01.170> always<00:00:01.290> been<00:00:01.500> informed<00:00:02.070> by

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
I feel like I've always been informed by

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.960 
I feel like I've always been informed by
land<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.840> earth<00:00:04.020> my<00:00:04.859> observation<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.790> and

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
land the earth my observation of it and

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.009 
land the earth my observation of it and
and<00:00:06.710> for<00:00:07.710> me<00:00:07.830> it's<00:00:07.980> like<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.130> meditation<00:00:08.900> it's<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
and for me it's like a meditation it's a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.810 
and for me it's like a meditation it's a
time<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.380> sort<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.620> let<00:00:10.800> go<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.309> internal

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
time to sort of let go of that internal

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.810 
time to sort of let go of that internal
chatter<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:13.340> present<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.670> know

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
chatter and just to be present you know

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
chatter and just to be present you know
with<00:00:15.859> with<00:00:16.859> where<00:00:17.100> I'm<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:19.109> going

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
with with where I'm at and it's going

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.870 
with with where I'm at and it's going
through<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> woods<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.279> through<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> land

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
through the woods and through the land

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.740 
through the woods and through the land
that<00:00:21.170> sort<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> informs<00:00:23.220> me<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:24.510> only

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
that sort of informs me it's not only

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
that sort of informs me it's not only
observing<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.890> seeing<00:00:26.460> what's<00:00:26.640> going<00:00:26.939> on

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
observing and seeing what's going on

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.330 
observing and seeing what's going on
there<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.660> sort<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.349> letting<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> sort<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
there but sort of letting it sort of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.450 
there but sort of letting it sort of
speak<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.910> me<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.679> I<00:00:33.320> think<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.680> sort

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
speak to me and I think it's that sort

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.780 
speak to me and I think it's that sort
of<00:00:35.610> curiosity<00:00:36.450> about<00:00:37.190> what<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.550> what

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
of curiosity about what is it what

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.520 
of curiosity about what is it what
what's<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> song<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.260> am<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.469> missing

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
what's the song there what am I missing

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.190 
what's the song there what am I missing
what<00:00:41.040> am<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.430> hearing<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.210> led<00:00:42.750> me<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
what am I not hearing that led me to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.080 
what am I not hearing that led me to
look<00:00:43.559> further<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:46.309> vibration<00:00:47.309> particularly

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
look further into vibration particularly

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.690 
look further into vibration particularly
sound<00:00:48.360> vibration<00:00:49.050> when<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.379> saw<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.340> work<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
sound vibration when I saw the work that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.660 
sound vibration when I saw the work that
has<00:00:51.059> been<00:00:51.090> done<00:00:51.379> many<00:00:52.379> years<00:00:52.559> ago<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.010> cymatics

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
has been done many years ago in cymatics

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.200 
has been done many years ago in cymatics
and<00:00:54.059> even<00:00:54.860> more<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.039> currently<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:57.030> being

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and even more so currently I think being

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.869 
and even more so currently I think being
brought<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> forefront<00:00:58.410> through<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
brought to the forefront through the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
brought to the forefront through the
sound<00:01:00.120> healing<00:01:00.420> work<00:01:00.920> I<00:01:03.530> wanted<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> find<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
sound healing work I wanted to find a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
sound healing work I wanted to find a
way<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> bring<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> into<00:01:05.880> my<00:01:06.030> own<00:01:06.210> work

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
way to bring that into my own work

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.149 
way to bring that into my own work
there's<00:01:07.049> an<00:01:07.170> experiment<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.010> do

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
there's an experiment that you can do

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.780 
there's an experiment that you can do
and<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:09.479> taking<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.140> metal<00:01:10.530> plate<00:01:10.790> sprinkling

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and it's taking a metal plate sprinkling

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
and it's taking a metal plate sprinkling
a<00:01:12.150> fine<00:01:12.659> coat<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.049> sand<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.890> then

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a fine coat of sand on it and then

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.969 
a fine coat of sand on it and then
running<00:01:14.490> frequency<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:15.270> through<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
running frequency up through there and

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.080 
running frequency up through there and
what<00:01:16.979> happens<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.670> these<00:01:17.880> incredible

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
what happens is these incredible

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.950 
what happens is these incredible
formations<00:01:21.090> appear<00:01:21.480> when<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> hit<00:01:21.870> a<00:01:21.900> certain

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
formations appear when you hit a certain

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.920 
formations appear when you hit a certain
frequency<00:01:22.550> as<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.700> change<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> frequency

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
frequency as you change the frequency

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.260 
frequency as you change the frequency
the<00:01:25.410> sand<00:01:25.830> goes<00:01:26.070> into<00:01:26.400> what's<00:01:26.610> seemingly<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the sand goes into what's seemingly a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.830 
the sand goes into what's seemingly a
chaotic<00:01:28.700> event<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.510> change<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
chaotic event and then you change the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
chaotic event and then you change the
frequency<00:01:31.350> again<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.640> another

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
frequency again and you get another

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000 
frequency again and you get another
beautiful<00:01:33.450> shape<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.110> even<00:01:34.410> if<00:01:34.770> you're

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
beautiful shape that's even if you're

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.040 
beautiful shape that's even if you're
going<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.940> know<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> higher<00:01:36.840> frequency

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
going up you know to a higher frequency

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.580 
going up you know to a higher frequency
you<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.620> a<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:37.860> complex<00:01:38.960> shape<00:01:39.960> geometric

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you get a more complex shape geometric

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.760 
you get a more complex shape geometric
shape<00:01:41.220> very<00:01:41.520> mandala<00:01:41.940> like<00:01:42.300> very<00:01:43.229> much<00:01:43.440> like

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
shape very mandala like very much like

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.180 
shape very mandala like very much like
shapes<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.580> might<00:01:44.760> see<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.060> nature

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
shapes that you might see in nature

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.210 
shapes that you might see in nature
again<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> truly<00:01:48.990> peaked<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.440> curiosity<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
again this truly peaked my curiosity and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
again this truly peaked my curiosity and
what<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.370> wanted<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.060> capture<00:01:51.540> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
what I wanted to do was capture that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.530 
what I wanted to do was capture that
like<00:01:52.350> handwriting<00:01:52.910> capture<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.240> paper

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
like handwriting capture that in paper

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.470 
like handwriting capture that in paper
and<00:01:55.370> so<00:01:56.370> what<00:01:56.550> I<00:01:56.580> did<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:57.650> use<00:01:59.480> this

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
and so what I did was use this

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.680 
and so what I did was use this
particular<00:02:01.020> time<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.220> studio<00:02:02.480> to<00:02:03.480> create

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
particular time in the studio to create

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.430 
particular time in the studio to create
large<00:02:04.140> sheets<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.950> paper<00:02:05.130> 25<00:02:05.670> by<00:02:05.790> 25<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.490> a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
large sheets of paper 25 by 25 it was a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
large sheets of paper 25 by 25 it was a
used<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.770> couple<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.340> different<00:02:11.760> fibers

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
used a couple of different fibers

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.030 
used a couple of different fibers
continent<00:02:12.540> avakov<00:02:12.960> blended<00:02:13.740> them<00:02:13.830> together

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
continent avakov blended them together

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.280 
continent avakov blended them together
and<00:02:14.580> added<00:02:14.730> some<00:02:14.880> kalyan<00:02:15.840> which<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.260> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and added some kalyan which is like a
