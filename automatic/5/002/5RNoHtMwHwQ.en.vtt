on how to create some humidity in your
tank<00:00:04.770> for<00:00:05.220> monitors<00:00:05.759> specifically<00:00:06.859> a<00:00:07.859> lot<00:00:08.309> of

tank for monitors specifically a lot of

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.780 
tank for monitors specifically a lot of
people<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:09.480> savanna<00:00:10.050> means<00:00:10.590> desert<00:00:11.309> high

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
people think savanna means desert high

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.749 
people think savanna means desert high
high<00:00:12.030> dry<00:00:12.330> heat<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.259> it's<00:00:13.759> Savannah

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
high dry heat it's not it's Savannah

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.960 
high dry heat it's not it's Savannah
monitors<00:00:15.059> are<00:00:16.130> they<00:00:17.130> love<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> hot<00:00:17.760> hot

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
monitors are they love the hot hot

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.519 
monitors are they love the hot hot
temperatures<00:00:18.449> as<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> desert<00:00:19.410> but

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
temperatures as if it was a desert but

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.400 
temperatures as if it was a desert but
they<00:00:19.680> also<00:00:19.830> love<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> humidity<00:00:21.199> it<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.320> be

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
they also love the humidity it can be

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.130 
they also love the humidity it can be
replicated<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.310> couple<00:00:23.580> different<00:00:23.880> ways

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
replicated in a couple different ways

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
replicated in a couple different ways
inside<00:00:25.140> someone's<00:00:25.560> tank<00:00:25.939> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
inside someone's tank you can have a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
inside someone's tank you can have a
large<00:00:27.599> water<00:00:27.930> dish<00:00:28.289> very<00:00:28.949> very<00:00:29.220> large<00:00:29.369> size

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
large water dish very very large size

large water dish very very large size
inside<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> tank<00:00:30.510> such<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:32.120> multiple

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
inside the tank such as this multiple

inside the tank such as this multiple
water<00:00:33.360> water<00:00:34.290> areas<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:34.950> water<00:00:35.160> bowls<00:00:35.489> for

them<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> add<00:00:36.780> some<00:00:36.989> humidity<00:00:37.469> in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
them to going to add some humidity in

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.840 
them to going to add some humidity in
the<00:00:37.559> tank<00:00:39.500> it's<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.739> dry<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.370> most<00:00:41.550> people

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the tank it's not dry like most people

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.430 
the tank it's not dry like most people
think<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.270> love<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> high<00:00:42.809> heat<00:00:43.050> yes<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
think they love the high heat yes you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
think they love the high heat yes you
need<00:00:43.559> 90<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> 100<00:00:44.399> degree<00:00:44.610> basking<00:00:45.090> spots<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
need 90 to 100 degree basking spots and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.569 
need 90 to 100 degree basking spots and
80<00:00:45.809> at<00:00:46.110> least<00:00:46.320> 85<00:00:46.739> degrees<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> rest<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
80 at least 85 degrees in the rest of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.410 
80 at least 85 degrees in the rest of
the<00:00:47.640> tank<00:00:48.079> but<00:00:49.640> it's<00:00:50.640> very<00:00:50.820> hard<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> keep

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the tank but it's very hard to keep

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
the tank but it's very hard to keep
something<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:53.039> humidity<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
something like the humidity up when you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.270 
something like the humidity up when you
have<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> temperatures<00:00:55.280> different

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
have that kind of temperatures different

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.500 
have that kind of temperatures different
ways<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.420> an

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
ways you can do it is you can have an

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.119 
ways you can do it is you can have an
insulated<00:00:57.989> tank<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> tank<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.710> displaying

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
insulated tank this tank I'm displaying

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
insulated tank this tank I'm displaying
here<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.550> only<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.850> glass<00:01:00.059> tank<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
here is only a glass tank it's a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
here is only a glass tank it's a
temporary<00:01:01.050> tank<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> mine<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.800> building<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
temporary tank of mine and building a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
temporary tank of mine and building a
regular<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:02.989> that's<00:01:03.989> encased<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
regular one that's encased but you can

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
regular one that's encased but you can
actually<00:01:06.360> even<00:01:06.659> keep<00:01:06.960> immunity<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> tank

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
actually even keep immunity in a tank

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
actually even keep immunity in a tank
bit<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:09.270> high<00:01:09.689> enough<00:01:09.930> our

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
bit like this up high enough our

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.320 
bit like this up high enough our
monitors<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.670> different<00:01:12.000> ways<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> can

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
monitors there's different ways you can

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.320 
monitors there's different ways you can
do<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:14.390> find<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:17.040> best<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
do it I find out that the best way to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
do it I find out that the best way to
add<00:01:18.540> instant<00:01:19.080> humidity<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> tank<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
add instant humidity to a tank and it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.710 
add instant humidity to a tank and it
also<00:01:20.610> looks<00:01:21.060> amazing<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.590> use<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> father<00:01:23.280> or

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
also looks amazing is to use a father or

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
also looks amazing is to use a father or
missing<00:01:24.720> something<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> there's<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
missing something like that there's so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
missing something like that there's so
different<00:01:26.549> devices<00:01:26.790> online<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.810> pet

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
different devices online that your pet

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.440 
different devices online that your pet
stores<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:28.979> over<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> place

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
stores and get them all over the place

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.640 
stores and get them all over the place
if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.689> them<00:01:30.780> online<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.500> get

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
if you get them online you probably get

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.760 
if you get them online you probably get
them<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:31.979> cheaper<00:01:33.259> as<00:01:34.259> opposed<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
them a little cheaper as opposed to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890 
them a little cheaper as opposed to
misting<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.729> electrical<00:01:36.329> equipment

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
misting with a lot electrical equipment

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.399 
misting with a lot electrical equipment
and<00:01:38.150> extra<00:01:39.150> stuff<00:01:39.360> hanging<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> tank<00:01:40.140> or

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and extra stuff hanging on the tank or

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.670 
and extra stuff hanging on the tank or
inside<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> tank<00:01:41.930> an<00:01:42.930> alternative<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.560> ever

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
inside the tank an alternative I ever

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.130 
inside the tank an alternative I ever
prefer<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> fogger<00:01:44.939> ultrasone<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> fogger

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
prefer is a fogger ultrasone the fogger

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
prefer is a fogger ultrasone the fogger
is<00:01:46.350> pretty<00:01:46.560> small<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.250> take<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
is pretty small you can take it in and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
is pretty small you can take it in and
out<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.600> auto<00:01:48.810> shut<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
out they have auto shut off so if the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.030 
out they have auto shut off so if the
water<00:01:50.070> level<00:01:50.460> goes<00:01:50.579> down<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.000> low<00:01:51.829> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.920> get

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
water level goes down to low if you get

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.380

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
looks instantly and how well it works

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.059 
looks instantly and how well it works
and<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:38.019> know<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.139> give<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> five<00:03:38.859> out<00:03:38.889> of

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
and you know I give it a five out of

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.500 
and you know I give it a five out of
five<00:03:39.250> stars<00:03:39.579> these<00:03:39.790> things<00:03:40.000> are<00:03:40.120> great<00:03:40.299> they

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
five stars these things are great they

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.360 
five stars these things are great they
last<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.900> really<00:03:41.079> long<00:03:41.199> time<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:45.129> only<00:03:45.250> thing

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
last a really long time the only thing

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.640 
last a really long time the only thing
you<00:03:45.549> got<00:03:45.669> to<00:03:45.699> watch<00:03:45.879> out<00:03:46.090> for<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.659> is<00:03:47.349> shooting

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
you got to watch out for is is shooting

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.710 
you got to watch out for is is shooting
drops<00:03:47.949> up<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.150> want<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:49.359> make<00:03:49.479> sure<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
drops up and you want to make sure the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.270 
drops up and you want to make sure the
drops<00:03:49.959> are<00:03:50.139> lining<00:03:50.290> back<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.709> water<00:03:50.919> dish

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
drops are lining back in a water dish

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.589 
drops are lining back in a water dish
otherwise<00:03:51.549> you'll<00:03:51.760> empty<00:03:52.090> your<00:03:52.209> water<00:03:52.389> I'm<00:03:52.540> a

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
otherwise you'll empty your water I'm a

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.599 
otherwise you'll empty your water I'm a
lot<00:03:52.810> faster<00:03:53.260> than<00:03:53.459> then<00:03:54.459> needs<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:56.609> but

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
lot faster than then needs to but

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.159 
lot faster than then needs to but
basically<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.359> you<00:03:58.479> can<00:03:58.599> leave<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.870> like<00:03:59.019> this

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
basically is you can leave it like this

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.629 
basically is you can leave it like this
you<00:03:59.349> can<00:03:59.500> put<00:03:59.620> them<00:03:59.769> on<00:03:59.799> timers<00:04:00.280> if<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.489> have<00:04:00.609> a

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
you can put them on timers if you have a

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.509 
you can put them on timers if you have a
big<00:04:00.879> enough<00:04:01.030> Bowl<00:04:01.389> I<00:04:01.919> take<00:04:02.919> my<00:04:03.069> in<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.400> out

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
big enough Bowl I take my in and out

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.280 
big enough Bowl I take my in and out
just<00:04:03.760> because<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.359> easier<00:04:04.659> on<00:04:04.720> my<00:04:04.959> end<00:04:05.139> I

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
just because it's easier on my end I

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.530 
just because it's easier on my end I
think<00:04:05.699> but<00:04:06.699> you<00:04:06.790> can<00:04:06.939> leave<00:04:07.090> them<00:04:07.180> right<00:04:07.359> in

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
think but you can leave them right in

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.789 
think but you can leave them right in
there<00:04:07.720> if<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.930> had<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.199> big<00:04:08.319> enough<00:04:08.409> for<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
there if you had it big enough for the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.969 
there if you had it big enough for the
right<00:04:08.979> setup<00:04:10.049> very<00:04:11.049> small<00:04:11.409> wire<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.859> could

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
right setup very small wire you could

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.860 
right setup very small wire you could
hide<00:04:12.159> it<00:04:12.280> behind<00:04:12.400> anything<00:04:13.030> some<00:04:13.299> kind<00:04:13.509> of<00:04:13.540> 3d

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
hide it behind anything some kind of 3d

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.740 
hide it behind anything some kind of 3d
backgrounds<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:15.269> they're<00:04:16.269> great<00:04:16.509> especially

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
backgrounds and they're great especially

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.620 
backgrounds and they're great especially
if<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.049> have<00:04:17.199> a<00:04:17.229> water<00:04:17.709> end<00:04:17.949> in<00:04:18.159> your<00:04:18.310> tank

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
if you have a water end in your tank

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.089 
if you have a water end in your tank
well<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.930> great<00:04:20.139> way<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.349> add<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.769> mitad<00:04:21.010> in

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
well it's a great way to add to mitad in

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.740 
well it's a great way to add to mitad in
your<00:04:21.250> tank<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.779> it<00:04:22.779> looks<00:04:22.990> cool

water bowl extra Tara water bowl it's
about<00:04:39.110> two<00:04:39.319> inches<00:04:39.560> deep<00:04:39.819> then<00:04:40.819> it's<00:04:40.970> almost

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
about two inches deep then it's almost

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.850 
about two inches deep then it's almost
full<00:04:41.629> it's<00:04:41.930> not<00:04:42.080> enough<00:04:42.289> where<00:04:42.470> it's<00:04:42.590> spilling

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
full it's not enough where it's spilling

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.969 
full it's not enough where it's spilling
everywhere<00:04:43.250> but<00:04:44.020> yet<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.169> can<00:04:45.319> cast<00:04:45.530> off<00:04:45.770> some

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
everywhere but yet you can cast off some

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.230 
everywhere but yet you can cast off some
really<00:04:46.099> nice<00:04:46.370> fog<00:04:48.580> inside<00:04:49.580> your<00:04:49.729> tank<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.090> mean

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
really nice fog inside your tank I mean

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.170 
really nice fog inside your tank I mean
if<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.389> leave<00:04:50.659> it<00:04:50.780> running<00:04:50.930> all<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.500> time<00:04:52.180> you

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
if you leave it running all the time you

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.180 
if you leave it running all the time you
know<00:04:53.270> what<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:53.680> definitely<00:04:54.680> have<00:04:54.800> way<00:04:55.159> more

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
know what I definitely have way more

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.610 
know what I definitely have way more
enough<00:04:55.639> humidity<00:04:55.970> than<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.360> need<00:04:56.569> it<00:04:56.960> would

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
enough humidity than you need it would

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.499 
enough humidity than you need it would
be<00:04:57.710> very<00:04:57.919> very<00:04:58.099> sufficient<00:04:58.699> and<00:04:58.909> it's<00:04:59.210> it's

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
be very very sufficient and it's it's

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.089 
be very very sufficient and it's it's
not<00:04:59.720> bad<00:04:59.930> because<00:05:00.319> it<00:05:00.440> doesn't<00:05:00.710> use<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.830> lot<00:05:01.069> of

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
not bad because it doesn't use a lot of

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.330 
not bad because it doesn't use a lot of
water<00:05:01.750> if<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:03.319> have<00:05:03.409> a<00:05:03.500> very<00:05:03.710> small<00:05:04.009> small

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
water if you have a very small small

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.040 
water if you have a very small small
water<00:05:04.580> dish<00:05:04.819> it's<00:05:05.509> going<00:05:05.659> to<00:05:05.720> be<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> little

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
water dish it's going to be a little

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.140 
water dish it's going to be a little
harder<00:05:06.380> just<00:05:07.159> really<00:05:07.460> depends<00:05:07.729> on<00:05:07.819> your<00:05:07.940> setup

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
harder just really depends on your setup

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.070 
harder just really depends on your setup
what<00:05:08.900> you<00:05:09.020> need<00:05:09.199> it<00:05:09.289> for<00:05:09.319> how<00:05:09.650> much<00:05:09.830> humidity

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
what you need it for how much humidity

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.089 
what you need it for how much humidity
me.you<00:05:12.080> dis<00:05:12.289> kind<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:12.710> couldn't<00:05:13.009> really

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
me.you dis kind of I couldn't really

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.490 
me.you dis kind of I couldn't really
come<00:05:13.310> up<00:05:13.400> with<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.580> great<00:05:13.759> design<00:05:13.909> to<00:05:14.419> put<00:05:15.319> it<00:05:15.409> in

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
come up with a great design to put it in

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.990 
come up with a great design to put it in
the<00:05:15.590> tank<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:16.370> have<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:16.610> there<00:05:16.729> all<00:05:16.849> the<00:05:16.940> time

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
the tank to have in there all the time

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.850 
the tank to have in there all the time
so<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.419> just<00:05:17.569> take<00:05:17.690> in<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.050> out<00:05:18.139> because<00:05:18.710> she

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
so I just take in and out because she

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.149 
so I just take in and out because she
loves<00:05:19.130> laying<00:05:19.430> in<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.639> water<00:05:19.789> dish<00:05:20.090> anyway<00:05:21.159> so

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
loves laying in the water dish anyway so

lizard in the morning or at night to
kind<00:06:17.090> of<00:06:17.150> simulate<00:06:17.360> do<00:06:18.159> it's<00:06:19.159> a<00:06:19.219> pretty<00:06:19.400> good

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
kind of simulate do it's a pretty good

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.740 
kind of simulate do it's a pretty good
way<00:06:19.669> to<00:06:19.729> do<00:06:19.969> it<00:06:22.060> you<00:06:23.060> know<00:06:23.150> like<00:06:23.330> I<00:06:23.449> said<00:06:23.509> it's

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
way to do it you know like I said it's

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.200 
way to do it you know like I said it's
pretty<00:06:23.840> much<00:06:23.990> Auto<00:06:24.229> I<00:06:24.349> can<00:06:24.590> just<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:25.029> can<00:06:26.029> just

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
pretty much Auto I can just I can just

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.760 
pretty much Auto I can just I can just
basically<00:06:26.479> it<00:06:26.810> can<00:06:26.930> take<00:06:27.110> it<00:06:27.229> in<00:06:27.349> and<00:06:27.529> out<00:06:27.560> like

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
basically it can take it in and out like

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.980 
basically it can take it in and out like
this<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.940> turns<00:06:29.180> right<00:06:29.389> off<00:06:29.800> put<00:06:30.800> it<00:06:30.830> back<00:06:30.889> in

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
this it turns right off put it back in

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.089 
this it turns right off put it back in
there<00:06:32.990> you<00:06:33.050> go<00:06:33.199> the<00:06:33.380> biggest<00:06:33.649> thing<00:06:33.800> you<00:06:33.949> want
