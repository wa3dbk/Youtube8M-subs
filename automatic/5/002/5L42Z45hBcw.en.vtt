00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.870
 until one day someone takes this aspect are many steps to follow 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.009
 and everyone has had to 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.449
 dionisio hernandez 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.449
 the pessimist in the Salamanca municipality of 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.499
 his son has followed the family trade and one day he dared to build 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:21.769
 next to face 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.609
 the result was positive and they were encouraged to continue producing other instruments 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.060
 musicals 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.360
 with a friend of my son efe 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.489
 is a musician 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.960
 play with work 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.909
 if the writer scams you I retired one day yes 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.730
 you could do some work or instrument of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.530
 there were ways to do this he said because it's implicit since adif and the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.740
 country in another pazo ticket I pass you plans and measures of such through 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.370
 another one with the copies of what I'm going to get you I passed a few copies of that and a 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.750
 day then often equal promoter of the violent 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.330
 and they started violent for now 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.710
 and I did not have any idea of ​​violins 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.660
 I had not had a violin nearby and the idea goes hand in hand with pensions and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.220
 cell phones 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 the process is not quite simple 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.250
 the same did the same month 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.830
 congratulations to funes and precise 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.880
 something that until now was not necessary to manufacture this type of institutions 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.730
 carpentry 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.590
 I started to fabricate even your own tools 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.810
 because it is a 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.360
 we are carpenters some of us are worth but most of them have none 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.750
 that be all very small tool 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.590
 so the job itself has finished work that I know how to do 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.720
 look for the right way because motorbike pump 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 Well, not because we have lots of wood many times but 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.170
 Anyway you have today here is not worth just lavalle 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.820
 ask for special 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.020
 and that is the beginning 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.210
 choose the woods 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 then things in the templates 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.110
 ted as you grow the violin 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.080
 the model you want to make 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.400
 the departure of the templates then thought past 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.950
 two wood join the templates, not many templates 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.450
 that process 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.030
 until the start time does not lead a very bulky production 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.119
 there are three copies that have been born in your hands 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:15.059
 they do have much in common with those made by the stradivarius itself 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.269
 to begin with, none is the same as others 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.199
 there are no two woods and the same are all the same 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.739
 are the violins and possible aids 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.409
 even stradivarius oysho violins and the ditto differently from model 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.169
 the idea different then different 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.209
 and there they sounded good 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.199
 the Ukrainians are still seen without pressing well 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.019
 as your creation increases also your request to the technique 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.019
 not only bojan or helmet the materials and so 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.689
 they say that information is the power 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.729
 but if this comes to our hands our language 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.099
 the magic formula detracts a bit 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.549
 I valued passes the first measure will never be a solution of English 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.789
 then translated literally 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.799
 English to Spanish, whatever it is, how it sounds weird is very difficult 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.339
 apart what translate measures 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.749
 also down street uncle sam inches 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.240
 all the terms they use to 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.069
 it's not about pieces 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.159
 postcards are different since in Spain 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.340
 so for example from in england takes a madriza around the violin the 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:20.479
 ponzi scheme 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.689
 Mauricio Macri times 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.859
 It has not translation 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.719
 all things that are extinguished 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.009
 studying it looking for them 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.319
 and the isi in principle works for him 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.829
 distinguish in the state argued 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.799
 is content to spend his free time 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.759
 at the beginning by amateurs 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.159
 and I do it for example on Saturdays 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.989
 the morning predominated whenever the party was spoiled for a while 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.939
 I speak here then this detail of what we have called and they are not at home 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.279
 sitting there photo of the ciutadella 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:53.279
 between these and the finalist challenges was difficult 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.609
 once it is firm 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.779
 the unknown no longer scares soon 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.339
 the beginning 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.269
 did not come to the world to a viola also 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.129
 the night what is already 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.939
 that larger size then of not having a home a place to 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.789
 having them is already complicated because I already have two violins 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.969
 we have a guitar also at home 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.159
 and there is not much space but to have it 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.370
 and do not believe that the thing gets here 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.750
 Dionisio is not satisfied that his hands are born instruments pretend 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.889
 get musical pieces also born 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.439
 every day, February 13, the family, the friends are up because they do not 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.340
 you point inc 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.830
 Well, in principle, yes 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.309
 the face covered with music to know what you are doing if the zone sounds 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.309
 jimena baron and phlegm point and in September the support proposals 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.490
 his restlessness and perseverance and his patience ensured that they help him in this 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.449
 moment 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.240
 the same ingredients that have helped you create these pieces of 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.800
 collection
