00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and go ahead and put a little cut in it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
and go ahead and put a little cut in it
so<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.799> leave<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> wire<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.330> on

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
so that we can leave the wire here on

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.410 
so that we can leave the wire here on
the<00:01:21.540> outside<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.920> grommet<00:01:23.280> okay<00:01:24.240> with

actually before I put the taillight back
on<00:02:25.939> I<00:02:26.060> do<00:02:26.209> want<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.390> note<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.780> our<00:02:27.049> unit<00:02:27.739> here

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
on I do want to note that our unit here

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.619 
on I do want to note that our unit here
we<00:02:28.069> do<00:02:28.159> have<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.340> fuse<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.909> place<00:02:29.209> here

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
we do have a fuse in place here

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.030 
we do have a fuse in place here
if<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.930> harness<00:02:30.170> stops<00:02:30.379> working<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.860> could

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
if the harness stops working this could

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.860 
if the harness stops working this could
be<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.340> source<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.730> problem<00:02:32.030> here<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.390> you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
be the source of the problem here so you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.530 
be the source of the problem here so you
may<00:02:32.989> take<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.379> provided<00:02:33.650> zip<00:02:34.129> ties<00:02:34.579> here<00:02:34.849> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
may take the provided zip ties here and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.759 
may take the provided zip ties here and
actually<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.959> go<00:02:36.049> ahead<00:02:36.109> and<00:02:36.290> tie<00:02:36.409> it<00:02:36.470> up<00:02:36.620> so

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
actually just go ahead and tie it up so

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:37.720 
actually just go ahead and tie it up so
that<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.040> get<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.489> little<00:02:37.609> bit

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
that you can get to it a little bit

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.880 
that you can get to it a little bit
easier<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.170> not<00:02:39.290> just<00:02:39.319> hanging<00:02:39.769> all

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
easier so that it's not just hanging all

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.289 
easier so that it's not just hanging all
the<00:02:39.980> way<00:02:40.099> down<00:02:40.250> towards<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.579> bottom<00:02:40.700> we'll<00:02:41.239> go

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
the way down towards the bottom we'll go

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.220 
the way down towards the bottom we'll go
ahead<00:02:41.359> and<00:02:41.480> continue<00:02:41.659> underneath<00:02:42.109> the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
ahead and continue underneath the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.479

the way over until we get to the opening
between<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.549> body<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.909> bumper<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:50.420> we

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
between the body and the bumper like we

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.020 
between the body and the bumper like we
had<00:02:50.720> over<00:02:50.930> here<00:02:50.959> we'll<00:02:51.889> take<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.220> up<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.879> make

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
had over here we'll take it up and make

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.610 
had over here we'll take it up and make
our<00:02:53.150> connection<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.989> definitely<00:02:54.349> want<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.500> be

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
our connection we definitely want to be

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.440 
our connection we definitely want to be
careful<00:02:54.819> when<00:02:55.819> we<00:02:55.940> were<00:02:56.030> writing<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.299> wire

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
careful when we were writing the wire

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.720 
careful when we were writing the wire
around<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.230> exhaust<00:02:57.620> make<00:02:58.340> sure<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.639> it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
around the exhaust make sure that it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.699 
around the exhaust make sure that it
doesn't<00:02:58.879> get<00:02:59.060> caught<00:02:59.269> up<00:02:59.420> or<00:02:59.569> or<00:02:59.959> hangs<00:03:00.470> down

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
doesn't get caught up or or hangs down

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.500 
doesn't get caught up or or hangs down
where<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.040> could<00:03:01.159> make<00:03:01.579> contact<00:03:01.790> with<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.359> and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
where it could make contact with it and

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.839 
where it could make contact with it and
damage<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.170> wire<00:03:03.319> if<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.129> follow<00:03:04.310> up<00:03:04.579> the

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
damage the wire if you follow up the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.460 
damage the wire if you follow up the
backside<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.359> bumper<00:03:05.480> there<00:03:06.319> are<00:03:06.440> a

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
backside of the bumper there are a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.809 
backside of the bumper there are a
couple<00:03:06.620> loops<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:07.099> which<00:03:07.250> are<00:03:07.370> hard<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.609> see

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
couple loops here which are hard to see

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.750 
couple loops here which are hard to see
but<00:03:08.060> we<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.239> actually<00:03:08.659> use<00:03:08.750> those<00:03:08.989> as<00:03:09.760> points

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
but we can actually use those as points

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.970 
but we can actually use those as points
to<00:03:11.000> take<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> couple<00:03:12.109> of<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.409> zip<00:03:12.590> ties<00:03:12.769> and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
to take a couple of the zip ties and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.229 
to take a couple of the zip ties and
secure<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:13.430> wires<00:03:13.639> up<00:03:13.879> there<00:03:15.879> so<00:03:16.879> I've<00:03:17.030> got<00:03:17.150> it

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
secure the wires up there so I've got it

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.400 
secure the wires up there so I've got it
pulled<00:03:17.419> up<00:03:17.569> here<00:03:17.780> go<00:03:18.049> ahead<00:03:18.139> and<00:03:18.230> make<00:03:18.379> our

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
pulled up here go ahead and make our

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.680 
pulled up here go ahead and make our
connection<00:03:18.919> to<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.160> taillight<00:03:19.549> there's<00:03:20.419> just

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
connection to the taillight there's just

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.869 
connection to the taillight there's just
one<00:03:20.959> final<00:03:20.989> step<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.590> we<00:03:21.709> need<00:03:22.099> to<00:03:22.220> do<00:03:22.430> there

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
one final step that we need to do there

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.759 
one final step that we need to do there
is<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> fuse<00:03:23.989> that's<00:03:24.169> provided<00:03:24.590> with<00:03:24.680> the
