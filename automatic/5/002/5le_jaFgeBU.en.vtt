 then you stand out that these 16 gigabytes a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 picture of what does not wait like that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.960

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.840
 samsung galaxy tab 10.1 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.900
 so he is he has a 10-point lcd screen 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.880
 a full HD video player in history 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 is a battery 7000 m 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.400
 to the camera 3 MP and a GPS 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.840
 it also including android's 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 bluetooth wifi and divx hd which 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.740
 I just opened there to prevent a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:43.189
 mention will open it 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:47.400
 this part is the beast 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.500
 this is raised 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.850
 I do not like it too much because you 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 iphone stuff ya marked a moment 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.320
 designed by there is a piece of cardboard that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.070
 at least give up suddenly seems 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.710
 something did not work very well 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.170
 here we are going to lift 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.720
 in fact it's just the quarter time to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.810
 lose so not practical 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.610
 we're going to pose there we just see it like that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 that they are all out there is the guide of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.090
 quick start 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:34.980
 the usb connector that allows so that's it 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.800
 This is what makes us at here 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.640
 underneath there is that which allows you 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.320
 to have robin wants plugged into usb so 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.810
 it's a pity that on damage only on 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.920
 ipad and where there is not even looks 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:59.190
 where I am here and here you have 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.290
 connect a usb so I was already 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.800
 turned on because the teachers for 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.150
 put the books in the media 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:12.870
 good evening be listed now eyes 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.450
 the headphones that looks a lot like 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.410
 those of apple 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.400
 samba kÃ¢ father and brought a complaint against 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.590
 they are very similar 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.650
 the team of protective foam because we 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.650
 here loses the power cable 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:36.110
 we can notice that the end of the cap is 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.890
 exactly the same as apple 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:46.160
 look this is exactly the same set 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:52.110
 point it's exactly the same 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:55.610
 after we see here at the height sector 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:15.380
 exactly like that of apple 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:15.380
 there you put yourself like that in time to 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.769
 alignment is not that easy 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.100
 here and there 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.440
 and that's it without thermal lactose 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.940
 shady following street giving way I 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.900
 think at the moment of the prospective product 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.900
 the perex center 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.260
 you have the speakers 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.850
 the second because I miss it 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.990
 little trick for the battery or up to 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.670
 left there is the marolles button of the 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.690
 sulk the volume buttons and we can 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:07.520
 put a micro sd 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:11.240
 that's not bad behind so noticed 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.810
 samsung on the sound and the special 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:22.280
 Behind behind special ignorance 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:25.430
 oualalou to the vez slide your finger 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.850
 on the screen to unlock I put 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.850
 a code 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.570
 that's what it gives me I fell a few 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.280
 geeks 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:45.380
 so we will go on where there are all 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.810

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.960
 test 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.160

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.250
 breaks of time where there are all the books in 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.490

 comorienne here with all the stuff 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.990

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.340
 it works 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:27.750
