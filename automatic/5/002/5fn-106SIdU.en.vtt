00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.770 

keep<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.100> mind<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.460> will<00:01:25.880> be<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> little<00:01:26.360> hard

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
keep in mind that will be a little hard

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.920 
keep in mind that will be a little hard
to<00:01:26.990> kind<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.500> put<00:01:27.710> all<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.190> all<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.060> it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
to kind of put all the all of it

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.420 
to kind of put all the all of it
together<00:01:30.110> because<00:01:30.650> it<00:01:30.800> will<00:01:30.950> get<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.160> bit

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
together because it will get a bit

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.710 
together because it will get a bit
tighter<00:01:33.070> now<00:01:34.070> kind<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:34.550> squish<00:01:35.090> them<00:01:35.300> towards

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
tighter now kind of squish them towards

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720 
tighter now kind of squish them towards
the<00:01:35.960> middle<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.710> they're<00:01:36.890> all<00:01:37.040> tight<00:01:37.460> together

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
the middle so they're all tight together

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:47.850 
the middle so they're all tight together
and<00:01:38.360> it's<00:01:38.750> more<00:01:39.080> in<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.260> ball<00:01:39.560> shape<00:01:46.330> so<00:01:47.330> it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
and it's more in a ball shape so it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.840 
and it's more in a ball shape so it
should<00:01:48.860> basically<00:01:49.250> just<00:01:50.150> look<00:01:50.690> like<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:51.850> now

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
should basically just look like this now

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.530 
should basically just look like this now
take<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.510> small<00:01:53.840> handful<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:56.030> can<00:01:56.270> just

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
take the small handful and you can just

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.400 
take the small handful and you can just
slip<00:01:56.900> them<00:01:57.110> through<00:02:01.780> they<00:02:02.780> mostly<00:02:03.200> don't

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
slip them through they mostly don't

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.460 
slip them through they mostly don't
really<00:02:03.740> come<00:02:04.250> out<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.950> if<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.990> kind<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.110> move

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
really come out so if you kind of move

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.590 
really come out so if you kind of move
that<00:02:09.860> around<00:02:11.320> now<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.680> go<00:02:12.920> like<00:02:13.100> this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
that around now you can go like this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.290 
that around now you can go like this
shake<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.400> treats<00:02:16.700> won't<00:02:16.940> come<00:02:17.150> out

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
shake it and the treats won't come out

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.020 
shake it and the treats won't come out
and<00:02:18.230> your<00:02:18.470> rats<00:02:18.650> will<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.100> very<00:02:19.370> fun<00:02:19.760> time
