00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.540 
think the very next day they talked
about<00:00:56.190> gears<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.120> being<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.600> reboost<00:00:58.550> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
about gears for not being a reboost the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
about gears for not being a reboost the
new<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.969> being<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> reboot<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:02.100> they

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
new one not being a reboot and that they

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.479 
new one not being a reboot and that they
aim<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.080> bring<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> franchise<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.339> its

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
aim to bring the franchise back to its

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850 
aim to bring the franchise back to its
darker<00:01:05.909> roots<00:01:06.200> I'm<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.320> kind<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.590> hit<00:01:07.710> home

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
darker roots I'm not kind of hit home

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
darker roots I'm not kind of hit home
with<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.430> think<00:01:09.000> me<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:10.110> I've<00:01:10.229> seen

with I think me because what I've seen
from<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.280> some<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> reasons

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
from you all is that some of the reasons

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
from you all is that some of the reasons
that<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> got<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.740> gears<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.070> war<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that you got into gears of war in the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.740 
that you got into gears of war in the
first<00:01:14.580> place<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> game<00:01:15.479> seemed

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
first place is that the game seemed

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.740 
first place is that the game seemed
really<00:01:15.930> dark<00:01:16.259> thing<00:01:16.560> darkly<00:01:17.070> famed<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.750> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
really dark thing darkly famed and you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
really dark thing darkly famed and you
know<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:20.040> game<00:01:20.250> progressed<00:01:20.729> especially

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
know as the game progressed especially

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
know as the game progressed especially
with<00:01:21.299> gears<00:01:21.509> 3<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> lot<00:01:22.799> more

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
with gears 3 I think it was a lot more

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
with gears 3 I think it was a lot more
colorful<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.600> didn't<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.080> dark

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
colorful and it didn't have the dark

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.249 
colorful and it didn't have the dark
grays<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.400> browns<00:01:26.580> everywhere<00:01:27.390> which<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
grays and browns everywhere which it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
grays and browns everywhere which it
seemed<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> throw<00:01:29.040> people<00:01:29.250> off<00:01:29.750> I'm

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
seemed to kind of throw people off I'm

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.899 
seemed to kind of throw people off I'm
not<00:01:30.869> necessarily<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.159> pushing<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.759> way

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
not necessarily you know pushing one way

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
not necessarily you know pushing one way
or<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.090> other<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.540> terms<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.960> art<00:01:34.500> style<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
or the other in terms of art style but I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.999 
or the other in terms of art style but I
think<00:01:35.460> having<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.909> darker<00:01:36.270> tone<00:01:36.710> for<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.770> game

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
think having a darker tone for the game

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
think having a darker tone for the game
thematic<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.180> acting<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
thematic you know acting and all that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.469 
thematic you know acting and all that
stuff<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> plays<00:01:41.310> into<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:42.240> just

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
stuff kind of plays into that not just

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.319 
stuff kind of plays into that not just
the<00:01:42.689> brightness<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> colors<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.299> screen

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the brightness and colors on the screen

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749 
the brightness and colors on the screen
so<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.430> thought<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.640> pretty

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
so that thought that was pretty

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.920 
so that thought that was pretty
interesting<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.299> other<00:01:48.390> thing<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.689> kind<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
interesting the other thing I kind of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
interesting the other thing I kind of
pull<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.299> they

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
pull from that is that you know they

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
pull from that is that you know they
keep<00:01:51.840> talking<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.140> these<00:01:52.380> franchises<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
keep talking about these franchises that

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.460 
keep talking about these franchises that
they<00:01:53.340> want<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.670> last<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.210> 10<00:01:54.420> years<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
they want to last for 10 years now you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
they want to last for 10 years now you
think<00:01:55.649> about<00:01:55.710> gears<00:01:56.250> when<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.240> first<00:01:57.420> released

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
think about gears when it first released

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.950 
think about gears when it first released
two<00:01:58.079> gears<00:01:58.670> 3<00:01:59.670> or<00:01:59.909> judgment<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> didn't<00:02:00.810> quite

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
two gears 3 or judgment it didn't quite

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.700 
two gears 3 or judgment it didn't quite
last<00:02:01.320> 10<00:02:01.590> years<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:04.290> interview

decade so you know that's kind of
something<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.319> think<00:02:16.470> about<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> know<00:02:17.010> in

something to think about it you know in

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.920 
something to think about it you know in
terms<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.580> pacing<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.269> how<00:02:18.480> often<00:02:18.810> they

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
terms of pacing for this how often they

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.289 
terms of pacing for this how often they
want<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> release<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.620> game<00:02:20.000> seems<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.120> each

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
want to release the game seems like each

want to release the game seems like each
one<00:02:21.569> if<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:22.379> they<00:02:22.590> plan<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.980> go<00:02:23.099> ten<00:02:23.340> years<00:02:23.640> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
one if if they plan to go ten years is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.399 
one if if they plan to go ten years is
probably<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.390> pretty<00:02:24.450> big<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.140> last

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
a little bit about was movement and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.170 
a little bit about was movement and
gears<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.720> war<00:02:48.870> for<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.500> what<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.519> guys<00:02:50.670> kind

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
gears of war for and what you guys kind

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.780 
gears of war for and what you guys kind
of<00:02:51.269> want<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:52.049> resemble<00:02:52.890> now<00:02:53.099> judgments

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
of want it to resemble now judgments

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.569 
of want it to resemble now judgments
movement<00:02:54.150> was<00:02:54.269> actually<00:02:54.660> pretty<00:02:55.379> good<00:02:55.739> in

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
movement was actually pretty good in

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.460 
movement was actually pretty good in
terms<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.359> know<00:02:57.390> while<00:02:57.690> bouncing<00:02:58.170> flew

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
terms of you know while bouncing flew

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.979 
terms of you know while bouncing flew
fluidity<00:02:59.150> seemed<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.450> was<00:03:00.540> pretty<00:03:00.690> good

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
fluidity seemed like it was pretty good

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.130 
fluidity seemed like it was pretty good
I<00:03:01.560> think<00:03:02.099> years<00:03:02.670> three<00:03:02.909> they're<00:03:03.720> pretty<00:03:03.989> close

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
I think years three they're pretty close

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.130 
I think years three they're pretty close
for<00:03:04.500> me<00:03:04.640> in<00:03:05.640> terms<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:06.060> overall<00:03:06.209> movement<00:03:06.780> I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
for me in terms of overall movement I

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.440 
for me in terms of overall movement I
don't<00:03:07.950> want<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> go<00:03:08.400> back<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.579> gears<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.390> I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
don't want to go back to gears to and I

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.630 
don't want to go back to gears to and I
don't<00:03:09.510> particularly<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.680> gears<00:03:11.010> one<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.549> you

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
don't particularly like gears one if you

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.610 
don't particularly like gears one if you
go<00:03:11.790> back<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.180> play<00:03:12.359> gears<00:03:12.599> one<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.349> those<00:03:13.470> of

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
go back and play gears one for those of

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.309 
go back and play gears one for those of
you<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.859> are<00:03:14.010> still<00:03:14.220> playing<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:15.690> feels

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
you that are still playing it feels

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.949 
you that are still playing it feels
sluggish<00:03:17.209> that's<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.359> only<00:03:18.510> way<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.720> put

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
sluggish that's the only way I can put

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.960 
sluggish that's the only way I can put
it<00:03:19.019> feels<00:03:19.319> kind<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.590> sluggish<00:03:19.829> I'm<00:03:20.190> opening

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
it feels kind of sluggish I'm opening

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.390 
it feels kind of sluggish I'm opening
for<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> 60<00:03:21.930> FPS<00:03:22.290> very<00:03:22.620> smooth<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.250> feel

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
for like a 60 FPS very smooth I feel

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400 
for like a 60 FPS very smooth I feel
like<00:03:23.459> wall<00:03:23.760> balancing<00:03:24.180> at<00:03:24.269> 60fps<00:03:24.690> will<00:03:25.200> feel

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
like wall balancing at 60fps will feel

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.210 
like wall balancing at 60fps will feel
so<00:03:25.680> good<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:28.079> would<00:03:28.410> prefer<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.859> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
so good and I would prefer that the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.460 
so good and I would prefer that the
controls<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.030> movement<00:03:30.629> feel<00:03:30.840> very<00:03:31.079> similar

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
controls and movement feel very similar

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.220 
controls and movement feel very similar
to<00:03:31.500> gears<00:03:31.859> 3<00:03:32.250> or<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:33.329> some<00:03:33.510> cases<00:03:33.569> judgment<00:03:34.139> not

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
to gears 3 or in some cases judgment not

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.839 
to gears 3 or in some cases judgment not
necessarily<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.829> controls<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.370> judgment

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
necessarily the controls for judgment

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.229 
necessarily the controls for judgment
but<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.780> movement<00:03:37.230> was<00:03:37.290> pretty<00:03:37.650> fluid<00:03:38.120> one<00:03:39.120> of

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
but the movement was pretty fluid one of

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.930 
but the movement was pretty fluid one of
the<00:03:39.329> things<00:03:39.919> very<00:03:40.919> quickly<00:03:41.099> before<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.639> sign

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
off here is that with wall bouncing

there's<00:03:45.299> been<00:03:45.769> not<00:03:46.769> necessarily<00:03:47.730> uh<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.629> know

there's been not necessarily uh you know

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.720 
there's been not necessarily uh you know
people<00:03:48.989> against<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:49.949> more<00:03:50.310> about<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
people against it but more about the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.780 
people against it but more about the
argument<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.329> it's<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.629> broken<00:03:52.109> mechanic<00:03:52.790> and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
argument that it's a broken mechanic and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.129 
argument that it's a broken mechanic and
I've<00:03:54.030> seen<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.299> number<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.690> people<00:03:54.810> talk<00:03:55.109> about

I've seen a number of people talk about

I've seen a number of people talk about

this based off of hit boxes and showing

this based off of hit boxes and showing
how<00:03:58.379> shocked<00:03:58.680> should<00:03:58.889> hit<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.310> wall

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489

they're not wall bouncers themselves and

they're not wall bouncers themselves and
they<00:04:16.320> don't<00:04:16.440> use<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.859> or<00:04:17.010> they<00:04:17.099> don't<00:04:17.489> like<00:04:17.760> it

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
they don't use it or they don't like it

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.259 
they don't use it or they don't like it
so<00:04:18.959> I'm<00:04:19.650> kind<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.919> wondering<00:04:20.130> if<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:21.120> know

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
so I'm kind of wondering if you know

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.500 
so I'm kind of wondering if you know
people<00:04:22.219> start<00:04:23.219> championing<00:04:23.669> behind<00:04:24.060> no<00:04:24.270> wall

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
people start championing behind no wall

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.480 
people start championing behind no wall
balancing<00:04:25.020> what<00:04:25.710> their<00:04:25.919> argument

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
balancing what their argument

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.820 
balancing what their argument
would<00:04:26.669> be<00:04:26.880> if<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.270> was<00:04:27.419> hit<00:04:27.569> boxes<00:04:27.990> or<00:04:28.259> you<00:04:28.710> know

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
would be if it was hit boxes or you know

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.960 
would be if it was hit boxes or you know
they<00:04:28.979> didn't<00:04:29.160> like<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.490> felt<00:04:29.639> like<00:04:29.789> it<00:04:29.880> was

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
they didn't like it I felt like it was

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.809 
they didn't like it I felt like it was
broken<00:04:30.389> versus<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.139> crowd<00:04:31.889> that<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.729> know

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
broken versus the crowd that you know

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.089 
broken versus the crowd that you know
really<00:04:33.030> enjoys<00:04:33.449> personally<00:04:34.020> I'm<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.530> love<00:04:34.800> wall

bouncing<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:36.300> know<00:04:36.389> I<00:04:36.419> feel<00:04:36.599> like<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.960> adds

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
bouncing you know I feel like it adds

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.460 
bouncing you know I feel like it adds
another<00:04:37.740> layer<00:04:38.069> of<00:04:38.130> skill<00:04:38.759> to<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.389> game<00:04:39.720> you

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
another layer of skill to the game you

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.990 
another layer of skill to the game you
know<00:04:40.560> if<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.009> have<00:04:41.099> a<00:04:41.130> harder<00:04:41.430> time<00:04:41.460> tracking

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
know if you have a harder time tracking

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.659 
know if you have a harder time tracking
your<00:04:42.240> opponents<00:04:42.840> obviously<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.979> kind<00:04:44.580> of

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
your opponents obviously that kind of

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.629 
your opponents obviously that kind of
raises<00:04:44.819> the<00:04:45.889> skill<00:04:46.889> curve<00:04:47.130> there<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.430> little

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
raises the skill curve there a little

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.570 
raises the skill curve there a little
bit<00:04:47.789> but<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:49.530> know<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.979> other<00:04:50.039> thing<00:04:50.160> is<00:04:50.310> you

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
bit but you know the other thing is you

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.839 
bit but you know the other thing is you
know<00:04:50.729> I<00:04:50.789> use<00:04:51.000> alternate<00:04:51.539> control<00:04:51.900> scheme<00:04:52.229> so

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
know I use alternate control scheme so

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.909 
know I use alternate control scheme so
you<00:04:53.849> know<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.090> fact<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:55.050> think<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:55.740> is

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
you know the fact that I think this is

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.499 
you know the fact that I think this is
also<00:04:56.099> reported<00:04:56.729> this<00:04:56.880> someone<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.330> came

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
also reported this someone that came

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.930 
also reported this someone that came
into<00:04:57.690> our<00:04:57.900> stream<00:04:58.530> earlier<00:04:58.860> today<00:04:59.099> talked

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
into our stream earlier today talked

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.550 
into our stream earlier today talked
about<00:05:00.090> them<00:05:00.750> saying<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.139> they're<00:05:01.349> going<00:05:01.470> to

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
about them saying that they're going to

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.200 
about them saying that they're going to
return<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.009> the<00:05:02.099> old<00:05:02.250> control<00:05:02.699> scheme<00:05:02.940> i<00:05:03.030> don't

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
return to the old control scheme i don't

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.600 
return to the old control scheme i don't
know<00:05:03.270> if<00:05:03.360> that's<00:05:03.479> confirmed<00:05:03.990> or<00:05:04.259> not<00:05:04.289> but<00:05:05.280> if

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
know if that's confirmed or not but if

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.129 
know if that's confirmed or not but if
that's<00:05:05.789> the<00:05:05.909> case<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:06.509> play<00:05:06.690> alternate

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
that's the case and you play alternate

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.510 
that's the case and you play alternate
control<00:05:07.470> scheme<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:07.830> seems<00:05:08.130> like<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.340> would<00:05:08.400> be

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
control scheme it seems like it would be

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.370 
control scheme it seems like it would be
pretty<00:05:08.729> good<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:09.330> really<00:05:09.870> interested<00:05:10.289> to<00:05:10.349> hear

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380
