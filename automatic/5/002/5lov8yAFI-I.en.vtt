it's<00:02:21.410> filmed<00:02:21.860> from<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> side<00:02:22.489> where<00:02:23.480> we're

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
it's filmed from the side where we're

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.470 
it's filmed from the side where we're
already<00:02:23.840> slated<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.640> can<00:02:25.850> start<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.239> see

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
already slated so you can start to see

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.820 
already slated so you can start to see
how<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:28.000> back<00:02:29.000> after<00:02:29.209> is<00:02:29.390> slated<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:29.930> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
how the back after is slated in and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.030 
how the back after is slated in and
whether<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.880> probably<00:02:32.690> go<00:02:32.780> too<00:02:33.019> far<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.680> often

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
whether it probably go too far we often

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.600 
whether it probably go too far we often
need<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.549> put<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:35.030> piece<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:36.220> timber<00:02:37.220> through

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
need to put a piece of timber through

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.360 
need to put a piece of timber through
here<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.630> area<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:41.000> take<00:02:41.239> up<00:02:41.720> feed<00:02:42.620> rate<00:02:43.220> to

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
here this area to take up feed rate to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.120 
here this area to take up feed rate to
take<00:02:43.579> up<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.850> thickness<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.829> slight

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
take up the thickness but the slight

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.039 
take up the thickness but the slight
because<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.700> one<00:02:46.880> otherwise<00:02:47.180> will<00:02:47.630> rattle

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
because this one otherwise will rattle

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.479 
because this one otherwise will rattle
once<00:02:48.980> we<00:02:49.100> come<00:02:49.310> across<00:02:49.400> here

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
once we come across here

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.119 
once we come across here
let's<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.659> this<00:02:52.409> game<00:02:52.709> will<00:02:52.859> vary

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
let's do that this game will vary

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.149 
let's do that this game will vary
depending<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.879> suit<00:02:54.239> where<00:02:54.390> you're<00:02:54.510> using

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
depending on the suit where you're using

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:05.080 
depending on the suit where you're using
we<00:02:56.159> just<00:02:59.209> a<00:03:00.209> narrow<00:03:00.359> piece<00:03:00.599> into<00:03:00.959> position<00:03:03.530> and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
we just a narrow piece into position and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.050 
we just a narrow piece into position and
what<00:03:06.090> we're<00:03:06.239> looking<00:03:06.329> for<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.370> sort<00:03:08.639> of<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
what we're looking for the sort of the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.789 
what we're looking for the sort of the
same<00:03:09.299> height<00:03:09.540> really<00:03:09.780> as<00:03:10.170> we've<00:03:10.349> got<00:03:10.560> here

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
same height really as we've got here

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.429 
same height really as we've got here
we've<00:03:11.180> got<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.329> this<00:03:12.420> stage<00:03:12.719> you<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.079> recap

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
we've got to this stage you just recap

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.309 
we've got to this stage you just recap
in<00:03:13.650> with<00:03:13.799> power<00:03:14.219> soaking<00:03:15.120> up<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.329> side<00:03:15.540> we've

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
in with power soaking up a side we've

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.500 
in with power soaking up a side we've
slated<00:03:16.799> as<00:03:17.010> much<00:03:17.250> as<00:03:17.400> we<00:03:17.519> possibly<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:18.150> and

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
slated as much as we possibly can and

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.369 
slated as much as we possibly can and
now<00:03:19.609> we're<00:03:20.609> going<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.790> fit<00:03:20.939> the<00:03:21.030> bat<00:03:21.180> gala<00:03:21.420> sole

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
now we're going to fit the bat gala sole

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.099 
now we're going to fit the bat gala sole
boards<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:23.299> little<00:03:24.299> children<00:03:24.450> fill<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.959> here

hair it fits the reason the soul is in
place<00:03:50.099> there<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:52.099> twofold

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
place there is twofold

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.920 
place there is twofold
really<00:03:53.519> if<00:03:53.969> anyone's<00:03:54.389> at<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.569> back<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.870> the

really if anyone's at the back of the
chimney<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.349> gives<00:03:55.530> them<00:03:55.620> an<00:03:55.680> opportunity<00:03:55.739> for

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
chimney it gives them an opportunity for

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.589 
chimney it gives them an opportunity for
someone<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.549> step<00:03:56.729> on<00:03:56.940> without<00:03:57.060> breaking<00:03:57.510> the

someone to step on without breaking the
slates<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.139> secondly<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.669> stops<00:04:00.060> the

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
slates and secondly it stops the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.479 
slates and secondly it stops the
build-up<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.629> leaves<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.290> debris<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:02.280> fact

winter dryer and and the wind of rain to

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.899 
winter dryer and and the wind of rain to
actually<00:04:07.319> get<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.340> off<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.609> roof<00:04:09.560> however

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
actually get it off the roof however

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.399 
actually get it off the roof however
because<00:04:11.909> the<00:04:12.209> step<00:04:12.479> flashing<00:04:12.629> hasn't<00:04:13.290> been

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
because the step flashing hasn't been

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.170 
because the step flashing hasn't been
done<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.769> will<00:04:13.859> need<00:04:14.189> to<00:04:14.370> lift<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.760> because

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
done I will need to lift this because

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.379 
done I will need to lift this because
it's<00:04:15.299> got<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.510> go<00:04:15.629> behind<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:17.220> we'll<00:04:17.459> do<00:04:18.299> the

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
it's got to go behind so we'll do the

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.649 
it's got to go behind so we'll do the
setback<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.989> next<00:04:19.320> before<00:04:20.220> we<00:04:20.549> proceed<00:04:20.759> to<00:04:21.209> the

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
setback in next before we proceed to the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.920 
setback in next before we proceed to the
weathering<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:23.669> back<00:04:23.789> gather<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.810> other

weathering of the back gather the other
measurement<00:04:25.259> I<00:04:25.470> need<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.919> from<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.310> joint

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.740 
measurement I need is from this joint
here<00:04:26.909> I'm<00:04:27.060> not<00:04:27.180> going<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.389> bother<00:04:27.479> with<00:04:27.630> that

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
here I'm not going to bother with that

here I'm not going to bother with that
one<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.199> could<00:04:28.770> cut<00:04:29.009> that<00:04:29.159> one<00:04:29.340> out<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.610> do<00:04:29.699> it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
one I could cut that one out and do it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.270 
one I could cut that one out and do it
there<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.930> piece<00:04:31.409> of<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.740> found<00:04:32.130> is

a lot if I cut that off so I might as

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.100 
a lot if I cut that off so I might as
well<00:06:16.730> put<00:06:16.970> the<00:06:17.120> lot<00:06:17.270> in<00:06:17.450> it<00:06:17.600> gives<00:06:17.720> us<00:06:17.810> prettier

will<00:07:00.110> then<00:07:00.139> go<00:07:00.409> out<00:07:00.559> the<00:07:00.709> top<00:07:00.739> there<00:07:02.709> covering

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:03.709 
will then go out the top there covering

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:15.459 
will then go out the top there covering
the<00:07:03.889> existing<00:07:04.339> lid<00:07:13.449> what<00:07:14.449> I<00:07:14.479> think<00:07:14.899> sometimes

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:15.469 
the existing lid what I think sometimes

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:16.689 
the existing lid what I think sometimes
do<00:07:15.679> when<00:07:15.860> you<00:07:15.979> get<00:07:16.099> them<00:07:16.219> like<00:07:16.369> that<00:07:16.519> the

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:16.699 
do when you get them like that the

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.100 
do when you get them like that the
bricklayer<00:07:17.029> comes<00:07:17.360> along<00:07:17.659> who<00:07:17.809> puts<00:07:17.989> the

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
bricklayer comes along who puts the

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.259 
bricklayer comes along who puts the
brickwork<00:07:18.499> on<00:07:18.739> top<00:07:19.009> and<00:07:19.519> he<00:07:19.699> might<00:07:19.879> knock<00:07:20.089> it

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:20.269 
brickwork on top and he might knock it

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:22.029 
brickwork on top and he might knock it
up<00:07:20.329> out<00:07:20.539> away<00:07:20.809> so<00:07:20.869> what<00:07:21.229> I<00:07:21.259> often<00:07:21.589> do<00:07:21.769> is<00:07:21.800> get

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 
up out away so what I often do is get

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:29.799 
up out away so what I often do is get
yourself<00:07:22.129> or<00:07:22.459> now<00:07:22.610> find<00:07:23.539> it<00:07:23.689> joint<00:07:28.779> and<00:07:29.779> just

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:29.809 
yourself or now find it joint and just

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:32.409 
yourself or now find it joint and just
put<00:07:30.259> it<00:07:30.379> in<00:07:30.529> just<00:07:31.069> to<00:07:31.189> stop<00:07:31.399> it<00:07:31.549> moving<00:07:31.699> once

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419 
put it in just to stop it moving once

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:34.509 
put it in just to stop it moving once
the<00:07:32.569> cement<00:07:32.929> or<00:07:33.169> mortars<00:07:33.679> on<00:07:33.860> top<00:07:34.039> of<00:07:34.189> it<00:07:34.309> it<00:07:34.459> is

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:34.519 
the cement or mortars on top of it it is

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:36.699 
the cement or mortars on top of it it is
not<00:07:34.759> going<00:07:34.939> anywhere<00:07:35.110> yeah<00:07:36.110> this<00:07:36.409> particular

closest<00:07:37.369> reasonably<00:07:38.149> neat<00:07:38.360> however<00:07:39.139> this<00:07:39.289> can

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:39.529 
closest reasonably neat however this can

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:43.029 
closest reasonably neat however this can
be<00:07:39.679> trimmed<00:07:40.099> to<00:07:40.429> shoot<00:07:41.229> whatever<00:07:42.229> profile<00:07:42.860> you

might have in this area I you can take

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:51.100 
might have in this area I you can take
it<00:07:47.569> back<00:07:47.749> slightly<00:07:48.219> on<00:07:49.219> that<00:07:49.459> line<00:07:50.110> and

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.110 
it back slightly on that line and

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.989 
it back slightly on that line and
obviously<00:07:51.860> the<00:07:52.159> same<00:07:52.339> on<00:07:52.489> the<00:07:52.579> other<00:07:52.610> side

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:52.999 
obviously the same on the other side

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:55.959 
obviously the same on the other side
all<00:07:53.419> right<00:07:53.569> that's<00:07:53.779> been<00:07:53.959> fairly<00:07:54.169> clear<00:07:54.969> also

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:55.969 
all right that's been fairly clear also

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.119 
all right that's been fairly clear also
be<00:07:56.119> looking<00:07:56.389> at<00:07:56.509> later<00:07:56.689> on<00:07:56.989> how<00:07:57.619> we<00:07:57.679> can<00:07:57.979> do

00:07:58.119 --> 00:07:58.129 
be looking at later on how we can do

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:01.839 
be looking at later on how we can do
this<00:07:58.309> when<00:07:58.519> we're<00:07:58.639> using<00:07:58.929> tiles<00:08:00.129> the<00:08:01.129> oath<00:08:01.550> the
