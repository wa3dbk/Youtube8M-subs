00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120

 a carton of condensed milk and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.920
 a box of strawberries 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.730
 we'll start by separating the whites from 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.920
 egg yolk 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.129
 I'll put it clear since where I go 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:00.300
 beat alla in the snow and I'll put the yolk 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:02.969
 a little pot separating okay then I will 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280
 start beating the whites in snow you 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.720
 can set at low speed when 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.720
 she spas you increase speed 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.140
 when I have it at that point as soon as 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 You turn into a bowl and it does not fall. 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 You see, it 's the ideal spot there. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.590
 knock back 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.320
 and add the gems there you give a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.189
 And then we go. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.689
 add sugar 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.990
 You'll slowly put it on and go. 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.460
 move until incorporating everything 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.460
 ingredients and kuna 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.820
 and it is non-stop to beat everyone can 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.820
 hit and put 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.560
 O 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.690
 now I'm going to start putting here the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.400
 strawberry flavor mixture is that 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.790
 knecht click and we will continue 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.500
 knocking and putting it will make a 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.500
 bit of dirt but it's normal 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.610
 there you can help with a spatula 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.370
 take a little sticking with the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.380
 flour so it sticks sometimes in the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.209
 sometimes at the bottom of the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.580
 mixer then you can help with a 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.290
 spatula to release side and bottom 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.990
 That's when I'm going to start putting the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.200
 wheat flour, we are going to put a 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.510
 little of the wheat flour and we go 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.620
 have her with the water in a cup 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.209
 of water 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.620
 this water helfer vita 'she is then 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.620
 boiling water temperature 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.720
 There you put some flour. 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.170
 expects to absorb and puts a little 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:13.070
 until the water and flour have run out 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:15.200
 You're interspersing there now I'm 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:22.880
 putting powdered yeast that the last 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:25.670
 thing that we do give you a 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.920
 And here we can stop. 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.739
 to hit 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.670
 here i am using a smeared form 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:38.690
 with margarine and wheat flour 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.450
 I'll put here all the dough has to 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.140
 being a big shape is because this 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.730
 mass it grows a lot 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.000
 Then I'll take it to the preheated oven. 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.829
 for about 30 minutes or until 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.190
 she looks golden 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.790
 meanwhile I'll prepare the tail is 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.220
 only put the strawberries already washed and 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.709
 cut so his tip is not 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.230
 with sour cream and condensed milk 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.660
 in a blender 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.329
 will be just putting the three ingredients 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.190
 and hit 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.320
 if you want to separate some 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.690
 strawberries for the decoration but there 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.789
 optional 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.769
 Let's hit the three minutes. 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.769
 until well homogeneous 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:33.889
 so it's only you uninform your cake 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.990
 There you go and get your tail. 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.210

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.759

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.569

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.969
 The cake inside the cake is also 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:54.529
 very wet inside and there you 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:56.449
 This is quite a rule for the 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:59.719
 The way that you think it will be good 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:07.189
