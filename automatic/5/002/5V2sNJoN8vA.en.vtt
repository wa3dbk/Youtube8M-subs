00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you have to do is just go round in a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
you have to do is just go round in a
circle<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.789> Buddha<00:00:29.970> room<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.929> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
all there is to it it's an easy loop

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.030 
all there is to it it's an easy loop
there's<00:00:33.059> nothing<00:00:33.450> tricky<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.860> there's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and then do two separate loops that's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.240

which is one by with teddy bears there's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
which is one by with teddy bears there's
the<00:01:24.960> window<00:01:25.229> spawn<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.009> jump<00:01:26.310> up

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the window spawn and then they jump up

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.090 
the window spawn and then they jump up
from<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:28.049> area<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.680> you'll<00:01:28.860> see

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
defensive positions which I will be

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.109 
defensive positions which I will be
going<00:01:42.450> over<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.619> next<00:01:43.740> few<00:01:43.950> videos<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:45.090> i
