month okay I'm gonna start with a G

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.779 
month okay I'm gonna start with a G
chord<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:23.390> right<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.320> right<00:00:25.830> hand<00:00:25.860> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
chord and right now the right hand the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.029 
chord and right now the right hand the
right<00:00:26.820> hand<00:00:26.940> fingers<00:00:27.710> designating<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.830> this

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
right hand fingers designating like this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.930 
right hand fingers designating like this
the<00:00:29.190> thumb<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> designated<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:31.289> six<00:00:31.650> v<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the thumb is designated to the six v and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
the thumb is designated to the six v and
the<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.300> strength<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.420> then<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.350> third

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the for strength and then for the third

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.080 
the for strength and then for the third
second<00:00:38.430> first<00:00:38.460> strength

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
second first strength

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.470 
second first strength
it's<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.810> third<00:00:40.290> string<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.620> your<00:00:40.860> index

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
it's the third string is your index

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.630 
it's the third string is your index
second<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.720> metal<00:00:43.050> finger<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.770> first

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
second at your metal finger and first

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.920 
second at your metal finger and first
ring<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.180> ring

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.270 

so<00:00:51.770> here's<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.070> G<00:00:52.340> pattern<00:00:52.840> they<00:00:53.840> go<00:00:53.990> six<00:00:54.560> and

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
so here's a G pattern they go six and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.440 
so here's a G pattern they go six and
these<00:00:55.430> are<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:55.670> strings<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.240> comma<00:00:56.480> six

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
these are the strings and comma six

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:08.140 
these are the strings and comma six
second<00:00:59.950> or<00:01:01.360> first<00:01:02.680> six<00:01:03.940> second<00:01:04.940> or<00:01:05.770> third<00:01:07.150> that

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
second or first six second or third that

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.020 
second or first six second or third that
goes

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.179 

slower

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.630 

faster

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.970 

now<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.570> C<00:01:21.750> chord<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.290> same<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> G

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
now the C chord is the same as a G

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.530 
now the C chord is the same as a G
except<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.700> lowest<00:01:23.970> note<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> base

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
except for the lowest note on the base

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
except for the lowest note on the base
it's<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.080> end<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> fifth

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it's going to be end up on the fifth

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.940 
it's going to be end up on the fifth
string<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.500> goes<00:01:28.910> 5th<00:01:30.380> second<00:01:31.430> for<00:01:32.540> first

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
string so that goes 5th second for first

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:46.240 
string so that goes 5th second for first
six<00:01:35.120> second<00:01:36.120> for

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.200 

now<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.290> decor<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.770> thumb<00:01:49.130> ranat<00:01:49.790> thum<00:01:49.820> is

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
now the decor the thumb ranat thum is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.680 
now the decor the thumb ranat thum is
going<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.450> be<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.780> fourth<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.560> third<00:01:51.590> and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
going to be the fourth and the third and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.690 
going to be the fourth and the third and
then<00:01:53.690> index<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.440> on<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.830> second<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.460> the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
then index is on the second and the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.000 
then index is on the second and the
middle<00:01:55.940> fingers<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.080> first<00:01:57.350> say<00:01:57.770> don't

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
middle fingers on the first say don't

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.609 
middle fingers on the first say don't
need<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.310> ring<00:01:58.460> finger<00:01:58.910> could<00:01:59.090> just

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.789 

so<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.700> goes<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.509> put<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.810> discussed<00:02:04.500> four

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
so that goes and I put a discussed four

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.339 
so that goes and I put a discussed four
in<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.109> D

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
in there so it's D

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.880 
in there so it's D
it's<00:02:09.859> gonna<00:02:10.039> be<00:02:10.189> four<00:02:11.019> second

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's gonna be four second

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.820 
it's gonna be four second
first<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.569> put<00:02:14.780> my<00:02:14.900> pinkie<00:02:15.230> down<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
first and I put my pinkie down for the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.540 
first and I put my pinkie down for the
sus4

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
sus4

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.509 
sus4
be<00:02:16.880> sus4<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.440> it's<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:19.390> second<00:02:20.390> third

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
be sus4 so it's for second third

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.300 
be sus4 so it's for second third
first<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.299> then<00:02:24.450> back<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.720> d4<00:02:26.090> second<00:02:28.310> wait

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
first and then back to d4 second wait

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.880 
first and then back to d4 second wait
for<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.900> last<00:02:31.230> part<00:02:31.500> goes<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:32.360> second<00:02:33.650> for

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
for the last part goes for second for

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.210 
for the last part goes for second for
strangled<00:02:37.770> under<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.890> goes

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.990 

you<00:02:42.640> know<00:02:42.790> slower<00:02:43.300> here<00:02:43.540> goes<00:02:43.690> deep

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
you know slower here goes deep

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.930 
you know slower here goes deep
he<00:02:46.480> says<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.580> me<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:52.680> second<00:02:53.680> back<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> the

he says for me for second back to the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.809 
he says for me for second back to the
