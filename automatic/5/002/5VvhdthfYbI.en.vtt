00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.660
 a greeting guys kept another 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
 video produced for you as has 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.450
 announced we arrived at the video in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.830
 which we can download 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.060
 the highly anticipated fifa trevi hundred from 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.980
 riccardo and was on the move a lot 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 francesco a ripa of this game too 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.260
 easy it seems too easy for us 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.599
 we show immediately we go straight to the point 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 we take this nice text file 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.480
 which demonstrates the link of utorrent that for 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.750
 those who do not know it still must copy 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.410
 this link that we put them here magni 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.280
 pursued so we make a nice copy 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.750
 and we are going to glue it on the key 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.969
 you have to press to the utorrent curlo 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.500
 we run after here if there is nothing here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.239
 we go for a feist splash boc 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 time joked hoc 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.680
 we will see that this appears to us this 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
 electrical interface but ok we already have 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.070
 obviously done therefore it will not be necessary to do 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.760
 anything 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.770
 this quite weighs a lot where it is 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.479
 turns it looks like such a thing 10 gb 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 so it will take a while to discharge 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 let's say this though very nice either 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.540
 beautiful we have this dmg file one 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.659
 once downloaded everything will go to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.450
 click twice and it will appear 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.729
 precisely this disk that is mounted in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.720
 practice you go to mount the image 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.820
 iso with this double click it pressed e 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.090
 we will find the scar icon 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.920
 now if you don't want to have to every time 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.110
 click on this to play 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.810
 dragging them into your folder 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 application or games or mac and things 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.189
 various where you want 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.439
 and precisely bees and bees in if into 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.740
 game can safely start us 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.860
 as we see on launchpad we have games 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.229
 here and father ricci you can see 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.619
 also the one you most black ops will be 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.560
 our next video or between two 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.660
 so much expected video I bet ce 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.009
 you asked so many but today it is 13 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.090
 had been requested by several people 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.680
 of course us 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.269
 let's start the video for problems 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.069
 of copyright and various things 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.610
 because you can't make videos of 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.280
 games just sure then 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.379
 at least not to us 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.640
 we have heard however that some computers 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.890
 some mac 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.010
 maybe I die old exactly as per 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.090
 example of the 2008 macbook pro 2009 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.920
 so it could tie a little however not 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.110
 there should be problems with us 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.150
 we have but slightly only 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.310
 on startup it didn't panic if there 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.890
 france shoe a moment after 5 seconds 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.880
 everything will be all right it's really easy 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.400
 video 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.860
 anciently already well dominating we wanted 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.470
 try to insert the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.989
 joystick to do it joystick of 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.150
 playstation exactly ie speak of 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.329
 playstation 3 but unfortunately we are not there 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.739
 failed even the mac succeeded in 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.120
 recognizing it is therefore not exactly 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.879
 we just managed to do it though 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.829
 we read that you can succeed then 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.620
 maybe try you maybe in the next ones 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.720
 days if we can figure out the way to 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.639
 connect it do with video to show them 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.160
 how to do it perfect 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.560
 as you see here still present and active 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.470
 our site where we just have 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.540
 published the keynote of the apple 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.430
 concerning ipad ipad exactly e 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.980
 we also published the video in 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.150
 merit precisely to this keynote the other 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.470
 yesterday 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.359
 go see it is not a good time me 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.639

 which is really very nice to see 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.700
 more and more people coming 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.609
 others instead to our channel though 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.049
 youtube occasionally plays tricks 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.470
 delete all inactive accounts 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.560
 like the other day it happened we were in 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.060
 2670 members fell to 2655 as well 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.630
 nothing is fine 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.160
