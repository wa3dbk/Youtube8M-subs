00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
snaps try to avoid the big play that's

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.490 
snaps try to avoid the big play that's
the<00:01:03.120> big<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:03.750> they<00:01:03.960> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> do

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the big thing I think they want to do

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500 
the big thing I think they want to do
they<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> try<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.729> us<00:01:05.850> balanced<00:01:06.299> up

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
they want to try to make us balanced up

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.620 
they want to try to make us balanced up
they<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.460> pass<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.880> well<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.360> run

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
they want to see you pass as well as run

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.380 
they want to see you pass as well as run
and<00:01:10.010> just<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.189> how<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.520> handle<00:01:11.729> both<00:01:12.060> phases

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and just see how they handle both phases

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
and just see how they handle both phases
so<00:01:12.869> i<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so i think that's that's going to be a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.160 
so i think that's that's going to be a
little<00:01:15.240> different<00:01:15.540> than<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:15.990> saw<00:01:16.140> last

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
little different than what we saw last

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
little different than what we saw last
week<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.799> texas<00:01:17.250> where<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.580> manned<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
week with texas where they manned up a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
week with texas where they manned up a
lot<00:01:18.360> forces<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.710> run<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.130> intricate

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lot forces to really run in intricate

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.499 
lot forces to really run in intricate
routes<00:01:20.970> made<00:01:21.750> us<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.200> work<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.650> timing<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
routes made us really work on timing and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
routes made us really work on timing and
overall<00:01:24.509> texas<00:01:24.990> wasn't<00:01:25.259> afraid<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> pressure

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
overall texas wasn't afraid to pressure

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
they did pressure and one time we hit

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609
