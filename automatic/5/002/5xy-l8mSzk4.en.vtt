00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.280 

what's<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.430> applied<00:01:40.790> side<00:01:41.300> of<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.110> life

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
what's the applied side of the life

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.890 
what's the applied side of the life
sciences<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.240> about<00:01:44.480> your<00:01:44.750> own

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
sciences I think and it's about your own

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.430 
sciences I think and it's about your own

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
it puts a human face on biology we deal

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.080 
it puts a human face on biology we deal
where<00:01:48.110> agriculture<00:01:48.740> meets<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.220> consumer<00:01:49.730> you

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
where agriculture meets the consumer you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.030 
where agriculture meets the consumer you
get<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.360> see<00:01:50.570> how<00:01:50.810> biological<00:01:51.200> science<00:01:51.920> is

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
get to see how biological science is

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.070 
get to see how biological science is
applied<00:01:52.160> first<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.090> foremost<00:01:53.480> in<00:01:53.690> everyday
