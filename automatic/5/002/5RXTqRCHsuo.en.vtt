always<00:02:37.040> accurate<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:38.209> always<00:02:38.390> wish<00:02:38.690> that

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
always accurate and I always wish that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.570

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
though it would be so overpowered it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.030

would<00:02:46.940> just<00:02:47.030> be<00:02:47.180> fun<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:47.959> of<00:02:48.530> course<00:02:48.590> that's

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
would just be fun but of course that's

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.080 
would just be fun but of course that's
never<00:02:49.250> gonna<00:02:49.400> happen<00:02:51.400> either<00:02:52.400> way<00:02:52.670> yeah<00:02:52.910> this
