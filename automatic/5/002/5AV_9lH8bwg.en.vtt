what investigators are telling us is

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.839 
what investigators are telling us is
that<00:00:28.109> human<00:00:28.859> error<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.189> course<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> always<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that human error of course is always a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.460 
that human error of course is always a
possibility<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.779> things<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.320> but

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
possibility with things like that but

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
possibility with things like that but
basically<00:00:31.590> they've<00:00:32.009> narrowed<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.460> down<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
basically they've narrowed it down to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.330 
basically they've narrowed it down to
engine<00:00:34.140> failure<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.829> very<00:00:35.130> much<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
engine failure which is very much a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.180 
engine failure which is very much a
possibility<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> yak-42<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.950> old

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
