lot<00:01:37.929> of<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.350> heavy<00:01:39.100> lifting<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:40.390> needed<00:01:40.630> to

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
lot of the heavy lifting that needed to

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.249 
lot of the heavy lifting that needed to
be<00:01:40.749> done<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.229> really<00:01:42.359> take<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.659> values<00:01:43.990> and

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
be done to really take the values and

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.349 
be done to really take the values and
principles<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.999> America<00:01:45.999> needs<00:01:46.569> to<00:01:46.659> recover

to<00:01:49.359> the<00:01:49.479> next<00:01:49.689> level<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.020> mean<00:01:50.049> really<00:01:50.319> to<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:51.130> lot

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
to the next level I mean really to a lot

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.309 
to the next level I mean really to a lot
of<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:51.880> works<00:01:52.030> been<00:01:52.240> solidified<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.020> it

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
of that works been solidified and it

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.840 
of that works been solidified and it
just<00:01:53.560> hasn't<00:01:53.770> been<00:01:54.009> applied<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.429> the<00:01:54.520> local

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
just hasn't been applied to the local

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.149 
just hasn't been applied to the local
process<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:56.200> we've<00:01:56.439> done<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.829> instead<00:01:57.039> of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
process and so we've done is instead of

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.739 
process and so we've done is instead of
writing<00:01:57.399> another<00:01:57.609> report<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.359> you<00:01:58.659> know

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
states have been very keen to take up

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.230 
states have been very keen to take up
there<00:04:47.580> an<00:04:48.120> article<00:04:48.510> 1<00:04:48.660> section<00:04:48.690> 10<00:04:50.000> ability<00:04:51.000> to

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
make gold and silver coin legal tender

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.810 
make gold and silver coin legal tender
and<00:04:55.010> we've<00:04:56.010> been<00:04:56.160> working<00:04:56.310> with<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.610> number

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
and we've been working with the number

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.210 
and we've been working with the number
of<00:04:56.880> states<00:04:57.470> trying<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.530> figure<00:04:58.740> out<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.860> best

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
of states trying to figure out the best

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.610 
of states trying to figure out the best
way<00:04:59.840> to<00:05:00.840> do<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:02.190> think<00:05:02.850> that<00:05:03.210> that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
way to do that and I think that that

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.860 
way to do that and I think that that
helps<00:05:04.620> advance<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:06.210> work<00:05:06.419> at<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.690> state

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
helps advance the the work at the state

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.930 
helps advance the the work at the state
level<00:05:06.990> as<00:05:07.290> well<00:05:07.530> as<00:05:07.770> then<00:05:08.010> puts<00:05:08.340> pressure<00:05:08.580> back

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
level as well as then puts pressure back

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.590 
level as well as then puts pressure back
on<00:05:08.970> Congress<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.750> take<00:05:10.850> some<00:05:11.850> role<00:05:12.150> or<00:05:12.389> some

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
on Congress to take some role or some

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.860 
on Congress to take some role or some
leadership<00:05:12.900> role<00:05:13.370> in<00:05:14.370> monetary<00:05:14.850> reform<00:05:15.090> so

to take to make circulation of gold and

impediment<00:05:39.419> still<00:05:39.979> exists<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.160> so<00:05:41.990> you<00:05:42.990> know

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
impediment still exists and so you know

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.279 
impediment still exists and so you know
in<00:05:43.200> an<00:05:43.289> ideal<00:05:43.620> world<00:05:44.690> you<00:05:45.690> just<00:05:45.960> go<00:05:46.110> straight

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
in an ideal world you just go straight

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.230 
in an ideal world you just go straight
to<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.620> IRS<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.460> change<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.940> interpretation

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
to the IRS and change the interpretation

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.450 
to the IRS and change the interpretation
but<00:05:48.960> I<00:05:49.020> think<00:05:49.349> the<00:05:49.440> stress<00:05:49.620> about<00:05:49.889> the<00:05:50.160> metals

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
but I think the stress about the metals

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.969 
but I think the stress about the metals
could<00:05:50.639> be<00:05:50.700> used<00:05:51.360> without<00:05:51.660> tax<00:05:52.139> consequences

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
could be used without tax consequences

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.770 
could be used without tax consequences
exactly<00:05:53.820> it's<00:05:54.000> not<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.479> legal<00:05:55.229> tender<00:05:55.560> per<00:05:55.710> se

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
exactly it's not the legal tender per se

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.450 
exactly it's not the legal tender per se
of<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:58.020> US<00:05:58.260> dollar<00:05:58.500> that<00:05:58.770> makes<00:05:59.039> the<00:05:59.310> use<00:05:59.430> of

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
of the US dollar that makes the use of

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.700 
of the US dollar that makes the use of
gold<00:05:59.789> silver<00:06:00.080> practically<00:06:01.080> impossible<00:06:01.320> it's

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
gold silver practically impossible it's

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.110 
gold silver practically impossible it's
the<00:06:01.830> tax<00:06:02.099> treatment<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.710> but<00:06:05.490> going<00:06:05.760> to

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
the tax treatment so but going to

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.589 
the tax treatment so but going to
Congress<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.110> asking<00:06:07.530> them<00:06:07.650> to<00:06:07.770> remove<00:06:08.599> you

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
Congress and asking them to remove you

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.240 
Congress and asking them to remove you
know<00:06:09.660> this<00:06:09.840> tax<00:06:10.080> status<00:06:10.320> of<00:06:10.590> gold<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:10.919> silver

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
know this tax status of gold and silver

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.219 
know this tax status of gold and silver
is<00:06:11.639> kind<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.360> like<00:06:12.449> going<00:06:12.630> to<00:06:12.750> Congress<00:06:13.080> and

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
is kind of like going to Congress and

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.480 
is kind of like going to Congress and
asking<00:06:13.470> them<00:06:13.560> to<00:06:13.770> implement<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.280> gold

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
asking them to implement the gold

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.939 
asking them to implement the gold
standard<00:06:14.669> it's<00:06:15.000> just<00:06:15.210> it's<00:06:15.449> a<00:06:15.690> it's<00:06:16.110> a<00:06:16.349> hard

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
standard it's just it's a it's a hard

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.770 
standard it's just it's a it's a hard
ask<00:06:17.160> without<00:06:17.370> political<00:06:17.729> movement<00:06:18.270> momentum

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
ask without political movement momentum

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.800 
ask without political movement momentum
and<00:06:18.930> so<00:06:19.849> what's<00:06:20.849> great<00:06:21.210> about<00:06:21.240> where<00:06:21.660> we<00:06:21.780> are

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810

to<00:07:12.770> a<00:07:12.800> state<00:07:13.130> as<00:07:13.840> the<00:07:14.840> legislation<00:07:15.560> gained

to a state as the legislation gained
some<00:07:16.130> momentum<00:07:16.190> or<00:07:16.550> it<00:07:16.610> looks<00:07:16.760> like<00:07:16.910> it's

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
some momentum or it looks like it's

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.050 
some momentum or it looks like it's
gonna<00:07:17.120> be<00:07:17.330> introduced<00:07:17.690> and<00:07:18.320> so<00:07:18.770> we<00:07:19.730> wouldn't

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 
gonna be introduced and so we wouldn't

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.870 
gonna be introduced and so we wouldn't
