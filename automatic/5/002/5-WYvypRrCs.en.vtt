always number one I think the coolest

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.710

thing<00:01:46.190> about<00:01:46.280> street<00:01:46.670> food<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.510> feel

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
thing about street food is that you feel

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.120 
thing about street food is that you feel
like<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.110> only<00:01:48.320> get<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.680> in<00:01:48.800> that<00:01:48.920> moment

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
like you can only get it in that moment

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.670 
like you can only get it in that moment
so<00:01:49.790> if<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:50.570> almost<00:01:50.750> like<00:01:50.930> it's

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
so if you see it it's almost like it's

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.930 
so if you see it it's almost like it's
kinda<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.010> ice<00:01:52.130> cream<00:01:52.340> truck<00:01:52.460> mentality

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
kinda like the ice cream truck mentality

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.980 
kinda like the ice cream truck mentality
if<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.150> have<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.360> like<00:01:53.450> chase<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.780> down<00:01:53.810> you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
have to have it then because you don't

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.130
