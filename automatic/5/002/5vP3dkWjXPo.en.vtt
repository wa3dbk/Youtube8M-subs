00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.070
 second part of necklaces with t-shirts 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.410
 we start 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.690
 let's see a new style now 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.540
 we fold the shirt back to the middle 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.820
 this time we are going to do it in color 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.740
 blue but remember that this is just one 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.289
 technique so is the color that you 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.050
 you want to wear shirts that you already go to 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.369
 throw away or you get old stained or 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.560
 broken 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.130
 We are going to cut several strips and we are going to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.340
 stretch request it roger and that makes 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.190
 a very father effect trims several strips 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.670
 because this time we're just going to 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.670
 use a color 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.850
 now let's join three strips makes a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.210
 knot in the part of up and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.020
 squeeze it very well let's make a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.600
 traditional braid 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.730
 do not squeeze your braid but if 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.880
 try this very straight so that the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.120
 press do not bend in the end we return 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.030
 to do another knot we tighten very well and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.760
 We cut the part that is left over from the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.920
 outside the knot let's do two 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.440
 braids a bit longer than the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.870
 other 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.510
 Now let's remember our strips of 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.870
 different sizes the idea is to have a 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.780
 necklace with different sizes of strips 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.710
 So short a bit longer 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 the one that follows a little more a little more 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.240
 small to make a style 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.310
 choker this will be very 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.040
 wide in the neck to join all 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.580
 our strips we are going to gather several 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.960
 small strips and we will sew them 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.480
 remember that you and what has to be very 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.140
 similar to the color of your shirt 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.080
 how are all all together and 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.900
 squeezes very well 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.260
 come back and put the needle back in 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.200
 all the ribbons of t- shirts 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.020
 now let's make a wider braid 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.390
 with all these strips we are going to live them 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.240
 between them 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.850
 the right should not be too tight 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.910
 leave a little loose 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.400
 At the end we can saturate the braid with 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.500
 some clothespins or with a piece 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.290
 for the hair this is so that it does not 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.079
 undo 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.859
 now in this wide braid we are going to join 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:28.560
 all our strips and the braids that 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:32.189
 they are all of different sizes 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 to sew it with the thread one by one and 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.689
 we tighten very well in all the braid 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.770
 this is so that it fits perfectly 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.990
 well fixed 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.240
 let's go picking one by one in the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.400
 braid since you have given several 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.070
 turns with the thread and the needle you can 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.310
 cut the excess of l several passes 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.740
 with the thread and the needle to cover this 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.310
 let's wrap it with a piece of ribbon 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.040
 of t-shirt well all that area that 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.650
 we just sew this will make it 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.590
 hide all the joints perfectly and that 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.090
 it's very nice this will give it a finish 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.310
 much more professional 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.920
 in the widest braid where we are 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.780
 placing all our pieces is going to be 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.750
 the back of our neck is 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.150
 say the nape so it should not be 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.180
 very wide 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.000
 Now we are going to sew the braid very well and 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.769
 about that piece we are going to unite all 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.530
 the others that we lack to do 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.930
 our necklace is to say let's do what 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.090
 same as the other side we are going to sew 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.150
 All parts of our necklace for 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.060
 do it as style chokers 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.640
 we cut what is left over from the braid and 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 Now let's roll up a piece of cloth 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.739
 again to give it a good finish and 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.739
 that all seams are not visible 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.690
 you can experiment with t-shirts 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.300
 other colors or even combine them Czech 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.800
 the last video where we use many 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.200
 colors of t-shirts 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.500
 this is the same example with another tone 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.020
 of t-shirt this shirt is navy blue and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.240
 the other one is a little lighter blue in 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.410
 The two of you are very proud with some jeans and 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.650
 a T-shirt 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.870
 original modern and can even be a 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.870
 cute detail try 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.400
 how little what is a very fine 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.950
 nobody would think that comes from a shirt 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.390
 if it's just the one we just made here 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.390
 there is the press 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.919
 we'll leave with the next 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.370

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:48.250

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.070
