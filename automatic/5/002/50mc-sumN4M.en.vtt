00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.960 
well as he's capable and I think Miami's
defense<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.560> better<00:02:02.770> than<00:02:02.920> its<00:02:03.100> showed<00:02:03.369> they

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
defense is better than its showed they

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.580 
defense is better than its showed they
got<00:02:04.119> a<00:02:04.149> bad<00:02:04.360> rap<00:02:04.570> against<00:02:04.960> new<00:02:05.140> england<00:02:05.170> which

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
got a bad rap against new england which

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.800 
got a bad rap against new england which
can<00:02:05.829> just<00:02:06.009> murder<00:02:06.369> any<00:02:06.579> defense<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.509> so

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
can just murder any defense and so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.409 
can just murder any defense and so
that's<00:02:08.349> on<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.920> miami<00:02:09.249> side<00:02:09.549> now<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.179> san

be more of an integral part of the
offense<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.050> year<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.530> more<00:02:40.740> carries<00:02:41.010> he's

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550

yards<00:02:43.980> run<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:45.570> San<00:02:45.870> Diego<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.320> being

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
yards run so I see San Diego as being

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.949 
yards run so I see San Diego as being
less<00:02:46.740> explosive<00:02:47.420> defensively<00:02:48.420> there<00:02:48.720> they're

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
less explosive defensively there they're

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.840 
less explosive defensively there they're
strong<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.070> number<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.490> total

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
strong there are number one in total

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.030 
strong there are number one in total
defense<00:02:51.000> last<00:02:51.480> year<00:02:51.780> they've<00:02:52.260> improved<00:02:52.709> in

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.410 
defense last year they've improved in
special<00:02:53.490> teams<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:54.060> they're<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.270> going<00:02:54.360> to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
special teams when they're not going to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.510 
special teams when they're not going to
give<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.870> number<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.770> returns<00:02:56.130> they<00:02:56.340> gave
