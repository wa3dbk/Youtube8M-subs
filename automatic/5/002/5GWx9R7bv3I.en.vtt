00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
by the way this is real carbon fiber I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.390 
by the way this is real carbon fiber I
think<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> overall<00:01:28.110> design<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> styling<00:01:29.220> on

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
changing the LED colors now it comes

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.190

with<00:02:35.010> three<00:02:35.250> sets<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.760> weights<00:02:36.030> these<00:02:36.510> are<00:02:36.780> two

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
with three sets of weights these are two

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.729 
with three sets of weights these are two
grams<00:02:37.560> these<00:02:38.280> are<00:02:38.760> four<00:02:39.150> grams<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.810> these<00:02:40.379> are

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
grams these are four grams and these are

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.530 
grams these are four grams and these are
six<00:02:41.099> grams<00:02:41.370> now<00:02:41.760> there's<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.000> correct<00:02:42.209> way<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
six grams now there's a correct way to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.390 
six grams now there's a correct way to
install<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.379> weights<00:02:43.560> first<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:44.129> you

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
install the weights first of all you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.280 
install the weights first of all you
will<00:02:44.549> need<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.819> take<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.329> top<00:02:45.690> such<00:02:46.049> and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
will need to take this top such and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.390 
will need to take this top such and
often<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.129> push<00:02:47.959> here<00:02:48.959> but<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:50.129> way

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
often to do so push here but that way

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.599 
often to do so push here but that way
very<00:02:51.209> important<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.230> once<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.590> do<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.829> it

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
very important and once you do that it

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.449 
very important and once you do that it
should<00:02:53.640> pop<00:02:54.120> right<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:55.379> lift<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:55.950> off<00:02:56.129> at

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
should pop right up then lift it off at

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.110 
should pop right up then lift it off at
the<00:02:56.790> back<00:02:57.170> there<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.620> little<00:02:58.890> rubber<00:02:59.430> holder

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the back there is a little rubber holder

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.740 
the back there is a little rubber holder
here<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.959> inside<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> then<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.569> would

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
here on the inside so then you would

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.390 
here on the inside so then you would
insert<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:05.549> weights<00:03:06.799> whichever<00:03:07.799> ones<00:03:08.069> that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
insert the weights whichever ones that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.449 
insert the weights whichever ones that
you<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:10.109> need<00:03:10.349> I'm<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.010> put<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
you think you need I'm going to put the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.050 
you think you need I'm going to put the
six<00:03:12.450> gram<00:03:13.049> weights<00:03:13.349> in<00:03:13.620> there<00:03:13.829> push<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.819> down

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
six gram weights in there push it down

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.220 
six gram weights in there push it down
and<00:03:15.959> then<00:03:17.239> position<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.299> like<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.019> I

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
and then position it like so and I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.140 
and then position it like so and I
should<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.560> snap<00:03:20.190> back<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.730> comes<00:03:20.880> with<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
should just snap back it comes with a

covered in silver and that's to reduce

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.710 
covered in silver and that's to reduce
the<00:03:41.190> resistance<00:03:41.669> now<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.359> software

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
the resistance now this is the software

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
the resistance now this is the software
it's<00:03:42.900> very<00:03:43.079> easy<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.440> use<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:43.799> extremely

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it's very easy to use but extremely
