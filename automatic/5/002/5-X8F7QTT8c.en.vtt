and<00:07:26.240> I<00:07:26.270> think<00:07:26.540> it<00:07:26.660> was<00:07:26.720> the<00:07:26.780> jacket<00:07:27.470> was<00:07:27.560> it<00:07:27.680> the

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
and I think it was the jacket was it the

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.680 
and I think it was the jacket was it the
jacket<00:07:28.160> that<00:07:28.310> got<00:07:28.430> the<00:07:28.520> double<00:07:28.790> inform<00:07:29.150> just
