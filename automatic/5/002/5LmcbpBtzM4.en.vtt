00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.490 

I<00:00:00.850> think<00:00:01.569> it's<00:00:01.660> fair<00:00:01.810> to<00:00:01.840> say<00:00:01.960> most<00:00:02.320> people

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.500 
I think it's fair to say most people

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.590 
I think it's fair to say most people
have<00:00:02.800> heard<00:00:02.860> of<00:00:03.040> Michael<00:00:03.340> Jordan<00:00:03.520> and<00:00:03.850> I

have heard of Michael Jordan and I

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.420

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
always I love asking the question did he

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.240 
always I love asking the question did he
win<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:08.080> much<00:00:08.320> because<00:00:08.680> he<00:00:08.770> was<00:00:08.889> that<00:00:09.070> much

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
win so much because he was that much

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.680 
win so much because he was that much
better<00:00:09.629> and<00:00:12.030> I've<00:00:13.030> been<00:00:13.150> fortunate<00:00:13.420> enough<00:00:13.570> to

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
better and I've been fortunate enough to

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.390 
better and I've been fortunate enough to
talk<00:00:13.930> to<00:00:14.049> a<00:00:14.320> couple<00:00:14.619> professional<00:00:15.160> players

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
talk to a couple professional players

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.999 
talk to a couple professional players
and<00:00:15.639> they<00:00:15.730> they<00:00:16.090> believed<00:00:16.360> that<00:00:16.589> he<00:00:17.589> was<00:00:17.740> just

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:18.009 
and they they believed that he was just

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.279 
and they they believed that he was just
better<00:00:20.009> which<00:00:21.009> is<00:00:21.039> my<00:00:21.250> point<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.960> believe

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
better which is my point they believe

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.909 
better which is my point they believe
that<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.660> I'm<00:00:25.990> gonna<00:00:26.169> get<00:00:26.349> into<00:00:26.529> Michael

to<00:01:26.440> get<00:01:26.560> dunked<00:01:26.980> on<00:01:27.070> by<00:01:27.570> spud<00:01:28.570> Webb<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:29.080> don't

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
to get dunked on by spud Webb I don't

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.420 
to get dunked on by spud Webb I don't
know<00:01:29.890> if<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.040> remember<00:01:30.340> him<00:01:30.430> no<00:01:31.030> offense<00:01:31.300> bud

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
know if we remember him no offense bud

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.590 
know if we remember him no offense bud
but<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.580> hurts<00:01:34.560> right<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.920> be<00:01:36.010> 67<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.450> get

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
but that hurts right to be 67 and get

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.390 
but that hurts right to be 67 and get
dunked<00:01:37.870> on<00:01:37.930> by<00:01:37.990> someone<00:01:38.410> who's<00:01:38.560> five<00:01:39.130> foot

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
dunked on by someone who's five foot

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.290 
dunked on by someone who's five foot
whatever<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.470> if<00:01:41.560> Jordan<00:01:41.950> dunks<00:01:42.310> on<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.460> if

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
whatever but if Jordan dunks on you if

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.950 
whatever but if Jordan dunks on you if
LeBron<00:01:43.750> dunks<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:45.070> hurts<00:01:45.660> but<00:01:46.660> you<00:01:46.810> can

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
LeBron dunks on you it hurts but you can

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.110 
LeBron dunks on you it hurts but you can
stomach<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.350> because<00:01:47.830> he's<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.640> best<00:01:49.980> and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
stomach that because he's the best and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.100 
stomach that because he's the best and
so<00:01:52.120> it<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:53.040> lends<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.460> tell<00:01:55.330> you<00:01:55.510> how<00:01:55.810> much

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
so it just lends to tell you how much

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.450 
so it just lends to tell you how much
how<00:01:57.040> strong<00:01:57.580> our<00:01:58.650> beliefs<00:01:59.650> are<00:01:59.860> not<00:02:00.220> even

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
how strong our beliefs are not even

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.640 
how strong our beliefs are not even
about<00:02:00.550> ourselves<00:02:00.790> but<00:02:01.390> about<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.630> world<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
about ourselves but about the world and

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.370 
about ourselves but about the world and
other<00:02:02.800> people<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.720> if<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.750> can<00:02:04.960> get<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.290> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
other people and if we can get to the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.930 
other people and if we can get to the
point<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.740> where<00:02:05.830> we<00:02:06.070> challenge<00:02:06.670> some<00:02:06.910> of

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
point to where we challenge some of

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.539 
point to where we challenge some of
those<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.500> start<00:02:08.500> interrupting<00:02:09.399> those

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
those and start interrupting those

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.610 
those and start interrupting those
patterns<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:10.209> those<00:02:10.299> thoughts<00:02:10.599> well<00:02:11.319> then<00:02:11.590> I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
patterns and those thoughts well then I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.250 
patterns and those thoughts well then I
think<00:02:11.680> we're<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.129> something
