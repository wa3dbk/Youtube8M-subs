00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.890
 today I will talk about my first 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.890
 impressions with moto g1 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 For those who do not know I'm making a 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.929
 series on the channel where I'm going to use it for 30 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 days 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 the engine and make all this transition to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 ideal is if android 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.199
 We are already in the third episode that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.199
 It's the day today that 's the video here. 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.060
 that the first impressions with motogp 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.160
 I will not talk about the system itself yet 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.990
 android will be another chapter that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.570
 I'll go deeper 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.640
 today it is only on the device the first 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.309
 positive point you notice when it is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.670
 when you pick up the appliance that part 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.559
 rounded and this background helps a lot 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.690
 you in the handling of the cell phone 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.860
 it is slightly larger than the iphone 5 s 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 What is my iphone? 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.910
 so you can have security for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 to play with one hand 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.820
 It's very cool, I found it very interesting. 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 I believe the iphone 6 is follow this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.930
 rounded maple line for you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.649
 able to hold the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.910
 appliance 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.299
 another detail that pleased me a lot 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.070
 it was the led that motogp has to stay 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.080
 targeting you when you have some 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.170
 notification any notification arrives 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 he will whistle and keep remembering 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.360
 that led you to see one thing for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 the more you see the notifications if 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.630
 still like penalty notifications it gets you 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.110
 telling me this is very interesting for 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.060
 who is in the running of a notification 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.009
 closes the phone and it is still there say 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.890
 Looks still have notice for you to see 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.119
 It's for those who have a hard life and like 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.329
 reminders etc 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 was how I use enough reminders in the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.470
 iphone this does not work for me is 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 horrible s reminders 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.860
 I know you end up forgetting something. 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.899
 that is there in notifications 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.399
 good bad reporting system for the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.070
 People are going to say that further. But 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.799
 This led is very helpful for the hard battery. 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.930
 more or less all day I used the 4g 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.909
 on all day I auditioned 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.450
 for a day the glass and stayed on 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.820
 I still have one of the 20% of the battery 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.280
 I used it intensely for five 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.229
 hours and left over and 19 hours 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.920
 We can share these 19 hours 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.080
 between standby by and a moderate use point 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.300
 negative 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.420
 the most negative point of the cell phone for me 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.190
 the engine g was the camera the camera for me 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.140
 and it was horrible 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.990
 the experience I practically took 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.630
 No photos so far, I really like 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.600
 take photos and with the iphone 50 shot photo 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.270
 of several things but with a motor g 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.190
 It just does not work, no photo comes out 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.950
 well I did not like the camera very much 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.530
 bad but should be the reason for the mobile 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.080
 It's cheaper than the others, right? 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.090
 it comes with 8 gb of capacity and this is 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.710
 a negative but not so negative point 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.170
 Why are you there enough? 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.510
 thing in the mobile application is pretty 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.330
 all useful apps any game 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.400
 such as it supports the eight gigas but you 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.709
 can expand so it is not a negative 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 so negative on the cell phone 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.720
 His entry is up here. 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.810
 I find this entry extremely obsolete 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.270
 they are on top because it is usually guard 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.310
 Pocket cell and then to pick up the 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.260
 People take it upside down, huh? 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.650
 and have to keep turning and when you 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.610
 is with a telephone with that wire 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.620
 It gets very bad, it gets down is 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.660
 too bad I do not think I know if they 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.150
 changed it in the new version but I found it 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.920
 I think this is a bad point in the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.010
 cell phone with a point that could enter 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.680
 in the system talking video but the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.959
 device itself with android it runs 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.150
 well however while you are transiting 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.430
 between the application and another it chokes 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.950
 too much and sometimes hangs and closes type 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.769
 spotify closes while I was in a 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.220
 So I thought it was pretty bad and that's 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.190
 despite the transition and navigation being 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.320
 very fast cell phone to him a cell phone 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.390
 much cheaper but analyzing it myself 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.610
 I found that many times the performance 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.370
 it falls too much and sometimes the application 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.890
 close and I'll give you an example 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.600
 when you 're listening to a song and then you 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.299
 is playing something and gets a 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.820
 you will receive an ok sap read the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.610
 know answers there comes twitter will read 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.709
 simply close the application is it 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.109
 can not handle the value of the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.419
 who searches only the internet is a little game 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.340
 social network is a great device 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.410
 especially if you do not care about 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.990
 camera quality now if you use the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.169
 app 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.509
 intensely as I use it is playing 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.630
 listening to music or tweeting and browsing 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.509
 there is this transition going to work well 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.020
 bad and maybe you do not like it that much 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.460
 intense use of the personal system 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.740
 summarizing this I hope you have 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.569
 I liked it, I'll continue another 20 days more 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.720
 or less with the cell phone 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:51.419
 I'll do android analysis is from 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.310
 system in comparison to the 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.970
 game I hope you are enjoying this 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.099
 series 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.360
 You like her like to help 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.669
 channel disclosure 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.440
 comment what you think about the series is 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.650
 your cell phone if you're watching 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.250
 To make that decision, I'm looks and 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.250
 this in the world
