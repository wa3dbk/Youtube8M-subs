00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.840
 esparto algete to 5 is not grace 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.790
 complete what I 'm seeing in the background 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.070
 right now it's another part of the relationship 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.320
 because the recording lasts much longer than 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.120
 what you have seen, I did not want to focus 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.250
 in the humor part but in the sitting 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.260
 that makes me and put it in a context that 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.220
 is the one that street view say 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.810
 you have context and have their part 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.580
 bastard so the part of a bonus 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.490
 according to another video that has come 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.060
