but let's talk about storing it anyway
isiliye<00:00:24.779> suggests<00:00:25.849> whenever<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.300> store<00:00:27.750> it

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
isiliye suggests whenever you store it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.380 
isiliye suggests whenever you store it
either<00:00:28.890> stand<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.760> vertically<00:00:31.430> silly<00:00:32.430> um

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
either stand it up vertically silly um

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.260 
either stand it up vertically silly um
stand<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.079> vertically<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.030> like<00:00:36.030> just

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
stand it up vertically and like just

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.750 
stand it up vertically and like just
leave<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> closet<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:38.010> back<00:00:38.190> make

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
leave it in a closet in the back make

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
leave it in a closet in the back make
sure<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.090> doesn't<00:00:39.210> fall<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:40.230> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
sure it doesn't fall down because you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010 
sure it doesn't fall down because you
know<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> hard<00:00:41.579> hit<00:00:41.879> would<00:00:42.270> probably<00:00:42.809> hurt

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
know like a hard hit would probably hurt

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.220 
know like a hard hit would probably hurt
it<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.800> most<00:00:43.950> definitely<00:00:44.250> heard<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.230> but

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it it would most definitely heard it but

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.040 
it it would most definitely heard it but

moving<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:10.580> hand<00:01:11.580> yeah<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> can't<00:01:12.330> really

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
moving it a hand yeah I can't really

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.800 
moving it a hand yeah I can't really
tell<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.960> does<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:14.369> start<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> lean<00:01:15.210> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
tell it does it will start to lean this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.800 
tell it does it will start to lean this
part<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.890> start<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.430> lean<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.420> that's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
part here will start to lean so that's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.830 
part here will start to lean so that's
why<00:01:19.020> i<00:01:19.049> recommend<00:01:19.470> laying<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.580> flat<00:01:21.030> with

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
why i recommend laying it down flat with

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.190 
why i recommend laying it down flat with
something<00:01:22.740> underneath<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.810> keep<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
something underneath just to keep it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.370 
something underneath just to keep it
straight<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.509> pretty<00:01:27.780> much<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
straight and that is pretty much at the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
straight and that is pretty much at the
bottom<00:01:28.979> piece<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:31.250> Paris<00:01:34.970> um<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:37.110> bottom

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
bottom piece just Paris um the bottom

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
bottom piece just Paris um the bottom
piece<00:01:37.590> doesn't<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.340> mean<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> lot

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
piece doesn't really mean you know a lot

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.929 
piece doesn't really mean you know a lot
of<00:01:39.299> special<00:01:39.780> care<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.189> teeth

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
of special care of these the teeth

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.660 
of special care of these the teeth
they're<00:01:42.600> pretty<00:01:42.840> well<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:46.130> but<00:01:47.130> yeah<00:01:47.369> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
they're pretty well on there but yeah I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.960 
they're pretty well on there but yeah I
i<00:01:47.970> I've<00:01:48.750> never<00:01:48.810> kept<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:49.770> very<00:01:50.280> long<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
i I've never kept one for very long I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.580 
i I've never kept one for very long I
usually<00:01:51.360> make<00:01:51.509> them<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.869> then<00:01:51.990> ship<00:01:52.229> them<00:01:52.439> out

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
usually make them and then ship them out

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.580 
usually make them and then ship them out
pretty<00:01:53.399> quick<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.829> i<00:01:56.450> definitely<00:01:57.450> recommend

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.289 

standing<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.799> either<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.790> kind<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
standing it up either like this kind of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.139 
standing it up either like this kind of
against<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.689> wall<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:05.909> at<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
against a wall not like not like at a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.050 
against a wall not like not like at a
hard<00:02:06.659> angle<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.409> i<00:02:07.649> don't<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.489> i<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.729> think

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
hard angle but i don't know i just think

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.520 
hard angle but i don't know i just think
this<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> best<00:02:09.629> i<00:02:09.840> think<00:02:09.869> laying<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.500> down

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
this is the best i think laying it down

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.500 
this is the best i think laying it down
horizontally<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.390> best<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.230> do

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
horizontally is the best but if you do

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.589 
horizontally is the best but if you do
want<00:02:13.659> to<00:02:13.780> stand<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.970> yeah<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.299> I<00:02:16.569> also

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
want to stand it up yeah and I also

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.149 
want to stand it up yeah and I also
think<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:18.519> best<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.540> if<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.860> can

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
think that it's best to if if you can

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.759 
think that it's best to if if you can
when<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.329> understand<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.379> some

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
when you get it I understand that some

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.559 
when you get it I understand that some
cons<00:02:24.099> won't<00:02:24.489> let<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.790> bring<00:02:25.030> something<00:02:25.329> this

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
cons won't let you bring something this

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.559 
cons won't let you bring something this
big<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:26.159> but<00:02:27.159> if<00:02:27.430> at<00:02:27.670> all<00:02:27.700> possible<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.510> do

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
big in but if at all possible I do

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.140 
big in but if at all possible I do
suggest<00:02:28.900> when<00:02:29.319> you<00:02:29.439> screw<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.829> together<00:02:30.150> glue

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
suggest when you screw it together glue

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.880 
suggest when you screw it together glue
it<00:02:31.299> together<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:32.019> keep<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.769> together

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
it together and keep it together

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.610 
it together and keep it together
permanently<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.909> think<00:02:34.659> that<00:02:34.840> would<00:02:35.379> just<00:02:35.560> be

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
permanently I think that would just be

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.910 
permanently I think that would just be
better<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.970> stability<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.590> if<00:02:38.829> you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
better for the stability but if you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.979 
better for the stability but if you
can't<00:02:39.129> do<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.489> because<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:40.209> Convention

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
can't do that because of Convention

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.699 
can't do that because of Convention
rules<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:43.060> okay<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.689> just<00:02:43.959> think<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.349> it's

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
rules it's okay I just think that it's

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.599 
rules it's okay I just think that it's
better<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.780> screw<00:02:46.829> inside<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.280> screw

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
better for the screw inside the screw

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.839 
better for the screw inside the screw
and<00:02:48.819> then<00:02:48.940> there's<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.560> thread<00:02:50.639> coupling<00:02:51.639> bit

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
and then there's a thread coupling bit

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.750 
and then there's a thread coupling bit
in<00:02:52.000> there<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.260> here<00:02:53.530> too<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.459> it's<00:02:54.609> not

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
in there and in here too so it's not

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.369 
in there and in here too so it's not
like<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.209> goes<00:02:55.359> into<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.690> wood<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.200> I

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
like it just goes into the wood but I

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.039 
like it just goes into the wood but I
just<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.069> it<00:02:57.489> would<00:02:57.940> be<00:02:58.000> stronger<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:58.900> it

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
just think it would be stronger if it

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.009 
just think it would be stronger if it
was<00:02:59.170> glued<00:02:59.409> together<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.790> okay<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.810> is

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
was glued together but okay that is

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.039 
was glued together but okay that is
pretty<00:03:02.049> much<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:04.060> care<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.359> your<00:03:04.810> time

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
pretty much it for the care of your time

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.379 
pretty much it for the care of your time
