as<00:02:32.500> well<00:02:33.190> as<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.550> speaker<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.300> speaker

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.760 
as well as the speaker and the speaker
is<00:02:35.710> actually<00:02:36.160> holes<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.510> i'm<00:02:37.840> guessing<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
is actually holes so i'm guessing the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.090 
is actually holes so i'm guessing the
holes<00:02:40.050> actually<00:02:41.050> they<00:02:41.170> don't<00:02:41.290> match<00:02:41.590> up<00:02:41.620> what

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
holes actually they don't match up what

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.200 
holes actually they don't match up what
they<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.430> open<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:45.550> way<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.790> seems

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
they just open it up so the way it seems

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.970 
they just open it up so the way it seems
like<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.660> put<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.900> case<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.740> put

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
like that you put this case in you put

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.370 
like that you put this case in you put
in<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.220> buttons<00:02:48.550> first<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.990> seems<00:02:53.260> like

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
in the buttons first and it seems like

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.740 
in the buttons first and it seems like
it's<00:02:53.740> hard<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.100> put<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.790> then<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.510> just

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it's hard to put in and then you just

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.070 
it's hard to put in and then you just
snap<00:02:56.740> it<00:02:56.770> around<00:02:58.290> and<00:03:00.240> there<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.360> go<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.780> case

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
snap it around and there you go the case

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.800 
snap it around and there you go the case
is<00:03:02.290> actually<00:03:02.740> inside<00:03:03.220> with<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.210> product

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
is actually inside with the product

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.050 
is actually inside with the product
bread<00:03:04.990> so<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.950> won't<00:03:06.160> be<00:03:06.250> able<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.610> show<00:03:06.790> off<00:03:06.910> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
