be the judge on whether or not it sounds
good<00:00:21.500> my<00:00:22.500> opinion<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.279> does<00:00:23.430> sound

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
good my opinion is that it does sound

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.420 
good my opinion is that it does sound
fairly<00:00:24.480> good<00:00:24.840> definitely<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.400> par

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
fairly good definitely not up to par

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
fairly good definitely not up to par
with<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> higher-end<00:00:27.750> models<00:00:28.260> like

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
with some of the higher-end models like

the blue yeti link to my other video
annotation<00:00:32.700> somewhere<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:33.930> definitely

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
annotation somewhere but it's definitely

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930 
annotation somewhere but it's definitely
a<00:00:34.320> big<00:00:34.590> step<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.550> standard

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
a big step up from the standard

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.370 
a big step up from the standard
microphone<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.480> comes<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.899> most<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.260> your

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
microphone that comes in most of your

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.540 
microphone that comes in most of your
devices<00:00:37.829> today<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.260> sound<00:00:40.260> quality<00:00:40.739> mainly<00:00:41.460> up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
devices today so sound quality mainly up

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
devices today so sound quality mainly up
to<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.450> opinion<00:00:42.920> let's<00:00:43.920> go<00:00:44.010> ahead

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to you that's my opinion let's go ahead

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.490 
to you that's my opinion let's go ahead
and<00:00:44.219> take<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> look<00:00:44.730> at<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> design<00:00:45.500> first

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and take a look at the design first

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
and take a look at the design first
impressions<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.340> looks<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.789> good

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
impressions are this looks very good

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350 
impressions are this looks very good
this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.350> chromed<00:00:49.879> aluminium<00:00:50.879> i<00:00:50.969> believe<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
this is chromed aluminium i believe it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.450 
this is chromed aluminium i believe it
is<00:00:51.449> definitely<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.590> sort<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.829> metal<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
is definitely some sort of metal this is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.420 
is definitely some sort of metal this is
not<00:00:53.579> cheap<00:00:53.910> plastic<00:00:54.350> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> designed<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.250> be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
not cheap plastic this is designed to be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
not cheap plastic this is designed to be
portable<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.379> be

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
portable so it's going to have to be

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.639 
portable so it's going to have to be
very<00:00:59.070> well-made<00:01:00.059> very<00:01:00.390> well<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.809> together<00:01:00.960> or

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
very well-made very well put together or

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.170 
very well-made very well put together or
else<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.370> definitely<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.910> break

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
else this will definitely just break

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
else this will definitely just break
when<00:01:03.390> you're<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> move<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:05.040> would

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
when you're on the move and that would

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.539 
when you're on the move and that would
make<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.970> bad<00:01:06.150> product<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.260> not

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
make this a bad product which it is not

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.490 
make this a bad product which it is not
so<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> portability<00:01:09.540> these

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so going on to the portability these

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
so going on to the portability these
little<00:01:10.680> legs<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.549> keep<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
little legs here which keep the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.469 
little legs here which keep the
microphone<00:01:12.750> standing<00:01:13.290> tall<00:01:14.180> actually<00:01:15.180> fold

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
microphone standing tall actually fold

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
microphone standing tall actually fold
up<00:01:15.659> into<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.229> microphone<00:01:16.500> itself<00:01:16.710> making

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
up into the microphone itself making

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
up into the microphone itself making
this<00:01:17.790> already<00:01:18.270> small<00:01:18.540> microphone<00:01:19.049> even

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
this already small microphone even

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.340 
this already small microphone even
smaller<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> even<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.090> perfect<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
smaller and even more perfect for on the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
smaller and even more perfect for on the
move<00:01:22.670> go<00:01:23.670> ahead<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> fold<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.479> these<00:01:24.630> little

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
move go ahead and fold up these little

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
move go ahead and fold up these little
legs<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.409> put<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> pouch<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.119> can

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
legs here put in the pouch and you can

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.319 
legs here put in the pouch and you can
easily<00:01:27.479> slip<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.110> into<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.560> backpack<00:01:29.329> zipper

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
easily slip this into a backpack zipper

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.719 
easily slip this into a backpack zipper
pouch<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:31.280> unity<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.340> guess<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> really

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
pouch or unity I guess if you really

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.780 
pouch or unity I guess if you really
wanted<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.450> pocket<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.790> definitely

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
wanted to in your pocket but definitely

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.630 
wanted to in your pocket but definitely
made<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.000> portability<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.460> because<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
made for portability and because it is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
made for portability and because it is
so<00:01:38.790> portable<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.079> definitely<00:01:40.290> made<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> be

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so portable it is definitely made to be

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.639 
so portable it is definitely made to be
very<00:01:41.130> simple<00:01:41.490> very<00:01:41.670> quick<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.240> easy<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> use

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
very simple very quick and easy to use

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.899 
very simple very quick and easy to use
so<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:43.979> too<00:01:44.250> many<00:01:44.280> settings<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so there are not too many settings that

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.700 
so there are not too many settings that
come<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.390> let's<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.200> over<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> the

ones that we do have on the front of the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.060 
ones that we do have on the front of the
microphone<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:50.310> will<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:50.670> an<00:01:50.880> LED<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.799> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
microphone you will see an LED this is
