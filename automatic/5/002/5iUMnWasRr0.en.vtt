00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
there and this kind of goes hand-in-hand

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.430 
there and this kind of goes hand-in-hand
with<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:16.059> whole<00:00:16.240> yes<00:00:16.510> yes<00:00:16.750> no<00:00:16.960> philosophy

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
that we talked about a lot where when

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.970 
that we talked about a lot where when
the<00:00:19.780> pitcher<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.170> in<00:00:20.380> his<00:00:20.500> windup<00:00:20.830> you're

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
the pitcher is in his windup you're

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.980 
the pitcher is in his windup you're
thinking<00:00:21.430> swing<00:00:21.940> you're<00:00:22.150> thinking<00:00:22.480> yes<00:00:22.690> yes

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
thinking swing you're thinking yes yes

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.300 
thinking swing you're thinking yes yes
yes<00:00:23.230> you're<00:00:23.470> thinking<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.860> the<00:00:23.980> pitch<00:00:24.160> is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
yes you're thinking that the pitch is

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.890 
yes you're thinking that the pitch is
gonna<00:00:24.490> be<00:00:24.670> your<00:00:24.940> pitch<00:00:25.150> that<00:00:25.330> you're<00:00:25.540> looking

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
gonna be your pitch that you're looking

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.520 
gonna be your pitch that you're looking
for<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.260> then<00:00:26.620> all<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:26.980> say<00:00:27.340> is<00:00:27.750> no<00:00:28.750> when<00:00:29.380> it's

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
for and then all you say is no when it's

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.260 
for and then all you say is no when it's
not<00:00:29.800> your<00:00:29.980> pitch<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.520> if<00:00:30.700> it<00:00:30.789> is<00:00:30.910> your<00:00:31.060> pitch

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
not your pitch and if it is your pitch

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.970 
not your pitch and if it is your pitch
you<00:00:31.420> continue<00:00:31.900> to<00:00:31.990> say<00:00:32.140> yes<00:00:32.379> you're<00:00:32.590> on<00:00:32.739> time

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
you continue to say yes you're on time

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.319 
you continue to say yes you're on time
you're<00:00:33.039> aggressive<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.699> you<00:00:33.730> take<00:00:33.940> a<00:00:33.969> swing

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
you're aggressive and you take a swing

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.710 
you're aggressive and you take a swing
and<00:00:35.079> you<00:00:35.199> hopefully<00:00:35.379> square<00:00:35.800> up<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.010> ball

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
and you hopefully square up the ball

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.870 
and you hopefully square up the ball
so<00:00:37.720> first<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.800> misconception<00:00:39.460> that<00:00:39.489> I<00:00:39.640> think

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
so first the misconception that I think

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.060 
so first the misconception that I think
is<00:00:40.000> out<00:00:40.150> there<00:00:40.420> with<00:00:40.720> players<00:00:41.050> and<00:00:41.320> coaches<00:00:41.770> a

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
is out there with players and coaches a

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.950 
is out there with players and coaches a
lot<00:00:42.520> of<00:00:42.610> players<00:00:42.820> that<00:00:42.880> I<00:00:43.030> talk<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.450> think<00:00:43.720> that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
lot of players that I talk to think that

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.020 
lot of players that I talk to think that
when<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.470> take<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:44.770> pitch<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.399> you<00:00:45.790> should

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
when you take a pitch that you should

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.100 
when you take a pitch that you should
basically<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:47.710> loaded<00:00:47.950> up<00:00:48.130> stride<00:00:48.520> separate

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
basically get loaded up stride separate

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.560 
basically get loaded up stride separate
land<00:00:50.110> and<00:00:50.440> then<00:00:50.739> not<00:00:51.280> move<00:00:51.640> at<00:00:51.820> all<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.329> take<00:00:52.540> a

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
land and then not move at all and take a

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.229 
land and then not move at all and take a
pitch<00:00:52.930> without<00:00:53.260> flinching<00:00:54.000> whatsoever<00:00:55.000> and

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
pitch without flinching whatsoever and

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.910 
pitch without flinching whatsoever and
they<00:00:55.300> think<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.780> best<00:00:56.079> major-league

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
they think that the best major-league

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.569 
they think that the best major-league
hitters<00:00:57.219> do<00:00:57.399> this<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:59.620> actually<00:01:00.309> almost

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
hitters do this and it's actually almost

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.060 
hitters do this and it's actually almost
the<00:01:01.090> complete<00:01:01.570> opposite<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.680> only<00:01:02.860> time

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
the complete opposite the only time

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.649 
the complete opposite the only time
you'll<00:01:03.219> see<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.370> major<00:01:03.820> league<00:01:04.089> player<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.420> good

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
you'll see a major league player a good

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.809 
you'll see a major league player a good
hitter<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:07.180> move<00:01:07.509> at<00:01:07.689> all<00:01:07.810> not<00:01:08.200> flinch<00:01:08.679> not<00:01:09.009> it

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:09.819 
hitter not move at all not flinch not it

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.370 
hitter not move at all not flinch not it
looks<00:01:10.090> like<00:01:10.299> they're<00:01:10.479> basically<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> statue

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
looks like they're basically a statue

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.749 
looks like they're basically a statue
when<00:01:11.709> they're<00:01:11.889> taking<00:01:12.189> a<00:01:12.249> pitches<00:01:12.579> when

they're just straight taking and there

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.499 
they're just straight taking and there
is<00:01:14.530> no<00:01:14.709> intent<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.249> swing<00:01:15.490> anytime<00:01:16.299> there<00:01:16.479> is

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509

it's<00:02:31.900> probably<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.440> pitch<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.890> he<00:02:32.980> wasn't

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it's probably a pitch that he wasn't

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.039 
it's probably a pitch that he wasn't
looking<00:02:33.550> for<00:02:33.760> maybe<00:02:34.599> he<00:02:34.780> was<00:02:34.930> looking

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
looking for maybe he was looking

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.229 
looking for maybe he was looking
fastball<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.830> he<00:02:35.920> gets<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.190> breaking<00:02:36.549> ball<00:02:36.700> or

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
fastball and he gets a breaking ball or

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.080 
fastball and he gets a breaking ball or
vice<00:02:37.510> versa<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.069> could<00:02:39.190> be<00:02:39.310> location<00:02:39.910> maybe

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
vice versa or it could be location maybe

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.820 
vice versa or it could be location maybe
he<00:02:40.390> was<00:02:40.569> looking<00:02:40.870> away<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.410> balls<00:02:41.620> in

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
he was looking away in the balls in

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.800 
he was looking away in the balls in
whatever<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:42.910> he's<00:02:43.060> decided<00:02:43.569> not<00:02:43.750> to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
whatever it is but he's decided not to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.020 
whatever it is but he's decided not to
swing<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.940> thing<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.269> see<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.780> with

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
swing and and the thing I see is with

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.039 
swing and and the thing I see is with
especially<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> younger<00:02:49.420> levels<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> lot<00:02:49.930> of

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
especially a younger levels a lot of

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.789 
especially a younger levels a lot of
times<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.410> play<00:02:50.560> will<00:02:50.739> take<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.950> pitch<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.400> this

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
times a play will take a pitch like this

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.789 
times a play will take a pitch like this
and<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:55.030> coach<00:02:55.239> will<00:02:55.390> say<00:02:55.420> hey<00:02:56.380> man<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.709> guys

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.199 
can't be moving that much you've got to
recognize<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:02.110> pitch<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:03.310> again<00:03:03.579> if<00:03:03.910> you're

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
recognize the pitch but again if you're

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.690 
recognize the pitch but again if you're
not<00:03:04.450> doing<00:03:04.870> something<00:03:05.319> like<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:05.920> then<00:03:06.489> you

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
not doing something like this then you

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.729 
not doing something like this then you
would<00:03:06.880> be<00:03:07.060> too<00:03:07.540> late<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.200> decided<00:03:08.620> to

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
would be too late if you decided to

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.000 
would be too late if you decided to
swing<00:03:09.069> there<00:03:09.579> needs<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.090> be<00:03:13.470> some<00:03:14.470> movement

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
stops and that's a fine take that's a

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.000 
stops and that's a fine take that's a
perfectly<00:03:43.930> fine<00:03:44.139> take<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.560> that's<00:03:44.680> actually

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
perfectly fine take and that's actually

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.910 
perfectly fine take and that's actually
what<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.250> take<00:03:45.549> should<00:03:46.420> look<00:03:46.630> like<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.049> think

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
what it take should look like so think

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.009 
what it take should look like so think
about<00:03:48.010> how<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.310> take<00:03:48.700> pitches<00:03:49.209> go<00:03:49.630> back<00:03:49.810> and

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
about how you take pitches go back and

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
this you probably don't you probably are

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.089

taking<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.750> look<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.079> this<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.650> you're

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
taking like that

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.400 
taking like that
and<00:04:04.120> if<00:04:04.540> that's<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.810> case<00:04:05.019> you're<00:04:05.290> probably
