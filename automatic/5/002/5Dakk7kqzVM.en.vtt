00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello here you are on blog of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.579
 diana i'm just going to show you how 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.589
 I make my pancakes and give you there 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.570
 the trick to always make beautiful 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.569
 pancakes actually the technique 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.900
 I put in versera paws I you 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:23.240
 admit I bought it yesterday so I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.830
 test at the same time with you live 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.539
 actually the technique for it to be 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.359
 always beautiful and that's it and if you can 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.470
 see the bottom of the pile of pancakes 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.539
 that one must always pay the same 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.390
 quantity dough is always paid to 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:39.629
 middle of the pan and the dough actually goes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.190
 to spread out alone is really the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.170
 only tip I can give you 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.620
 to make pancakes and then 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.680
 you see very quickly you have the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.929
 formation of little bubbles and that's it and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.510
 you have pancakes that are perfect 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.370
 with a completely uniform color 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.160
 so what must be understood 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.850
 is that it will not give cheeks the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 say because it's often 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.980
 question that I asked myself 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.530
 that's why I'm going to buy 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.330
 Paschal naked actually you happen to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.660
 never make the same measure it's 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.020
 still pretty delicate so I'm going 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.500
 invest very soon all 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 simply in a ladle 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 here is a ladle they are they 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.870
 are really smaller 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 than the usual ladles then a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.210
 little thing too I prefer you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.560
 prevent 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.240
 me I succeed but pancakes 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 especially in this pan it's 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.750
 a stove that is that is really a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.930
 stove of very good quality which a 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.180
 crepe maker that is a little heavier than 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.220
 the hairs you use 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.420
 usually open facing 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.690
 whole adherents for not mentioning 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.510
 brand all my hair of seven big 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.100
 brands have all good of it is under 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.260
 the effect of the heat will be celebrating the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.280
 hairs that you must know as the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.210
 baked dishes 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.700
 in fact gondola very easily as soon as 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.960
 as soon as they are heated to white which 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.319
 happens very often when we make 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.690
 pancakes 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.230
 here is a little thing that 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.940
 hang on so be aware that I 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.660
 do not put any oil at all during the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.090
 cooking these pancakes there are none 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.950
 need I do it only during the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.860
 first and you will see the two three 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.630
 first creams are always missing 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.209
 you do not know why even where I can 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.030
 not explain it to you but it's 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.000
 impossible to succeed first pancake 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.700
 here and you get that's a very 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.630
 beautiful stack of pancakes 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.130
