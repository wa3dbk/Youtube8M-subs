00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.520 
almost instantaneous in fact all the
functions<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.120> this<00:01:51.300> device<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.870> very<00:01:52.050> fast

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
functions on this device is very fast

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
functions on this device is very fast
now<00:01:53.100> let's<00:01:53.340> check<00:01:53.580> about<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> light<00:01:54.360> sensor

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
now let's check about the light sensor

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.080 
now let's check about the light sensor
that<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.440> ambient<00:01:55.980> light<00:01:56.130> sensor<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.730> as

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that is the ambient light sensor and as

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.280 
that is the ambient light sensor and as
you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.780> no<00:01:57.930> auto<00:01:58.080> brightness

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
you can see there is no auto brightness

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.710 
you can see there is no auto brightness
control<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.550> have<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> manually<00:02:00.360> set<00:02:00.690> the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
control so you have to manually set the

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.420 
control so you have to manually set the
brightness<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.560> device<00:02:01.830> according<00:02:02.160> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
brightness of this device according to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.340 
brightness of this device according to
your<00:02:02.520> ambience<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.600> after<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.140> full

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
your ambience now after the full

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.410 
your ambience now after the full
brightness<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.190> can<00:02:05.370> see<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.760> screen<00:02:06.180> is

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
brightness as you can see the screen is

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.810 
brightness as you can see the screen is
just<00:02:06.630> flashing<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.320> light<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.340> colors<00:02:08.640> are

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
just flashing with light the colors are

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.730 
just flashing with light the colors are
looking<00:02:09.090> more<00:02:09.300> vibrant<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.080> also<00:02:10.440> more

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
looking more vibrant and also more

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.220 
looking more vibrant and also more
attractive<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:12.030> battery<00:02:12.330> may<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.840> last<00:02:13.080> very

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
attractive but battery may not last very

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.920 
attractive but battery may not last very
long<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.100> high<00:02:14.370> brightness<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.060> in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
long with this high brightness and in

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.690 
long with this high brightness and in
fact<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.500> found<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.160> battery<00:02:17.580> on

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
fact I have found that the battery on

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.120 
fact I have found that the battery on
this<00:02:17.820> device<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.330> though<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:19.050> two<00:02:19.770> thousand

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
this device is though of two thousand

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.920 
this device is though of two thousand
billion<00:02:20.280> per<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.420> battery<00:02:21.630> performance

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
billion per but the battery performance

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.530 
billion per but the battery performance
is<00:02:22.350> not<00:02:22.590> very<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.850> battery<00:02:24.210> may<00:02:24.360> last

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
is not very good the battery may last

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.050 
is not very good the battery may last
only<00:02:24.780> 10<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.410> 12<00:02:25.650> hours<00:02:25.890> with<00:02:26.250> normal<00:02:26.670> users
