used for your main beam okay so if we we
did<00:00:22.109> another<00:00:22.350> video<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.740> how<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.920> take<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
did another video of how to take the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
did another video of how to take the
headlight<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.910> which<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> easiest<00:00:24.750> way

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
headlight out which is the easiest way

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679 
headlight out which is the easiest way
to<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.939> okay<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> back<00:00:27.480> you've

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
to do this okay so on the back you've

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.570 
to do this okay so on the back you've
got<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> two<00:00:27.960> covers<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> cover

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
got the two covers so it's the cover

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.810 
got the two covers so it's the cover
furthest<00:00:30.179> away<00:00:30.359> from<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> connector<00:00:31.800> used<00:00:32.700> to

furthest away from the connector used to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.630 
furthest away from the connector used to
unscrew<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.300> quarter<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.260> turn<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:35.370> remove

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
unscrew that quarter of a turn to remove

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299 
unscrew that quarter of a turn to remove
that<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:37.649> you've<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.980> long

so you've got this section at the top
here<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:36.170> needs<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.650> go<00:01:36.860> next<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.990> this

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
here and that needs to go next to this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.180 
here and that needs to go next to this
at<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.040> top<00:01:40.369> there<00:01:41.409> okay<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:42.470> again<00:01:42.830> don't

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
at the top there okay so again don't

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.820 
at the top there okay so again don't
touch<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.670> glass<00:01:43.909> area<00:01:44.330> if<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.840> because

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
touch the glass area if you can because

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.389 
touch the glass area if you can because
the<00:01:46.009> oils<00:01:46.580> on<00:01:46.759> your<00:01:46.790> hands<00:01:47.270> can<00:01:48.100> can<00:01:49.100> reduce

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
the oils on your hands can can reduce

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.700 
the oils on your hands can can reduce
the<00:01:49.580> bulb<00:01:49.790> life<00:01:50.000> because<00:01:50.180> they<00:01:50.330> get<00:01:50.479> hot<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.680> I

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
the bulb life because they get hot so I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.660 
the bulb life because they get hot so I
don't<00:01:51.860> know<00:01:51.920> if<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.039> can<00:01:52.159> see<00:01:52.369> on<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.580> video

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
don't know if you can see on the video

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.639 
don't know if you can see on the video
there's<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.090> little<00:01:53.330> tab<00:01:53.600> there<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.020> sits

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
there's a little tab there that sits

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.120 
there's a little tab there that sits
next<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.750> next<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.170> one<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.710> get<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:57.950> out

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
next to next to that one to get it out

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.359 
next to next to that one to get it out
so<00:01:58.549> that's<00:01:58.789> that<00:01:59.090> replaced<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.930> then<00:02:00.680> this

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
so that's that replaced and then this

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.180 
so that's that replaced and then this
tab<00:02:01.940> again<00:02:02.259> points<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.530> top<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:04.009> the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
tab again points to the top of the
