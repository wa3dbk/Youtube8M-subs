now because the liner of the Mach 1 star

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.950 
now because the liner of the Mach 1 star
helmet<00:00:07.010> was<00:00:08.010> custom<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.490> produce<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:09.570> required

still there but to do the rivets and
skill<00:00:12.330> labor<00:00:12.480> was<00:00:12.750> required<00:00:13.110> elsewhere<00:00:13.259> by

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
skill labor was required elsewhere by

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.000 
skill labor was required elsewhere by
the<00:00:14.190> time<00:00:14.460> war<00:00:14.730> had<00:00:14.910> broken<00:00:15.059> out<00:00:16.010> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the time war had broken out the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.939 
the time war had broken out the
government<00:00:17.369> put<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.260> huge<00:00:19.260> demand<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.800> steel

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
government put in huge demand for steel

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.250 
government put in huge demand for steel
helmets<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:21.029> led<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.720> rise<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
helmets and this led to the rise of the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.410 
helmets and this led to the rise of the
British<00:00:22.590> Army<00:00:22.830> Mach<00:00:23.010> 2<00:00:23.310> steel<00:00:23.609> helmet<00:00:23.939> which

British Army Mach 2 steel helmet which

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
British Army Mach 2 steel helmet which
is<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> completely<00:00:25.019> revised<00:00:25.439> design<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.460> we'll

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
is a completely revised design so we'll

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.279 
is a completely revised design so we'll
get<00:00:26.670> shut<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.029> 1<00:00:27.349> this<00:00:29.900> is<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.140> you'll

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
get shut up at 1 this is what you'll

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.650 
get shut up at 1 this is what you'll
find<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> bog<00:00:32.219> standard<00:00:32.399> World<00:00:33.300> War

on the shelf you have manufacturers

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
on the shelf you have manufacturers
initials<00:00:54.440> then<00:00:55.440> you'll<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:56.210> MK<00:00:57.210> 1<00:00:57.719> 1<00:00:57.960> mark<00:00:58.350> -
