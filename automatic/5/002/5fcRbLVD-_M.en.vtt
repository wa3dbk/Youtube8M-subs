00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.740 
did back then and then they put the
Dudley's<00:02:38.850> back<00:02:39.030> together<00:02:39.360> when<00:02:39.600> they

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
Dudley's back together when they

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.360 
Dudley's back together when they
realized<00:02:40.200> how<00:02:40.440> much<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:40.770> messed<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.190> they

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
realized how much they messed up they

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.530 
realized how much they messed up they
never<00:02:41.580> should<00:02:41.700> have<00:02:41.760> broken<00:02:41.940> them<00:02:42.209> up<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
never should have broken them up in the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.190 
never should have broken them up in the
first<00:02:42.660> place<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:44.190> him<00:02:44.790> coming<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.240> WWE<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
first place so him coming to WWE as a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.100 
first place so him coming to WWE as a
big-time<00:02:47.130> singles<00:02:47.610> heel<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.420> guess<00:02:48.870> he<00:02:48.990> could

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
big-time singles heel I guess he could

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.160 
big-time singles heel I guess he could
be<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> babyface<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.950> think<00:02:50.190> he's<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> born

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
be a babyface I think he's a born

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.080 
be a babyface I think he's a born
natural<00:02:52.170> heel<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.489> ever<00:02:53.610> did<00:02:53.820> bring

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
natural heel and if they ever did bring

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.640 
natural heel and if they ever did bring
him<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.510> probably<00:02:54.810> would<00:02:54.989> be<00:02:55.020> as<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> heel

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
him in it probably would be as a heel

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.410 
him in it probably would be as a heel
could<00:02:56.489> that<00:02:56.670> work<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.320> say<00:02:58.320> yes<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:59.000> know<00:03:00.000> he's<00:03:00.270> no

he going out there and dropping f-bombs

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.759 
he going out there and dropping f-bombs
is<00:04:11.820> he<00:04:12.299> going<00:04:12.420> out<00:04:12.660> there<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:12.930> using<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.590> lot<00:04:13.739> of

is he going out there and using a lot of
sexual<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:15.000> know<00:04:15.060> innuendos<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:15.989> stuff<00:04:16.470> like

sexual you know innuendos and stuff like
that<00:04:16.709> not<00:04:17.100> really<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.840> think<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.470> could<00:04:19.590> work

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
that not really so I think it could work

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.029 
that not really so I think it could work
I<00:04:20.239> think<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.359> could<00:04:21.479> work<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.710> just<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
I think it could work and it's just a

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.370 
I think it could work and it's just a
guy<00:04:23.310> for<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:23.729> John<00:04:24.000> Cena<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.479> work<00:04:24.630> with<00:04:24.870> you

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
guy for a John Cena to work with you

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.659 
guy for a John Cena to work with you
could<00:04:25.560> put<00:04:25.740> bully<00:04:25.919> against<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.370> lot<00:04:26.520> of

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
could put bully against a lot of

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.379 
could put bully against a lot of
different<00:04:26.940> people<00:04:27.030> you

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
different people you

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.570 
different people you
do<00:04:27.599> bully<00:04:27.870> if<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.680> really<00:04:29.039> wanted<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.430> I

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
do bully if you really wanted to I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.969 
do bully if you really wanted to I

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
could work with so yeah I do think there

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.140 
could work with so yeah I do think there
is<00:05:12.689> value<00:05:12.719> in<00:05:13.139> one<00:05:13.469> last<00:05:13.650> run<00:05:13.800> for<00:05:14.189> boolean<00:05:14.550> WWE

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
is value in one last run for boolean WWE

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.820 
is value in one last run for boolean WWE
as<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.389> singles<00:05:15.900> do<00:05:16.020> they<00:05:16.169> share<00:05:16.409> that<00:05:16.620> same

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
as a singles do they share that same

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.040 
as a singles do they share that same
point<00:05:17.039> of<00:05:17.219> view<00:05:17.370> my<00:05:17.550> sense<00:05:17.819> is<00:05:17.969> no<00:05:18.180> they<00:05:18.870> don't

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
point of view my sense is no they don't

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.290 
point of view my sense is no they don't
I<00:05:19.680> don't<00:05:20.159> think<00:05:20.219> he<00:05:20.460> left<00:05:20.639> on<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:20.939> best<00:05:21.180> of

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
I don't think he left on the best of

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.390 
I don't think he left on the best of
terms<00:05:21.360> they<00:05:21.870> probably<00:05:22.050> look<00:05:22.319> at<00:05:22.529> his<00:05:22.830> age<00:05:23.039> as

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
terms they probably look at his age as

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.670 
terms they probably look at his age as
being<00:05:23.639> a<00:05:23.789> big<00:05:23.939> factor<00:05:24.180> against<00:05:24.779> him<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.469> I

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
being a big factor against him so I

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.579 
being a big factor against him so I
actually<00:05:26.189> don't<00:05:26.909> see<00:05:27.060> WWE<00:05:27.900> having<00:05:28.409> much

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:28.589 
actually don't see WWE having much

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.159 
actually don't see WWE having much
interest<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.129> bringing<00:05:29.310> bully<00:05:29.699> ray<00:05:29.849> in<00:05:30.169> once

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
interest in bringing bully ray in once

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.439

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.709 
possibility that unless he and TNA come
to<00:06:38.250> a<00:06:38.279> last-minute<00:06:38.789> agreement<00:06:39.029> which<00:06:39.509> they

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
still be negotiating even as we speak if

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.100 
still be negotiating even as we speak if
that<00:06:43.979> doesn't<00:06:44.400> happen<00:06:44.520> though<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.240> I<00:06:45.810> assume

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
that doesn't happen though and I assume

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.159 
that doesn't happen though and I assume
it<00:06:46.199> just<00:06:46.350> boils<00:06:46.470> down<00:06:46.710> to<00:06:46.919> money<00:06:47.270> now<00:06:48.270> he

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
it just boils down to money now he

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.210 
it just boils down to money now he
probably<00:06:49.320> won't<00:06:49.620> appear<00:06:49.889> at<00:06:49.979> the<00:06:50.039> Hall<00:06:50.190> of
