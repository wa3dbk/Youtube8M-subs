 one stone plus the same paper and I'll have 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.389
 finished careful that wall is up to the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.119
 coast could bring down the winds 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.040
 strong has not rushed I put 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.040
 enough mix and it is very strong 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.080
 careful if you do not see that wall anymore 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.290

 you have to use bows to throw the that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.840
 buttresses an architectural support of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.129
 the buildings the most famous example that 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.100
 is the one of the cathedral of our lady 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.650
 from paris in france and I can see how it 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.830
 he built the young cathedral of course 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.240
 draw a line in the mix 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.120
 let's imagine it is the river sena in paris 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.860
 there is an island in the middle of the river where 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.230
 is one of the most beautiful and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.440
 famous cathedrals our lady of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.089
 Paris 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.610
 He said it is very beautiful just look at the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.390
 carved stone and beautiful stained glass 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.659
 then an art shoulder 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.479
 I would like to know more about this place 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.750
 can you ask that painter me 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.590
 want and buy my life there there is nothing 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.049
 and has good eyesight 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.969
 I'm not interested in paintings but 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.450
 life anything you do 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.460
 wants to know things about us then 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.270
 to paint the history of the cathedral 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.259
 of notre-dame this soil has been sacred 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.719
 for many years and that is a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.020
 Celtic tabernacle was here in this 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.760
 site many years ago and there are you use it 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.490
 imagination 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.240
 but that's not our lady of Paris and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:03.070
 I do not think I'm calm, I know it 's 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:06.799
 hours and it 's in the cathedral is a temple 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.130
 the Roman god was built here makes 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.750
 over 2000 years and the Romans came 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.200
 up to this point 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.000
 I see this temple but as not all 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.280
 he built the young cathedral and he loves them 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.620
 imagine that I am a foreman and you 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.130
 a mason 800 years ago 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.540
 [Music] 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.710
 we are in the year of 1163 the archbishop 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 upset and makes the plans of the cathedral 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.230
 foundations 10 meters deep 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.080
 let's go start digging 10 meters today 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.190
 crowded imagination that almost us 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:54.470
 we imagine that it's over it's fine 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.900
 magical at every moment and then but in 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.650
 the clear ones demand that they be placed there 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.570
 heavy parts moments my planes 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.530
 there are also people that I sharqat this 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.600
 hole 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.030
 only the heavy materials of 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.030
 fossil construction in the vicinity of 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.540
 Paris and all the masons imagine 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.680
 who love neighbors of the town 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.819
 so I do not want to work so much anymore 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.599
 let's imagine that the cathedral is already 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.420
 finished and not 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.819
 We need almost 200 years for that. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.560
 to polish that window when you are 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.780
 thinking about too big to never go to 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.870
 make it clear that it is large centrals and 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.010
 it measures 11 meters in diameter there is a spot 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.480
 around here and today and another spot over there and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.239
 yesterday I do not visit 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.420
 and a bigger blot that came out here 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.489
 go up to the twin towers and high up the 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.120
 roof is the one that is going to finish more 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:58.120
 I am soon before the cathedral 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.930
 You look all are 75 meters high 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.110
 so be careful morán and 10 por 3 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.650
 between 3 discounting the hard hear this 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.849
 it's being 22 stories high that's 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.540
 very high now if the cathedral is 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.750
 finished and has not heard 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.020
 we will add the belfry the chapels 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.290
 the concepts of ambulatory and 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.610
 bows boat to vélez the first ones of the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.980
 history this is what came from him 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.760
 [Music] 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.650
 but what is this and our demons do not 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.380
 we are only the statues of the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.600
 you are not ignored and have more 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.760
 of one thousand two hundred as they are made to me 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.590
 many for me to tell them and finally 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.590
 where were the notarial arches is there 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.080
 where the chapel ends its funny 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.760
 Design adds a special beauty in addition 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.260
 of support for the new ones of the 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.750

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.990

 a pleasure is equal to the cathedral is 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.660
 pretty but I do not want a painting 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.810
 or if I already have the authentic 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.870
 and with these pretty 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.060
 the roof is more than 33 meters high 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.360
 or be bigger than a whole town 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.100
 a great house of prayer is also due 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.760
 have made a lot of history in this place 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.790
 true if the violence of the revolution 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.919
 French left her in ruins but thank you 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.530

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.470
 hour in all its beauty and yet 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.760
