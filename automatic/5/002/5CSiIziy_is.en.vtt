00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 It's six hours and 53 minutes and you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.630
 solve a magic cube that 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.690
 colorful and colorful square is in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.259
 How long can you do this in 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.759
 this Sunday 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.980
 a lot of people participated in a competition 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.430
 here in goiânia besides reasoning 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.490
 logical you have to be very fast 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.980
 looking like this seems like a joke 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.109
 But it's serious, these people are there. 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 in a national competition of cubes 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.320
 magical 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 how quickly they assemble the cubes is 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.690
 so it is difficult to keep up with the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.640
 reasoning and a technique like that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 people have a technique we have several 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.149
 steps to solve the magic cube that the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.840
 people always follow in order to do well 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.289
 fast 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.850
 the technical party for us then 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 first thing you can see before 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.289
 to make a side is to make a cross and a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.360
 sides or make a white cross ac 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.280
 that way here and then complete 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.289
 You can stop to Gabriel who is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 complicating even more vile let's leave 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.730
 this business there for those who know 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.920
 and this galley knows a lot walter is 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.840
 programmer and came from são paulo just to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.340
 competition and we can not simply 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.010
 fun even though it does not have much 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.080
 money involved but it is always legal 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.790
 while people competing 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 competitors are divided by 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 category from which to mount the hub 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.159
 in less time 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 continuing the person starts to practice is 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.390
 solve the magic cube it begins to have 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.759
 an improvement with logical adjustment 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.119
 three-dimensional perception a sport that 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.820
 involves reasoning and brings an improvement 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.579
 concentration in the sound the more competitive 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.439
 brand new today only look at the amount of 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.659
 cubes he rides he only has five 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.329
 aninhos and proposed me a challenge was 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.070
 to assemble this tub that is the simplest and 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.299
 he's going to ride this one that's going to see 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.299
 Who finishes first chan 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.640
 Of course I lost in tea. 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.680
 we are very difficult to summarize we do not have 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.140
 how to put it here 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.390
 the little one is not much to talk about if well 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.400
 that words are expendable in this 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.970
 In case you can see that this boy is going 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.970
 far 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.650
 ruby will train promising to train more 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.270
 to maybe make it as beautiful as the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.270
 Little boy 20 thousand of the report
