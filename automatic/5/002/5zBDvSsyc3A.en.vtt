there's<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.870> few<00:00:01.110> settings<00:00:01.469> that<00:00:01.589> we're<00:00:01.740> going

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
there's a few settings that we're going

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.080 
there's a few settings that we're going
to<00:00:01.920> want<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.129> make<00:00:02.280> sure<00:00:02.310> that<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:02.669> set<00:00:02.879> here

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
to want to make sure that we set here

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.210 
to want to make sure that we set here
first<00:00:03.750> let's<00:00:04.080> turn<00:00:04.259> off<00:00:04.410> color<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.980> we'll

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
first let's turn off color and we'll

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.579 
first let's turn off color and we'll
turn<00:00:05.430> deformation<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.480> once<00:00:07.200> you've<00:00:07.379> turned

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
turn deformation on once you've turned

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.950 
turn deformation on once you've turned
on<00:00:07.830> deformation<00:00:08.580> make<00:00:09.120> sure<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.360> have<00:00:09.510> double

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
on deformation make sure you have double

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.890 
on deformation make sure you have double
sided<00:00:10.230> clicked<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:11.490> have<00:00:11.670> fade<00:00:12.179> turned<00:00:12.660> off

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
sided clicked you have fade turned off

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.589 
sided clicked you have fade turned off
and<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.950> normalized<00:00:14.549> turned<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.089> the

and you have normalized turned on the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.689 
and you have normalized turned on the
reason<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.020> turn<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.470> normalizes<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
reason we turn on normalizes so that the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
reason we turn on normalizes so that the
details<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.420> create<00:00:18.720> here<00:00:18.960> will<00:00:19.410> project

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
details that we create here will project

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.910 
details that we create here will project
around<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.789> surface<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> our<00:00:21.600> pillar<00:00:21.920> once

stroke<00:00:35.160> palette<00:00:35.579> we'll<00:00:35.850> select<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.450> line

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
stroke palette we'll select the line

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.229 
stroke palette we'll select the line
stroke<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.980> we'll<00:00:38.160> choose<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> nice<00:00:38.730> soft

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
stroke and then we'll choose a nice soft

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.600 
stroke and then we'll choose a nice soft
round<00:00:39.660> alpha<00:00:40.170> we're<00:00:40.860> gonna<00:00:40.950> make<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> few

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
round alpha we're gonna make a few

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
round alpha we're gonna make a few
adjustments<00:00:41.760> through<00:00:42.450> our<00:00:42.540> line<00:00:42.750> stroke<00:00:43.140> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
adjustments through our line stroke so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.440 
adjustments through our line stroke so
we'll<00:00:43.559> go<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> main<00:00:44.160> menu<00:00:44.550> click<00:00:45.239> on

we'll go up to the main menu click on

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.330 
we'll go up to the main menu click on
the<00:00:45.570> stroke<00:00:45.899> palate<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:47.039> we'll<00:00:47.160> dock

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the stroke palate and then we'll dock

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
the stroke palate and then we'll dock
that<00:00:47.579> over<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.149> hand<00:00:48.270> side<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:49.020> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that over on the right hand side if you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
that over on the right hand side if you
have<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> line<00:00:50.280> stroke<00:00:50.700> selected<00:00:51.239> you'll

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
have the line stroke selected you'll

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.819 
have the line stroke selected you'll
notice<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.140> an<00:00:52.260> option<00:00:52.559> here

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
notice that you have an option here

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
notice that you have an option here
called<00:00:53.039> spacing<00:00:53.670> let's<00:00:54.270> turn<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
called spacing let's turn that all the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
called spacing let's turn that all the
way<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.410> two<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> do

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
way up to two what this is going to do

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.939 
way up to two what this is going to do
is<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.390> sure<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> nice<00:00:58.469> solid

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is make sure that we have a nice solid

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.000 
is make sure that we have a nice solid
line<00:00:59.370> instead<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.090> bunch<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.510> dots

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
line instead of a bunch of little dots

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
line instead of a bunch of little dots
so<00:01:02.010> let's<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> test<00:01:02.730> stroke<00:01:03.090> I'll<00:01:03.390> turn<00:01:03.870> RGB

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so let's do a test stroke I'll turn RGB

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960 
so let's do a test stroke I'll turn RGB
off<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.949> we're<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:05.339> working<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.820> any

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
off so that we're not working with any

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
off so that we're not working with any
color<00:01:06.240> information<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.110> by<00:01:07.710> holding<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
color information and by holding the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
color information and by holding the
shift<00:01:08.250> key<00:01:08.580> I'll<00:01:08.909> draw<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> nice<00:01:09.510> straight<00:01:09.590> line

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
shift key I'll draw a nice straight line

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
shift key I'll draw a nice straight line
across<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.189> surface<00:01:11.610> once<00:01:12.479> again<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:12.900> going

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
across the surface once again I'm going

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.109 
across the surface once again I'm going
to<00:01:13.080> press<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> letter<00:01:13.740> G<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
to press the letter G this is going to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.999 
to press the letter G this is going to
bring<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.600> projection<00:01:16.229> master<00:01:16.590> settings

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
bring up my projection master settings

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
bring up my projection master settings
what's<00:01:17.700> great<00:01:17.939> about<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.110> don't

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
what's great about this is if I don't

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.109 
what's great about this is if I don't
like<00:01:19.470> any<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> settings<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.340> set<00:01:20.549> earlier<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
like any of the settings I set earlier I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.149 
like any of the settings I set earlier I
can<00:01:21.180> change<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> case

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
can change them now but in this case

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.130 
can change them now but in this case
we're<00:01:23.400> happy<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.180> settings<00:01:24.420> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
we're happy with all of our settings so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.249 
we're happy with all of our settings so
we'll<00:01:25.320> simply<00:01:25.560> click<00:01:25.979> pick<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.670> now<00:01:27.020> once<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.200> do

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
we'll simply click pick up now once I do

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
we'll simply click pick up now once I do
that<00:01:28.619> it'll<00:01:28.890> take<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.369> model<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.119> two

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that it'll take my model out of a two

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.600 
that it'll take my model out of a two
and<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> half<00:01:30.689> D<00:01:30.930> State<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.369> into

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and a half D State and put it back into

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.179 
and a half D State and put it back into
a<00:01:32.729> full<00:01:33.090> 3d<00:01:33.479> state<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.350> we'll<00:01:34.409> hit<00:01:34.650> control<00:01:35.159> Z

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
a full 3d state so we'll hit control Z

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
jump back into projection master you'll
notice<00:01:40.290> our<00:01:40.409> settings<00:01:40.799> remain<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> same<00:01:41.729> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
notice our settings remain the same and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450 
notice our settings remain the same and
we'll<00:01:42.630> draw<00:01:42.840> another<00:01:43.380> line<00:01:43.500> across<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
we'll draw another line across the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.819 
we'll draw another line across the
surface<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> many<00:01:46.380> very

powerful features of using projection
master<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.290> after<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.950> draw<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> stroke<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
master is after you draw a stroke you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.060 
master is after you draw a stroke you
can<00:01:51.360> actually<00:01:51.570> click<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.200> your<00:01:52.439> move<00:01:52.649> rotate

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
can actually click on your move rotate

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.399 
can actually click on your move rotate
or<00:01:53.490> scale<00:01:53.700> option<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.290> adjust

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
or scale option and then you can adjust

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.069 
or scale option and then you can adjust
that<00:01:56.009> stroke<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.329> move<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> across<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that stroke so we can move it across the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.889 
that stroke so we can move it across the
surface<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.890> scale<00:01:59.280> its<00:01:59.520> size<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.719> can

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
surface we can scale its size we can

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.740 
surface we can scale its size we can
even<00:02:01.110> change<00:02:01.409> our<00:02:01.680> intensity<00:02:02.189> sliders<00:02:02.700> our<00:02:03.030> Z

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
even change our intensity sliders our Z

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.770 
even change our intensity sliders our Z

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
ad and Z sub options so that we can have

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.830 
ad and Z sub options so that we can have
full<00:02:07.170> control<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:08.009> our<00:02:08.129> stroke<00:02:08.459> after<00:02:08.970> we've

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
full control over our stroke after we've

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.180 
full control over our stroke after we've
actually<00:02:10.110> drawn<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> onto<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> surface

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
actually drawn it onto the surface

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.310 
actually drawn it onto the surface
so<00:02:12.670> we'll<00:02:13.030> draw<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> few<00:02:13.600> more<00:02:13.750> lines<00:02:13.990> here

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
so we'll draw a few more lines here

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.100 
so we'll draw a few more lines here
again<00:02:15.100> switching<00:02:15.430> between<00:02:15.700> our<00:02:16.060> Z<00:02:16.300> ad<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.870> Z

again switching between Z ad and Z sub

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.070 
again switching between Z ad and Z sub
that<00:02:39.340> way<00:02:39.430> we<00:02:39.610> can<00:02:39.730> draw<00:02:39.909> lines<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.420> protrude

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
that way we can draw lines that protrude

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.110 
that way we can draw lines that protrude
out<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.470> lines<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.280> actually<00:02:42.610> carve<00:02:42.849> into

out and lines that actually carve into
the<00:02:43.330> surface<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:45.040> definitely<00:02:45.640> take<00:02:45.819> advantage

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
the surface so definitely take advantage

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.030 
the surface so definitely take advantage

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
your strokes across the surface so we'll

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.369 
your strokes across the surface so we'll
click<00:02:50.620> w4<00:02:51.340> move<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:51.849> we'll<00:02:52.329> just<00:02:52.540> reposition

click w4 move and we'll just reposition

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.500 
click w4 move and we'll just reposition
this<00:02:53.500> stroke<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.980> we<00:02:54.069> just<00:02:54.340> drew<00:02:54.579> another

really<00:02:55.959> powerful<00:02:56.440> feature<00:02:56.829> is<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.310> ability

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
really powerful feature is the ability

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.880 
really powerful feature is the ability
to<00:02:57.670> duplicate<00:02:58.299> strokes<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.409> if<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.739> click

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
to duplicate strokes so if we click

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890 
to duplicate strokes so if we click
shift<00:03:00.459> s<00:03:00.670> you'll<00:03:01.120> notice<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.540> we've<00:03:01.690> just
