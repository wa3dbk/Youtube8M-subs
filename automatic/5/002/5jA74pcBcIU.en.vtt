to use the regular nosal's only when
spraying<00:01:38.009> overhead<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:39.329> fighting

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
spraying overhead you're fighting

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.539 
spraying overhead you're fighting
gravity<00:01:40.259> when<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.619> spraying<00:01:40.920> straight<00:01:41.369> up

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
gravity when you're spraying straight up

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.520 
gravity when you're spraying straight up
so<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> spread<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.320> with

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.780 
another handy tip when spraying overhead
to<00:02:02.250> help<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.090> foam<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:04.250> solidify<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> end

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to help the foam not solidify on the end

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.310 
to help the foam not solidify on the end
of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> night

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
of the night

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.440 
of the night
is<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.710> actually<00:02:07.220> use<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.850> little<00:02:08.119> bit<00:02:08.330> of

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
is to actually use a little bit of

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.780 
is to actually use a little bit of
petroleum<00:02:09.080> jelly<00:02:09.110> on<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.190> end<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.580> nozzle

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
petroleum jelly on the end of the nozzle

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.510 
petroleum jelly on the end of the nozzle
to<00:02:11.090> help<00:02:11.270> lubricate<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.840> coming<00:02:12.320> out<00:02:12.440> much<00:02:13.370> in

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
to help lubricate it coming out much in

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.550 
to help lubricate it coming out much in
the<00:02:13.610> same<00:02:13.820> way<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.390> foam<00:02:14.630> will<00:02:14.840> not<00:02:14.870> stick<00:02:15.020> to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the same way the foam will not stick to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.050 
the same way the foam will not stick to
the<00:02:15.590> petroleum<00:02:16.040> jelly<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.640> end<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.970> the

the petroleum jelly on the end of the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.050 
the petroleum jelly on the end of the
nozzle<00:02:17.470> another<00:02:18.470> handy<00:02:18.890> trick<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.340> apply<00:02:20.030> a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
nozzle another handy trick is to apply a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.330 
nozzle another handy trick is to apply a
thin<00:02:20.450> layer<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.170> petroleum<00:02:21.710> jelly<00:02:21.740> just

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
thin layer of the petroleum jelly just

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.360 
thin layer of the petroleum jelly just
on<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.910> outside<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.660> goggles<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.370> way

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
on the outside of the goggles that way

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.360 
on the outside of the goggles that way
it's<00:02:25.550> going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.760> come<00:02:25.970> off<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.360> lot<00:02:26.690> easier<00:02:27.370> when

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
it's going to come off a lot easier when

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.550 
it's going to come off a lot easier when
you<00:02:28.520> undoubtedly<00:02:28.820> do<00:02:29.420> get<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.720> foam<00:02:29.930> on<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you undoubtedly do get the foam on the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.520 
you undoubtedly do get the foam on the
goggles<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.820> as<00:02:31.970> always<00:02:32.210> use<00:02:32.840> common<00:02:33.290> sense

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
goggles and as always use common sense

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.530 
goggles and as always use common sense
and<00:02:33.770> be<00:02:33.860> as<00:02:33.950> safe<00:02:34.190> as<00:02:34.430> possible<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:35.450> know
