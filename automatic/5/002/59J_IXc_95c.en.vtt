was just playing with TV volume so I

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.670 
was just playing with TV volume so I
really<00:00:36.940> didn't<00:00:37.239> mind<00:00:37.420> having<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:38.500> know

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680

really didn't mind having you know
somebody<00:00:39.129> talking<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:39.760> yelling<00:00:39.940> in<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.390> mic

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
somebody talking and yelling in the mic

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.030 
somebody talking and yelling in the mic
because<00:00:40.720> I<00:00:40.900> couldn't<00:00:41.290> really<00:00:41.470> hear<00:00:41.650> them<00:00:41.860> too

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
because I couldn't really hear them too

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.130 
because I couldn't really hear them too
much<00:00:42.190> I<00:00:42.460> didn't<00:00:42.699> have<00:00:42.820> a<00:00:42.850> headset<00:00:43.059> on<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:43.659> it

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
much I didn't have a headset on so it

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.899 
much I didn't have a headset on so it
wasn't<00:00:44.440> overbearing<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.190> I<00:00:45.280> thought<00:00:45.519> it<00:00:45.760> was

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
wasn't overbearing and I thought it was

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.869 
wasn't overbearing and I thought it was
hilarious<00:00:46.470> from<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.589> moment<00:00:48.040> he<00:00:48.129> scream<00:00:48.670> like

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
hilarious from the moment he scream like

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.140 
hilarious from the moment he scream like
that<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.269> whole<00:00:49.299> game<00:00:50.110> he<00:00:50.890> was<00:00:51.100> yelling<00:00:51.970> you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
that the whole game he was yelling you

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.490 
that the whole game he was yelling you
could<00:00:52.330> hear<00:00:52.510> his<00:00:52.629> mom<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.260> background

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
could hear his mom in the background

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.710 
could hear his mom in the background
saying<00:00:54.159> things<00:00:54.580> like<00:00:54.670> what<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:55.269> heck<00:00:55.510> is

kill<00:01:01.839> streak<00:01:02.110> come<00:01:02.229> on<00:01:02.379> right<00:01:02.589> now<00:01:02.619> and<00:01:02.920> he<00:01:03.400> was

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
kill streak come on right now and he was

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.359 
kill streak come on right now and he was
like<00:01:03.760> barely<00:01:04.210> going<00:01:04.689> positive<00:01:05.199> he<00:01:06.010> was<00:01:06.189> like-

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
like barely going positive he was like-

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.399 
like barely going positive he was like-
in<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.090> first<00:01:07.330> half<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:07.780> anyways<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:08.229> thought

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
in the first half so anyways I thought

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.469 
in the first half so anyways I thought
that<00:01:08.530> was<00:01:08.680> really<00:01:08.860> funny<00:01:08.979> so<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:09.970> figured<00:01:10.060> I'd

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
that was really funny so I figured I'd

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.510 
that was really funny so I figured I'd
throw<00:01:10.510> that<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:11.080> died<00:01:11.289> into<00:01:11.859> the<00:01:11.979> commentary

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
throw that it died into the commentary

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.359 
throw that it died into the commentary
but<00:01:12.640> anyways<00:01:13.000> speaking<00:01:13.329> about<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:13.750> gameplay

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
but anyways speaking about the gameplay

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.340 
but anyways speaking about the gameplay
this<00:01:15.369> is<00:01:15.520> actually<00:01:16.000> my<00:01:16.149> first<00:01:16.179> 100<00:01:16.990> plus<00:01:17.170> on

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
this is actually my first 100 plus on

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.649 
this is actually my first 100 plus on
black<00:01:17.530> ops<00:01:17.710> 2<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.369> I'm<00:01:18.939> really<00:01:19.090> excited<00:01:19.390> about

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
black ops 2 and I'm really excited about

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.739 
black ops 2 and I'm really excited about
it<00:01:19.929> I<00:01:20.109> mean<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.560> didn't<00:01:21.340> expect<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.850> get<00:01:22.600> it

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
it I mean I didn't expect to get it

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.300 
it I mean I didn't expect to get it
today<00:01:22.899> because<00:01:23.140> my<00:01:23.289> headset<00:01:23.799> broke<00:01:23.979> like<00:01:24.189> I

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
today because my headset broke like I

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.410 
today because my headset broke like I
said<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:24.640> I've<00:01:24.759> been<00:01:24.880> playing<00:01:25.119> with<00:01:25.240> no

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
said so I've been playing with no

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.510 
said so I've been playing with no
headset<00:01:25.810> but<00:01:26.499> I<00:01:26.679> think<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.280> actually

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
headset but I think that it actually

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.099 
headset but I think that it actually
might<00:01:27.909> have<00:01:28.149> helped<00:01:28.450> me<00:01:28.570> out<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.749> bit<00:01:28.869> not

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
might have helped me out a bit not

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.260 
might have helped me out a bit not
having<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.469> headset<00:01:29.859> I<00:01:30.039> wasn't<00:01:30.549> really<00:01:30.820> relying

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
having a headset I wasn't really relying

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.599 
having a headset I wasn't really relying
too<00:01:31.479> much<00:01:31.509> on<00:01:31.840> just<00:01:32.140> sound<00:01:32.439> whoring<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.100> it

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
too much on just sound whoring and it

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:34.919 
too much on just sound whoring and it
kind<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.880> made<00:01:34.030> me<00:01:34.060> pay<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.359> little<00:01:34.539> bit<00:01:34.659> more

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
kind of made me pay a little bit more

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.919 
kind of made me pay a little bit more
attention<00:01:35.109> to<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.710> actual<00:01:36.369> game<00:01:36.729> going<00:01:37.689> on<00:01:37.810> in

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
attention to the actual game going on in

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.929 
attention to the actual game going on in
front<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.380> me<00:01:38.499> rather<00:01:38.770> than<00:01:38.950> kind<00:01:39.310> of<00:01:39.490> trying

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
front of me rather than kind of trying

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.899 
front of me rather than kind of trying
to<00:01:39.999> half<00:01:40.390> pay<00:01:40.780> attention<00:01:41.259> have<00:01:41.640> listening<00:01:42.640> and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
to half pay attention have listening and

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.639 
to half pay attention have listening and
you<00:01:43.539> know<00:01:43.659> paying<00:01:43.960> attention<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.439> what<00:01:44.560> i'm

hearing<00:01:44.950> rather<00:01:45.189> than<00:01:45.399> what<00:01:45.579> i'm<00:01:45.670> seeing

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030

the<00:01:54.219> second<00:01:54.639> half<00:01:54.789> i<00:01:55.060> get<00:01:55.479> out<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> new<00:01:55.960> killer

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
the second half i get out a new killer

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.749 
the second half i get out a new killer
killer<00:01:56.560> metal<00:01:56.829> i<00:01:56.920> think<00:01:57.130> i<00:01:57.189> actually<00:01:57.340> go<00:01:57.670> on

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
killer metal i think i actually go on

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.020 
killer metal i think i actually go on
like<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.909> 37<00:01:58.719> gunstreak<00:01:59.139> and<00:01:59.609> i<00:02:00.609> won't<00:02:00.880> give

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
like a 37 gunstreak and i won't give

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.389 
like a 37 gunstreak and i won't give
away<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.299> end<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.840> match<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.859> had<00:02:03.369> a

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
away the end of the match but I had a

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.539 
away the end of the match but I had a
101<00:02:04.329> kill<00:02:04.780> streak<00:02:05.109> with<00:02:05.259> about<00:02:05.469> 15<00:02:06.069> seconds

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
101 kill streak with about 15 seconds

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.139 
101 kill streak with about 15 seconds
left<00:02:06.819> and<00:02:07.860> tragedy<00:02:08.860> strikes<00:02:09.280> that's<00:02:09.850> all<00:02:10.119> I

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
left and tragedy strikes that's all I

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.660 
left and tragedy strikes that's all I
know<00:02:10.360> uh<00:02:10.740> that's<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.950> only<00:02:12.250> way<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.400> know<00:02:12.550> how

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
know uh that's the only way I know how

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.810 
know uh that's the only way I know how
to<00:02:12.730> put<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.930> was<00:02:14.410> unfortunate<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.340> was

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
to put it but it was unfortunate I was

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.100 
to put it but it was unfortunate I was
like<00:02:15.940> okay<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.600> flawless<00:02:17.140> game<00:02:17.380> and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
like okay this is a flawless game and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.800 
like okay this is a flawless game and
then<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:19.430> wasn't<00:02:19.730> flawless<00:02:20.000> I'm<00:02:20.420> gonna<00:02:20.600> put

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
then it wasn't flawless I'm gonna put

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.270 
then it wasn't flawless I'm gonna put
the<00:02:20.930> score<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.320> title<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.800> I'm<00:02:21.860> not<00:02:21.980> giving

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the score in the title so I'm not giving

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.210 
the score in the title so I'm not giving
it<00:02:22.340> away<00:02:22.460> but<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.150> actually<00:02:23.630> do<00:02:24.110> go<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.440> 101

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it away but I actually do go on a 101

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.160 
it away but I actually do go on a 101
kill<00:02:25.520> streak<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:26.630> only<00:02:26.930> at<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> very

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
kill streak and it's only at the very

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.920 
kill streak and it's only at the very
very<00:02:27.730> last<00:02:28.730> seconds<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.420> game<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.810> die

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
very last seconds of the game that I die

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.740 
very last seconds of the game that I die
and<00:02:30.440> ruin<00:02:30.770> my<00:02:30.890> flawless<00:02:31.130> game<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:31.760> that's

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
and ruin my flawless game but that's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.540 
and ruin my flawless game but that's
alright<00:02:32.960> there's<00:02:33.650> always<00:02:33.920> time<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.310> get

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
alright there's always time to get

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.010 
alright there's always time to get
another<00:02:34.790> flawless<00:02:35.090> game<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.630> not<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.810> big

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
another flawless game it's not a big

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.990 
another flawless game it's not a big
deal<00:02:36.050> I'm<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.950> pretty<00:02:37.250> stoked<00:02:37.610> about<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
deal I'm so pretty stoked about the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.600 
deal I'm so pretty stoked about the
match<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.960> I<00:02:39.350> guess<00:02:39.410> I'll<00:02:39.890> tell<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.250> guys<00:02:40.370> what

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
match so I guess I'll tell you guys what

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.700 
match so I guess I'll tell you guys what
class<00:02:40.820> i'm<00:02:41.030> using<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.260> first<00:02:42.440> half<00:02:42.650> and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
class i'm using in the first half and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.760 
class i'm using in the first half and
put<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.100> 94<00:02:43.850> with<00:02:44.390> my<00:02:44.540> typical<00:02:45.200> domination

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
put on a 94 with my typical domination

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.640 
put on a 94 with my typical domination
setup<00:02:46.100> which<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.850> hard-line<00:02:47.209> ghost

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
setup which is just a hard-line ghost

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.220 
setup which is just a hard-line ghost
toughness<00:02:48.650> dexterity<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.750> then<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.780> realized

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
toughness dexterity and then I realized

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.230 
toughness dexterity and then I realized
if<00:02:51.740> I'm<00:02:51.890> gonna<00:02:52.040> try<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> go<00:02:52.520> for<00:02:52.640> andhra<00:02:52.910> pluses

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
if I'm gonna try to go for andhra pluses

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.630 
if I'm gonna try to go for andhra pluses
I'm<00:02:53.330> gonna<00:02:53.480> need<00:02:53.660> scavengers<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.560> i<00:02:54.590> put<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.459> my

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
I'm gonna need scavengers so i put on my

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.430 
I'm gonna need scavengers so i put on my
vector<00:02:55.970> class<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:56.720> i<00:02:56.900> didn't<00:02:57.140> die<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
vector class but i didn't die in the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.760 
vector class but i didn't die in the
first<00:02:57.590> half<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.580> never<00:02:58.910> switched<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.770> only

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
first half so it never switched and only

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.410 
first half so it never switched and only
in<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> second<00:03:01.370> half<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.670> i<00:03:01.760> start<00:03:02.030> using<00:03:02.209> my

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
in the second half that i start using my

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.900 
in the second half that i start using my
vector<00:03:02.600> class<00:03:02.989> which<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.800> think<00:03:04.580> has<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
vector class which I I think has the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.530 
vector class which I I think has the
perks<00:03:05.600> hard<00:03:06.350> lining<00:03:06.709> ghost<00:03:06.890> as<00:03:07.130> well<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.610> then

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
perks hard lining ghost as well and then

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.630 
perks hard lining ghost as well and then
per<00:03:08.720> second<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.170> arm<00:03:09.290> using<00:03:09.459> toughness<00:03:10.459> in

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
per second to arm using toughness in

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.880 
per second to arm using toughness in
scavenger<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.989> definitely<00:03:12.230> helps<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.770> lot

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
scavenger so that definitely helps a lot

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.860 
scavenger so that definitely helps a lot
having<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.250> scavenger<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.880> was<00:03:14.060> able<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.750> get

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
having the scavenger I was able to get

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.900 
having the scavenger I was able to get
replenished<00:03:15.830> ammo<00:03:16.250> throughout<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.730> match

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
replenished ammo throughout the match

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.420 
replenished ammo throughout the match
and<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.630> way<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.070> wasn't<00:03:19.070> worrying<00:03:19.310> about

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
and this way I wasn't worrying about

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.370 
and this way I wasn't worrying about
picking<00:03:19.790> up<00:03:19.880> guns<00:03:20.120> like<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:20.510> actually<00:03:20.870> had<00:03:21.260> to

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
picking up guns like I actually had to

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.530 
picking up guns like I actually had to
do<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.739> first<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.640> first<00:03:22.910> round<00:03:23.209> of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
do in the first in the first round of

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.420 
do in the first in the first round of
the<00:03:23.570> match<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.830> definitely<00:03:25.040> helped<00:03:25.340> me

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the match so that definitely helped me

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.160 
the match so that definitely helped me
out<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.549> lot<00:03:25.610> but<00:03:25.910> I'll<00:03:26.060> moving<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.900> my<00:03:26.989> third

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
out a lot but I'll moving on to my third

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.080 
out a lot but I'll moving on to my third
/<00:03:27.380> con<00:03:27.530> i<00:03:27.709> think<00:03:27.980> i'm<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:28.070> using<00:03:28.400> dexterity

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
/ con i think i'm just using dexterity

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.880 
/ con i think i'm just using dexterity
attachment<00:03:29.780> wise<00:03:29.930> i'm<00:03:30.080> just<00:03:30.320> using<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
attachment wise i'm just using a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.420 
attachment wise i'm just using a
silencer<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:32.239> i<00:03:33.049> think<00:03:33.440> quick<00:03:33.680> quick<00:03:34.190> mags

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
silencer and i think quick quick mags

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.449 
silencer and i think quick quick mags
because<00:03:35.420> since<00:03:36.410> i<00:03:36.530> have<00:03:36.650> scavenger<00:03:37.160> I'm<00:03:37.280> not

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
because since i have scavenger I'm not

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.830 
because since i have scavenger I'm not
really<00:03:37.580> too<00:03:37.790> worried<00:03:37.970> about<00:03:38.030> ammo<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.690> it's

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
really too worried about ammo and it's

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.720 
really too worried about ammo and it's
better<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.769> quick<00:03:40.130> reload<00:03:40.930> then<00:03:41.930> to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
better to have that quick reload then to

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.210 
better to have that quick reload then to
run<00:03:43.730> out<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:43.940> ammo<00:03:44.570> in<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.860> middle<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.130> a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
run out of ammo in the middle of a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.190 
run out of ammo in the middle of a
gunfight<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.730> then<00:03:46.850> not<00:03:47.030> be<00:03:47.209> not<00:03:47.720> being<00:03:48.019> able

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
gunfight and then not be not being able

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.080 
gunfight and then not be not being able
to<00:03:48.380> reload<00:03:48.920> quick<00:03:49.160> enough<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.820> like<00:03:50.060> a

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
to reload quick enough that is like a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.180 
to reload quick enough that is like a
much<00:03:50.480> bigger<00:03:50.690> problem<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.530> figured<00:03:52.070> I'd

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
much bigger problem so I figured I'd

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.620 
much bigger problem so I figured I'd
just<00:03:52.340> run<00:03:52.519> quick<00:03:52.790> mags<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.450> actually

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
just run quick mags and it actually

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.870 
just run quick mags and it actually
worked<00:03:53.959> out<00:03:54.080> really<00:03:54.290> well<00:03:54.410> mismatch<00:03:54.950> ok<00:03:55.820> so

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
worked out really well mismatch ok so

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.030 
worked out really well mismatch ok so
the<00:03:56.120> map<00:03:56.330> aftermath<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.470> actually<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:57.920> think

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
the map aftermath is actually I think

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.490 
the map aftermath is actually I think
one<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.910> less<00:03:59.180> common<00:03:59.209> maps<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:00.230> get

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
one of the less common maps to get

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.470 
one of the less common maps to get
hundred-plus<00:04:00.890> game<00:04:01.130> plays<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.489> because<00:04:02.450> it's

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
hundred-plus game plays on because it's

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.979 
hundred-plus game plays on because it's
pretty<00:04:03.080> big<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:04.360> generally<00:04:05.360> speaking<00:04:05.690> and

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
pretty big and generally speaking and

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.930 
pretty big and generally speaking and
Scott<00:04:06.200> all<00:04:06.350> sorts<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.950> turns<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.580> places

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
Scott all sorts of turns and places

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.150 
Scott all sorts of turns and places
where<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:08.299> get<00:04:08.390> shot<00:04:08.630> from<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.140> at<00:04:10.010> least

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
where you can get shot from so at least

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.740 
where you can get shot from so at least
I<00:04:10.340> don't<00:04:10.400> think<00:04:10.700> I've<00:04:10.760> seen<00:04:10.790> too<00:04:11.120> many<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.420> might

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
I don't think I've seen too many I might

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.840 
I don't think I've seen too many I might
be<00:04:11.900> completely<00:04:12.350> wrong<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.799> there<00:04:13.070> might<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.250> so

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
be completely wrong in there might be so

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.370 
be completely wrong in there might be so
many<00:04:14.030> game<00:04:14.329> players<00:04:14.570> on<00:04:14.720> this<00:04:14.840> map<00:04:15.079> but<00:04:15.350> I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
many game players on this map but I

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.229 
many game players on this map but I
don't<00:04:15.950> think<00:04:16.070> I've<00:04:16.160> seen<00:04:16.190> too<00:04:16.549> many<00:04:16.700> on<00:04:16.940> here

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
don't think I've seen too many on here

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.880 
don't think I've seen too many on here
at<00:04:17.419> least<00:04:17.630> not<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.049> channels<00:04:18.380> i<00:04:18.470> watch<00:04:18.680> i

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
at least not on the channels i watch i

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.380 
at least not on the channels i watch i
might<00:04:19.070> just<00:04:19.100> be<00:04:19.340> watching<00:04:19.760> her<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:19.940> channels

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
might just be watching her on channels

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.140 
might just be watching her on channels
but<00:04:20.540> anyway<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.470> i<00:04:21.979> found<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.430> technique<00:04:22.880> that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
but anyway so i found a technique that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.330 
but anyway so i found a technique that
works<00:04:23.570> really<00:04:24.050> really<00:04:24.229> well<00:04:24.500> for<00:04:24.800> aftermath

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
works really really well for aftermath

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.010 
works really really well for aftermath
and<00:04:25.550> that's<00:04:25.729> pretty<00:04:25.910> much<00:04:26.030> if<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.720> enemy<00:04:26.990> team

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
and that's pretty much if the enemy team

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.770 
and that's pretty much if the enemy team
has<00:04:27.349> to<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> flag<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:29.090> want<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.419> stay<00:04:29.630> around

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
has to a flag you want to stay around

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.140 
has to a flag you want to stay around
this<00:04:30.169> diner<00:04:30.590> right<00:04:31.400> here<00:04:31.760> the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
this diner right here the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.870 
this diner right here the
that<00:04:32.420> I'm<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:33.050> one<00:04:33.170> rate<00:04:33.380> myarray<00:04:34.160> dough<00:04:34.400> and

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
that I'm the one rate myarray dough and

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.790 
that I'm the one rate myarray dough and
the<00:04:35.000> one<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:35.240> went<00:04:35.600> in<00:04:35.750> or<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.590> one<00:04:36.680> I'm

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
the one I just went in or the one I'm

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.100 
the one I just went in or the one I'm
about<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.220> go<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.460> but<00:04:37.640> this<00:04:38.240> diner<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.750> really

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
about to go in but this diner is really

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.930 
about to go in but this diner is really
good<00:04:39.290> because<00:04:39.470> especially<00:04:40.280> once<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.790> have

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
good because especially once you have

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.000 
good because especially once you have
your<00:04:41.000> orbital<00:04:41.390> vsat<00:04:41.600> up<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.650> can<00:04:42.980> just

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
your orbital vsat up like you can just

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.270 
your orbital vsat up like you can just
kind<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:44.270> can<00:04:44.480> predict<00:04:45.350> every<00:04:45.830> move<00:04:46.250> that

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
kind of you can predict every move that

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.430 
kind of you can predict every move that
your<00:04:46.610> enemies<00:04:46.910> going<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.150> do<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.630> can<00:04:47.840> you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
your enemies going to do you can you

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.320 
your enemies going to do you can you
know<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.620> have<00:04:48.980> so<00:04:49.220> many<00:04:49.310> little<00:04:49.730> spots<00:04:50.150> that

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
know you have so many little spots that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.140 
know you have so many little spots that
you<00:04:50.390> can<00:04:50.600> kind<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:51.100> weight<00:04:52.100> in<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.430> diner<00:04:52.700> for

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
you can kind of weight in the diner for

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.940 
you can kind of weight in the diner for
them<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.420> come<00:04:53.690> if<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:54.080> see<00:04:54.260> them<00:04:54.410> all<00:04:54.620> spawn

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
them to come if you see them all spawn

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.650 
them to come if you see them all spawn
coming<00:04:55.400> into<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.700> diner<00:04:55.880> where<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.270> can<00:04:56.420> cut

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
coming into the diner where you can cut

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.380 
coming into the diner where you can cut
them<00:04:56.810> off<00:04:56.990> like<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:57.440> just<00:04:57.470> cut<00:04:57.860> that<00:04:57.980> guy<00:04:58.160> off<00:04:58.390> so

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
them off like I just cut that guy off so

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.000 
them off like I just cut that guy off so
it's<00:04:59.540> got<00:04:59.660> tons<00:04:59.870> of<00:04:59.990> different<00:05:00.110> routes<00:05:00.590> where

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
it's got tons of different routes where

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.100 
it's got tons of different routes where
I<00:05:01.070> can<00:05:01.490> you<00:05:02.000> know<00:05:02.120> kind<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.450> kill<00:05:02.690> them<00:05:02.840> as<00:05:02.930> they

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
I can you know kind of kill them as they

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.050 
I can you know kind of kill them as they
spawn<00:05:03.410> and<00:05:03.680> then<00:05:03.800> just<00:05:04.070> pop<00:05:04.370> back<00:05:04.580> out<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
spawn and then just pop back out of the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.360 
spawn and then just pop back out of the
action<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.630> back<00:05:05.900> in<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.260> out<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.740> it's

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
action and back in and out and it's

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.360 
action and back in and out and it's
really<00:05:07.670> easy<00:05:07.870> quick<00:05:08.870> interruption<00:05:09.500> here<00:05:09.830> if

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
really easy quick interruption here if

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.980 
really easy quick interruption here if
you<00:05:10.550> guys<00:05:10.580> were<00:05:10.910> listening<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.450> what<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:11.630> just

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
you guys were listening to what I just

what she said upd it but anyways it's

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.160 
what she said upd it but anyways it's
really<00:05:22.460> easy<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:23.000> navigate<00:05:23.480> your<00:05:23.960> way<00:05:24.020> around

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
really easy to navigate your way around

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
really easy to navigate your way around
this<00:05:24.680> building<00:05:24.920> and<00:05:26.260> kill<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:27.410> enemy<00:05:27.740> as<00:05:27.920> they

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
this building and kill the enemy as they

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.880 
this building and kill the enemy as they
kind<00:05:28.460> of<00:05:28.640> continuously<00:05:29.450> spawn<00:05:29.780> there<00:05:30.020> you

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
kind of continuously spawn there you

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.500 
kind of continuously spawn there you
still<00:05:31.130> got<00:05:31.280> a<00:05:31.310> bunch<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.700> color<00:05:31.940> at<00:05:32.120> all<00:05:32.150> times

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
still got a bunch of color at all times

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.290 
still got a bunch of color at all times
so<00:05:32.750> you're<00:05:33.470> pretty<00:05:33.800> much<00:05:33.950> always<00:05:34.430> going<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.270> be

so you're pretty much always going to be

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.970 
so you're pretty much always going to be
able<00:05:35.420> to<00:05:35.570> avoid<00:05:35.750> getting<00:05:36.050> flanked<00:05:36.410> as<00:05:36.590> long<00:05:36.800> as

able to avoid getting flanked as long as

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.070 
able to avoid getting flanked as long as
you<00:05:37.070> play<00:05:37.220> carefully<00:05:37.520> enough<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.210> pretty
