00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
have a look at as we go around so we

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.200 
have a look at as we go around so we
start<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> top<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:36.719> Dexter<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.469> fitted<00:00:37.800> with

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
start the top the Dexter is fitted with

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.069 
start the top the Dexter is fitted with
silicon<00:00:39.210> seals<00:00:40.079> around<00:00:40.440> neck<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> wrists<00:00:41.760> and

silicon seals around neck and wrists and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
silicon seals around neck and wrists and
benefit<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.320> silicon<00:00:43.890> seal<00:00:44.040> not<00:00:44.550> only<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
benefit of a silicon seal not only is it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
benefit of a silicon seal not only is it
more<00:00:45.329> comfortable<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.140> very<00:00:46.200> very<00:00:46.530> stretchy

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
more comfortable it's very very stretchy

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.779 
more comfortable it's very very stretchy
but<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.820> also<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:49.219> quick<00:00:50.219> release<00:00:50.250> system

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
but they also use a quick release system

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.510 
but they also use a quick release system
so<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> seals<00:00:52.350> himself<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.070> changed

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so that the seals himself can be changed

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
so that the seals himself can be changed

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
so front loading zips a front entry it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
so front loading zips a front entry it
doesn't<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.509> typical<00:01:54.780> standard<00:01:55.670> brass

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
doesn't have your typical standard brass

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.080 
doesn't have your typical standard brass
it<00:01:56.969> zip<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.719> has<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> new<00:01:58.799> much<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.579> flexible

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it zip it has a new much more flexible

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
it zip it has a new much more flexible

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.550 

so<00:02:05.680> rather<00:02:05.920> than<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.540> brass<00:02:07.780> teeth<00:02:08.200> you've

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
so rather than the brass teeth you've

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.280 
so rather than the brass teeth you've
got<00:02:08.770> this<00:02:08.920> plastic<00:02:09.190> zip<00:02:09.610> which<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.750> completely

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
got this plastic zip which is completely

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.280 
got this plastic zip which is completely
dry<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.760> isn't<00:02:13.060> very<00:02:13.420> very<00:02:13.630> comfortable<00:02:13.840> way

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
dry it isn't very very comfortable way

so when she got on and can flex with you

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.539 
so when she got on and can flex with you
it's<00:03:06.549> not<00:03:06.610> completely<00:03:07.239> rigid<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:09.489> a

and you've got a big stain still tearing

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.630 
and you've got a big stain still tearing
inside<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:40.359> has<00:03:40.510> an<00:03:40.660> anchor<00:03:40.870> point<00:03:44.519> drained<00:03:45.519> in

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
inside it has an anchor point drained in

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.150 
inside it has an anchor point drained in
the<00:03:45.730> bottom<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.359> water<00:03:46.600> does<00:03:47.079> drain<00:03:47.739> out<00:03:47.920> very

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
the bottom so water does drain out very

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.630 
the bottom so water does drain out very
quickly<00:03:49.890> double<00:03:50.890> thickness<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.489> knee

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
quickly double thickness on the knee

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.449 
quickly double thickness on the knee
area<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.780> do<00:03:52.900> have<00:03:52.930> lots<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.650> abrasion

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
area so you do have lots of abrasion

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.190 
area so you do have lots of abrasion
protection<00:03:54.660> it's<00:03:55.660> going<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.870> take<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:55.989> long

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
protection it's going to take a long

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.069 
protection it's going to take a long
time<00:03:56.380> for<00:03:56.700> abrasive<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:58.359> get<00:03:58.540> through<00:03:58.780> there

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
time for abrasive to get through there

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.289 
time for abrasive to get through there
it's<00:03:59.920> particularly<00:04:00.250> tough<00:04:00.549> material<00:04:01.030> as<00:04:01.120> well

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
it's particularly tough material as well

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.559 
it's particularly tough material as well
so<00:04:01.420> it's<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.690> very<00:04:01.900> long<00:04:02.049> life<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:04.150> suit<00:04:04.390> is

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
of webbing and they disbanded walk

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.270 
of webbing and they disbanded walk
towards<00:04:23.990> bottom<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.590> can<00:04:24.620> get<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.040> fair

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
towards bottom so you can get a fair

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.190 
towards bottom so you can get a fair
amount<00:04:25.310> in<00:04:25.610> there<00:04:25.790> as<00:04:25.940> well

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.630 

Hollis<00:04:30.200> branches<00:04:30.590> saw<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:30.920> and<00:04:31.220> again<00:04:31.430> it's

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
Hollis branches saw it and again it's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.060 
Hollis branches saw it and again it's
drained<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.990> allow<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.200> excess<00:04:33.590> water<00:04:33.770> to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
drained to allow the excess water to

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.850 
drained to allow the excess water to
come<00:04:34.220> out<00:04:35.740> when<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.830> arms<00:04:37.130> got<00:04:38.860> reflective

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
come out when the arms got reflective

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.530 
come out when the arms got reflective
band<00:04:39.980> around<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.430> outside<00:04:40.790> just<00:04:41.030> great<00:04:41.300> for

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
band around the outside just great for

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.140 
band around the outside just great for
low<00:04:41.810> visibility<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.620> again<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.550> can<00:04:43.700> see<00:04:43.940> the

low visibility and again you can see the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.750 
low visibility and again you can see the
silicon<00:04:44.990> seals<00:04:45.230> on<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.530> wrists<00:04:45.760> incredibly
