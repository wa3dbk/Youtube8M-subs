and he's hitting the bumps and then the
thing<00:00:11.610> explodes<00:00:12.349> on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.500> screen<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.920> go

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
thing explodes on the screen we go

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860 
thing explodes on the screen we go
flying<00:00:14.309> but<00:00:14.549> there's<00:00:14.700> really<00:00:14.880> nothing<00:00:15.570> except

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
flying but there's really nothing except

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.210 
flying but there's really nothing except
a<00:00:15.960> little<00:00:15.990> vibration<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.890> good<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.190> that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
a little vibration so what good is that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.359 
a little vibration so what good is that
like<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.330> something<00:00:19.109> missing<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:20.250> we

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
like it is something missing here if we

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.830 
like it is something missing here if we
started<00:00:20.640> thinking<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:20.939> what<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.510> know

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
started thinking about what you know

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.880 
started thinking about what you know
that<00:00:21.960> would<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.140> great<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.470> could<00:00:22.619> kind<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that would be great if we could kind of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.580 
that would be great if we could kind of
get<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.460> feeling<00:00:23.519> across<00:00:24.390> not<00:00:25.320> only<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
get that feeling across not only do you

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170 
get that feeling across not only do you
feel<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> impact<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.550> feel<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.939> spread

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.130 

there<00:01:10.850> are<00:01:10.970> three<00:01:11.150> major<00:01:11.300> components<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:12.050> this

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
there are three major components to this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.710 
there are three major components to this
suit<00:01:12.410> there's<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.890> decoder<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.910> exoskeleton

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
suit there's the decoder the exoskeleton

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.960 
suit there's the decoder the exoskeleton
and<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.440> sim<00:01:15.620> skin<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.370> decoder<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.790> the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
and the sim skin the decoder is the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.490 
and the sim skin the decoder is the
piece<00:01:17.150> that<00:01:17.180> attaches<00:01:17.330> actually<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.320> your

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
piece that attaches actually to your

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.080 
piece that attaches actually to your
console<00:01:19.010> or<00:01:19.130> platform<00:01:19.640> takes<00:01:19.910> information

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
console or platform takes information

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.969 
console or platform takes information
then<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.660> brings<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.050> and<00:01:21.320> sends<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.950> the

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
then it brings that and sends it to the

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.490 
then it brings that and sends it to the
exoskeleton<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.450> exoskeleton<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.320> now<00:01:24.440> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
exoskeleton the exoskeleton is now the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900 
exoskeleton the exoskeleton is now the
component<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.010> sort<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.430> has<00:01:25.550> all<00:01:25.760> the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
component that sort of has all the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.030 
component that sort of has all the
pieces<00:01:26.120> in<00:01:26.390> airag<00:01:26.900> that<00:01:27.050> you're<00:01:27.140> wearing<00:01:27.500> from

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
pieces in airag that you're wearing from

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.770 
pieces in airag that you're wearing from
the<00:01:28.250> nervous<00:01:28.760> system<00:01:29.060> which<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.450> feedback

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
the nervous system which is the feedback

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.840 
the nervous system which is the feedback
to<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.860> control<00:01:31.190> center<00:01:31.220> which<00:01:31.580> takes

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
to the control center which takes

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.090 
to the control center which takes
information<00:01:32.060> from<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.660> decoder<00:01:32.990> as<00:01:33.260> well<00:01:33.950> as

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
information from the decoder as well as

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.859 
information from the decoder as well as
the<00:01:34.310> power<00:01:34.670> supply<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.300> make<00:01:35.630> sure<00:01:35.750> it's

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
the power supply to make sure it's

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.359 
the power supply to make sure it's
wireless<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:39.619> sound<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.040> we're<00:01:40.190> providing

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
wireless the sound that we're providing

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.090 
wireless the sound that we're providing
is<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:40.880> patented<00:01:41.450> sound<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.770> quite<00:01:43.070> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
is a patented sound it's quite a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.160 
is a patented sound it's quite a
different<00:01:43.550> experience<00:01:44.000> we<00:01:44.570> want<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.899> make<00:01:45.020> it

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
different experience we want to make it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.080 
different experience we want to make it
a<00:01:45.200> surround<00:01:45.740> sound<00:01:45.860> feel<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.670> idea<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:46.970> we

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
a surround sound feel so the idea is we

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.389 
a surround sound feel so the idea is we
have<00:01:47.240> six<00:01:47.570> speakers<00:01:47.990> two<00:01:48.649> on<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.860> front<00:01:49.040> on

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
have six speakers two on the front on

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.340 
have six speakers two on the front on
this<00:01:49.759> side<00:01:49.970> two<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.479> side<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.080> then<00:01:51.229> on

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
this side two on that side and then on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.350 
this side two on that side and then on
the<00:01:51.470> back<00:01:51.649> one<00:01:52.340> here<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.670> one<00:01:52.729> here<00:01:52.850> as<00:01:53.240> well

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
the back one here and one here as well

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.120 
the back one here and one here as well
as<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.509> subwoofer<00:01:53.840> you're<00:01:54.590> always<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
as a subwoofer you're always in the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.520 
as a subwoofer you're always in the
sweet<00:01:55.430> spot<00:01:55.550> no<00:01:55.820> matter<00:01:55.880> where<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.360> are

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.410 

and<00:02:00.100> as<00:02:00.190> for<00:02:00.400> like<00:02:00.549> vibratory<00:02:00.940> feedback<00:02:01.299> right

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
and as for like vibratory feedback right

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.520 
and as for like vibratory feedback right
now<00:02:01.540> it's<00:02:01.659> always<00:02:01.840> been<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> controller

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
now it's always been to the controller

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.289 
now it's always been to the controller
so<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.830> feel<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> rumble<00:02:03.430> in<00:02:03.460> your<00:02:03.610> hand<00:02:03.850> now

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
so you feel the rumble in your hand now

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.190 
so you feel the rumble in your hand now
we're<00:02:04.450> actually<00:02:04.540> getting<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.049> it's

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
we're actually getting it so it's

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.690 
we're actually getting it so it's
located<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.010> specific<00:02:06.310> parts<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.580> your

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
located on the specific parts of your

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.760 
located on the specific parts of your
body<00:02:06.790> where<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.090> should<00:02:07.330> be<00:02:07.360> there<00:02:08.020> are<00:02:08.200> 16

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
body where it should be there are 16

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.230 
body where it should be there are 16
points<00:02:09.100> on<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.280> front<00:02:09.520> eight<00:02:09.789> points<00:02:10.090> on<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
points on the front eight points on the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.660 
points on the front eight points on the
side<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.660> 16<00:02:11.230> points<00:02:11.530> on<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.770> back<00:02:11.950> alright

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
side and 16 points on the back alright

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.710 
side and 16 points on the back alright
so<00:02:12.790> first<00:02:12.880> thing<00:02:13.090> we're<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.630> I'm

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
so first thing we're going to do is I'm

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.120 
so first thing we're going to do is I'm
going<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.870> test<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.319> vibrational<00:02:14.890> stuff

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
going to test this in vibrational stuff

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.920 
going to test this in vibrational stuff
so<00:02:15.459> let's<00:02:16.030> start<00:02:16.209> with<00:02:16.390> I'm<00:02:16.630> just<00:02:16.720> going<00:02:16.870> to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
so let's start with I'm just going to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.309 
so let's start with I'm just going to
set<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> value<00:02:17.319> here<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.720> I'm<00:02:19.870> going<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.050> be<00:02:20.140> top

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
set a value here and I'm going to be top

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.290 
set a value here and I'm going to be top
right<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.340> do<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.630> yeah<00:02:24.120> alright<00:02:25.120> so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
right you can do that yeah alright so

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.059 
right you can do that yeah alright so
let's<00:02:25.450> switch<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.780> over<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.230> bottom<00:02:26.890> left

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
let's switch that over to bottom left

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.410 
let's switch that over to bottom left
and<00:02:28.140> with<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.319> yeah<00:02:29.950> switch<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.640> awesome

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
and with you yeah switch is awesome

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.330 
and with you yeah switch is awesome
that's<00:02:32.019> pretty<00:02:32.350> much<00:02:32.500> how<00:02:32.650> vibration<00:02:33.130> works

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
that's pretty much how vibration works

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.759 
that's pretty much how vibration works
as<00:02:33.550> for<00:02:34.000> stims<00:02:34.420> they're<00:02:34.930> pretty<00:02:35.080> much<00:02:35.110> focused

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
as for stims they're pretty much focused

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.920 
as for stims they're pretty much focused
on<00:02:35.920> particular<00:02:36.310> muscles<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.330> contracts<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
on particular muscles it contracts the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.150 
on particular muscles it contracts the
muscles<00:02:38.260> i<00:02:38.380> can<00:02:38.590> either<00:02:38.650> give<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.920> full

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
muscles i can either give a full

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.680 
muscles i can either give a full
contraction<00:02:39.670> or<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.000> can<00:02:40.090> be<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.269> slight

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
contraction or it can be a slight

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.870 
contraction or it can be a slight
contraction<00:02:40.959> once<00:02:41.920> again<00:02:42.040> same<00:02:42.340> thing<00:02:42.610> top

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
contraction once again same thing top

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.470 
contraction once again same thing top
right<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.630> they<00:02:43.720> just<00:02:43.750> sets<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.140> how<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.350> okay

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
right so they just sets of how you okay

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.930 
right so they just sets of how you okay
there

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
there

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.330 
there
all<00:02:48.330> right<00:02:48.480> shut<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.780> off<00:02:48.950> how<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.010> feeling

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
all right shut that off how you feeling

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.770 
all right shut that off how you feeling
we<00:02:50.850> can<00:02:50.970> see<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.180> moving<00:02:51.210> your<00:02:51.480> shoulder

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
we can see it moving your shoulder

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.830 
we can see it moving your shoulder
forward<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.380> yeah<00:02:52.530> nothing<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.040> wait

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
forward like that yeah nothing will wait

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.880 
forward like that yeah nothing will wait
all<00:02:54.840> right<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.110> that's<00:02:55.260> pretty<00:02:55.500> much<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.710> for

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
all right so that's pretty much it for

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.620 
all right so that's pretty much it for
the<00:02:56.130> basic<00:02:56.460> fundamentals<00:02:56.580> what<00:02:57.150> air<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
the basic fundamentals what air I can

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.630 
the basic fundamentals what air I can
actually<00:02:57.990> do<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.890> what<00:02:59.070> do<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.220> think<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.490> it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
actually do so what do you think of it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.670 
actually do so what do you think of it
it<00:03:00.330> was<00:03:00.630> pretty<00:03:00.780> interesting<00:03:01.050> i'm<00:03:01.410> not<00:03:01.440> really

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
it was pretty interesting i'm not really

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.000 
it was pretty interesting i'm not really
experienced<00:03:02.220> anything<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.720> yeah

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
experienced anything like that yeah

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.590 
experienced anything like that yeah
virtual<00:03:05.010> world<00:03:05.220> awareness<00:03:05.880> you're<00:03:06.420> actually

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
virtual world awareness you're actually

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.110 
virtual world awareness you're actually
inside<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.830> world<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.580> you're<00:03:08.700> playing<00:03:08.940> it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.150 

the<00:03:13.120> last<00:03:13.330> piece<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.200> sim<00:03:14.410> skin<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.950> sim

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
the last piece is the sim skin so sim

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.190 
the last piece is the sim skin so sim
skin<00:03:15.460> is<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.970> look<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.270> feel<00:03:16.480> over<00:03:16.720> top<00:03:16.960> you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
skin is the look and feel over top you

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.780 
skin is the look and feel over top you
can<00:03:17.320> then<00:03:17.350> have<00:03:17.590> these<00:03:17.770> front<00:03:18.130> piece<00:03:18.310> plate<00:03:18.670> so

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
can then have these front piece plate so

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.250 
can then have these front piece plate so
you<00:03:18.850> put<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.180> or<00:03:19.330> armor<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.930> sides<00:03:20.140> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
you put on or armor on the sides and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.660 
you put on or armor on the sides and
that<00:03:20.410> kind<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.620> stuff<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.160> actually<00:03:21.310> look<00:03:21.640> like

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
that kind of stuff it actually look like

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that kind of stuff it actually look like
you're<00:03:21.940> in<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> game<00:03:22.270> that<00:03:22.300> you're<00:03:22.510> actually

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
you're in the game that you're actually

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.480 
you're in the game that you're actually
envisioning<00:03:23.200> yourself<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:23.710> games<00:03:24.310> already

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
envisioning yourself in games already

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.220 
envisioning yourself in games already

have sound arity of haptic feedback so

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.270 
have sound arity of haptic feedback so
we<00:03:26.260> take<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.680> information<00:03:26.800> that's<00:03:27.220> already

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
we take that information that's already

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.950 
we take that information that's already
there<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.790> we<00:03:27.850> implemented<00:03:28.360> with<00:03:28.450> Eric<00:03:28.810> and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
there and we implemented with Eric and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.710 
there and we implemented with Eric and
it's<00:03:29.530> now<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.710> matter<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.610> developers<00:03:31.240> to

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
it's now a matter of the developers to

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.600 
it's now a matter of the developers to
take<00:03:31.960> on<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.320> role<00:03:32.560> if<00:03:32.980> they<00:03:33.160> have<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.340> game

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
take on that role if they have a game

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.830 
take on that role if they have a game
and<00:03:33.730> they<00:03:33.820> want<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.030> compete<00:03:34.300> with<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> Triple

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.360 
and they want to compete with the Triple
A<00:03:34.930> game<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.350> they're<00:03:35.440> only<00:03:35.470> an<00:03:35.710> indie<00:03:35.980> company

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
A game and they're only an indie company

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.010 
A game and they're only an indie company
well<00:03:36.610> now<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.820> can<00:03:36.940> it's<00:03:37.300> not<00:03:37.450> just<00:03:37.660> about<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
well now you can it's not just about the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.199 
well now you can it's not just about the
visuals<00:03:38.440> anymore<00:03:38.830> it's<00:03:39.310> about<00:03:39.400> how<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.820> can

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
visuals anymore it's about how you can

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.060 
visuals anymore it's about how you can
how<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.630> can<00:03:40.870> differentiate<00:03:41.500> your<00:03:41.740> product

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
how you can differentiate your product

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.740 
how you can differentiate your product
we<00:03:42.880> think<00:03:43.060> that's<00:03:43.120> going<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.330> be<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> big

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
we think that's going to be a big

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.360 
we think that's going to be a big
difference
