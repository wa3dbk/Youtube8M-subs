00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
useful for internet security ok it works

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.260 
useful for internet security ok it works
like<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.580> start<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.150> big

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
like this start with two really big

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.300 
like this start with two really big
Prime's<00:01:06.659> call<00:01:06.960> them<00:01:07.080> p1<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.530> p2<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.070> then

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
Prime's call them p1 and p2 and then

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.590 
Prime's call them p1 and p2 and then
you're<00:01:08.460> multiply<00:01:08.880> them<00:01:09.060> together<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
you're multiply them together to get a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.950 
you're multiply them together to get a
composite<00:01:09.810> number<00:01:10.140> we'll<00:01:10.650> call<00:01:10.680> C<00:01:11.570> ok<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.780> C

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
composite number we'll call C ok and C

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
composite number we'll call C ok and C
is<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> prime<00:01:13.470> number<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:14.010> course<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.520> but

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
is not a prime number of course not but

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.880 
is not a prime number of course not but
the<00:01:15.330> point<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.080> while<00:01:16.350> computers<00:01:16.770> are

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the point is that while computers are

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.810 
the point is that while computers are
very<00:01:16.920> good<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.280> multiplying<00:01:17.700> numbers

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
very good at multiplying numbers

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
very good at multiplying numbers
together<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.020> start<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.560> C<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.100> try

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
together if you start with C and try

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.550 
together if you start with C and try
working<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.240> p1<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.630> p2<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.259> turns

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
working back to get p1 and p2 it turns

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.429 
working back to get p1 and p2 it turns
out<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.860> super<00:01:23.159> hard<00:01:23.310> ah<00:01:23.900> right<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.259> then

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
out to be super hard ah right so then

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.640 
out to be super hard ah right so then
what<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.330> number<00:01:27.570> C<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.290> used<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
what so this number C is used to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.950 
what so this number C is used to
generate<00:01:28.799> what's<00:01:29.310> called<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.670> public<00:01:30.000> key<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
generate what's called a public key a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.109 
generate what's called a public key a
code<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:31.979> available<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.490> anyone<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> use

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
code that's available for anyone to use

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.560 
code that's available for anyone to use
hence<00:01:33.570> public<00:01:34.170> yeah<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.820> bank<00:01:36.060> sends<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
hence public yeah the bank sends you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.170 
hence public yeah the bank sends you
this<00:01:36.810> public<00:01:37.380> key<00:01:37.409> which<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.250> use<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> fix

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
this public key which you use to fix

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.640 
this public key which you use to fix
your<00:01:39.329> credit<00:01:39.630> card<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
your credit card or what have you

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.620 
your credit card or what have you
and<00:01:41.980> then<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:43.000> returns<00:01:43.120> back<00:01:43.480> safe<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.110> sound

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and then it returns back safe and sound

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.480 
and then it returns back safe and sound
so<00:01:46.630> then<00:01:46.840> what<00:01:46.990> but<00:01:47.410> P<00:01:47.590> 1<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:47.830> P<00:01:47.980> 2<00:01:48.160> are<00:01:48.190> used<00:01:48.400> to

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
so then what but P 1 and P 2 are used to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.040 
so then what but P 1 and P 2 are used to
decrypt<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:49.000> code<00:01:49.300> so<00:01:49.630> they<00:01:49.750> have<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:49.960> be

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
decrypt this code so they have to be

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.750 
decrypt this code so they have to be
kept<00:01:50.200> secret<00:01:50.410> they're<00:01:51.010> what's<00:01:51.190> called<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
kept secret they're what's called the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.450 
kept secret they're what's called the
private<00:01:52.120> key<00:01:52.480> right<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:53.620> they're<00:01:53.800> not<00:01:54.130> beamed

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
private key right so they're not beamed

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.360 
private key right so they're not beamed
across<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.940> Internet<00:01:55.300> no<00:01:55.570> only<00:01:56.560> your<00:01:56.860> bank<00:01:57.190> or

couple of digits right so then how big
is<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.640> next<00:02:43.210> biggest<00:02:43.420> prime<00:02:43.780> number<00:02:44.080> going

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
is the next biggest prime number going

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.830 
is the next biggest prime number going
to<00:02:44.350> be

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
to be

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.320

nobody knows it's a mystery ah well
there<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.660> go<00:02:52.870> it's<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:53.680> another<00:02:54.010> one<00:02:54.220> of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
there you go it's just another one of

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.260 
there you go it's just another one of
