00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.180

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:50.460
 You go there in the settings of your 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.070
 smartphone will not 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 show why you are without hulk and the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.280
 program that I use to record so far 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 from my smartphone it only works with 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.560
 Fine then it will also show how 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.300
 you enable usb debugging you go in 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.220
 I looked for settings you will look for 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.530
 developer options 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.650
 and you look there debugging I got you 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.390
 brand her because if you do not brand not 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.360
 works you can see that the program 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.750
 that he has not yet identified my 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.520
 smartphone why debug usb 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.430
 she is not active but I just 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.630
 activate and you see that it is already 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.960
 looking for the device model here 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.350
 so let's wait a little bit to the 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.350
 identification 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.340
 ready has already been identified here in 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.260

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.710

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:05.120
 hulk is applying here this waits 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.120
 now the process 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.190
 it's not a time-consuming process, it 's fast 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.610
 after he finished he will restart the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.770
 smartphone need not be afraid and when 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.770
 it will return and it will be routed 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.000
 wait a little longer there is almost 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.000
 ending 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.620

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.810

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:28.919
 You can see here and ruth succeeds. 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:36.560
 My smartphone is restarting here and 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:41.090

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.380
