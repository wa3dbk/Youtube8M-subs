00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
if I had to get braces again I would get

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.550 
if I had to get braces again I would get
the<00:03:48.880> lack<00:03:49.060> because<00:03:49.510> like<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.780> feel<00:03:49.990> black<00:03:50.260> makes

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
the lack because like I feel black makes

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.750 
the lack because like I feel black makes
your<00:03:50.680> teeth<00:03:50.800> look<00:03:50.860> whiter<00:03:50.980> leave<00:03:51.640> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
your teeth look whiter leave the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.760 
your teeth look whiter leave the
contrast<00:03:52.240> and<00:03:52.420> stuff<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:53.050> black<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.410> silver

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
contrast and stuff so black and silver

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.590 
contrast and stuff so black and silver
are<00:03:53.890> two<00:03:54.160> colors<00:03:54.490> that<00:03:54.520> I<00:03:54.700> would<00:03:54.880> go<00:03:54.970> for<00:03:55.000> also

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
are two colors that I would go for also

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.330 
are two colors that I would go for also
the<00:03:55.750> reason<00:03:55.930> why<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.320> had<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.680> wear<00:03:56.830> braces<00:03:57.040> for

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
the reason why I had to wear braces for

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.370 
the reason why I had to wear braces for
four<00:03:57.580> years<00:03:57.820> instead<00:03:58.300> of<00:03:58.360> two<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.900> because<00:03:59.260> i

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
four years instead of two is because i

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.350 
four years instead of two is because i
do<00:03:59.500> not<00:03:59.740> wear<00:03:59.890> my<00:04:00.070> rubber<00:04:00.250> band<00:04:00.670> here's<00:04:01.150> what

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
they look like they're different for

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.680 
they look like they're different for
every<00:04:02.770> different<00:04:03.100> bite<00:04:03.670> only<00:04:04.390> gonna<00:04:04.540> need

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
every different bite only gonna need

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.330 
every different bite only gonna need
rubber<00:04:04.870> bands<00:04:05.320> if<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.590> have<00:04:05.770> a<00:04:05.800> cross<00:04:06.070> by

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
really small but it goes onto the hook
