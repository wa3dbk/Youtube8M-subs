we're<00:01:36.900> seeing<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> mouth<00:01:38.220> guards

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we're seeing now with the mouth guards

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
we're seeing now with the mouth guards
it's<00:01:39.000> given<00:01:39.360> us<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> opportunity<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's given us the opportunity to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.830 
it's given us the opportunity to
increase<00:01:40.710> his<00:01:41.009> workload<00:01:41.280> his<00:01:42.000> capacity<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
increase his workload his capacity for

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.620 
increase his workload his capacity for
the<00:01:43.200> workout<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.799> itself<00:01:43.909> because<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.420> what

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the workout in itself because of what

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.389 
the workout in itself because of what
the<00:01:45.810> mouth<00:01:45.960> guard<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.320> doing<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.829> opening<00:01:47.280> up

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the mouth guard is doing to opening up

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
the mouth guard is doing to opening up
more<00:01:47.700> air<00:01:47.970> flow<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.299> oxygen<00:01:48.540> throughout<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
more air flow and oxygen throughout the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.289 
more air flow and oxygen throughout the
muscles<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.490> we're<00:01:50.610> finding<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.060> his

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
muscles so what we're finding that his

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.800 
muscles so what we're finding that his
aerobic<00:01:51.810> endurance<00:01:52.320> has<00:01:53.250> increased<00:01:53.810> double

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
aerobic endurance has increased double

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
aerobic endurance has increased double
and<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.590> we're<00:01:55.770> finding<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.130> he's<00:01:56.369> able<00:01:56.610> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and so we're finding that he's able to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
and so we're finding that he's able to
create<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> much<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:57.930> intense<00:01:58.229> atmosphere

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
create a much more intense atmosphere

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
create a much more intense atmosphere
for<00:01:58.950> his<00:01:59.100> work<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.520> which<00:02:00.090> makes<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.420> get

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
for his work out which makes them get

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.010 
for his work out which makes them get
better

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
better

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.079 
better
