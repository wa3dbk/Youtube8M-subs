00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:12.249
 Hello, I'm back again 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.460
 There was something about Rickert 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.849
 we are here in Durban where the photoblogger kitchen and in the 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.570
 Living room kitchen 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.810
 and we do certain people in the field today how Rummenigge got along 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 parental excellent sheets have been made but we all special it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.069
 do this time today because they make the Berlinische his Olga b TR 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.069
 The Taliban have made others has some big differences 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.680
 Today we do Paetzold Mieter Lokal 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.700
 that is, percent not so many carbs we make a bottom of 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.410
 So carbohydrates are concerned 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.829
 I also want to be with the Italian of the nose 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.589
 let's just start now we're bringing along with PlÃ¼tzer 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.589
 soil and flooring relatively easy to produce the first thing he did 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.840
 Needs ten eggs 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.820
 You need a second key for this 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.380
 and indeed we want to start the AIT clear of egg yolk 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.570
 I think that separates most of the work 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 beautiful Treml always ran so envy had certainly seen 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.830
 so now I have one on separate the concerns of the keys 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.900
 Next, we need 400 grams per each of them, neutral proteins 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.220
 because with sweet it would not be paid more vegetables and rise is like that 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.890
 for every time to the 85 of 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.550
 This is a high quality protein is tasteless and works well 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.040
 to process for such things 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.430
 These 400 grams we throw in with the shots 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.420
 next we need Seitz and herbs Spices Nachgeschmack Seitz 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 coated teaspoons 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 and track 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 we need 700 milliliters of water 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
 I've already prepared here 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.190
 he sleeps really happy 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.600
 two already in the case is clear i would on 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 Now we put our part 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.579
 distribute nicely 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.679
 so that the tomato sauce can spread her better I do the following me 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.229
 Just turn all the fun around 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.829
 Jane Fonda's government 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.339
 the tomato sauce 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.339
 they just open up 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.299
 it is important that this is distributed nicely 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.299
 The farm today decided we start its work with onions and 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.299
 Pepperoni time 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:54.319
 these places are now specifically for the microwave Weidlich the ground already 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.389
 made before and then made the surface on it if we have the PID directly 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.399
 Take out of the oven which need to cut between 20 and 25 minutes ten minutes 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:08.979
 let go prepare the floor, take it out for 10 and then take it out 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.529
 15 minutes, depending on how Kossmann would like to have the pizza 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.509
 Of course you can pack everything you want 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:19.219
 However, you should make sure that the products take part where the x 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.119
 Factor heath relatively low is probably the reason with bike content relatively 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.530
 is low and this team is wonderful now 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.480
 for the microwave three made two to three minutes and that only has 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.819
 fresh pizza 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.129

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.480
 which has been guaranteed 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.689
 Microwave and push Asma by the Rhine 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.729
