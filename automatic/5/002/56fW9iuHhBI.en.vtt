speeding<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.730> gameplay<00:00:11.940> was<00:00:12.389> it's

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
speeding this up this gameplay was it's

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.289 
speeding this up this gameplay was it's
pretty<00:00:13.049> lengthy<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.490> didn't<00:00:14.969> want<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.210> to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
pretty lengthy and I didn't want it to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.910 
pretty lengthy and I didn't want it to
be<00:00:15.450> too<00:00:15.480> long<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:15.990> sped<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.560> beginning<00:00:16.830> part

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
be too long so I sped the beginning part

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560 
be too long so I sped the beginning part
up<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.400> once<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.670> realized<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.240> was

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
up but once I realized that I really was

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.760 
up but once I realized that I really was
gonna<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> control<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> wanted<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
gonna have the control I wanted in

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.080 
gonna have the control I wanted in
theater<00:00:20.039> mode<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.400> speed<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.789> pots

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
theater mode to speed up the pots

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
theater mode to speed up the pots
there's<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.170> sloppy<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
there's going to be a little sloppy I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
there's going to be a little sloppy I
decided<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.189> stop<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.000> let<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> middle

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
decided to stop and just let the middle

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.490 
decided to stop and just let the middle
run<00:00:26.240> anyways<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:28.019> wanted<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> talk

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
run anyways what I really wanted to talk

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.160 
run anyways what I really wanted to talk
about<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.800> I've<00:00:29.699> been<00:00:29.939> struggling<00:00:30.269> lately<00:00:30.480> in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
about was I've been struggling lately in

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
about was I've been struggling lately in
this<00:00:31.320> game<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.920> kind<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> lot<00:00:32.820> over

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
this game actually kind of a lot over

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.060 
this game actually kind of a lot over
the<00:00:33.329> last<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.600> week<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.680> couldn't<00:00:34.860> really

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the last like week and I couldn't really

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
the last like week and I couldn't really
figure<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.370> why<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:36.030> until<00:00:37.020> recently

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
figure out why that was until recently

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.889 
figure out why that was until recently
um<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.460> today<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> figured<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> when

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
um just today I figured out that it when

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.510 
um just today I figured out that it when
I<00:00:39.930> switched<00:00:40.440> my<00:00:40.500> sensitivity<00:00:40.980> i<00:00:41.190> turned<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I switched my sensitivity i turned the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.569 
I switched my sensitivity i turned the
aim<00:00:41.670> assist<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.890> has<00:00:44.070> been<00:00:44.100> killing

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
aim assist off and that has been killing

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.709 
aim assist off and that has been killing
me<00:00:44.670> i<00:00:44.700> don't<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> guys<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.480> tried

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
me i don't know if you guys have tried

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.529 
me i don't know if you guys have tried
to<00:00:45.840> play<00:00:46.020> without<00:00:46.200> aim<00:00:46.500> assist<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.789> far

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
to play without aim assist but it is far

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.709 
to play without aim assist but it is far
more<00:00:48.780> difficult<00:00:48.960> than<00:00:49.320> playing<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.719> yeah

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
more difficult than playing with it yeah

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.990 
more difficult than playing with it yeah
what<00:00:51.899> happened<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.410> i<00:00:52.770> used<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> play<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.699> nine

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
what happened was i used to play on nine

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.310 
what happened was i used to play on nine
sensitivity<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> guys<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> probably

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
sensitivity which you guys can probably

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.720 
sensitivity which you guys can probably
tell<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> watched<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.010> earlier<00:00:56.340> videos

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
tell if you watched on my earlier videos

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
tell if you watched on my earlier videos
but<00:00:57.480> after<00:00:57.930> playing<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.350> game<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.739> little

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
but after playing this game for a little

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
but after playing this game for a little
while<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.100> decided<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.180> probably<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
while I decided you know it probably a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
while I decided you know it probably a
lot<00:01:00.750> more<00:01:00.780> beneficial<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.920> me<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.100> turn<00:01:02.219> my

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
lot more beneficial for me to turn my

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.490 
lot more beneficial for me to turn my
sensitivity<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.390> bit<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> focus

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
sensitivity down a little bit and focus

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.330 
sensitivity down a little bit and focus
more<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:04.890> accuracy<00:01:05.220> than<00:01:05.400> speed<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:08.159> guess

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
more on accuracy than speed and I guess

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.100 
more on accuracy than speed and I guess
while<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.939> doing<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.450> managed<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> turn

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
while I was doing that I managed to turn

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
while I was doing that I managed to turn
the<00:01:10.229> aim<00:01:10.380> assist<00:01:10.680> off<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.310> pretty<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.090> for

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the aim assist off so pretty much for

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.060 
the aim assist off so pretty much for
the<00:01:12.330> last<00:01:12.479> week<00:01:12.600> I've<00:01:12.780> been<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.380> thinking

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the last week I've been just thinking

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
the last week I've been just thinking
that<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.430> lost<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:15.060> ability<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.479> aim<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that I lost my ability to aim and that I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
that I lost my ability to aim and that I
just<00:01:16.560> couldn't<00:01:16.740> shoot<00:01:16.979> anymore<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.670> what

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
just couldn't shoot anymore but what

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.550 
just couldn't shoot anymore but what
turned<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> truth<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
turned out to be the truth was just the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
turned out to be the truth was just the
aim<00:01:19.680> assist<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.070> off<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.060> would

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
aim assist was off and I would

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
aim assist was off and I would
definitely<00:01:21.689> suggest<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> guys<00:01:23.220> like

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
definitely suggest that if you guys like

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
definitely suggest that if you guys like
you're<00:01:23.700> having<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> same<00:01:24.150> trouble<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you're having the same trouble that you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.469 
you're having the same trouble that you
check<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:25.920> i<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.450> i

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
check that out because i think when i

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.929 
check that out because i think when i
was<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.780> scrolling<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.619> uh<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
was just scrolling down to uh to get to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.920 
was just scrolling down to uh to get to
the<00:01:30.030> sensitivity<00:01:30.329> i<00:01:30.509> must<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.750> just

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the sensitivity i must have just

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210 
the sensitivity i must have just
accidentally<00:01:31.500> turned<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> off<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.189> even

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
bit more aggressive than this I still

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.910 
bit more aggressive than this I still
want<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> try<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.750> play<00:02:00.960> smart<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.740> when

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
want to try to play smart you know when

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.190 
want to try to play smart you know when
I<00:02:01.979> play<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> game<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.030> definitely<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I play the game but I definitely like to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.690 
I play the game but I definitely like to
be<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> little<00:02:04.590> bit<00:02:04.799> more<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.159> offensive

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
be a little bit more on the offensive

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
be a little bit more on the offensive
than<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.880> am<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.930> now<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> reason<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.860> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
than I am here and now the reason that I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.619 
than I am here and now the reason that I
was<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.610> defensive<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.479> I

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
was just so defensive here is because I

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.260 
was just so defensive here is because I
had<00:02:09.959> been<00:02:10.110> struggling

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
had been struggling

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.030 
had been struggling
you<00:02:11.960> know<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.080> really<00:02:12.350> had<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.560> make<00:02:12.770> sure<00:02:12.890> that

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
you know I really had to make sure that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.620 
you know I really had to make sure that
I<00:02:13.070> wasn't<00:02:13.460> getting<00:02:13.520> surprised<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.300> gunfights

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
I wasn't getting surprised in gunfights

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.060 
I wasn't getting surprised in gunfights
then<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.930> was<00:02:15.050> kind<00:02:15.320> of<00:02:15.350> choosing<00:02:15.770> my<00:02:15.860> gun

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
then I was kind of choosing my gun

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.700 
then I was kind of choosing my gun
fights<00:02:16.280> when<00:02:16.490> playing<00:02:16.640> with<00:02:16.820> this<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.710> it's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
fights when playing with this and it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.530 
fights when playing with this and it's
just<00:02:18.890> because<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> aim<00:02:19.250> assist<00:02:19.490> wasn't<00:02:19.880> on<00:02:20.000> I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
just because the aim assist wasn't on I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.660 
just because the aim assist wasn't on I
feel<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:22.130> I'm<00:02:22.250> sure<00:02:22.400> there<00:02:22.550> are<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
feel like and I'm sure there are a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.070 
feel like and I'm sure there are a
couple<00:02:22.880> players<00:02:23.150> out<00:02:23.390> there<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.600> don't<00:02:23.720> want<00:02:23.990> to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
couple players out there I don't want to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.320 
couple players out there I don't want to
say<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.620> know<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.700> always<00:02:25.880> have<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.300> use

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
say that you know you always have to use

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
say that you know you always have to use
the<00:02:26.480> aim<00:02:26.570> assist<00:02:26.780> because<00:02:26.900> that's<00:02:27.140> probably

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
the aim assist because that's probably

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.450 
the aim assist because that's probably
not<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.560> truth<00:02:27.860> I'm<00:02:28.010> sure<00:02:28.160> there's<00:02:28.340> some

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
not the truth I'm sure there's some

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.650 
not the truth I'm sure there's some
people<00:02:28.730> out<00:02:28.880> there<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.120> are<00:02:29.180> really<00:02:29.450> good

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
people out there that are really good

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.780 
people out there that are really good
and<00:02:29.870> they're<00:02:30.560> able<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.860> make<00:02:31.460> up<00:02:31.610> for<00:02:31.640> not

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
and they're able to make up for not

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.580 
and they're able to make up for not
having<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.150> aim<00:02:32.270> assist<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.960> if<00:02:33.230> that's

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
having the aim assist on and if that's

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.550 
having the aim assist on and if that's
you<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:35.090> know<00:02:35.180> kudos<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.810> because<00:02:35.840> I've

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
you you know kudos to you because I've

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.260 
you you know kudos to you because I've
been<00:02:36.920> struggling<00:02:37.460> with<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.000> thought<00:02:38.150> was

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
been struggling with it I thought was

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.590 
been struggling with it I thought was
real<00:02:38.420> tough<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:39.290> there<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.740> one<00:02:40.100> benefit<00:02:40.730> to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
real tough but there is one benefit to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.510 
real tough but there is one benefit to
having<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.020> aim<00:02:42.140> assist<00:02:42.410> off<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.950> you'll<00:02:43.370> see

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
having the aim assist off and you'll see

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.770 
having the aim assist off and you'll see
in<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.700> game<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.910> managed<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.510> get<00:02:44.600> like<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
in this game I managed to get like a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.590 
in this game I managed to get like a
little<00:02:44.990> bit<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.230> triple<00:02:45.530> spray<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.240> I<00:02:47.240> think

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
little bit of a triple spray and I think

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.700 
little bit of a triple spray and I think
the<00:02:47.690> reason<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.960> it's<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.260> much<00:02:48.380> easier<00:02:48.410> to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
the reason that it's so much easier to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.070 
the reason that it's so much easier to
take<00:02:48.860> out<00:02:49.010> multiple<00:02:49.310> enemies<00:02:49.820> without<00:02:50.080> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
take out multiple enemies without the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.530 
take out multiple enemies without the
aim<00:02:51.200> assist<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.100> because<00:02:52.540> sometimes

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
aim assist on is just because sometimes

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.090 
aim assist on is just because sometimes
when<00:02:53.870> you're<00:02:54.020> aiming<00:02:54.290> at<00:02:54.410> someone<00:02:54.800> your

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100

crosshairs will pull to another guy and
it<00:02:57.110> just<00:02:57.260> makes<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.500> really<00:02:57.620> tough<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.010> take

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
modern warfare 2 even caught for I

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.150 
modern warfare 2 even caught for I
wasn't<00:03:08.690> like<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.020> know<00:03:09.050> double<00:03:09.560> whatever<00:03:09.770> but

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
wasn't like you know double whatever but

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.980 
wasn't like you know double whatever but
I'm<00:03:10.400> pretty<00:03:10.760> happy<00:03:11.060> when<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.360> get<00:03:11.510> doubles<00:03:11.840> and

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
I'm pretty happy when I get doubles and

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.360 
I'm pretty happy when I get doubles and
I'm<00:03:12.050> extremely<00:03:12.380> happy<00:03:12.740> if<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.070> get<00:03:13.190> anything

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
I'm extremely happy if I get anything

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.160 
I'm extremely happy if I get anything
more<00:03:13.490> than<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.820> double<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.660> managed<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.080> get

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
more than a double and I managed to get

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.449 
more than a double and I managed to get
like<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> triple<00:03:15.680> spray<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.130> game<00:03:16.280> it's

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
like a triple spray in this game it's

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.040 
like a triple spray in this game it's
probably<00:03:16.730> not<00:03:16.880> technically<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.450> real<00:03:17.750> triple

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
probably not technically a real triple

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.080 
probably not technically a real triple
doesn't<00:03:18.440> say<00:03:18.530> triple<00:03:18.740> but<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.310> still<00:03:19.850> get<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
doesn't say triple but I still get the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.850 
doesn't say triple but I still get the
kill<00:03:20.300> feed<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.020> makes<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.260> puts<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.650> smile

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
kill feed and it makes it puts a smile

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.430 
kill feed and it makes it puts a smile
on<00:03:21.890> my<00:03:22.100> face<00:03:22.130> at<00:03:22.520> least<00:03:22.550> makes<00:03:22.940> me<00:03:23.090> happy<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.600> I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
on my face at least makes me happy and I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.300 
on my face at least makes me happy and I
like<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.740> it's<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.950> little<00:03:24.980> bit<00:03:25.130> more

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
like that it's a little bit more

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
like that it's a little bit more
challenging<00:03:25.520> like<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.000> because<00:03:26.090> little

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
challenging like that because little

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.270 
challenging like that because little
things<00:03:26.570> like<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.750> definitely<00:03:27.380> they<00:03:28.010> stand

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
things like that definitely they stand

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.190 
things like that definitely they stand
out<00:03:28.400> more<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.790> me<00:03:28.880> now<00:03:28.910> when<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.180> play<00:03:29.450> where<00:03:30.080> as

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
out more to me now when I play where as

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.720 
out more to me now when I play where as
before<00:03:30.320> when<00:03:30.560> i<00:03:30.709> get<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.920> triple<00:03:31.220> i<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.459> beg<00:03:31.580> or

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
before when i get a triple i just beg or

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.850 
before when i get a triple i just beg or
whatever<00:03:32.030> if<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.270> wasn't<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.600> quad<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.590> didn't

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
whatever if it wasn't a quad it didn't

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.420 
whatever if it wasn't a quad it didn't
even<00:03:33.920> really<00:03:34.070> register<00:03:34.580> in<00:03:34.670> my<00:03:34.760> head<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:37.190> yeah

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
even really register in my head but yeah

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.850 
even really register in my head but yeah
so<00:03:38.209> i<00:03:38.570> think<00:03:38.930> i'm<00:03:39.200> definitely<00:03:39.530> gonna<00:03:39.590> try<00:03:39.800> to

to be intelligent player on that count

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.860
