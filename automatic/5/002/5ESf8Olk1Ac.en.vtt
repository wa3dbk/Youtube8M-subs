00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
builds roads in sub PvP there's a

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.780 
builds roads in sub PvP there's a
hemorrhage<00:00:29.309> of<00:00:29.430> spec<00:00:29.700> as<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> backstab<00:00:30.930> spec

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
hemorrhage of spec as a backstab spec

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.250 
hemorrhage of spec as a backstab spec
this<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> hemorrhage<00:00:34.050> back

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
this as you can see is a hemorrhage back

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.500 
this as you can see is a hemorrhage back
the<00:00:37.260> hemorrhage<00:00:37.649> spec<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.430> designed<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.360> be

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the hemorrhage spec is designed to be

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.990 
the hemorrhage spec is designed to be
fast<00:00:39.960> paced<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.620> terms<00:00:40.859> of<00:00:40.949> combo<00:00:41.339> building<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
fast paced in terms of combo building a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.529 
fast paced in terms of combo building a
more<00:00:42.750> survivability<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.679> say<00:00:44.609> faster<00:00:45.120> pace<00:00:45.329> in

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
more survivability I say faster pace in

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.270 
more survivability I say faster pace in
terms<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> combat<00:00:46.019> air<00:00:46.530> combo<00:00:46.890> building

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
terms of combat air combo building

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
terms of combat air combo building
because<00:00:47.629> hemorrhage<00:00:48.629> costs<00:00:49.579> less<00:00:50.899> energy<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
because hemorrhage costs less energy and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
because hemorrhage costs less energy and
therefore<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:53.010> spam<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:53.909> really

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
therefore you can spam it more really

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
therefore you can spam it more really
and<00:00:54.510> every<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.409> say<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.589> get<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> combo

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and every time you say it get a combo

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.689 
and every time you say it get a combo
for<00:00:56.339> him<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> faster<00:00:58.859> builds<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.370> combo

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
for him the faster builds of combo

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.399 
for him the faster builds of combo
points<00:00:59.969> means<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> apply

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
points means that you can apply

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.529 
points means that you can apply
recuperate<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.460> slice<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.909> dice<00:01:03.030> quicker

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
recuperate and slice and dice quicker

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.490 
recuperate and slice and dice quicker
also<00:01:04.170> use<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> whispering<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:07.140> step

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
also use the whispering or the back step

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.190 
also use the whispering or the back step
spec<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.940> basically<00:01:09.300> this<00:01:09.570> back<00:01:09.870> cover

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
spec which is basically this back cover

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
spec which is basically this back cover
you<00:01:10.440> take<00:01:10.680> two<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.190> of<00:01:11.220> improved<00:01:11.610> cooperate

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you take two out of improved cooperate

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.640 
you take two out of improved cooperate
and<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.540> coupe<00:01:12.720> de<00:01:12.840> Graaff<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> put<00:01:13.350> three

in punk three moons let me put it in
pantry<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> moons<00:01:16.320> also<00:01:16.710> increased<00:01:17.010> critical

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
pantry and moons also increased critical

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.260 
pantry and moons also increased critical

strike chance back to step I personally
don't<00:01:21.690> like<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.050> backstop<00:01:22.500> spec<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
don't like the backstop spec because I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.910 
don't like the backstop spec because I
find<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.850> too<00:01:24.300> slow<00:01:24.600> paced<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.410> got<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
find it too slow paced it's got a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.680 
find it too slow paced it's got a
reposition<00:01:26.460> yourself<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.300> lot<00:01:27.450> extra

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
reposition yourself it's a lot extra

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.640 
reposition yourself it's a lot extra
effort<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.720> some<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.140> nice<00:01:31.260> crits

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
effort you get some really nice crits

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.890 
effort you get some really nice crits
and<00:01:31.950> there's<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.180> much<00:01:33.450> difference

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and there's not really much difference

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.340 
and there's not really much difference
at<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.170> between<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.740> damage<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.250> tooth

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
at all between the damage of the tooth

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.860 
at all between the damage of the tooth
ok<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.410> with<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> hem<00:01:38.250> o<00:01:38.370> spec<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.630> wouldn't

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
ok so with the hem o spec you wouldn't

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.630 
ok so with the hem o spec you wouldn't
have<00:01:39.990> any<00:01:40.170> impugn<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> mamouns<00:01:41.040> sue<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.580> be

have any impugn to mamouns sue and be

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.960 
have any impugn to mamouns sue and be
using<00:01:41.940> backstab<00:01:42.390> really<00:01:42.900> at<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.640> you'd<00:01:44.640> put

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
using backstab really at all you'd put

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 
using backstab really at all you'd put
wilder<00:01:45.510> points<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.110> coop<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> grass<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.460> fill

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
wilder points in coop the grass to fill

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
wilder points in coop the grass to fill
that<00:01:47.790> talent<00:01:48.150> up<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.620> spam

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that talent up so because you can spam

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.650 
that talent up so because you can spam
it<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:50.820> great<00:01:50.940> more<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.510> you'll<00:01:51.630> have

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
it was great more because you'll have

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.810 
it was great more because you'll have
your<00:01:51.840> bus<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.320> quicker<00:01:52.560> you'd<00:01:53.430> want<00:01:53.610> next

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
your bus up quicker you'd want next

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.890 
your bus up quicker you'd want next
damage<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:55.460> two<00:01:56.460> points<00:01:56.790> improved<00:01:57.210> cooperate

damage and two points improved cooperate

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.560 
damage and two points improved cooperate
because<00:01:58.190> dash<00:01:59.190> survivability<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.090> always

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
because dash survivability is always
