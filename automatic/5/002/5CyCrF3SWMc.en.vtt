this<00:02:12.840> episode<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.350> my<00:02:13.500> first<00:02:13.710> time<00:02:13.950> I've

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
heard about this ship I thought

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.270 
heard about this ship I thought
the<00:02:16.080> blue<00:02:16.230> may<00:02:16.380> was<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> giant<00:02:16.920> ass<00:02:17.010> laser

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the blue may was a giant ass laser

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370 
the blue may was a giant ass laser
that's<00:02:17.520> exactly<00:02:18.030> what<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.210> thought<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.510> was<00:02:18.690> but

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's exactly what I thought it was but

priorities straight and actually look at

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.080 
priorities straight and actually look at
the<00:02:55.740> real<00:02:55.950> problem<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.610> currently<00:02:56.910> going

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the real problem that is currently going

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.960 
the real problem that is currently going
on<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.680> episode<00:02:58.830> for<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> most<00:02:59.550> part<00:02:59.790> I

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
on so the episode for the most part I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.790 
on so the episode for the most part I
enjoyed<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.690> episode<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:01.140> watch<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.500> lot<00:03:01.740> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
enjoyed the episode of watch a lot of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.010 
enjoyed the episode of watch a lot of
things<00:03:02.160> threw<00:03:02.760> me<00:03:02.940> off<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.510> said<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.810> ship

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
things threw me off like I said the ship

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.590 
things threw me off like I said the ship
just<00:03:04.260> came<00:03:04.410> out<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> nowhere<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:06.090> liked<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
just came out of nowhere and I liked the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.150 
just came out of nowhere and I liked the
entire<00:03:06.840> theory<00:03:07.080> about<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.380> live<00:03:07.590> blasters

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
entire theory about the live blasters

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.490 
entire theory about the live blasters
now<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.670> guess<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> lot<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.900> people<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.170> could<00:03:10.230> see

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
now I guess a lot of people I could see

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.710 
now I guess a lot of people I could see
would<00:03:10.830> call<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:11.540> anticlimactic<00:03:12.540> for

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
would call this anticlimactic for

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.970 
would call this anticlimactic for
instance<00:03:12.990> how<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.260> ended<00:03:13.530> how<00:03:13.710> you<00:03:13.860> know

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
instance how it ended how you know

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.320 
instance how it ended how you know
everything<00:03:14.280> ended<00:03:14.550> fine<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.240> know

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
everything ended fine and you know

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.180 
everything ended fine and you know
Hannes<00:03:15.840> saves<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.230> day<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.560> stuff<00:03:16.770> like<00:03:16.950> that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
Hannes saves the day and stuff like that

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.190 
Hannes saves the day and stuff like that
but<00:03:17.760> for<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.030> most<00:03:18.180> part<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.630> enjoyed<00:03:19.050> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
but for the most part I enjoyed it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170 
but for the most part I enjoyed it
because<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.770> we<00:03:19.890> travelled<00:03:20.370> back<00:03:20.550> about<00:03:20.910> six

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
because if we travelled back about six

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.940 
because if we travelled back about six
to<00:03:21.300> eight<00:03:21.330> episodes<00:03:21.840> ago<00:03:22.110> hona

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
to eight episodes ago hona

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.710 
to eight episodes ago hona

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
she was a cardboard character about six

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.610

character development
my<00:03:43.530> biggest<00:03:43.890> fear<00:03:44.459> though<00:03:44.790> my<00:03:45.390> biggest<00:03:45.720> fear

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
my biggest fear though my biggest fear

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.840 
my biggest fear though my biggest fear
is<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.970> cliche<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.000> how<00:03:48.510> Hana<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:50.100> princess

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
is the cliche of how Hana is a princess

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.699 
is the cliche of how Hana is a princess
that<00:03:51.120> needs<00:03:51.330> saving<00:03:51.540> because<00:03:52.410> that's<00:03:52.590> clearly

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
that needs saving because that's clearly

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.890 
that needs saving because that's clearly
the<00:03:52.980> position<00:03:53.580> she<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.330> at<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> end<00:03:54.780> of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
the position she is in at the end of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.660 
the position she is in at the end of
this<00:03:54.989> episode<00:03:55.290> because<00:03:55.620> die<00:03:55.830> she<00:03:56.070> has<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.400> save

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
this episode because die she has to save

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.040 
this episode because die she has to save
her<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.030> hopefully<00:03:57.330> this<00:03:57.510> doesn't<00:03:57.720> turn<00:03:58.020> into

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
her so hopefully this doesn't turn into

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.290 
her so hopefully this doesn't turn into
the<00:03:58.709> prince<00:03:58.980> has<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.340> save<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.730> princess<00:04:00.150> I
