if you do not have a wireless router you
won't<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.670> connected<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.450> totally

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
won't be connected and that's totally

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
like this basically means what what's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
like this basically means what what's
the<00:01:09.750> past<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> show<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the past we're going to show up when you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.660 
the past we're going to show up when you
try<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> log<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> web<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:13.500> basically<00:01:14.220> normal

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
try to log in web is basically normal

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
try to log in web is basically normal
but<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.509> need<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.350> things

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
but you need to have a lot of things

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.910 
but you need to have a lot of things
memorized<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.310> we're<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.490> gonna<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.909> nothing

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
memorized so we're just gonna do nothing

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.039 
memorized so we're just gonna do nothing
now<00:01:19.920> we're<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.130> gonna<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.400> save<00:01:21.360> Network<00:01:21.869> on

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
now we're just gonna go save Network on

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.649 
now we're just gonna go save Network on
this<00:01:22.200> computer<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.210> next<00:01:25.880> continue<00:01:28.159> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
this computer and next continue and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.219 
this computer and next continue and
there<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.720> connected<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
there it is so now it's not connected to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.920 
there it is so now it's not connected to
internet<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
internet so what you want to do is go to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.219 
internet so what you want to do is go to
manage<00:01:37.590> connections<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.880> you'll<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
manage connections and you'll see that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.620 
manage connections and you'll see that
there's<00:01:40.650> no<00:01:40.890> wireless<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:42.119> probably<00:01:42.509> not

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
there's no wireless you probably not

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.380 
there's no wireless you probably not
have<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.990> bridge<00:01:43.290> I'll<00:01:44.100> try<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> no<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.180> won't

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
have this bridge I'll try to no I won't

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.270 
have this bridge I'll try to no I won't
do<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.409> won't<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> bridge<00:01:47.040> but

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
do it you won't have the bridge but

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.550 
do it you won't have the bridge but
you'll<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.700> wireless<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.299> local<00:01:49.049> area

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you'll have the wireless and local area

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.639 
you'll have the wireless and local area
connection<00:01:49.820> there<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.720> has<00:01:52.110> an<00:01:52.259> X<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.590> both

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
connection there are it has an X on both

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.319 
connection there are it has an X on both
of<00:01:52.920> them<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.280> means<00:01:53.460> they're<00:01:53.700> both<00:01:54.000> not

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
of them so that means they're both not

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.530 
of them so that means they're both not
on<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.710> need<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> router<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.299> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
on what you need to make a router is you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.090 
on what you need to make a router is you
need<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> ethernet<00:01:58.590> cable<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:59.040> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
need to have the ethernet cable if you
