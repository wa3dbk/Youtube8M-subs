00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.709
 video 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.210
 in today's video I want to make you two 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.920
 super fast hairstyles that look super 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.200
 difficult but in real life they are super 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.520
 easy I put them in my instagram and all 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.020
 the lines their weight asked me 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.610
 then I hope you like the video 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.410
 it's super fast so do not get bored 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.320
 both the braids and starting the video 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.239
 the first hairstyle is a ponytail 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.400
 and has a braid that looks back and looks 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.739
 super complicated and the ministry I 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.690
 they have asked so much then what they should 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.580
 do first is to let their hair 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.120
 mind and what I'm going to do is apply the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.920
 organics treatment if any manager 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.170
 I'm organizing is watching this please 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.450
 contrast nothing but I use it just so that 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.039
 hair smooth and no tangling me 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.230
 then what are you going to disheveled 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.370
 First you will take three parts of the hair 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.800
 so what I'm going to do is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.330
 braid of three when they already have one what 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.280
 what we are going to do is pass but of each 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.880
 side incorporating it with the other then 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880
 but from here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.300
 and I do not pass by 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 straight 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.620
 and we meet with the other 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.640
 and so they do it as far as it starts 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.640
 the ear more or less 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.960
 and also so that when they reach the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.960
 start 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.120
 and now I mention it and what I do now 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.540
 is to open it a little bit because you want more 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.540
 gross 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.530
 when they finish hooking the braid 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.180
 what they want most can even 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.580
 integrate the normal let's do more 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.800
 horse tail 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.430
 and here a tail on horseback putting the 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.229
 river press and pull out a lock quoted the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.420
 horse and they turn him around so he does not 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.100
 see 8 and something like that would be 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.100
 first dam the first hairstyle 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.670
 and this hairstyle is from this photo that I 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.300
 they asked him a lot of I put his 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.300
 seven weeks 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.540
 and ready for the first hairstyle in the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.920
 second hairstyle was that of the last photo 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.450
 that I uploaded to instagram that is something like 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.400
 back that is also with a braid 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.840
 all with braids here I will tell you 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.700
 how they are done and what I'm going to do 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.790
 is to let go of my hair I'm going to leave 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.730
 half as well as here 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.980
 to be the second braid that 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.319
 consists of making a braid cap another 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.239
 braid here and then do as a 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.709
 scrambled to other basic subsidiaries I'm going to 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.510
 divide the hair here I will put a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.069
 top part and I'm going to divide it into 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.170
 three what I'm going to start doing is a 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.810
 braid equal to that of the previous hairstyle and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.939
 what I'm going to do is with the hair only 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.519
 on one side that is from the back side to 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.959
 that ahead we have his the tico but 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.670
 if you want to be seen 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.319
 ears as they catch up front too 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.840
 only that I hate that the edges are visible 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.989
 of the pine only behind only from here back 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.420
 we incorporate and incorporate 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.489
 but then we do it over there 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.360
 where the ears end today everything is 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:22.400
 to where he ends lives 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.580
 and when they stop introducing the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.470
 outside and normal well 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.790
 they see that I finish of hair because it does not take of 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.770
 this side or if they want to do it 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.660
 they can do it differently than me 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.210
 I like it and we're going to do the same 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.770
 tradition is the same here is the atom 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.370
 a part of the face above is 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.370
 divide into 3 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.430
 and I do the normal braid back 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.170
 incorporating hair from back to several and 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.239
 looking the other way because from a 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.720
 mirror in front to see you if not 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.870
 I'm superior to each stretch 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.690
 when they reach the ear 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.770
 these two braids are left like this 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.770
 as a first game 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.700
 ah 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.700
 ready then the next step to the east 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.650
 I have some stories 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.960
 do not have the two French and what 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.290
 they do is pass them back as a 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.389
 crown remove the rubbers and only leave 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.840
 Un Cachito to catch everything 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.780
 we just did and what I do now is 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.750
 straight between all the hair then one 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.210
 like this one also two and three and I make one 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.750
 normal plump braid of which all 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.750
 we do know 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.569
 when it reaches the end , the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.939
 little cochito and opened it a little 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.249
 and something like that would be the braid that 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:02.960
 I started yesterday that is in those boots something 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.960
 this is the other way around 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.300
 the slats from the hairstyle the second 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.370
