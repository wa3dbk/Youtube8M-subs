00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.530
 on the price pressure it depends and optimal Bratislava distinguishes us from 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.500
 from the beginning 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 have done good even better and both throughput and compresses 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 further optimized for our square bale Preston 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.090
 Almost 30 years ago, the first square bale press left the factory in Hesse 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.120
 and Nassau 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.850
 This became the foundation for one of the most successful stories in the world 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.060
 harvesting 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060
 and Steve create mother of all presses 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.340
 due to decades of development and production experience 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.940
 These are characterized by stability longevity and perfect technique 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.340
 but that was the point where we say and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.940
 Although it was attacked then you drove on the iPhone 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.610
 Euro happily raised the arm surprised what more power 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.850
 food processor 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.900
 that's how it goes 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140
 before fascinating 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.620
 but since then I have to say 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.620
 but really excited and have to this day 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.929
 the truck driver was 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.870
 Addresses stand for hard-pressed bales 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.720
 one like the other perfectly shaped and evenly distributed 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.000
 with about 20 percent more prestige per train 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.720
 are pressed to about 20 percent less wine per hectare that is Jena 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.470
 ErndtebrÃ¼ck defects between four and five lanes per hectare 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.090
 the few approached collected transported and started 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.380
 have to 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.540
 So let's talk, we talk through doctors with candidates 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.509
 even more 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.929
 Ultimately, then I need fewer farmers to buy acres 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.749
 Striking were suddenly no more performance what we really decide 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.169
 By which way he is continuing the journey is very short 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.009
 at times only a few hours and days 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.849
 and what came from the factory 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.769
 no matter how the use 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.429
 the field is unique 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:30.239
 whether in small areas and long distances or in large areas and 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.229
 short distances Vario tugs and the five square bale press 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.479
 not to beat 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.939
 Robustness and high performance but above all the capacity and longevity 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.839
 make sure that this press release can be on 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.839
 but inherited 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.129
 With the innovative lighting concept you can also use it at dusk or 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.609
 Carry out the maintenance of the machine at night at any time 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.019
 by the no alibi she is for her system inserting the 30th 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.169
 Spools of thread are a breeze 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.399
 Even after long days of use, the maintenance of the Fendt square bale press 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.419
 no problem 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.639
 The sealed bearings have kept the maintenance to a minimum 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.549
 reduced at 250 working hours 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.489
 at Fendt they have 44 Schmiedel 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.999
 For comparison with the main competitor, they are 460 dwindling that's it 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.999
 Ten times the time and snow instead 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.049
 Fendt square balers compress high performance with absolute reliability 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:54.269
