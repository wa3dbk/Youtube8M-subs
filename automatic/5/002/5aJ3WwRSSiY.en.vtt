00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.429 
they've just automated so the bar at the
top<00:00:16.440> left<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.830> my<00:00:16.949> energy<00:00:18.230> everything<00:00:19.230> cost

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439

following the instructions and let's see
how<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> red<00:00:39.300> lines<00:00:39.510> will<00:00:39.719> change<00:00:40.309> now<00:00:41.309> move

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:58.410 

okay<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.460> cool

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.250 

and<00:00:59.420> now<00:00:59.630> we<00:00:59.690> start<00:01:01.660> so<00:01:02.660> you're<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:02.930> kind<00:01:03.110> of

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
and now we start so you're just kind of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.540 
and now we start so you're just kind of
positioning<00:01:03.770> your<00:01:03.830> troops<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.400> right

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
positioning your troops in the right

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.850 
positioning your troops in the right
spot<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.239> then<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.690> battle<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.650> fights

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
spot and then do battle and the fights

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.690 
spot and then do battle and the fights
are<00:01:06.979> automated<00:01:08.590> no<00:01:09.590> pinch-to-zoom<00:01:10.040> I<00:01:10.550> don't

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
are automated no pinch-to-zoom I don't

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.770 
are automated no pinch-to-zoom I don't
see<00:01:10.880> any<00:01:11.030> panning<00:01:11.540> either<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:13.540> camera<00:01:14.540> button

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
see any panning either and camera button

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.510 
see any panning either and camera button
just<00:01:14.900> moves<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.260> camera<00:01:15.590> around

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.460 

so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> believe<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> gameplay<00:01:25.049> maybe

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so I believe that's the gameplay maybe

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.810 
so I believe that's the gameplay maybe
it<00:01:25.680> might<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.190> those<00:01:26.280> games<00:01:26.549> where

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
it might be one of those games where

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450 
it might be one of those games where
most<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> strategy<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.100> troop

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
most of the strategy is in like troop

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.399 
most of the strategy is in like troop
placements<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.240> upgrades<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> stuff<00:01:31.200> like

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
placements and upgrades and stuff like

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.160 
placements and upgrades and stuff like
that<00:01:31.909> but<00:01:32.909> people<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> chat<00:01:33.750> we're<00:01:33.990> saying

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that but people in chat we're saying

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.330 
that but people in chat we're saying
that<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.440> got<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> looks<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that it's got it looks like it's a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.460 
that it's got it looks like it's a
league<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.700> Legends<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.450> game<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
league of Legends kind of game and so

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.719 
league of Legends kind of game and so
far<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.830> not<00:01:38.509> or<00:01:39.509> World<00:01:40.080> of<00:01:40.229> Warcraft<00:01:40.729> it's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
far it's not or World of Warcraft it's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
far it's not or World of Warcraft it's
just<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.149> automated<00:01:45.799> same<00:01:46.799> routine<00:01:48.920> might

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:09.219 

and<00:01:56.500> there's<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.770> fast-forward<00:02:03.899> coin<00:02:04.899> coin

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229
