00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.679 
out and let it develop for two minutes I
can<00:01:34.920> scan<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.090> whatever<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.570> with

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
can scan it or do whatever I want with

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.410 
can scan it or do whatever I want with
it<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> first<00:01:38.909> thing<00:01:39.060> we're<00:01:39.180> gonna<00:01:39.270> work

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it so the first thing we're gonna work

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
it so the first thing we're gonna work
with<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.900> an<00:01:39.960> image<00:01:40.200> transfer<00:01:40.680> pretty

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
with here is an image transfer pretty

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.450 
with here is an image transfer pretty
easy<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> now<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.530> catch<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:43.950> is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
easy to do now the one catch here is

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.760 
easy to do now the one catch here is
that<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.939> light<00:01:45.689> hits<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> negative<00:01:46.560> before

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that if light hits the negative before

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350 
that if light hits the negative before
it<00:01:47.070> transfers<00:01:47.549> onto<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> paper<00:01:48.000> you'll

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it transfers onto the paper you'll

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
it transfers onto the paper you'll
either<00:01:48.509> overexposure<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.320> get<00:01:49.409> no<00:01:49.590> photo<00:01:49.829> or

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
either overexposure and get no photo or

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.660 
either overexposure and get no photo or
get<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> solarized<00:01:51.540> image<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> steps<00:01:53.490> here

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
get a solarized image so the steps here

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 
get a solarized image so the steps here
are<00:01:53.759> we're<00:01:54.060> gonna<00:01:54.149> make<00:01:54.360> our<00:01:54.479> photo<00:01:54.740> we're

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
are we're gonna make our photo we're

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.170 
are we're gonna make our photo we're
gonna<00:01:55.829> pull<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> from<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> camera<00:01:56.700> we'll<00:01:57.060> wait

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
gonna pull it from the camera we'll wait

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.330 
gonna pull it from the camera we'll wait
about<00:01:57.299> 20<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:57.899> seconds<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.250> we're

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
about 20 or so seconds and then we're

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.560 
about 20 or so seconds and then we're
gonna<00:01:59.430> peel<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.759> apart<00:01:59.909> we're<00:02:00.270> gonna<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
gonna peel it apart we're gonna put the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.780 
gonna peel it apart we're gonna put the
negative<00:02:00.750> onto<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.159> piece<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.430> watercolor

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
negative onto the piece of watercolor

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.740 
negative onto the piece of watercolor
paper<00:02:02.850> we're<00:02:03.119> trying<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.600> little

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
paper we're trying to get as little

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.810 
paper we're trying to get as little
light<00:02:04.020> onto<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.530> possible<00:02:04.920> once<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.759> on

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
light onto it as possible once it's on

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
light onto it as possible once it's on
the<00:02:05.909> watercolor<00:02:06.299> paper<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:07.200> use<00:02:07.380> our<00:02:07.530> roller

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the watercolor paper we use our roller

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.979 
the watercolor paper we use our roller
and<00:02:08.789> we're<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.090> gonna<00:02:09.179> roll<00:02:09.390> back<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.780> forth

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and we're just gonna roll back and forth

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.020 
and we're just gonna roll back and forth
on<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.289> for<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.619> 40<00:02:11.039> seconds

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
on it for about 40 seconds

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.309 
on it for about 40 seconds
and<00:02:12.120> then<00:02:12.209> peel<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> apart<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.900> hopefully

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and then peel it apart and hopefully

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.050 
and then peel it apart and hopefully
we'll<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> beautiful<00:02:13.709> transfer<00:02:16.910> okay<00:02:17.910> so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
we'll have a beautiful transfer okay so

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.550 
we'll have a beautiful transfer okay so
the<00:02:18.240> final<00:02:18.420> thing<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.020> do<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the final thing that you can do with the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.970 
the final thing that you can do with the
FP<00:02:20.400> 100<00:02:20.850> color<00:02:21.090> film<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.170> recover<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
FP 100 color film is you can recover the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.290 
FP 100 color film is you can recover the
negative<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.730> look<00:02:23.910> at<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> color

doing it the right order this the black

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.900 
doing it the right order this the black
backing<00:02:48.480> should<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.930> facing<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:50.310> any<00:02:50.670> of

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
backing should be facing up if any of

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.880 
backing should be facing up if any of
this<00:02:51.200> bleach<00:02:52.200> material<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.680> we're<00:02:52.769> gonna

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
this bleach material that we're gonna

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
this bleach material that we're gonna
use<00:02:52.980> gets<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.760> front<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.600> ruins<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
use gets on the front of it it ruins it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.620 
use gets on the front of it it ruins it
so<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:56.459> want<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.700> use<00:02:56.790> tape<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.330> tape<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
so you want to use tape here to tape the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.940 
so you want to use tape here to tape the
edges<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.050> don't<00:02:58.230> want<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> any<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.800> your

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
edges but you don't want it any of your

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.160 
edges but you don't want it any of your
chemical<00:02:59.790> which<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.060> bleach<00:03:00.300> basically<00:03:00.780> to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
chemical which is bleach basically to

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.979 
chemical which is bleach basically to
get<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.440> front<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.540> I'm<00:03:03.540> gonna<00:03:03.720> tape

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
get on the front of it so I'm gonna tape

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.500 
get on the front of it so I'm gonna tape
down<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.800> well<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.819> reason<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.120> like<00:03:06.300> paper

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
down really well the reason I like paper

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.660 
down really well the reason I like paper
tape<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.260> once<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:08.069> hit<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.550> with

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
tape is because once you do hit it with

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.710

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.330 

this<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.439> nut<00:04:05.590> oil<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:05.980> water<00:04:06.129> it's<00:04:06.310> just

this is nut oil and water it's just

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.410 
this is nut oil and water it's just
regular<00:04:06.670> water<00:04:07.150> room<00:04:08.109> temperature<00:04:08.219> and<00:04:09.219> you

regular water room temperature and you

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.990 
regular water room temperature and you
can<00:04:10.420> see<00:04:10.719> I<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:12.310> if<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> camera<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.819> see<00:04:12.879> I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
can see I know if the camera can see I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.399 
can see I know if the camera can see I
can<00:04:13.180> see<00:04:13.329> it<00:04:13.389> from<00:04:13.480> here<00:04:13.719> but<00:04:14.049> we'll<00:04:14.139> lift<00:04:14.319> it

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
can see it from here but we'll lift it

up<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.650> light<00:04:14.799> I<00:04:14.829> guess<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:16.900> see

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
up to the light I guess so you can see

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.170 
up to the light I guess so you can see
now<00:04:17.289> that<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:18.070> have<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> completely<00:04:18.910> transparent

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
now that I have a completely transparent

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.180 
now that I have a completely transparent
negative<00:04:21.990> you<00:04:22.990> can<00:04:23.139> easily<00:04:23.350> scan<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:23.979> or

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
negative you can easily scan this or

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.620 
negative you can easily scan this or
even<00:04:24.310> do<00:04:24.490> contact<00:04:24.820> printing<00:04:25.240> or<00:04:25.360> things<00:04:25.539> like

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
even do contact printing or things like

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.770 
even do contact printing or things like
