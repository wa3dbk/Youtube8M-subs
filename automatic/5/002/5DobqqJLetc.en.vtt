00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
it out the pizza was really good the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.390 
it out the pizza was really good the
only<00:02:38.560> thing<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.160> kind<00:02:39.310> of

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
only thing is that it's kind of

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.150 
only thing is that it's kind of
expensive<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.090> think<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.980> almost<00:02:41.980> like

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
expensive I think it's like almost like

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.080 
expensive I think it's like almost like
five<00:02:42.520> or<00:02:42.670> six<00:02:42.850> dollars<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.210> slice<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:44.230> um<00:02:44.470> but

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
five or six dollars a slice but um but

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
five or six dollars a slice but um but
yeah<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:46.300> pretty<00:02:46.390> expensive<00:02:46.630> although<00:02:47.080> a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
yeah it's pretty expensive although a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.920 
yeah it's pretty expensive although a
slice<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.560> really<00:02:47.770> really<00:02:47.980> big<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.810> I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
slice is really really big so like I

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.980 
slice is really really big so like I
only<00:02:50.050> was<00:02:50.260> able<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.560> eat<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.860> think<00:02:51.130> too<00:02:51.990> but

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
only was able to eat I think too but

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.570 
only was able to eat I think too but
yeah<00:02:53.110> kind<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.710> expense<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.220> not<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.430> eat

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
yeah kind of expense it's not like eat

try<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.510> stay<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.870> deficit<00:04:29.230> those<00:04:29.350> days

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
try to stay in the deficit those days

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.740 
try to stay in the deficit those days
and<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.860> don't<00:04:30.010> actually<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:31.000> way<00:04:31.120> when<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.600> say

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
and I don't actually the way when I say

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.750 
and I don't actually the way when I say
I<00:04:31.780> say<00:04:31.870> in<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.140> deficit<00:04:32.500> I'm<00:04:32.620> not<00:04:32.770> like<00:04:32.979> counting

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
I say in a deficit I'm not like counting

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.290 
I say in a deficit I'm not like counting
my<00:04:33.910> calories<00:04:33.940> or<00:04:34.510> anything<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.020> that

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
my calories or anything like that

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.869 
my calories or anything like that
but<00:04:35.509> for<00:04:36.139> me<00:04:36.259> he<00:04:36.560> says<00:04:36.710> when<00:04:36.860> metabolism<00:04:37.610> is<00:04:37.729> so

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879 
but for me he says when metabolism is so

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.170 
but for me he says when metabolism is so
fast<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.740> can<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.949> pretty<00:04:40.159> much<00:04:40.370> sure<00:04:40.669> that<00:04:40.699> as

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
fast I can be pretty much sure that as

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.390 
fast I can be pretty much sure that as
long<00:04:41.870> as<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.139> only<00:04:42.349> eat<00:04:42.440> until<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.830> full<00:04:43.099> and<00:04:43.340> I

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
long as I only eat until a full and I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.070 
long as I only eat until a full and I
don't<00:04:43.580> keep<00:04:43.759> eating<00:04:44.030> after<00:04:44.150> that<00:04:44.449> there's<00:04:44.840> no

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
don't keep eating after that there's no

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.499 
don't keep eating after that there's no
way<00:04:45.229> I'm<00:04:45.319> going<00:04:45.409> to<00:04:45.500> be<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.740> surplus<00:04:46.509> unless

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
way I'm going to be in a surplus unless

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.360 
way I'm going to be in a surplus unless
I<00:04:47.629> eat<00:04:47.810> like<00:04:47.990> every<00:04:48.740> hour<00:04:48.770> or<00:04:49.099> something<00:04:49.159> like

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
I eat like every hour or something like

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.850 
I eat like every hour or something like
that<00:04:49.430> but<00:04:49.729> yeah<00:04:50.300> generally<00:04:50.690> it's<00:04:51.500> pretty<00:04:51.740> hard

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
that but yeah generally it's pretty hard

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.119 
that but yeah generally it's pretty hard
for<00:04:51.919> me<00:04:52.039> to<00:04:52.159> be<00:04:52.250> in<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.340> surplus<00:04:52.669> so<00:04:53.500> yeah<00:04:54.500> that's

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
for me to be in a surplus so yeah that's

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.980 
for me to be in a surplus so yeah that's
the<00:04:55.310> way<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.460> will<00:04:55.520> go<00:04:55.580> for<00:04:55.909> now<00:04:56.060> I'll<00:04:56.449> probably

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
the way it will go for now I'll probably

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.189 
the way it will go for now I'll probably
keep<00:04:57.259> doing<00:04:57.500> one<00:04:57.710> cheat<00:04:57.949> meal<00:04:58.129> a<00:04:58.159> week<00:04:59.199> at

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
keep doing one cheat meal a week at

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.930 
keep doing one cheat meal a week at
least<00:05:00.289> until<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.620> go<00:05:00.740> back<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.889> school<00:05:01.250> just

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
least until I go back to school just

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.860 
least until I go back to school just
because<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.240> want<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.419> be<00:05:02.479> okay<00:05:02.659> with<00:05:02.780> my

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
because I want to be okay with my

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.080 
because I want to be okay with my
friends<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.259> stuff<00:05:03.669> once<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.729> go<00:05:04.849> back<00:05:04.970> to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
friends and stuff once I go back to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.339 
friends and stuff once I go back to
school<00:05:05.330> it'll<00:05:05.539> probably<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.900> little<00:05:05.990> harder<00:05:06.289> to

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
school it'll probably a little harder to

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.040 
school it'll probably a little harder to
find<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.650> time<00:05:06.860> do<00:05:07.069> I<00:05:07.159> eat<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.580> stuff<00:05:07.789> so<00:05:08.090> it

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
find the time do I eat and stuff so it

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.260 
find the time do I eat and stuff so it
might<00:05:09.289> be<00:05:09.319> less<00:05:09.590> frequent<00:05:10.009> then<00:05:10.159> and<00:05:10.370> uh<00:05:10.400> oh

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
might be less frequent then and uh oh

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.240 
might be less frequent then and uh oh
yeah<00:05:11.960> just<00:05:12.259> in<00:05:12.710> case<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:13.009> guys<00:05:13.069> are<00:05:13.129> wondering

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
yeah just in case you guys are wondering

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.029 
yeah just in case you guys are wondering
um<00:05:13.849> as<00:05:14.509> far<00:05:14.780> as<00:05:14.960> my<00:05:15.169> body<00:05:15.409> fat<00:05:15.590> percentage<00:05:15.919> goes

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
um as far as my body fat percentage goes

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.640 
um as far as my body fat percentage goes
as<00:05:16.370> measured<00:05:17.210> by<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.389> bees<00:05:17.569> here<00:05:17.900> I've<00:05:18.500> only

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
as measured by the bees here I've only

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.659 
as measured by the bees here I've only
gained<00:05:18.979> back<00:05:19.159> uh<00:05:19.969> maybe<00:05:20.690> half<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.139> percentage

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
gained back uh maybe half a percentage

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.100 
gained back uh maybe half a percentage
since<00:05:22.669> contest<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:23.539> think<00:05:23.960> I'm<00:05:24.020> doing

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
since contest so I think I'm doing

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.629 
since contest so I think I'm doing
pretty<00:05:24.229> good<00:05:24.729> so<00:05:25.729> I<00:05:26.569> will<00:05:26.960> continue<00:05:27.259> to<00:05:27.710> diet

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
pretty good so I will continue to diet

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.200 
pretty good so I will continue to diet
as<00:05:28.879> I<00:05:29.000> am<00:05:29.440> on<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.590> way<00:05:30.710> back<00:05:30.860> up<00:05:31.069> and<00:05:31.490> this
