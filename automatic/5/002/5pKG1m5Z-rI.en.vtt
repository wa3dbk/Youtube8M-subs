out see the residue right there that's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.999 
out see the residue right there that's
because<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:49.500> supposed<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:51.509> that

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
because it's supposed to be like that

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.630 
because it's supposed to be like that
instead<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.570> like<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> pop<00:01:56.369> out

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
instead of like that to see a pop out

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.139 
instead of like that to see a pop out
that's<00:01:56.939> awful<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.689> rue<00:01:58.670> anyway<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.000> one

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that's awful see rue anyway so that one

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
that's awful see rue anyway so that one
didn't<00:02:00.479> work<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.810> too<00:02:01.140> well<00:02:01.640> unfortunately

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
didn't work out too well unfortunately

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
didn't work out too well unfortunately
this<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.360> worked<00:02:03.540> out<00:02:03.750> better<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.380> i

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this one worked out better because i

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.300 
this one worked out better because i
didn't<00:02:04.829> i<00:02:05.070> only<00:02:05.880> put<00:02:06.030> five<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.719> here<00:02:06.930> i<00:02:06.960> think

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
didn't i only put five in here i think

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.279 
didn't i only put five in here i think
so<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:09.030> ones<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:09.479> all<00:02:09.599> orange<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.140> white

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
so these ones are all orange and white

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.650 
so these ones are all orange and white
because<00:02:11.069> orange<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.849> one<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.330> favorite

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
because orange is one of my favorite

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.050 
because orange is one of my favorite
colors<00:02:12.900> i<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.319> kind<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.620> funny<00:02:13.770> because

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
colors i think is kind of funny because
