under-21s<00:00:06.420> level<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.930> just<00:00:07.529> massively<00:00:08.490> flawed

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
under-21s level is just massively flawed

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.669 
under-21s level is just massively flawed
and<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.300> essentially<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> waste<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:10.110> do

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
and is essentially a waste of time do

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.780 
and is essentially a waste of time do
you<00:00:10.740> think<00:00:10.800> there's<00:00:11.070> some<00:00:11.250> truth<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.639> or<00:00:11.730> do

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
you think there's some truth in it or do

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.950 
you think there's some truth in it or do
you<00:00:11.880> think<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.210> there<00:00:12.509> are<00:00:12.540> players<00:00:12.809> who

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
you think that there are players who

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.690 
you think that there are players who
maybe<00:00:13.110> can't<00:00:13.380> get<00:00:13.590> loans<00:00:13.830> but<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.580> is

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
maybe can't get loans but that is

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.430 
maybe can't get loans but that is
because<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.599> only<00:00:15.660> option<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> best

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
because it's the only option is the best

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.380 
because it's the only option is the best
option<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.039> think<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.699> all<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.090> think<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
option I think it's all I think it's a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.950 
option I think it's all I think it's a
waste<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.690> time

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
waste of time

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
waste of time
obviously<00:00:21.890> players<00:00:22.890> sometimes<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.210> are
