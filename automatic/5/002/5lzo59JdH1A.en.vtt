00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.210
 it's a unique emotion script of the salt 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.610
 again nexos ugt not them a new video 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.560
 and well then this is a great 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.810
 news is that I was reviewing some 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.690
 comments of some videos of some 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.989
 internet pages and I discovered that this 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.980
 July 10 codes will appear 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.690
 that gave this game monster hunter eros 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.920
 of 40 and 48 hours free goal follows then 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.140
 so that divers get on so that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.409
 download the game again so that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.960
 do your accounts again and so on and 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.760
 a recommendation that I make to you is 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.000
 that they remove all the codes that can 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.360
 a day because it is possible that the codes 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.269
 nothing else are available for two or 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.190
 three months and take advantage of them with everything 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.470
 then take all the towns for the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.710
 codes that can and taking off about 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.400
 five games a day and lived about 610 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.380
 imagine in a month and good 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.010
 I'm going to leave the pressure link 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.420
 Game official 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.430
 where is this video 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.590
 this comes from the video the truth 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.140
 because the penalty is the guys 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.890
 it's well written that we see each other 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.890
 video captured
