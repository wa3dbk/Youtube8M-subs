00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the flying side kick is used to go a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.170 
the flying side kick is used to go a
distance<00:00:54.559> for<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.680> reason<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.520> safest<00:00:57.030> one

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
distance for that reason the safest one

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
distance for that reason the safest one
to<00:00:57.360> begin<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> jump<00:00:58.559> side<00:00:58.800> kick<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to begin with is the jump side kick so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.310 
to begin with is the jump side kick so
let's<00:00:59.430> break<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.730> down<00:00:59.789> first<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.989> easiest

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
let's break that down first the easiest

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.110 
let's break that down first the easiest
way<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> first<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> jump<00:01:02.340> side<00:01:02.550> kick<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
way to first do the jump side kick is to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.729 
way to first do the jump side kick is to
go<00:01:03.239> into<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.480> fighting<00:01:03.690> stance<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.749 
to time your base leg to push off now in
this<00:01:36.570> time<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> Drive<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> near<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.100> then

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
this time if I Drive this near and then

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.969 
this time if I Drive this near and then
I<00:01:38.850> push<00:01:39.060> off<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.540> end<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> very<00:01:40.710> weak

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I push off I end up with a very weak

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
I push off I end up with a very weak
jump<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.549> need<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> correct<00:01:42.360> timing

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
jump so I need to get the correct timing

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
jump so I need to get the correct timing
so<00:01:43.409> before<00:01:43.740> moving<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.790> actual<00:01:44.939> kick

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
so before moving on to the actual kick

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
so before moving on to the actual kick
or<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> suggest<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.590> first<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.909> get

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
or I suggest you do first is just get

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.039 
or I suggest you do first is just get
the<00:01:48.180> timing<00:01:48.450> right

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the timing right

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.429 
the timing right
so<00:01:49.470> from<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.710> turn<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.189> front<00:01:50.490> foot<00:01:50.729> driver

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
so from here turn your front foot driver

when<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.190> are<00:02:11.310> comfortable<00:02:11.520> doing<00:02:11.820> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
when you are comfortable doing that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
when you are comfortable doing that
extend<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.870> leg<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.410> strike<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.920> bladed

foot<00:02:14.640> or<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.120> heel<00:02:22.130> when<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.490> that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
foot or the heel when you can do that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.250 
foot or the heel when you can do that
then<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.150> focus<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> non<00:02:24.990> kicking

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
then you can focus on the non kicking

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
then you can focus on the non kicking
leg<00:02:25.620> where<00:02:26.070> most<00:02:26.250> people<00:02:26.340> first<00:02:26.790> do<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> jump

leg where most people first do the jump

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.790 
leg where most people first do the jump
so<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.540> kick<00:02:27.780> they<00:02:27.900> leave<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> leg<00:02:28.410> down<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
so I kick they leave the leg down to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.500 
so I kick they leave the leg down to
dangle<00:02:29.040> but<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.520> important<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.030> twine<00:02:30.270> tuck

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
dangle but it's important you twine tuck

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.660 
dangle but it's important you twine tuck
that<00:02:30.690> leg<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.650> doesn't<00:02:31.680> gets<00:02:32.130> wet<00:02:32.400> water

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
up and from this position going to turn

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.740 
up and from this position going to turn
in<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.050> 8<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.880> junk<00:03:00.120> side<00:03:00.450> kick

in the 8 and go to the junk side kick
the<00:03:01.170> bicycle<00:03:01.590> version<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> lot<00:03:02.280> easier<00:03:02.610> to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the bicycle version is a lot easier to

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.310 
the bicycle version is a lot easier to
do<00:03:02.880> with<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.270> run-up<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.959> commonly

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
do with the run-up so it is commonly

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.740 
do with the run-up so it is commonly
used<00:03:04.709> when<00:03:05.130> doing<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.700> flying<00:03:05.970> side<00:03:06.300> kick<00:03:06.570> if

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
used when doing the flying side kick if

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900

you want to do the jump side kick taking
off<00:03:09.000> both<00:03:09.209> feet<00:03:09.420> then<00:03:09.630> all<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.840> have<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.050> do<00:03:10.200> is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
off both feet then all you have to do is

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.050 
off both feet then all you have to do is
go<00:03:10.410> into<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.650> parallel<00:03:10.830> position<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.700> kick<00:03:11.910> off

go into a parallel position and kick off

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.550 
go into a parallel position and kick off
the<00:03:12.209> lead<00:03:12.390> legs<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:12.840> I'm<00:03:12.959> facing<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.500> way

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
the lead legs so if I'm facing this way

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.040 
the lead legs so if I'm facing this way
you'll<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.370> kicking<00:03:14.610> off<00:03:14.790> my<00:03:15.060> right<00:03:15.330> now<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
you'll be kicking off my right now the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.479 
you'll be kicking off my right now the
reason<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:16.470> easier<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> kick<00:03:17.100> off<00:03:17.220> your<00:03:17.250> lead

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
reason it's easier to kick off your lead

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.220 
reason it's easier to kick off your lead
leg<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.880> because<00:03:18.180> your<00:03:18.300> hips<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.840> foot

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
leg is because your hips and foot

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.920 
leg is because your hips and foot
already<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.890> line<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> side<00:03:21.090> kick<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.840> all

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
already in line for the side kick so all

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.890 
already in line for the side kick so all
you<00:03:22.049> have<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.320> do<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.769> jump<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.780> bringing<00:03:24.780> me

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
you have to do is jump up bringing me

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.509 
you have to do is jump up bringing me

the<00:04:00.599> rear<00:04:00.780> leg<00:04:00.959> as<00:04:01.110> well<00:04:01.260> but<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.739> difficult<00:04:02.340> to

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
the rear leg as well but is difficult to

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.830 
the rear leg as well but is difficult to
get<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.790> leg<00:04:03.060> around<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.599> change

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
get that leg around to the change

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.900 
get that leg around to the change
position<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.440> locate<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.010> side<00:04:05.220> kick<00:04:05.489> but<00:04:05.849> it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
position and locate the side kick but it

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.330 
position and locate the side kick but it
is<00:04:05.970> good<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:06.299> testing<00:04:06.690> your<00:04:06.840> own<00:04:06.870> ability

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.770 

make<00:04:14.340> for<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.579> flying<00:04:14.819> side<00:04:15.150> kick<00:04:15.420> all<00:04:15.630> we

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
make for the flying side kick all we

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.750 
make for the flying side kick all we
have<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.049> do<00:04:16.169> is<00:04:16.410> take<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.650> short<00:04:16.979> run<00:04:17.220> up<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.549> two

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
have to do is take a short run up of two

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.599 
have to do is take a short run up of two
to<00:04:17.910> three<00:04:17.940> steps<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.780> then<00:04:19.500> do<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.130> jump<00:04:20.370> side

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
to three steps and then do the jump side

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.280 
to three steps and then do the jump side
kick<00:04:20.639> that<00:04:21.120> we<00:04:21.209> did<00:04:21.359> at<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.510> very<00:04:21.780> beginning

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
kick that we did at the very beginning

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.620 
kick that we did at the very beginning
so<00:04:23.190> when<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.430> take<00:04:23.610> your<00:04:23.669> run<00:04:23.910> no<00:04:24.240> matter<00:04:24.360> how

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
so when you take your run no matter how

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.080 
so when you take your run no matter how
many<00:04:24.810> steps<00:04:25.229> your<00:04:25.530> last<00:04:25.860> step<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.490> need<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.880> be

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
many steps your last step and need to be

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.300 
many steps your last step and need to be
the<00:04:27.389> leg<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.870> are<00:04:27.990> not<00:04:28.290> kicking<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.280> I

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
the leg you are not kicking with so I

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.310 
the leg you are not kicking with so I
take<00:04:29.580> my<00:04:29.610> run-up<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.240> last<00:04:30.510> step<00:04:30.870> will<00:04:31.169> have

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
take my run-up the last step will have

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.350 
take my run-up the last step will have
to<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:31.590> for<00:04:31.770> me<00:04:31.919> with<00:04:32.400> my<00:04:32.520> left<00:04:32.789> leg<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.150> wanna

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
to be for me with my left leg of wanna

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.690 
to be for me with my left leg of wanna
kick<00:04:33.600> with<00:04:33.750> my<00:04:33.780> jump<00:04:34.139> right<00:04:34.380> side<00:04:34.650> kick<00:04:34.919> from

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
kick with my jump right side kick from

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.310 
kick with my jump right side kick from
this<00:04:35.850> position<00:04:36.030> now<00:04:36.479> all<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.840> momentum<00:04:37.260> you

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
this position now all the momentum you

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.930 
this position now all the momentum you
should<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.650> built<00:04:37.860> up<00:04:38.100> gives<00:04:38.610> us<00:04:38.789> the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
should have built up gives us the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.360 
should have built up gives us the
momentum<00:04:39.389> going<00:04:39.600> forwards<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.590> also<00:04:41.190> gives

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
momentum going forwards and also gives

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.800 
momentum going forwards and also gives
us<00:04:41.460> more<00:04:41.669> power<00:04:41.880> going<00:04:42.090> into<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.389> technique

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
us more power going into the technique

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.540 
us more power going into the technique
so<00:04:43.380> when<00:04:43.500> we<00:04:43.590> get<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.889> this<00:04:44.010> point<00:04:44.310> what<00:04:44.490> we

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
so when we get to this point what we

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.060 
so when we get to this point what we
need<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.789> focus<00:04:45.000> on<00:04:45.330> is<00:04:45.539> driving<00:04:46.289> these<00:04:46.410> arms

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
need to focus on is driving these arms

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.740 
need to focus on is driving these arms
and<00:04:47.160> need<00:04:47.490> up<00:04:47.760> because<00:04:48.240> we've<00:04:48.389> already<00:04:48.510> got<00:04:48.630> a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
and need up because we've already got a

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.779 
and need up because we've already got a
mental<00:04:49.110> boom<00:04:49.260> forwards<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:50.130> need<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.340> get<00:04:50.490> some

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
mental boom forwards we need to get some

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.940 
mental boom forwards we need to get some
momentum<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.750> go<00:04:51.930> up<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.320> get<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.560> height<00:04:52.770> for

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
momentum to go up and get the height for

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.210 
momentum to go up and get the height for
the<00:04:53.070> kick<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:54.030> when<00:04:54.150> you're<00:04:54.300> running<00:04:54.479> up<00:04:55.190> try<00:04:56.190> a

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
the kick so when you're running up try a

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.570 
the kick so when you're running up try a
block<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.870> then<00:04:58.349> go<00:04:58.620> into<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:59.099> jump<00:04:59.340> side

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
block and then go into the jump side

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:12.290 
block and then go into the jump side
kick<00:05:09.380> if<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:11.310> are<00:05:11.460> doing<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.820> bicycle

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
kick if you are doing the bicycle

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.210 
kick if you are doing the bicycle
version<00:05:12.660> flying<00:05:12.990> side<00:05:13.200> kick<00:05:13.500> then<00:05:13.800> your<00:05:14.010> last

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
version flying side kick then your last

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.520 
version flying side kick then your last
step<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.970> need<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:15.360> be<00:05:15.510> off<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.690> actual<00:05:16.320> kick

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
step and need to be off the actual kick

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.980 
step and need to be off the actual kick
in<00:05:16.710> leg<00:05:16.919> then<00:05:17.310> your<00:05:17.520> other<00:05:17.700> need<00:05:18.030> or<00:05:18.419> drive<00:05:18.720> up

if you are doing the bicycle version

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.460 
if you are doing the bicycle version
then<00:05:48.330> you<00:05:48.420> will<00:05:48.510> need<00:05:48.660> to<00:05:48.720> turn<00:05:49.020> your<00:05:49.230> non
