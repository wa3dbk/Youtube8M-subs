00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
only aim down sight when the enemies are
medium-range<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.250> there's<00:01:51.000> no<00:01:51.299> way

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
medium-range because there's no way

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
medium-range because there's no way
you'd<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.170> able<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.500> kills<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.009> long

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you'd be able to get kills from long

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.060 
you'd be able to get kills from long
range<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.530> over<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> Stachel

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
range and I like to go over the Stachel

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.840 
range and I like to go over the Stachel
quick<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.820> kap-40<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.840> damage<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> 45<00:01:58.979> from

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
quick the kap-40 the damage is 45 from

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
quick the kap-40 the damage is 45 from
up<00:02:00.149> close<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.600> 19<00:02:01.049> from<00:02:01.259> long-range<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
up close to 19 from long-range so I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.649 
up close to 19 from long-range so I
would<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.790> recommend<00:02:02.969> using<00:02:03.450> this

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
would not recommend using this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.350 
would not recommend using this
long-range<00:02:04.350> ever<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.399> tried<00:02:05.939> sticky<00:02:06.270> -

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
long-range ever at all I tried sticky -

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.789 
long-range ever at all I tried sticky -
the<00:02:06.450> only<00:02:06.659> close<00:02:06.990> quarters<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.409> game<00:02:07.530> prints

gameplay<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.989> kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> stay<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> buildings

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099

I<00:02:11.310> never<00:02:11.790> really<00:02:12.030> run<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.270> too<00:02:12.540> often<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
I never really run out too often and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.170 
I never really run out too often and
if<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:14.190> try<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> make<00:02:14.610> sure<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.030> don't

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
if I do I try to make sure that I don't

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390 
if I do I try to make sure that I don't
run<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.599> open<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.349> run<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.860> some<00:02:17.160> long

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
run in the open or I run to some long

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.750 
run in the open or I run to some long

range area the magazine size is only 12

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.330 
range area the magazine size is only 12
and<00:02:21.120> singleplayer<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.140> 15<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.950> multiplayer

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.610 
and singleplayer and 15 and multiplayer
and<00:02:23.819> like<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.209> said<00:02:24.420> before<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:25.020> 20<00:02:25.440> with

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and like I said before it's 20 with

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.290 
and like I said before it's 20 with
extended<00:02:26.099> clip<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.880> definitely<00:02:27.090> recommend

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
extended clip and I definitely recommend

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.990 
extended clip and I definitely recommend
you<00:02:27.660> use<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.620> unlocked<00:02:29.040> at<00:02:29.280> level<00:02:29.340> 43

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you use that it's unlocked at level 43

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.199 
you use that it's unlocked at level 43
so<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.989> get<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.290> pretty<00:02:31.650> late<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.130> I'm<00:02:32.940> not

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
so you get it pretty late on I'm not

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.670 
so you get it pretty late on I'm not
sure<00:02:33.269> if<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.810> would<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:33.989> use<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.290> prestige

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
sure if I would actually use a prestige

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.530 
sure if I would actually use a prestige
token<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.069> unlock<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.550> I'm<00:02:35.880> not<00:02:36.090> sure<00:02:36.390> because

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
token to unlock it I'm not sure because

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.360 
token to unlock it I'm not sure because
recently<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.349> started<00:02:37.800> using<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.160> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
recently I just started using it and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.509 
recently I just started using it and
honestly<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.360> super<00:02:39.959> super<00:02:40.530> powerful<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.190> I

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
honestly it's super super powerful and I

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.680 
honestly it's super super powerful and I
really<00:02:41.790> feel<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.420> gonna<00:02:42.540> start

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
