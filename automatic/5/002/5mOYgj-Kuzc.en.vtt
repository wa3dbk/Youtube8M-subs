but I recently got it fixed again the
the<00:00:56.070> signal<00:00:56.670> itself<00:00:57.000> had<00:00:57.210> set<00:00:57.449> upside-down

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
completely soaked the speaker magnets

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.570 
completely soaked the speaker magnets
and<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> wiring<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.430> was

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
all shot there's no good so I found I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
all shot there's no good so I found I
went<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.670> eBay<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.570> happened<00:01:12.930> to

went on eBay and I just so happened to
find<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.470> speaker<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.630> $25<00:01:15.650> hooked<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> up

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.240 
find this speaker for $25 hooked it up
and<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.189> works<00:01:17.400> perfectly<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.920> I'm<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.040> going

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.910 
and it works perfectly so I'm just going
to<00:01:20.280> demonstrate<00:01:21.439> different<00:01:22.439> sounds<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> has

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
to demonstrate different sounds it has

forth<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.600> make<00:02:02.720> different<00:02:03.110> tones<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:04.220> for

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
forth to make different tones like for

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:57.940 
so let's select one and five here then
there's<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.150> siren<00:02:41.620> one<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.950> six

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:09.960 

we<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.070> vibrato<00:02:59.670> 1<00:03:00.210> &amp;<00:03:00.420> 7

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.660 

you<00:03:10.970> have<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> slow<00:03:11.690> loop<00:03:12.140> which<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:13.070> one<00:03:13.400> and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
you have a slow loop which is one and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:31.240 
you have a slow loop which is one and
eight

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.410 

we<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:33.349> steady<00:03:34.349> beep<00:03:34.910> which<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.120> two<00:03:36.390> and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
we have a steady beep which is two and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.979 
we have a steady beep which is two and
four<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:38.520> now<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:38.730> got<00:03:38.940> shut<00:03:39.239> one<00:03:39.510> off<00:03:39.690> here

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
four so now you got shut one off here

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.750 
four so now you got shut one off here
let's<00:03:40.230> select<00:03:40.410> two<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:42.080> for<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:47.130> force<00:03:47.430> which

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
let's select two and for the force which

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.970 
let's select two and for the force which
is<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.970> little<00:03:48.239> funky<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.840> times<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.500> sometimes

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
is a little funky at times so sometimes

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.340 
is a little funky at times so sometimes
it<00:03:50.100> won't<00:03:50.280> work<00:03:51.060> unless<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.660> start<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.050> turn<00:03:52.260> it

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
it won't work unless I start to turn it

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.190 
it won't work unless I start to turn it
off<00:03:52.500> slightly<00:03:56.420> there's<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.750> one

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
off slightly there's that one

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:07.190 
off slightly there's that one
I<00:04:01.100> need<00:04:02.100> longer<00:04:02.370> fingernails<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.569> this<00:04:06.200> what

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
I need longer fingernails for this what

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:18.140 
I need longer fingernails for this what
else<00:04:07.410> here<00:04:07.880> stutter<00:04:08.880> two<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.170> five<00:04:16.850> that<00:04:17.850> felt

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
else here stutter two and five that felt

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.280 
else here stutter two and five that felt
weird<00:04:18.209> on<00:04:18.570> my<00:04:18.690> head<00:04:19.940> fast<00:04:20.940> loop<00:04:21.329> which<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.840> two

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
weird on my head fast loop which is two

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:43.690 
weird on my head fast loop which is two
and<00:04:22.530> six<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:33.300> chime<00:04:33.750> which<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:35.070> two<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:35.850> seven

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
the vibration let's see we have high-low

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:17.800 
the vibration let's see we have high-low
which<00:05:00.650> is<00:05:01.040> three<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.090> four<00:05:16.540> now<00:05:17.540> if<00:05:17.690> I

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
which is three and four now if I

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.070 
which is three and four now if I
remember<00:05:18.200> correctly<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:19.330> was<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.780> tone

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
remember correctly that was the tone

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.270 
remember correctly that was the tone
that<00:05:21.530> they<00:05:22.280> used<00:05:22.930> when<00:05:23.930> they<00:05:23.990> had<00:05:24.770> this<00:05:24.920> alarm

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
that they used when they had this alarm

that they used when they had this alarm
down<00:05:25.670> here<00:05:25.910> because<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.390> remember<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:26.930> went<00:05:27.110> off

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
down here because I remember it went off

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.020 
down here because I remember it went off
one<00:05:27.440> times<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:28.070> course<00:05:28.340> when<00:05:28.520> I<00:05:28.550> was<00:05:28.730> a<00:05:28.790> lot

anything<00:06:44.169> with<00:06:44.349> it

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.430 

hmm<00:06:50.430> I<00:06:50.610> guess<00:06:51.360> you<00:06:51.510> could<00:06:51.690> go<00:06:51.810> on<00:06:51.960> and<00:06:52.110> make<00:06:52.260> all

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
hmm I guess you could go on and make all

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.680 
hmm I guess you could go on and make all
kinds<00:06:52.470> of<00:06:52.980> different<00:06:53.370> sounds<00:06:53.910> when<00:06:54.300> you<00:06:54.330> mix

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.650 
kinds of different sounds when you mix
these<00:06:54.900> up<00:06:54.960> I<00:06:55.580> think<00:06:56.580> I<00:06:56.730> don't<00:06:56.790> know<00:06:56.970> what<00:06:57.150> 4<00:06:57.390> &amp;<00:06:57.510> 5

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
these up I think I don't know what 4 &amp; 5

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:08.109 
these up I think I don't know what 4 &amp; 5
does<00:07:01.370> nothing
