00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.660
 this is one of my videos to teach you 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.240
 as 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.190
 change the voice of the stories and how 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.510
 remove uncomfortable objects pro 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.510
 evolution soccer 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.270
 Well the change of the rapporteur is something that 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.830
 will bring for example a reactor 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.780
 determined to me they brought me the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.780
 Mexicans Luis Garcia and Christian 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.230
 martinoli would apologize 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:38.340
 ignorance if you pronounce it bad and good and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.130
 I am from Argentina so I wanted 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 intuit to know that they had the stories 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.890
 Argentineans want in these good 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.570
 then I had discovered an easy method 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.450
 how 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.540
 achieve it good I do not think I'll be you 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.800
 Here I am showing my day master 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.800
 and playing with river 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 good a growing we left duo champion 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.930
 of championship championships 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.430
 good what's important what I'm going to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.350
 to teach now is to be very attentive to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.350
 the camera and as high 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 we have to go to the options in the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 slot that 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.050
 we are going to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.759
 system settings 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.880
 then we went into settings subject 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.070
 let's find with language adjustment 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.950
 within screen and language of 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.010
 comment where I say language of 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.930
 comment we'll go in there and I'll 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.040
 I find this Portuguese ercis 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.820
 Spanish Mexico Spanish Spanish and Spain 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.190
 in Argentina 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.410
 I have labeled the option of Argentina 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.560
 but you any of these can 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.130
 choose among these rare 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.209
 this reaction latin american 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.810
 os valos in spain bring I do not know german 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.410
 I think that if it is brought by Spanish from Spain, 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.950
 bring I do not know if your other countries 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.099
 good and to remove the annoying things 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.140
 this in the sense of xbox because I 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.150
 setting up a play 3 did not show up 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.519
 this in the production of play station 3 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.780
 new version when we give the pass to 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.500
 racing we will appear about 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.900
 little things so it tells you to 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.709
 where to go then to me it seemed very 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.930
 uncomfortable but still using it let's 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.459
 the personal data is to say we put 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.580
 our data can be very much here 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.720
 I have this leandro some good let's 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.799
 support options and here we have 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.040
 technique free throw controls 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.580
 shoot 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.210
 good here we have adjectives 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.830
 and guide would be the guide 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.260
 address says the guide and address is 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.510
 shows when shooting pass or play a 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.150
 ball to depth manually the cheese 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.250
 you win in the circles everything and we are going to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.660
 inform the party a bit if you 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.900
 they want it to disappear from your screen 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.260
 that directly push the button 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.060
 green that is the image and they put today and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.680
 then it will appear will not show 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.090
 helps on the screen and it's not going to 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.340
 bother 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.740
 good would that be if they want to guide the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.400
 objective and positioning reads what 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.930
 says and the highway to be selected 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.050
 skill controls is simple 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.630
 automatic according to how it runs when playing and 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.880
 we put it two you saw this is the do not know 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.700
 will select control should 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.590
 single semiautomatic according to the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.170
 direction that I left comfortable 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.590
 and I usually play in manual mode to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:03.300
 times but much more complicated is but 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.310
 I've been playing since 2011 there 12 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.920
 I already have it the manual is not available 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.160
 2011 which must be sincere for the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.910
 2012 I think I started 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.220
 and I'm good in 2003 and 2014 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.100
 and well that would be all friends if you 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.090
 liked the video from I like 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.760
 any suggestion channel especially if it 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.650
 for the camera you have to wait until my 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.820
 birthday people January 29th you have to 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.160

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.110
 and they wait for some new cameras better 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.690
 hd recording or directly what 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.190
 we can record with the split and a 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.750
 way to record our console with the 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.800
 lead and I'm not going to do it and well 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.450
