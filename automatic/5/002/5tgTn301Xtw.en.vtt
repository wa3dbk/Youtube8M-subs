00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
that sound is indicating to me that the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.430 
that sound is indicating to me that the
other<00:05:19.110> headlight<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.950> not<00:05:20.190> present<00:05:20.640> and<00:05:21.440> it's

that's why anyway I don't know how much

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.810 
that's why anyway I don't know how much
gas<00:05:32.190> is<00:05:32.430> in<00:05:32.460> this<00:05:32.730> thing<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.410> I'm<00:05:34.410> just<00:05:34.560> gonna

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
gas is in this thing so I'm just gonna

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.350 
gas is in this thing so I'm just gonna
try<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.850> start<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.480> see<00:05:36.750> what<00:05:37.080> happens<00:05:37.140> and

try to start it and see what happens and

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.000 
try to start it and see what happens and
the<00:05:39.360> brakes<00:05:39.600> are<00:05:39.810> like<00:05:39.990> mashed<00:05:40.200> potatoes<00:05:40.740> so

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
the brakes are like mashed potatoes so

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.379 
the brakes are like mashed potatoes so
there's<00:05:41.700> no<00:05:41.850> way<00:05:42.090> i'm<00:05:42.240> gonna<00:05:42.390> move<00:05:42.630> this<00:05:42.690> car

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
there's no way i'm gonna move this car

00:05:44.389 --> 00:06:11.279 
there's no way i'm gonna move this car
anyway

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.790 

our<00:06:11.860> steering<00:06:12.279> still<00:06:12.550> works<00:06:13.589> check<00:06:14.589> engine

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
our steering still works check engine

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.570 
our steering still works check engine
lights<00:06:15.129> on<00:06:15.279> though

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.309 

damn<00:06:21.210> that's<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:21.659> first<00:06:21.900> time<00:06:21.990> it's<00:06:22.110> ever

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
damn that's the first time it's ever

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:32.870 
damn that's the first time it's ever
came<00:06:22.590> on<00:06:22.800> in<00:06:22.979> five<00:06:23.189> months

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.610 

think<00:06:33.450> I<00:06:33.540> better<00:06:33.720> shut<00:06:33.990> off<00:06:34.110> because

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
think I better shut off because

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.100 
think I better shut off because
really<00:06:36.430> low<00:06:36.580> on<00:06:36.699> gas<00:06:36.910> to

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
really low on gas to

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.260 
really low on gas to
but<00:06:39.650> that<00:06:39.800> was<00:06:39.950> simple<00:06:40.730> it<00:06:40.880> just<00:06:40.910> started<00:06:41.390> up

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
but that was simple it just started up

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:52.290 
but that was simple it just started up
oh<00:06:43.680> yeah<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.830> brakes<00:06:45.070> are<00:06:45.250> really<00:06:45.490> bad

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.390 

so<00:06:53.300> yeah<00:06:53.420> if<00:06:53.540> the<00:06:53.660> car<00:06:53.810> actually<00:06:54.020> runs<00:06:54.440> for

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
so yeah if the car actually runs for

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.570 
so yeah if the car actually runs for
once<00:06:55.810> um<00:06:57.550> yeah<00:06:58.550> just<00:06:58.910> a<00:06:59.030> small<00:07:00.580> small

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
once um yeah just a small small

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.840 
once um yeah just a small small
collision<00:07:02.030> wasn't<00:07:02.420> anything<00:07:02.600> bad<00:07:03.790> but<00:07:04.790> with<00:07:05.660> a

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
collision wasn't anything bad but with a

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.060
