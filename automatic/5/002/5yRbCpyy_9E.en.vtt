00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello very good I am chori pontius and today 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.440
 I'm going to show you what a twin is and how 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.950
 get to make it clear a ring is a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.460
 character with his level finished in 9 is 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.999
 say 29 39 or in my case 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.999
 79 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.950
 and why do this so to be able 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.680
 take advantage of that you are of high level 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.750
 get into old age and face people 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.510
 of lower level than you or just worse 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.390
 how are we going to make this possible well 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.670
 first we stop the experience in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.890
 the case of the alliance we will have to see 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.750
 to this guy who is in the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.360
 castle in storm in the room 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.780
 controls 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.510
 which is that of has experience in the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.640
 case of the fat woman I leave a link in the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.340
 description of where it is 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.900
 because you have experience 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.360
 gives us the two options of 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.760
 stop the experience bar or in my 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.020
 case to win again 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.229
 and for a small fee you do it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.420
 once given then it is only necessary 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.720
 arm 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 and start enjoying the pga by 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.729
 example me how am I in the 79 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:31.400
 and I'm plates the best option that I have 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.200
 is to get the wild salonic set 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.510
 I also recommend that you do 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.970
 engineers because that way you can have this 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.080
 hunting 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.530
 and these two beads that are very good 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.020
 and finally, because a good weapon is this 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 the pole whale harpoon that you get 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.560
 being revered with the bald 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 once we already have all this just 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.110
 is to get into old age and enjoy 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.030
 that you are the strongest there so 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.030
 I was already greeting and see you later
