steps<00:00:12.870> nope

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.740 

it<00:00:18.939> for<00:00:19.600> me<00:00:19.750> yeah<00:00:20.470> I<00:00:20.500> get<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:20.860> I<00:00:21.220> could<00:00:21.400> I<00:00:21.760> tend

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
it for me yeah I get that I could I tend

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.170 
it for me yeah I get that I could I tend
to<00:00:22.810> always<00:00:22.930> work<00:00:23.500> from<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.830> base<00:00:24.009> up<00:00:24.400> when

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
to always work from the base up when

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.170 
to always work from the base up when
styling<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.869> tree<00:00:26.110> or<00:00:26.230> doing<00:00:26.529> anything

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
styling a tree or doing anything

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.580 
styling a tree or doing anything
trimming<00:00:28.180> cutting<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.630> always<00:00:28.960> started<00:00:29.320> to<00:00:29.439> be

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
trimming cutting I always started to be

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.350 
trimming cutting I always started to be
so<00:00:29.950> yeah<00:00:30.789> I<00:00:30.820> this<00:00:31.240> is<00:00:31.630> what<00:00:31.810> I<00:00:31.840> do<00:00:33.150> but<00:00:34.150> yeah

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
so yeah I this is what I do but yeah

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.840 
so yeah I this is what I do but yeah
then<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.720> last<00:00:34.960> step<00:00:35.320> would<00:00:35.530> be<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:36.820> would

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
then the last step would be we would

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.119 
then the last step would be we would
this<00:00:37.390> happens<00:00:38.050> you've<00:00:38.260> just<00:00:38.650> been<00:00:38.800> trimmed

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
this happens you've just been trimmed

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.740 
this happens you've just been trimmed
recently<00:00:39.550> but<00:00:39.730> what<00:00:39.850> I<00:00:39.879> would<00:00:40.030> do<00:00:40.269> is<00:00:40.420> remove

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
recently but what I would do is remove

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.079 
recently but what I would do is remove
any<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.320> stuff<00:00:41.530> go<00:00:42.400> around<00:00:42.699> and<00:00:42.910> just

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
any of this stuff go around and just

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.910 
any of this stuff go around and just
pick<00:00:43.300> through<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.660> clean<00:00:44.019> it<00:00:44.170> up<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.470> if<00:00:44.800> it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
pick through it clean it up and if it

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.650 
pick through it clean it up and if it
needed<00:00:45.370> trimming<00:00:45.760> I<00:00:45.850> would<00:00:45.970> sort<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.239> do<00:00:46.480> that

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
needed trimming I would sort of do that

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.229 
needed trimming I would sort of do that
I<00:00:46.930> would<00:00:47.559> even<00:00:47.739> rewire<00:00:48.280> anything<00:00:48.879> here<00:00:49.120> with

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
I would even rewire anything here with

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.439 
I would even rewire anything here with
the<00:00:49.360> exception<00:00:50.019> of<00:00:50.110> maybe<00:00:50.970> going<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.180> little

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
the exception of maybe going a little

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.000 
the exception of maybe going a little
that<00:00:52.629> way<00:00:52.780> with<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.170> so<00:00:53.379> we<00:00:53.530> could<00:00:53.710> see<00:00:53.979> a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
that way with this so we could see a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.500 
that way with this so we could see a
little<00:00:54.220> more<00:00:54.519> of<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:54.670> trunk<00:00:55.119> because<00:00:55.449> I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
little more of that trunk because I

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.969 
little more of that trunk because I
think<00:00:55.600> that's<00:00:55.960> impressive<00:00:56.350> yeah<00:00:56.799> this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
think that's impressive yeah this

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.390 
think that's impressive yeah this
actually<00:00:57.549> hides<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.089> so<00:00:58.119> if<00:00:58.479> if<00:00:59.080> that's<00:00:59.409> okay

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
actually hides it so if if that's okay

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.549 
actually hides it so if if that's okay
with<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:00.790> would<00:01:01.299> certainly<00:01:01.540> do<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:02.350> would

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
with you I would certainly do it I would

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.460 
with you I would certainly do it I would
go<00:01:02.650> that<00:01:02.949> way<00:01:03.189> I<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.510> than<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:05.140> not<00:01:05.439> much

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
go that way I think I than that not much

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.060 
go that way I think I than that not much
I<00:01:05.830> would<00:01:06.010> I<00:01:06.400> would<00:01:06.670> consider<00:01:07.920> everything<00:01:08.920> it's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
I would I would consider everything it's

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.789 
I would I would consider everything it's
pretty<00:01:09.130> good<00:01:09.490> with<00:01:09.640> this<00:01:09.760> tree<00:01:10.060> which<00:01:10.540> is<00:01:10.799> if

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
pretty good with this tree which is if

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.280 
pretty good with this tree which is if
you<00:01:12.010> knew<00:01:12.159> me<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.549> would<00:01:12.729> be<00:01:12.970> very<00:01:13.689> rare<00:01:14.020> for

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
you knew me that would be very rare for

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.810 
you knew me that would be very rare for
me<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.500> say<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.740> grow<00:01:15.040> or<00:01:15.189> did<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.549> I<00:01:15.580> don't

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
me to say I grow or did that I don't

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.249 
me to say I grow or did that I don't
compliment<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.720> grow<00:01:16.900> as<00:01:17.110> much<00:01:18.900> well<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.020> is

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
compliment to grow as much well it is

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.680 
compliment to grow as much well it is
and<00:01:20.470> it's<00:01:20.619> an<00:01:20.740> art<00:01:20.920> form<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.369> obviously<00:01:22.210> black

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
and it's an art form is obviously black

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.020 
and it's an art form is obviously black
okay<00:01:23.050> like<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:23.740> yeah<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.400> think<00:01:24.670> it's<00:01:24.790> going<00:01:24.970> to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
okay like so yeah I think it's going to

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.390 
okay like so yeah I think it's going to
bring<00:01:25.210> out<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.510> moth<00:01:25.950> yes<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.100> think<00:01:27.190> like

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
bring out the moth yes I think like

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.680 
bring out the moth yes I think like
would<00:01:27.550> look<00:01:27.670> good<00:01:27.790> with<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.060> pot<00:01:28.450> especially

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
would look good with the pot especially

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:41.240 
would look good with the pot especially
a<00:01:29.110> black<00:01:29.500> day

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.630 

and<00:01:42.630> professionals<00:01:43.630> thought<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:44.170> should<00:01:44.640> so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
and professionals thought we should so

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.980 
and professionals thought we should so
you<00:01:45.700> can<00:01:45.910> see<00:01:46.090> I'm<00:01:46.210> clearly<00:01:46.570> not<00:01:46.720> a

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
you can see I'm clearly not a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.040 
you can see I'm clearly not a
professional<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.840> little

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
professional and they have little

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.930 
professional and they have little
brushes<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.740> clean<00:01:51.010> them<00:01:51.190> up<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.520> area<00:01:51.760> name

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
brushes and clean them up and area name

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.200 
brushes and clean them up and area name
so<00:01:52.180> yeah<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:55.119> no<00:01:55.270> idea<00:01:55.600> what<00:01:55.750> I'm<00:01:55.840> doing

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
so yeah I have no idea what I'm doing

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.990 
so yeah I have no idea what I'm doing
you'll<00:01:58.210> get<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.479> something<00:01:59.520> obviously<00:02:00.520> you're

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
you'll get it something obviously you're

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.240 
you'll get it something obviously you're
doing<00:02:01.330> right

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.820 

I<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:10.360> press<00:02:10.630> them<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.899> down<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.590> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
I just press them on down and it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.460 
I just press them on down and it
certainly<00:02:12.280> won't<00:02:12.520> hurt<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:13.060> push<00:02:13.540> out<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
certainly won't hurt to push out in the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.050 
certainly won't hurt to push out in the
event<00:02:14.560> there<00:02:14.920> are<00:02:15.040> any<00:02:15.280> more<00:02:15.550> little<00:02:15.940> air

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
event there are any more little air

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.940 
event there are any more little air
pockets<00:02:16.570> which<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.840> doubt<00:02:17.050> but<00:02:17.380> yeah<00:02:17.770> it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
pockets which I doubt but yeah it

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.320 
pockets which I doubt but yeah it
doesn't<00:02:18.280> hurt<00:02:18.370> they<00:02:18.610> give<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> good<00:02:19.090> press

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
doesn't hurt they give it a good press

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.260 
doesn't hurt they give it a good press
the<00:02:20.320> soil<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:23.430> aerated<00:02:24.430> enough<00:02:24.730> with<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> lava

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
the soil is aerated enough with the lava

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.380 
the soil is aerated enough with the lava
rocket<00:02:25.870> pressing<00:02:26.500> wouldn't<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:26.950> an<00:02:27.340> issue<00:02:27.520> in

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
rocket pressing wouldn't be an issue in

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.510 
rocket pressing wouldn't be an issue in
an<00:02:28.570> organic<00:02:28.990> soil<00:02:29.440> if<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.709> press<00:02:30.040> then<00:02:30.310> it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
an organic soil if you press then it's

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.490 
an organic soil if you press then it's
so<00:02:30.730> compacted<00:02:31.420> air<00:02:31.630> will<00:02:31.780> never<00:02:32.020> get<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.380> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
so compacted air will never get in you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500 
so compacted air will never get in you
kill<00:02:32.740> your<00:02:32.890> roots<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:34.090> case<00:02:34.330> you're

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
kill your roots but in case you're

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.020 
kill your roots but in case you're
wondering<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:35.140> won't<00:02:35.560> do<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.820> now<00:02:36.970> I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
wondering this won't do that so now I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.640 
wondering this won't do that so now I
just<00:02:37.330> clean<00:02:37.510> your<00:02:37.690> little<00:02:37.930> pot<00:02:38.110> up<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:38.440> we're

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
just clean your little pot up and we're

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.199 
just clean your little pot up and we're
going<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.800> wire<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:39.520> over<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.970> think

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
going to wire that one over and I think

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.410 
going to wire that one over and I think
it'll<00:02:40.330> look<00:02:40.450> pretty<00:02:40.780> good

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.470 

sounds<00:02:44.200> good

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:59.740 

I'm<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.530> on

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.740 

and<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.890> motors<00:03:01.400> get<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.850> console<00:03:02.360> open

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
and the motors get the console open

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.130 
and the motors get the console open
super-stretch<00:03:03.470> Lite<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.980> is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
super-stretch Lite it is

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.350 
super-stretch Lite it is
keep<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.680> happy

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.260 

I<00:03:13.800> don't<00:03:14.800> charge<00:03:15.010> extra<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.550> messing<00:03:16.090> up<00:03:16.210> your

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
I don't charge extra for messing up your

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:28.660 
I don't charge extra for messing up your
pie<00:03:18.810> I'm<00:03:19.810> good<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.380> way

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.260 

and<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:30.610> probably<00:03:31.610> lucky<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.060> this

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
and this is a probably lucky that this

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.030 
and this is a probably lucky that this
was<00:03:32.540> here<00:03:32.840> because<00:03:33.020> now<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.319> get<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.620> little

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
was here because now you get a little

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.630 
was here because now you get a little
bit<00:03:34.580> of<00:03:34.670> an<00:03:34.790> idea<00:03:34.940> about<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.630> wiring<00:03:36.640> I'm

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
bit of an idea about the wiring I'm

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.130 
bit of an idea about the wiring I'm
going<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.120> use<00:03:38.300> two<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.490> a<00:03:40.700> very

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
going to use two this is a very

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.190 
going to use two this is a very
intermediate<00:03:42.140> size<00:03:42.410> like<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.069> maybe<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.200> light

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
intermediate size like and maybe a light

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
intermediate size like and maybe a light
medium<00:03:45.530> we'll<00:03:46.040> call<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.580> wire<00:03:48.100> there<00:03:49.100> is

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
medium we'll call it wire there is

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.820 
medium we'll call it wire there is
fairly<00:03:49.850> pliable<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.350> we're<00:03:51.500> going<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.680> go

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
fairly pliable so we're going to go

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.560 
fairly pliable so we're going to go
through<00:03:52.160> an<00:03:52.310> anchor<00:03:54.520> anchor<00:03:55.520> our<00:03:55.910> wire<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.420> the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
through an anchor anchor our wire on the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.490 
through an anchor anchor our wire on the
opposite<00:03:57.110> branch<00:03:59.319> over<00:04:00.319> here

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.130 

right<00:04:02.650> enough<00:04:03.010> there<00:04:03.280> we<00:04:03.400> go<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:05.970> then<00:04:06.970> just

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.190 

and<00:04:10.590> kind<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:10.890> like<00:04:10.980> moist<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.640> up<00:04:12.020> we're<00:04:13.020> going

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
and kind of like moist it up we're going

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.650 
and kind of like moist it up we're going
to<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.440> wrap<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.040> right<00:04:14.340> lightly<00:04:15.270> we<00:04:15.420> don't

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
to just wrap it right lightly we don't

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.420 
to just wrap it right lightly we don't
want<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.900> cut<00:04:16.079> into<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.410> Bart<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.130> there's

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
want to cut into that Bart and there's

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.400 
want to cut into that Bart and there's
no<00:04:17.640> way<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.880> explain<00:04:18.090> wiring<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.109> something

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
no way to explain wiring it's something

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.830 
no way to explain wiring it's something
you<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.709> do<00:04:20.070> get<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.730> feel<00:04:20.970> for<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.600> and

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
you have to do get it feel for you and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.430 
you have to do get it feel for you and
kill<00:04:22.590> many<00:04:22.890> branches<00:04:23.520> where<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.270> get<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.230> but

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
kill many branches where you get it but

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.460 
kill many branches where you get it but
I<00:04:25.710> do<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:27.000> say<00:04:27.030> well<00:04:27.510> wrap<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:28.050> tight<00:04:28.260> but

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
I do it to say well wrap it tight but

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.200 
I do it to say well wrap it tight but
not<00:04:28.500> too<00:04:28.680> tight<00:04:28.920> well<00:04:29.400> what<00:04:29.550> does<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.700> mean<00:04:29.850> I

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
not too tight well what does that mean I

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.120 
not too tight well what does that mean I
mean<00:04:30.390> it's<00:04:31.170> just<00:04:31.470> not<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> thing<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.010> can

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
mean it's just not a thing you can

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.580 
mean it's just not a thing you can
really<00:04:32.550> explain<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:36.030> how<00:04:36.510> far<00:04:36.870> can<00:04:37.200> you<00:04:37.230> push

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
really explain and how far can you push

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.850 
really explain and how far can you push
that<00:04:37.830> branch<00:04:38.160> before<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.760> snaps<00:04:39.060> it's<00:04:39.570> all

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
that branch before it snaps it's all

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.960 
that branch before it snaps it's all
these<00:04:40.860> are<00:04:41.070> things<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.460> have<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.760> almost

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
these are things you have to almost

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.630 
these are things you have to almost
learn<00:04:42.450> over<00:04:42.780> years<00:04:43.050> by<00:04:43.440> feel<00:04:43.800> now<00:04:44.280> watch<00:04:44.460> me

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
learn over years by feel now watch me

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.880 
learn over years by feel now watch me
break<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.320> just<00:04:46.320> kidding

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
break it just kidding

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
bending it now I hope well I don't yeah

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.220 
bending it now I hope well I don't yeah
I<00:04:53.070> think<00:04:53.280> we<00:04:53.700> if<00:04:53.970> we<00:04:54.120> lose<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.360> trial<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:54.930> mean

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
I think we if we lose that trial I mean

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.909 
I think we if we lose that trial I mean
yeah<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.500> agree<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.669> have<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.090> injury<00:04:57.620> so<00:04:58.620> what

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
yeah I agree to have that injury so what

yeah I agree to have that injury so what
I've<00:04:59.040> done<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.460> now<00:04:59.640> made<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.419> too<00:05:00.660> high<00:05:00.870> you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
I've done is now made that too high you

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.100 
I've done is now made that too high you
have<00:05:01.290> an<00:05:01.560> option<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.490> either<00:05:03.120> wire<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:03.780> down

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
have an option to either wire that down

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.870 
have an option to either wire that down
which<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.530> don't<00:05:04.590> like<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:05.190> directly<00:05:05.640> under

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
which I don't like it directly under

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.560 
which I don't like it directly under
there<00:05:06.030> or<00:05:06.240> cut<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.720> off<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:09.120> it's<00:05:09.390> my

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
there or cut it off but that if it's my

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.600 
there or cut it off but that if it's my
tree<00:05:09.930> I<00:05:09.960> cut<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.530> off<00:05:10.590> but<00:05:11.100> I'm<00:05:11.340> going<00:05:11.580> to

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
tree I cut that off but I'm going to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
tree I cut that off but I'm going to
leave<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:12.000> up

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630

with their with their new presence so
that's<00:05:21.530> how<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.190> was<00:05:22.400> made<00:05:23.230> good<00:05:24.230> job<00:05:24.440> that's

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
that's how it was made good job that's

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.750 
that's how it was made good job that's
that's<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.310> really<00:05:25.670> fine<00:05:26.120> looking<00:05:26.450> bonsai<00:05:26.750> okay

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
that's a really fine looking bonsai okay

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.360 
that's a really fine looking bonsai okay
and<00:05:28.900> one<00:05:29.900> last<00:05:30.020> question<00:05:30.110> how<00:05:30.830> long<00:05:31.040> should

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
and one last question how long should

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.760 
and one last question how long should
this<00:05:31.490> remain<00:05:31.820> on<00:05:32.000> here<00:05:32.300> oh<00:05:32.540> good<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.470> good

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
this remain on here oh good a good

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.650 
this remain on here oh good a good
question<00:05:34.310> indeed<00:05:34.430> we<00:05:34.850> want<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.240> check<00:05:35.480> it

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
question indeed we want to check it

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.260 
question indeed we want to check it
often<00:05:36.170> so<00:05:36.890> that<00:05:36.920> the<00:05:37.190> wire<00:05:37.370> does<00:05:37.640> not<00:05:37.850> cut<00:05:38.090> into

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
often so that the wire does not cut into

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.200 
often so that the wire does not cut into
the<00:05:38.360> bark<00:05:39.190> by<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.250> way<00:05:40.430> I'll<00:05:40.580> trim<00:05:40.850> off<00:05:41.000> the

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
the bark by the way I'll trim off the

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.770 
the bark by the way I'll trim off the
excess<00:05:41.740> getting<00:05:42.740> ahead<00:05:42.950> of<00:05:43.010> myself<00:05:43.540> all<00:05:44.540> you

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
excess getting ahead of myself all you

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.660 
excess getting ahead of myself all you
do<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.050> just<00:05:45.230> unravel<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.040> a<00:05:46.070> bit<00:05:46.370> where

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
do is just unravel that a bit where

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.150 
do is just unravel that a bit where
where<00:05:46.970> it<00:05:47.090> is<00:05:47.240> if<00:05:47.990> you<00:05:48.230> don't<00:05:48.440> see<00:05:48.680> it<00:05:48.830> groove

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
where it is if you don't see it groove

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.830 
where it is if you don't see it groove
in<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.550> bark<00:05:49.790> in<00:05:50.030> other<00:05:50.210> words<00:05:50.360> if<00:05:50.510> it's<00:05:50.660> not

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
in the bark in other words if it's not

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.110 
in the bark in other words if it's not
cutting<00:05:51.140> in<00:05:51.440> it's<00:05:51.950> fine<00:05:52.250> to<00:05:52.400> leave<00:05:52.550> it<00:05:52.670> on<00:05:52.760> but

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
cutting in it's fine to leave it on but

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.120 
cutting in it's fine to leave it on but
if<00:05:53.420> you<00:05:53.540> start<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:53.960> see<00:05:54.170> groom<00:05:54.470> take<00:05:54.770> it<00:05:54.920> off

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
if you start to see groom take it off

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.550 
if you start to see groom take it off
and<00:05:55.700> if<00:05:55.940> it<00:05:56.120> didn't<00:05:56.450> set<00:05:56.720> if<00:05:56.840> it<00:05:56.990> pops<00:05:57.170> back

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
and if it didn't set if it pops back

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.550 
and if it didn't set if it pops back
slightly<00:05:57.950> rewire<00:05:58.670> it<00:05:58.850> again<00:05:59.090> just<00:06:00.020> change<00:06:00.350> the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
slightly rewire it again just change the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.010 
slightly rewire it again just change the
location<00:06:01.430> of<00:06:01.520> where<00:06:01.670> the<00:06:01.850> wires<00:06:02.060> on<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.390> and

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
location of where the wires on it and

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.320 
location of where the wires on it and
keep<00:06:03.350> keep<00:06:03.770> that<00:06:03.980> going<00:06:04.220> until<00:06:04.670> it<00:06:04.820> does<00:06:05.030> set

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
keep keep that going until it does set

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.220 
keep keep that going until it does set
but<00:06:05.890> normally<00:06:06.890> this<00:06:07.700> time<00:06:08.000> of<00:06:08.030> year<00:06:08.360> larysa

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
but normally this time of year larysa

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.840 
but normally this time of year larysa
are<00:06:09.500> different<00:06:10.010> from<00:06:10.160> other<00:06:10.310> plants<00:06:10.640> in<00:06:10.820> that

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
are different from other plants in that

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.030 
are different from other plants in that
they<00:06:11.120> grow<00:06:11.300> all<00:06:11.330> winter<00:06:11.750> so<00:06:12.080> with<00:06:12.860> the

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
they grow all winter so with the

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.010 
they grow all winter so with the
vigorous<00:06:13.430> growth<00:06:13.910> in<00:06:14.180> your<00:06:14.360> visual<00:06:14.630> set

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
vigorous growth in your visual set

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.720 
vigorous growth in your visual set
quickly<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.650> more<00:06:15.830> plants<00:06:16.280> growing<00:06:16.520> the

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
quickly the more plants growing the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.270 
quickly the more plants growing the
faster<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.300> accept<00:06:17.660> because<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:18.280> nutrients

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
faster the accept because the nutrients

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.890 
faster the accept because the nutrients
travel<00:06:19.730> up<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.000> bark<00:06:20.270> because<00:06:20.840> the

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
travel up the bark because the

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.890 
travel up the bark because the
chances<00:06:22.440> are<00:06:22.530> it'll<00:06:22.710> set<00:06:22.920> fairly<00:06:23.190> quickly

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
chances are it'll set fairly quickly

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.650 
chances are it'll set fairly quickly
three<00:06:24.900> weeks<00:06:25.140> a<00:06:25.320> month<00:06:25.350> something<00:06:25.890> like<00:06:26.040> that

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
three weeks a month something like that

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.830 
three weeks a month something like that
okay

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
okay

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.720 
okay
