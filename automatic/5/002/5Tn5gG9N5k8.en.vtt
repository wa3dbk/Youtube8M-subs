00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
everything up here it actually lights up

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
everything up here it actually lights up
all<00:00:31.650> LED<00:00:32.130> display<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> only<00:00:32.910> thing<00:00:33.030> that's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
all LED display the only thing that's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
all LED display the only thing that's
actually<00:00:33.480> physically<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.440> this

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
actually physically there is this this

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.580 
actually physically there is this this
circle<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.520> see<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:35.989> now<00:00:36.989> say<00:00:37.440> you're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
circle that you see here now say you're

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
circle that you see here now say you're
at<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> track<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.219> example<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:39.239> toggle

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
at the track for example you just toggle

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.229 
at the track for example you just toggle
over<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.559> left<00:00:40.710> hand<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
over right here with your left hand and

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.549 
over right here with your left hand and
you<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.540> your<00:00:42.899> different<00:00:43.079> settings

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you have all your different settings

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.830 
you have all your different settings
here<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.120> example<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.629> rep<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
here so for example you have a rep in

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.010 
here so for example you have a rep in
decatur<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.530> revin<00:00:47.460> decatur<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.030> located

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
decatur which revin decatur is located

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.940 
decatur which revin decatur is located
right<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> steering<00:00:49.500> wheel<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
right here on the steering wheel so this

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.040 
right here on the steering wheel so this
will<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> flashing<00:00:50.670> light<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.239> whatever

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
will be a flashing light so whatever

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.819 
will be a flashing light so whatever
rpmi<00:00:52.770> i<00:00:52.800> deem<00:00:53.750> suitable<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.110> me<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.649> will

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
rpmi i deem suitable for me it will

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.290 
rpmi i deem suitable for me it will
actually<00:00:55.980> flash<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.789> me<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.059> let<00:00:57.149> me<00:00:57.270> know

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
actually flash for me to let me know

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.650 
actually flash for me to let me know
it's<00:00:57.570> time<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.899> shift<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.460> it's<00:01:00.120> another<00:01:00.329> way

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's time to shift so it's another way

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's time to shift so it's another way
