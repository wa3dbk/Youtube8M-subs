definitely tell you that the lawn in the
11<00:02:12.300> inch<00:02:12.450> scale<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
11 inch scale of this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.449

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
boy has painted eyes this one does not I

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.400 
boy has painted eyes this one does not I
think<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.239> was<00:02:18.269> originally<00:02:18.810> planned<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.200> have

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
think it was originally planned to have

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.240 
think it was originally planned to have
painted<00:02:19.830> eyes<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.569> they<00:02:21.569> last<00:02:22.080> minute<00:02:22.530> did<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
painted eyes but they last minute did a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.540 
painted eyes but they last minute did a
change<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.720> looks<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.379> side<00:02:28.560> on

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
change so it looks like on the side on

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.040 
change so it looks like on the side on
the<00:02:29.819> other<00:02:29.970> side<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.680> bottom<00:02:32.840> kind<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> has

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
the other side on the bottom kind of has

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.070 
the other side on the bottom kind of has

which day this whole piece pops off
right<00:02:54.390> there<00:02:54.920> very<00:02:55.920> realistic-looking

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
right there very realistic-looking

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.289 
right there very realistic-looking
turtle<00:02:58.170> shell<00:02:58.940> that's<00:02:59.940> pretty<00:03:00.150> cool<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.940> pops

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
turtle shell that's pretty cool it pops

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.330

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.550 
and then you put them in his hands like
that<00:03:24.980> they're<00:03:25.980> kinda<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.430> there<00:03:26.639> one<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:26.970> them

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
that they're kinda in there one of them

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.110 
that they're kinda in there one of them
it<00:03:28.560> holds<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.980> tightly<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.730> other<00:03:29.850> one's

a little bit loose but they're rubbery

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.870 
a little bit loose but they're rubbery
plastic<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.319> hands<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:37.340> can<00:03:38.340> kinda<00:03:38.790> if

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880

opposed to this one that's it's a turtle
it's<00:04:38.610> got<00:04:38.790> muscles<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:40.320> that's<00:04:40.470> something

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
it's got muscles so that's something

and<00:04:44.130> down<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:46.440> articulation<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:47.550> it

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
and down and the articulation is it

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.840 
and down and the articulation is it
moves<00:04:47.880> forward<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.660> back<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:50.520> kind<00:04:50.760> of

turns has a little bit of a swivel but

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.010 
turns has a little bit of a swivel but
that's<00:04:54.090> due<00:04:54.420> to<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:55.440> piece<00:04:55.740> being<00:04:55.950> here<00:04:57.020> kind

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
that's due to this piece being here kind

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.790 
that's due to this piece being here kind
of<00:04:58.110> swivels<00:04:58.560> but<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.250> doesn't<00:05:00.020> lose<00:05:01.020> backwards

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
I guess if you had if you laid on a

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.690 
I guess if you had if you laid on a
shelf<00:06:27.300> like<00:06:27.660> that<00:06:27.900> you<00:06:28.080> could<00:06:28.260> do<00:06:28.380> that<00:06:28.700> it

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
shelf like that you could do that it

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.960

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
would be no big deal and you can get him

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.170 
would be no big deal and you can get him
