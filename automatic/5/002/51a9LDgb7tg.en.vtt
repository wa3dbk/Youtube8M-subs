and they kept bringing paper cut down to
very<00:00:22.949> low<00:00:23.160> health<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.449> might<00:00:24.600> try

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
very low health but you they might try

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.060 
very low health but you they might try
and<00:00:24.900> switch<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.140> up<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.740> might<00:00:25.890> try

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and switch it up a bit they might try

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279 
and switch it up a bit they might try
and<00:00:26.220> open<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.699> inflamed<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> wait<00:00:28.199> until

and open up on inflamed and wait until

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.740 
and open up on inflamed and wait until
paper<00:00:28.650> caps<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.160> zerker<00:00:29.550> before<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.000> unleash

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
paper caps in zerker before they unleash

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.840 
paper caps in zerker before they unleash
their<00:00:31.410> damage<00:00:31.710> onto<00:00:31.890> him<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.099> go<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.730> that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
their damage onto him and go for that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.270 
their damage onto him and go for that
frostbite<00:00:33.480> combo<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> kidney<00:00:35.070> shot

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
frostbite combo with the kidney shot

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.190 
frostbite combo with the kidney shot
yeah<00:00:35.610> we'll<00:00:35.850> see<00:00:36.030> where<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.989> case

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
yeah we'll see where that is the case

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.410 
yeah we'll see where that is the case
but<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> course<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.190> mean<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.700> tunnel<00:00:39.059> vision

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
but of course I mean a tunnel vision

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.590 
but of course I mean a tunnel vision
tactics<00:00:40.129> are<00:00:41.129> quite<00:00:41.430> good<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> same<00:00:42.329> time

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
tactics are quite good at the same time

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.619 
tactics are quite good at the same time
but<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:44.190> time<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.000> second

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
but you know one time you do it second

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
but you know one time you do it second
time<00:00:45.840> probably<00:00:46.350> won't<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.910> capable

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
time probably won't be as a as capable

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
time probably won't be as a as capable
so<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.840> following<00:00:49.050> happy<00:00:49.289> Minty's<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.770> can

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so just following happy Minty's you can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
see him scouting around the outside

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
trying to look for the druid everybody

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
trying to look for the druid everybody
has<00:00:53.550> actually<00:00:53.910> popped<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> center<00:00:54.870> in

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
has actually popped into the center in

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
has actually popped into the center in
comes<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.379> instant<00:00:55.829> intervene<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
comes an instant intervene then on to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
comes an instant intervene then on to
care<00:00:58.170> koala<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.859> means<00:00:59.039> he<00:00:59.160> doesn't<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
care koala that means he doesn't have to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.610 
care koala that means he doesn't have to
use<00:00:59.910> an<00:01:00.059> intercept<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.989> also<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.530> have

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
use an intercept but also could have

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.130 
use an intercept but also could have
potentially<00:01:01.890> stopped<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> cheap<00:01:02.879> shot<00:01:03.140> knotts

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
potentially stopped a cheap shot knotts

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
potentially stopped a cheap shot knotts
not<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> case<00:01:04.979> though<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.489> we're

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
not going to be the case though so we're

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
not going to be the case though so we're
