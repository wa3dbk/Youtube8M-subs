00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 knows these things that the galley invents 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.200
 about videogames 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.809
 these rumors myths and such then a time 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240
 ago I made a video talking about it 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.700
 big rumors and lies that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 happened in my childhood and how 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.680
 many of you have asked is there 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 second part of the rumors I've heard 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 already leaves your like in the video and there it goes 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.519
 one of the things that disappointed me most 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.550
 in the games was to know that he did not have the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.670
 super sonik no sony that one if you do not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 You know the super sonik was just showing up at the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.550
 second franchise game I listened to many 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.980
 people talking about the supersonic 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.770
 in the first game a secret character 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 that you had to be so often the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.320
 game for him to appear but it was pure 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.850
 The truth is that he only went to the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.850
 appear in the second game 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.310
 and the devil only by name 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.490
 the galley already created mysteries myths and such 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.890
 saying that the game was cursed that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.000
 you could not install the game on your 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.280
 computer 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.770
 another lie to fool the kid 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:32.600
 also used by parents not to leave 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:35.000
 You play this game of good soba I 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.910
 also had a legend saying that the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.910
 was the cattle that he ate the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.950
 mushroom and got high so I thought 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.560
 that was larger is not meaningful or 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.530
 It makes sense and will not know a legend. 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.850
 very famous is that of the great father in gta 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.369
 san andreas 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.550
 the rumor said you could find 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.700
 that big fish in the game forests 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.860
 during the night and it's a lie so much 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.080
 if you want to know more about these 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.840
 legends and myths of gta san andreas 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.209
 close in the description a video of the fiasco 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.700
 games that talks about this subject 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.580
 Another bizarre rumor was that if you 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.600
 lost in the deadly kombat 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.940
 You 'd have nightmares, that's it. 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.950
 to put even logical fear because the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.950
 he was very much robbed 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.930
 finally leave your comment 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.510
 talking about what legends and motorcycles you

 You heard about the games and leaves 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.730
