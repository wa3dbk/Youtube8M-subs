show but with this style what I don't we
do<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.900> take<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.320> hair<00:01:58.619> into<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.130> few

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
do is I take the hair into a few

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.550 
do is I take the hair into a few
sections<00:01:59.580> so<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.900> top<00:02:01.140> will<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.440> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
sections so this the top will be the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
sections so this the top will be the
normal<00:02:01.860> curling<00:02:02.159> awaiting<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:02.759> would<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
normal curling awaiting I would do the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.540 
normal curling awaiting I would do the
roots<00:02:03.750> separately<00:02:04.290> each<00:02:04.500> kill<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.369> well

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
roots separately each kill this as well

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.910 
roots separately each kill this as well
but<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.540> leave<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.229> straightener<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
but I leave the straightener on for a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.740 
but I leave the straightener on for a
little<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.130> longer<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.940> twisting<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
little bit longer so when twisting the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.660 
little bit longer so when twisting the
roots<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.229> sort<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> slow<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.860> down<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.489> what

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
roots this sort of slow it down so what

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
roots this sort of slow it down so what
that<00:02:11.760> does<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.209> gives<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.630> like<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:13.020> bit<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.350> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that does it gives it like a bit of a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530 
that does it gives it like a bit of a
kink<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> nice<00:02:14.760> switch<00:02:15.360> off

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
kink and then like a nice switch off

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.000 
kink and then like a nice switch off
you'll<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.080> mean<00:02:16.230> when<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.500> actually

do my hair it's a little bit um

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.960 
do my hair it's a little bit um
difficult<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.650> explain<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.459> well<00:02:20.640> isn't<00:02:20.850> this

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
difficult to explain and well isn't this

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.690 
difficult to explain and well isn't this
close<00:02:22.459> alright

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
close alright

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.660 
close alright
and<00:02:24.540> sorry<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> way<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.350> do<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.980> twist<00:02:26.519> it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and sorry the way I do it is I twist it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.470 
and sorry the way I do it is I twist it
backwards<00:02:27.570> not<00:02:28.470> forwards<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.370> think<00:02:29.670> my

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
backwards not forwards and I think my

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.140 
backwards not forwards and I think my
other<00:02:30.630> video<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.989> twisted<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.440> forward<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.150> found

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
other video I twisted it forward I found

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.699 
other video I twisted it forward I found
that<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.420> liked<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.870> twist<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.170> backwards<00:02:34.380> more

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
that I liked it twist it backwards more

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.040 
that I liked it twist it backwards more
also<00:02:35.160> because<00:02:35.640> then<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.390> hair<00:02:36.630> all<00:02:36.750> like

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
also because then the hair all like

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.320 
also because then the hair all like
hooks<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.560> itself<00:02:38.000> backwards<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.209> goes

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
hooks on itself backwards and it goes

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.330 
hooks on itself backwards and it goes
like<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:42.380> because<00:02:43.380> my<00:02:43.410> camera<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.950> giving<00:02:44.160> me

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
like that because my camera is giving me

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.970 
like that because my camera is giving me
issues<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.480> making<00:02:46.050> my<00:02:46.260> life<00:02:46.410> hot<00:02:46.650> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
stops every 6 or 7 seconds so I'm just

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.140

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
so it's a little bit wavy now this took

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.069 
so it's a little bit wavy now this took
about<00:03:07.170> maybe<00:03:07.680> about<00:03:08.090> 10<00:03:09.090> minutes<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.690> guess<00:03:09.870> as

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
about maybe about 10 minutes I guess as

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.660 
about maybe about 10 minutes I guess as
you<00:03:10.440> can<00:03:10.590> see<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.860> produces<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.370> really

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
you can see this produces a really

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.500 
you can see this produces a really
bouncy<00:03:12.239> really<00:03:12.690> volumize<00:03:13.200> set<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.070> hair

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
amazingly high the height that it gives

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.490 
amazingly high the height that it gives
me<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:18.000> incredible<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.750> fourth<00:03:18.959> step<00:03:19.260> which
