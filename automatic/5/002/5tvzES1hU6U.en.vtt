really work correctly you kind of need

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.719 
really work correctly you kind of need
to<00:01:14.729> use<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> light<00:01:15.590> pressure<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.460> get

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to use a light pressure with this to get

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.820 
to use a light pressure with this to get
the<00:01:17.970> fullest<00:01:18.509> effect<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.409> doing<00:01:19.619> is

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the fullest effect what this is doing is

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.980

it's not spinning and it's not

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.160 
it's not spinning and it's not
exfoliating<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.420> flexing<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.840> poor

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
