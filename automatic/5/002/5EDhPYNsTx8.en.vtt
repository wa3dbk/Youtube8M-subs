00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
place block the dirt underneath em can

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.440 
place block the dirt underneath em can
you<00:03:39.840> see<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.080> yeah<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.950> randomly<00:03:41.849> what's<00:03:42.360> a

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
you see that yeah just randomly what's a

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.080 
you see that yeah just randomly what's a
dope<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:44.370> an<00:03:44.489> effective<00:03:44.670> way<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
dope of it so it's an effective way it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.080 
dope of it so it's an effective way it
works<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.629> yet<00:03:46.110> resources<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.830> much

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
works and yet resources so much

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.790 
works and yet resources so much
okay<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:51.240> he<00:03:52.240> gets<00:03:52.630> all<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.350> different<00:03:53.620> kinds

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
okay and he gets all the different kinds
