00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.239
 not that we ask ourselves the question 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.239
 it is grenoble launched 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.069
 Paris is 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:15.179
 it's a football match ed 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.749
 to say that grenoble 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:17.980
 frankly 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.980
 unhappy child in many parts they played 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.359
 the action is just 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.759
 grenoble 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.759
 has no win on the clock 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.109
 we did a little 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.540
 goal against saint-etienne we had to win 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.810
 and the coach has us and this only 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.710
 in his speech of the cairo it was necessary to remain mobilized and concentrated 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.920
 for the city we have because we know that 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 do not fall into the ease this post is concentrated applied 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.499
 you have to take it 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.500
 like a football match 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.660
 in the game to bring poor opportunities 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.200
 to have them scored and paid every time we do not have 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.660
 the fabian balloon worked the facade well 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.190
 I think it's a game that exhausts no voice a door in that sense and 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.909
 not in the sense of a door won when 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.909
 grenoble they lost their first 11 games 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.180
 it's a team like any other 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.460
 to take would be social 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.490
 as soon as I take it very seriously at the base have never produced at the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.490
 light but well we'll say that statistics do not speak for them 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.980
 then for the request on a good pass on the other hand the good 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.509
 mentality bardet 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 their team the three starters already be single workout to apply 28 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.320
 euros who that on the ground 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.730
 also the duty to react by for him this commune to undergo bordeaux 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 but this defeat 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.660
 possibility of a 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.230
 we have to move forward and to move forward is to gain weight 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 we aim at the top of the painting 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.110
 I'm happy to see that because the technical staff 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.650
 that the players are motivated and that we are all motivated 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.380
 to go forward 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.660
 then 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.900
 this is a guarantee 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.500
 of his name continues to exist and that through the three points that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.859
 continues to advance 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.269
 I was more 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.289
 more virulent kind it's this week that 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.739
 than last week h because m 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.260
 it's true that the game I want involved players involved and 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.579
 applied in 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.939
 in all minds 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.939
 after the match happened as it happens but we must prepare it well 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.169
 the matches the faithful made obvious need that 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.680
 that offers apple won 1 to 0 against them 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.639
 this is not won 8 01 comment suite this lack 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.639
 what can we pass through grenoble but what do I mean these 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.140
 repressions that it is a Lorraine team in this type of good teams 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.910
 on the lookout for good matches was not very lucky at least we could 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.659
 say so all 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.179
 the newspaper will I hope this makes sense the morning after if all
