00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.029
 today in the channel how is it done we are going to 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.519
 prepare a rich lemon ice cream for 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.799
 these hot days then let's see 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.760
 the ingredients that we are going to use and 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.980
 I have milk and this we will use 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.689
 to create buttermilk we're going 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.970
 to see below you 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.880
 demonstrating the lemons in cream 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.880
 Sour or sour cream I'll leave the link 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.890
 of sugar and cream we will prepare the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.350
 recipe 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.980
 first of all let's use the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.760
 mixer or utensil that you have and 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.550
 we pour the liquid cream and that's how it goes 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.100
 forming the whipped cream we are going to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.190
 preparing whey for it 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.870
 we pour the milk in a saucepan and as you see 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.290
 here I have some lemons that we are going to 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.780
 squeeze and mix the lemons with the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.699
 milk in this way we break the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.620
 milk molecules and we will make a 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.839
 separation between the serum which is what 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.869
 we seek and what would be the 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.090
 milk cream form a kind 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.700
 of cottage cheese that we can also 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.560
 get it mixed a bit slowly 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.350
 a few seconds so everything is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.310
 homogeneous and we will leave at rest about 5 o 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.509
 10 minutes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.070
 as we see the curd has been broken and it has 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.260
 separated the floor of the requexÃ³n 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.590
 we can leave it for a moment in the fridge 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.840
 and then we will strain 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.549
 I have already cast it here as we will see here 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.320
 it would be a cottage cheese that we can 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.960
 consume in the morning with a little 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.920
 honey or with jam and here we have the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.799
 whey 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.270
 I'm thinking that I have enough 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.369
 gives the surplus weight 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.829
 and then we will continue with the recipe 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.070
 We mix the lemon juice with the 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.920
 milk soil we remove this well 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.210
 they are always repetitive steps but not 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.240
 However, I repeat it 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.520
 and now we also have cream here or 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.520
 sour cream that we also mix 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.220
 the sugar 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.640
 and we have incorporating and removing 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.510
 so all the ingredients then 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.510
 are well mixed 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.180
 as we see we are doing a series of 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.870
 classic ice cream and then later 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.069
 We do more elaborate ice cream 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.499
 these that 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.840
 come out the photographs that are very 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.879
 spectacular 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.860
 well we have already mixed everything then 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.319
 we would only lack what would be the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.739
 whipped cream let's mix the scales 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.739
 mounted 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.400
 and we are also going to move everything 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.410
 and then we practically have all 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.810
 the mixture would only be missing 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.620
 Mixer mix it and pass it to the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.390
 refrigerator 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.090
 As all the ingredients were 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 cold because you do not need to cool the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.710
 product directly we can put it 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.680
 in the refrigerator 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.800
 optionally I have picked the shells from 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.890
 lemon and I have chopped them for it with a 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.400
 I cut the knife 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.860
 skin of the lemon and then titleholder 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.080
 the title as we see here on the plate 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.110
 and when they pass about 10 or 12 minutes what 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.810
 we will put inside the refrigerator 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.850
 and those ten or twelve minutes have passed and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.400
 now let's put 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.470
 this titled lemon skin 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.000
 lemon but this solution to the however 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.520
 if you do, you will be very happy 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.650
 Well, here we have the age or 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.450
 creamy 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.209
 now we would only be left 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.230
 put it in a tupper and then pass it 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.230
 to the freezer 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.490
 the tongue of the cat itself we can 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.190
 measure in a tupper 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.110
 As you can see, it looks very rich and I 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.110
 I've already tried it and it's dead 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.700
 then we did a little bit of it and 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.870
 to the freezer and here we have the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:18.139
 final result 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.139
 I leave the ingredients and see you soon
