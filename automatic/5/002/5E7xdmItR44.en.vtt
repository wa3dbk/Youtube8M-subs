for<00:02:01.229> an<00:02:01.290> everyday<00:02:01.469> carry<00:02:01.770> especially<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
for an everyday carry especially on a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.399 
for an everyday carry especially on a
larger<00:02:02.939> blade<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:04.170> definitely

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
larger blade like that that's definitely

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.950 
larger blade like that that's definitely
a<00:02:04.710> pro<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.340> also<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.240> setup<00:02:06.570> where<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
a pro I also like this setup where the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
a pro I also like this setup where the
buttons<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.619> top<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> safety<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.700> on

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
buttons on the top and the safety is on

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.910 
buttons on the top and the safety is on
the<00:02:08.910> bottom<00:02:09.330> sometimes<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.530> think<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the bottom sometimes I think it's a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.170 
the bottom sometimes I think it's a
little<00:02:11.069> bit<00:02:11.190> quicker<00:02:11.370> where<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:11.970> pull

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
little bit quicker where you can pull

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.089 
little bit quicker where you can pull
this<00:02:12.330> down<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
this down and

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.160 
this down and
instead<00:02:13.939> of<00:02:14.030> having<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.420> pull<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:14.810> safety

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
instead of having to pull the safety

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
instead of having to pull the safety
down<00:02:15.319> if<00:02:15.499> it's<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.799> here<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.189> then<00:02:16.310> push<00:02:16.670> it's

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
down if it's up here and then push it's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.399 
down if it's up here and then push it's
kind<00:02:17.299> of<00:02:17.329> a<00:02:17.420> two<00:02:17.569> part<00:02:17.599> of<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.139> can<00:02:18.260> kind

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
kind of a two part of this you can kind

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.890 
kind of a two part of this you can kind
of<00:02:18.439> do<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:18.799> motion<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.459> really<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.599> that

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
of do in one motion I really like that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.369 
of do in one motion I really like that
like<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.950> design<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:23.659> the<00:02:23.840> new<00:02:23.959> redesign

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
like the design I like the new redesign

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.920 
like the design I like the new redesign
of<00:02:24.409> the<00:02:24.620> blade<00:02:24.829> with<00:02:25.609> the<00:02:25.639> steeper<00:02:26.540> thumb<00:02:26.719> ramp

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
of the blade with the steeper thumb ramp

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.550 
of the blade with the steeper thumb ramp
here<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.439> think<00:02:28.430> that's<00:02:28.609> a<00:02:28.700> nice<00:02:28.819> redesign<00:02:29.560> or

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
here I think that's a nice redesign or

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.959 
here I think that's a nice redesign or
addition<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.129> mean<00:02:31.340> they're<00:02:31.489> still<00:02:31.670> gonna<00:02:31.790> make

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
addition I mean they're still gonna make

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.160 
addition I mean they're still gonna make
the<00:02:32.120> other<00:02:32.269> sock<00:02:32.599> tacks<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:32.989> my

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
the other sock tacks for my

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.110 
the other sock tacks for my
understanding<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.250> don't<00:02:34.760> know<00:02:34.819> if<00:02:34.909> it's<00:02:35.030> an

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
understanding so I don't know if it's an

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.539 
understanding so I don't know if it's an
actual<00:02:35.450> redesign<00:02:35.900> another<00:02:36.170> Pro<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.829> that<00:02:37.099> you

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
actual redesign another Pro is that you

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.250 
actual redesign another Pro is that you
can<00:02:37.730> never<00:02:37.969> move<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.389> pocket<00:02:38.719> clip<00:02:38.959> and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
can never move the pocket clip and

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.949 
can never move the pocket clip and
switch<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.430> other<00:02:40.549> side<00:02:40.939> really<00:02:41.719> like

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
switch it to the other side really like

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.379 
switch it to the other side really like
that<00:02:42.079> pocket<00:02:42.439> clip<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.799> cons<00:02:43.069> for<00:02:43.370> me<00:02:44.109> I<00:02:46.389> don't

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
that pocket clip the cons for me I don't

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.970 
that pocket clip the cons for me I don't
know<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:47.569> really<00:02:47.810> having<00:02:48.079> cons<00:02:48.409> I<00:02:48.709> guess<00:02:48.859> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
know if really having cons I guess the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.649 
know if really having cons I guess the
only<00:02:49.069> con<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.849> not<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.389> really<00:02:50.629> a

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
only con is it's not this is really a

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.240 
only con is it's not this is really a
