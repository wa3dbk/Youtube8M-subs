they have several good reviews online
and<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> was<00:00:33.050> having<00:00:34.050> high<00:00:34.290> expectations

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
recommend it for sure

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.560 
recommend it for sure
so<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.739> said<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> 4G<00:00:45.059> cell<00:00:45.390> phone

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so like I said this is a 4G cell phone

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.529 
so like I said this is a 4G cell phone
booster<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.250> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> large

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
booster and this is for the large

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.889 
booster and this is for the large
building<00:00:49.460> complete<00:00:50.460> coverage<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> house<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
building complete coverage for a house I

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.389 
building complete coverage for a house I
think<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.920> said<00:00:53.129> about<00:00:53.840> 5000<00:00:54.840> square<00:00:54.930> feet<00:00:55.399> but

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
think it said about 5000 square feet but

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.709 
think it said about 5000 square feet but
of<00:00:56.610> course<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.000> all<00:00:57.120> dependent<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.570> your

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
of course that's all dependent on your

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.640 
of course that's all dependent on your
terrain<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:59.600> how<00:01:00.600> structure<00:01:01.079> etc<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.430> anyway

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
terrain and how structure etc but anyway

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.200 
terrain and how structure etc but anyway
inside<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> our<00:01:04.920> house<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:06.240> usually<00:01:07.020> had

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
inside of our house we have usually had

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.950 
inside of our house we have usually had
about<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:10.850> no<00:01:11.850> more<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.240> two<00:01:12.420> bars<00:01:12.659> though

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
about one no more than two bars though

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.710 
about one no more than two bars though
if<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.229> lucky<00:01:13.409> two<00:01:13.710> bars<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.159> 4G<00:01:14.720> there's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
if you're lucky two bars of 4G there's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.929 
if you're lucky two bars of 4G there's
only<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.140> tower<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.890> covers<00:01:17.189> our<00:01:17.340> town<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
our old DirecTV or dish system to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
our old DirecTV or dish system to
DirecTV<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:54.350> old<00:01:55.350> rg6<00:01:56.159> cabling<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.640> we're

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
DirecTV had old rg6 cabling that we're

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
DirecTV had old rg6 cabling that we're
already<00:01:57.899> ran<00:01:58.049> into<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> house<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.520> were

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
already ran into the house now we were

already ran into the house now we were
able<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.909> reuse<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.229> worked<00:02:01.409> out

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
able to reuse and so that worked out

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.660 
able to reuse and so that worked out
perfectly

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.180 

and<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.500> standard<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:08.979> they

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
and so that's the standard that they

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.810 
and so that's the standard that they
want<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.580> use<00:02:09.640> for<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.920> as<00:02:12.040> much<00:02:12.220> loss<00:02:12.490> in

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
want you to use for not as much loss in

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.540 
want you to use for not as much loss in
the<00:02:13.420> cable<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:15.310> worked<00:02:15.520> out<00:02:15.640> beautiful

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
the cable so that worked out beautiful

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.310 
the cable so that worked out beautiful
it's<00:02:18.550> kind<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.940> shooting<00:02:19.450> into<00:02:20.140> some<00:02:20.320> trees<00:02:22.320> so

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
it's kind of shooting into some trees so

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's kind of shooting into some trees so
I<00:02:24.150> didn't<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.330> want<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.600> up<00:02:25.750> any

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.670 
I didn't really want to get up any
higher<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:27.280> super<00:02:28.150> impressed<00:02:28.570> with<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.140> how

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.250 
higher but super impressed with just how
far<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.370> how<00:02:30.400> well<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.420> able<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.750> grab<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
far and how well it's able to grab the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.020 
far and how well it's able to grab the
signal<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.740> bring<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.070> inside<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.610> I'll<00:02:33.850> show

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
signal and bring it inside so I'll show

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.980 
signal and bring it inside so I'll show
you<00:02:34.060> where<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.760> cable<00:02:36.760> goes<00:02:36.940> into<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.750> attic

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
you where the cable goes into the attic

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.300 
you where the cable goes into the attic
and<00:02:38.260> then<00:02:38.350> where<00:02:38.470> we<00:02:38.560> have<00:02:38.680> our<00:02:38.800> access<00:02:39.070> point

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and then where we have our access point

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.940 
and then where we have our access point
and<00:02:39.459> I'll<00:02:39.520> talk<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.880> little<00:02:39.970> bit<00:02:40.209> more<00:02:40.360> about<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.260 

all<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.220> we're<00:02:45.370> inside<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.760> attic<00:02:46.060> and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
all right so we're inside the attic and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.229 
all right so we're inside the attic and
right<00:02:46.989> out<00:02:47.140> here<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.709> tower<00:02:48.209> where<00:02:49.209> I

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
right out here is the tower where I

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.850 
right out here is the tower where I
showed<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.930> has<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.230> intent<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.590> it

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
showed you it has the intent on it

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.590 
showed you it has the intent on it
the<00:02:51.070> cable<00:02:51.459> runs<00:02:51.670> inside<00:02:52.060> here<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.709> over<00:02:53.709> here

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
the cable runs inside here and over here

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.070 
the cable runs inside here and over here
to<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.900> box<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:56.650> have<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.130> Attic<00:02:57.370> so

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
to the box that we have in the Attic so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.910 
to the box that we have in the Attic so
this<00:02:59.080> thing<00:02:59.290> amplifies<00:02:59.830> all<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.030> major

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
this thing amplifies all of the major

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.430 
this thing amplifies all of the major
frequencies<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:04.690> green<00:03:04.959> lives<00:03:05.140> means

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
frequencies for green lives means

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.199 
frequencies for green lives means
everything's<00:03:05.830> working<00:03:06.280> operational<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.880> not

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
everything's working operational and not

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.460 
everything's working operational and not
getting<00:03:07.570> any<00:03:07.720> interference<00:03:08.260> from<00:03:08.320> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
getting any interference from the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.960 
getting any interference from the
outside<00:03:08.590> antenna<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:10.360> box<00:03:10.870> does<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.470> some

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
outside antenna this box does have some

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.640 
outside antenna this box does have some
pretty<00:03:12.970> expensive<00:03:13.239> circuitry<00:03:13.959> in<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.170> that

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
pretty expensive circuitry in it that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.380 
pretty expensive circuitry in it that
will<00:03:15.239> alert<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.420> if<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:18.340> inside<00:03:18.820> antenna<00:03:19.120> is

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
will alert you if the inside antenna is

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.789 
will alert you if the inside antenna is
receiving<00:03:19.840> too<00:03:19.959> much<00:03:20.110> interference<00:03:20.380> from<00:03:20.739> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
receiving too much interference from the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.820 
receiving too much interference from the
outside<00:03:20.890> antenna<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.850> will<00:03:22.000> shut<00:03:22.239> down

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
outside antenna and it will shut down

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.240 
outside antenna and it will shut down
this<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:26.110> way<00:03:26.260> you'll<00:03:26.410> be<00:03:26.500> able<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.920> not

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
this and that way you'll be able to not

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.190 
this and that way you'll be able to not
damage<00:03:27.459> any<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.200> amplification

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
damage any of the amplification

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.920 
damage any of the amplification
circuitry<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.330> we<00:03:31.480> just<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
circuitry in this so we just have the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.500 
circuitry in this so we just have the
outside<00:03:32.739> antenna<00:03:32.950> running<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.640> the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
outside antenna running in and the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.449 
outside antenna running in and the
inside<00:03:34.810> one<00:03:35.049> running<00:03:35.799> over<00:03:35.980> there<00:03:36.130> which<00:03:36.310> I'll

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
inside one running over there which I'll

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.710 
inside one running over there which I'll
show<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:36.700> in<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.299> moment<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:38.950> by<00:03:39.640> default<00:03:39.820> it

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
show you in a moment but by default it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.900 
show you in a moment but by default it
comes<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.230> believe<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.709> highest<00:03:42.280> settings

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
comes I believe on the highest settings

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.910 
comes I believe on the highest settings
and<00:03:43.150> then<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.320> event<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.680> you're<00:03:44.799> not

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
and then in the event that you're not

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.710 
and then in the event that you're not
getting<00:03:45.100> enough<00:03:45.310> distance<00:03:45.910> both<00:03:46.150> vertically

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
getting enough distance both vertically

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.300 
getting enough distance both vertically
and<00:03:46.750> horizontally<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.620> you're<00:03:48.190> getting

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
and horizontally and you're getting

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.310 
and horizontally and you're getting
interference<00:03:48.640> you'll<00:03:49.570> be<00:03:49.720> able<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.930> turn<00:03:50.110> down

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
interference you'll be able to turn down

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.440 
interference you'll be able to turn down
the<00:03:50.500> gain<00:03:50.709> settings<00:03:51.150> on<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.660> unit<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:54.450> it's

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
the gain settings on this unit but it's

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.840 
the gain settings on this unit but it's
up<00:03:55.660> high<00:03:55.840> enough<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.350> far<00:03:57.160> enough<00:03:57.370> vertically

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
up high enough and far enough vertically

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.240 
up high enough and far enough vertically
that<00:03:58.030> we<00:03:58.269> haven't<00:03:58.720> had<00:03:58.810> any<00:03:58.989> issues<00:03:59.079> so<00:03:59.290> been

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
that we haven't had any issues so been

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.120 
that we haven't had any issues so been
very<00:04:00.519> pleased<00:04:00.940> with<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:02.709> does<00:04:02.920> get<00:04:03.100> a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
very pleased with this it does get a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.030 
very pleased with this it does get a
little<00:04:03.190> warm<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.690> we'll<00:04:04.840> see<00:04:05.019> how<00:04:05.200> if<00:04:05.560> that's

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
little warm so we'll see how if that's

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.590 
little warm so we'll see how if that's
going<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.250> pose<00:04:06.430> any<00:04:06.640> problems<00:04:07.000> in<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.299> future

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
going to pose any problems in the future

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.089 
going to pose any problems in the future
but

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.509 

so<00:04:12.099> here's<00:04:12.340> where<00:04:12.489> we<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.939> antenna<00:04:13.810> and

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
so here's where we have the antenna and

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.650 
so here's where we have the antenna and
they<00:04:15.519> recommend<00:04:15.970> if<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.150> don't<00:04:16.299> want<00:04:16.449> to<00:04:16.509> run

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
they recommend if you don't want to run

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.590 
they recommend if you don't want to run
it<00:04:16.780> cable<00:04:17.259> inside<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.190> can<00:04:18.370> put<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.699> face

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
it cable inside that you can put it face

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.499 
it cable inside that you can put it face
down<00:04:19.979> over<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.250> area<00:04:21.609> maybe<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.060> middle<00:04:22.389> of

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:22.509 
down over the area maybe the middle of

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.629 
down over the area maybe the middle of
the<00:04:22.570> house<00:04:22.690> where<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.020> want<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.919> best<00:04:24.310> signal

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
the house where you want the best signal

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.810 
the house where you want the best signal
and<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:26.320> did<00:04:26.470> have<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.800> inside<00:04:27.160> but<00:04:27.400> actually

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
and we did have it inside but actually

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.840 
and we did have it inside but actually
found<00:04:28.030> that<00:04:28.240> having<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:29.350> up<00:04:29.919> here<00:04:30.430> we<00:04:30.699> would

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
found that having it up here we would

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.469 
found that having it up here we would
receive<00:04:31.240> better<00:04:31.530> signal<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.270> wanted

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
receive better signal so I just wanted

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.439 
receive better signal so I just wanted

time happen to run some cabling anyway

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.390 
time happen to run some cabling anyway
like<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.550> said<00:05:24.580> this<00:05:24.909> is<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.300> Wilson<00:05:26.020> DB<00:05:26.440> Pro<00:05:26.770> 4G

that like I said before if I was lucky I

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.580 
that like I said before if I was lucky I
would<00:06:18.039> be<00:06:18.190> two<00:06:18.610> bars<00:06:18.820> in<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.210> house<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.750> maybe

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.420 
would be two bars in the house and maybe
one<00:06:21.070> bar<00:06:21.279> in<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.820> basement<00:06:22.210> if<00:06:22.300> I<00:06:22.389> was<00:06:22.510> like

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
one bar in the basement if I was like

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.250 
one bar in the basement if I was like
most<00:06:24.820> times<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.240> wouldn't<00:06:25.660> even<00:06:25.780> get<00:06:25.960> one<00:06:26.080> bar

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
most times I wouldn't even get one bar

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.070 
most times I wouldn't even get one bar
in<00:06:26.350> the<00:06:26.410> basement<00:06:26.910> so<00:06:27.910> now<00:06:28.540> having<00:06:28.870> this

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
in the basement so now having this

in the basement so now having this
installed<00:06:29.470> it's<00:06:29.950> improved<00:06:30.250> my<00:06:30.340> signal<00:06:30.820> to

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
play around with the antenna much

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.630 
play around with the antenna much
especially<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.740> inside<00:06:47.980> antenna<00:06:48.280> I<00:06:48.370> just

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
especially the inside antenna I just

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.430 
especially the inside antenna I just
tried<00:06:48.820> two<00:06:49.000> different<00:06:49.030> locations<00:06:49.780> and<00:06:50.020> having

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
tried two different locations and having

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.670 
tried two different locations and having
it<00:06:50.530> face<00:06:50.830> down<00:06:51.390> in<00:06:52.390> between<00:06:52.810> the<00:06:52.960> rafters<00:06:53.140> was

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
it face down in between the rafters was

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.700 
it face down in between the rafters was
what<00:06:54.400> you<00:06:54.700> load<00:06:54.850> the<00:06:54.970> best<00:06:55.120> results<00:06:55.570> but<00:06:55.780> if

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
what you load the best results but if

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
what you load the best results but if
you<00:06:56.830> have<00:06:56.950> more<00:06:57.100> time<00:06:57.280> and<00:06:57.460> want<00:06:57.580> to<00:06:57.610> play

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
you have more time and want to play

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.280 
you have more time and want to play
around<00:06:57.910> with<00:06:58.030> it<00:06:58.180> I'm<00:06:58.270> sure<00:06:58.480> I<00:06:58.510> have<00:06:58.810> a<00:06:58.990> better

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
around with it I'm sure I have a better

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.820 
around with it I'm sure I have a better
location<00:06:59.800> I<00:06:59.890> could<00:07:00.160> put<00:07:00.340> it<00:07:00.930> but<00:07:01.930> it's<00:07:02.470> been

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
location I could put it but it's been

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.000 
location I could put it but it's been
working<00:07:03.040> great<00:07:03.160> for<00:07:03.550> me<00:07:03.670> and<00:07:04.860> that's<00:07:05.860> just

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
working great for me and that's just

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.050 
working great for me and that's just
these<00:07:06.400> are<00:07:06.520> my<00:07:06.610> results<00:07:07.030> and<00:07:07.210> I<00:07:07.780> have<00:07:08.620> a<00:07:09.060> pretty

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
these are my results and I have a pretty

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.240 
these are my results and I have a pretty
good<00:07:10.210> suspect<00:07:10.330> in<00:07:10.630> that<00:07:10.870> you<00:07:11.800> guys<00:07:11.950> would<00:07:12.130> have

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
good suspect in that you guys would have

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.190 
good suspect in that you guys would have
similar<00:07:12.580> results<00:07:13.060> if<00:07:13.180> you<00:07:13.270> have<00:07:13.450> signal

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200 
similar results if you have signal

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.950 
similar results if you have signal
outside<00:07:14.500> you'll<00:07:15.490> be<00:07:15.640> able<00:07:15.700> to<00:07:15.960> drastically

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
outside you'll be able to drastically

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.600 
outside you'll be able to drastically
improve<00:07:17.260> it<00:07:17.680> inside<00:07:17.980> so<00:07:18.450> thanks<00:07:19.450> guys
