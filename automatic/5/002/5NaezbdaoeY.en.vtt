 with music to the rhythm of cumbia and a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.830
 parody of the song sergio the dancer 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.500
 in uruapan the collector trucks 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.360
 garbage invite the population to take the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.630
 trash when the truck arrives 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.630
 collector 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.489
 since 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.489
 for me for nothing 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.540
 the curious practice has helped them 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 improve service and be more efficient 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.230
 says the ecology councilor of uruapan 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.930
 a song is happening in the truck 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.150
 collector in such a way that remote 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.910
 at your reach you will hear when it comes 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.490
 that truck and take out the trash and in that 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.229
 good song is also being asked 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.680
 Do not take out the trash until the 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.450
 Bogie arrives and then it came 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.760
 it's already here age for you to serve 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.259
 your trash is a motivation that is 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.900
 is giving and that has given very good 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.119
 results the citizenship is 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.250
 participating with that action that is being 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.310
 doing and I think it's a benefit for 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.490
 all but in addition to the rhythm and flavor 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.190
 the garbage trucks 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 will be equipped with gps so that 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.860
 citizens of uruapan locate their 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.860

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.580
 a few gps in each of the trucks 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.479
 this in order to give you a 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.900
 track these to these routes and that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.989
 the person who works the person who 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.050

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.380
