texture<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> paper<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:40.439> stretch<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
texture in the paper don't stretch it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
texture in the paper don't stretch it
out<00:01:41.040> too<00:01:41.250> far<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.670> want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> keep<00:01:42.180> those

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
out too far you want to keep those

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780 
out too far you want to keep those
wrinkles<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.549> want<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
wrinkles in there you don't want to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.410 
wrinkles in there you don't want to
flatten<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.299> too<00:01:45.479> much<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.860> leave<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
flatten it out too much so I leave that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.380 
flatten it out too much so I leave that
wrinkled<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.689> set<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> aside<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.770> minute

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
wrinkled and set it aside for a minute

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.730 
wrinkled and set it aside for a minute
the<00:01:51.390> next<00:01:51.750> step<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:53.810> adhesive<00:01:54.810> you've<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the next step is adhesive you've got to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.740 
the next step is adhesive you've got to
attach<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.219> tissue<00:01:57.060> paper<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.479> your<00:01:57.570> canvas

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
somehow there's two ways to go you can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.240 
somehow there's two ways to go you can
use<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.950> matte<00:02:02.340> medium<00:02:02.840> acrylic<00:02:03.840> medium<00:02:04.229> or<00:02:04.380> Mod

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
prefer the matte medium over the gloss

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.170 
prefer the matte medium over the gloss
simply<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.250> easier<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.640> paint<00:02:23.970> on

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
simply because it's easier to paint on

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.430 
simply because it's easier to paint on
when<00:02:24.450> you're<00:02:24.600> done<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.140> find<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:27.440> matte

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
when you're done I find that the matte

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.920 
when you're done I find that the matte
finish<00:02:28.470> gives<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> better<00:02:29.970> texture<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
finish gives you a better texture to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
finish gives you a better texture to
grip<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.380> acrylic<00:02:31.770> paint<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.460> might<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
grip the acrylic paint you might have a

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
grip the acrylic paint you might have a
little<00:02:33.360> bit<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> an<00:02:33.690> adhesion<00:02:34.050> problem<00:02:34.710> if<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
little bit of an adhesion problem if you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.460 
little bit of an adhesion problem if you
use<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.370> gloss<00:02:35.640> medium<00:02:36.050> rather<00:02:37.050> than<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
use the gloss medium rather than the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.770 
use the gloss medium rather than the
matte<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.610> find<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.970> matte<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.450> work<00:02:39.660> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
matte so I just find the matte to work a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.980 
matte so I just find the matte to work a
little<00:02:39.870> bit<00:02:40.050> better<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.590> me<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:42.210> what<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.480> do<00:02:42.600> is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
little bit better for me so what I do is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.340 
little bit better for me so what I do is
I<00:02:43.650> take<00:02:43.860> my<00:02:44.040> brush<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.610> my<00:02:45.420> Mod<00:02:45.660> Podge<00:02:45.930> my

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
I take my brush and my Mod Podge my

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.080 
I take my brush and my Mod Podge my
matte<00:02:46.620> Mod<00:02:46.860> Podge<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:49.250> give<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.430> canvas<00:02:50.910> a

back<00:04:30.930> into<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.410> Mod<00:04:31.590> Podge<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:33.410> give<00:04:34.410> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
back into the Mod Podge and give the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:46.230 
back into the Mod Podge and give the
paper<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:36.270> nice<00:04:36.960> layer<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:39.660> Mod<00:04:40.590> Podge<00:04:40.890> there

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.629 

you<00:04:46.840> don't<00:04:47.050> want<00:04:47.229> to<00:04:47.289> over<00:04:47.740> brush<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.370> push

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
you don't want to over brush and push

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.249 
you don't want to over brush and push
things<00:04:48.910> around<00:04:49.120> too<00:04:49.509> much<00:04:49.690> because<00:04:50.020> the

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
things around too much because the

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.170 
things around too much because the
tissue<00:04:50.590> gets<00:04:50.949> pretty<00:04:51.400> delicate<00:04:51.910> when<00:04:52.060> it's

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
tissue gets pretty delicate when it's

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.950 
tissue gets pretty delicate when it's
wet<00:04:52.449> it<00:04:52.690> might<00:04:52.990> end<00:04:53.259> up<00:04:53.580> tearing<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:55.419> just<00:04:55.810> be<00:04:55.930> a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
wet it might end up tearing so just be a

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.939 
wet it might end up tearing so just be a
little<00:04:56.169> bit<00:04:56.289> gentle<00:04:56.710> with<00:04:56.889> this<00:04:57.039> stage<00:05:01.949> and

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
little bit gentle with this stage and

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.920 
little bit gentle with this stage and
thankfully<00:05:03.699> this<00:05:04.030> stuff<00:05:04.270> dries<00:05:04.539> pretty<00:05:04.810> fast

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
thankfully this stuff dries pretty fast

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.499 
thankfully this stuff dries pretty fast
so<00:05:05.889> you'll<00:05:06.400> be<00:05:06.520> able<00:05:06.699> to<00:05:06.759> be<00:05:06.849> painting<00:05:07.150> in<00:05:07.360> no

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
so you'll be able to be painting in no

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.670 
so you'll be able to be painting in no
time<00:05:08.069> it's<00:05:09.069> just<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.430> few<00:05:09.639> minutes<00:05:10.380> this<00:05:11.380> is<00:05:11.500> not

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
time it's just a few minutes this is not

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.820 
time it's just a few minutes this is not
a<00:05:11.710> heavy<00:05:11.979> layer<00:05:12.250> there's<00:05:12.610> not<00:05:12.759> a<00:05:12.789> lot<00:05:13.030> of<00:05:13.150> thick

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
a heavy layer there's not a lot of thick

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.490 
a heavy layer there's not a lot of thick
wrinkles<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:16.599> it<00:05:16.690> shouldn't<00:05:16.900> take<00:05:17.020> long<00:05:17.139> to

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
wrinkles so it shouldn't take long to

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.600 
wrinkles so it shouldn't take long to
dry<00:05:18.479> so<00:05:19.479> once<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.900> have<00:05:20.159> the<00:05:21.159> top<00:05:21.520> coated<00:05:23.610> then

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
dry so once you have the top coated then

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.420 
dry so once you have the top coated then
you<00:05:24.759> can<00:05:24.940> go<00:05:25.090> in<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:26.250> do<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.430> sides<00:05:27.780> and

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
you can go in and do the sides and

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.270 
you can go in and do the sides and
that's<00:05:30.430> just<00:05:30.909> a<00:05:31.060> matter<00:05:31.300> of<00:05:31.800> coating<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:33.099> edge

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
that's just a matter of coating the edge

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:44.040 
that's just a matter of coating the edge
of<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.610> canvas<00:05:34.120> just<00:05:34.569> like<00:05:34.750> so

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.219 

and<00:05:44.250> then<00:05:45.250> folding<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.090> paper<00:05:46.120> back<00:05:46.840> down

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
and then folding the paper back down

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:57.300 
and then folding the paper back down
over<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.599> edge<00:05:50.699> and<00:05:51.699> then<00:05:52.949> again<00:05:55.919> do<00:05:56.919> a<00:05:56.949> layer

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
over the edge and then again do a layer

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.740 
over the edge and then again do a layer
of<00:05:57.669> Mod<00:05:57.909> Podge<00:05:58.150> on<00:05:58.419> top<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.409> tissue<00:05:59.680> and

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
of Mod Podge on top of the tissue and

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.999 
of Mod Podge on top of the tissue and
then<00:06:01.750> do<00:06:01.990> that<00:06:02.139> on<00:06:02.409> all<00:06:02.440> four<00:06:02.650> sides<00:06:02.919> and<00:06:05.009> when

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
then do that on all four sides and when

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.059 
then do that on all four sides and when
it's<00:06:06.159> dry<00:06:06.400> all<00:06:07.120> you<00:06:07.419> have<00:06:07.569> to<00:06:07.690> do<00:06:07.870> is<00:06:08.289> tear<00:06:08.830> away

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
it's dry all you have to do is tear away

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.460 
it's dry all you have to do is tear away
the<00:06:09.750> excess<00:06:10.750> tissue<00:06:12.509> it<00:06:13.509> even<00:06:13.780> comes<00:06:14.289> off

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
the excess tissue it even comes off

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.399 
the excess tissue it even comes off
pretty<00:06:14.500> easily<00:06:15.270> while<00:06:16.270> it's<00:06:16.449> still<00:06:16.659> wet<00:06:16.840> it

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
pretty easily while it's still wet it

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.749 
pretty easily while it's still wet it
just<00:06:17.620> tears<00:06:17.830> away<00:06:18.009> and<00:06:18.129> you<00:06:18.340> have<00:06:18.370> a<00:06:18.490> pretty

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
just tears away and you have a pretty

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.149 
just tears away and you have a pretty
clean<00:06:19.030> edge<00:06:19.210> if<00:06:19.900> you<00:06:20.020> have<00:06:20.169> some<00:06:20.469> ragged<00:06:21.009> edges

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
clean edge if you have some ragged edges

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.010 
clean edge if you have some ragged edges
that<00:06:21.460> are<00:06:21.550> still<00:06:21.940> overhang<00:06:22.360> you<00:06:22.479> can<00:06:22.659> just<00:06:22.870> cut

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
that are still overhang you can just cut

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.730 
that are still overhang you can just cut
them<00:06:23.169> off<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:25.330> that's<00:06:25.659> all<00:06:25.930> there<00:06:26.139> is<00:06:26.169> to

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
them off and that's all there is to

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.450 
them off and that's all there is to
doing<00:06:27.069> the<00:06:27.669> texture<00:06:28.240> on<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:29.349> canvas<00:06:29.740> when

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
doing the texture on the canvas when

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.149 
doing the texture on the canvas when
it's<00:06:30.610> completely<00:06:31.090> dry<00:06:31.469> then<00:06:32.469> you<00:06:32.530> can<00:06:32.860> start

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159
