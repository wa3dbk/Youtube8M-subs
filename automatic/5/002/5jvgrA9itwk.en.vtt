any fact that we just know that they

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.570 
any fact that we just know that they
nerfed<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.720> in<00:00:48.809> some<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> next<00:00:50.430> thing<00:00:50.519> is

nerfed it in some way the next thing is
the<00:00:50.670> ogr<00:00:51.269> lmg<00:00:51.900> they've<00:00:52.440> ever<00:00:52.589> used<00:00:52.830> it<00:00:52.979> the<00:00:53.369> one

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the ogr lmg they've ever used it the one

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.609 
the ogr lmg they've ever used it the one
you<00:00:53.729> start<00:00:53.940> out<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.180> has<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.839> ridiculous

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
you start out with has a ridiculous

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.350 
you start out with has a ridiculous
amount<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.920> recoil<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:56.549> it's<00:00:57.030> way

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
amount of recoil like it's it's way

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.789 
amount of recoil like it's it's way
higher<00:00:57.570> than<00:00:57.629> any<00:00:57.869> other<00:00:58.049> gun<00:00:58.229> so<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.500> reduce

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
higher than any other gun so they reduce

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.280 
higher than any other gun so they reduce
that<00:00:59.150> the<00:01:00.150> predator<00:01:00.629> bow<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.170> bow

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
that the predator bow which is the bow

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.770 
that the predator bow which is the bow
and<00:01:01.320> arrow<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.799> game<00:01:01.979> has<00:01:02.549> a<00:01:02.580> faster<00:01:03.479> draw

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and arrow in the game has a faster draw

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
and arrow in the game has a faster draw
time<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.710> actually<00:01:04.949> pull<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> arrow

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
time so you can actually pull the arrow

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
time so you can actually pull the arrow
back<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.150> shoot<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.420> faster<00:01:06.900> which<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
back and shoot it faster which is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.040 
back and shoot it faster which is
awesome<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> ad<00:01:08.700> s<00:01:09.000> sensitivity<00:01:09.630> X<00:01:09.780> actually

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
awesome the ad s sensitivity X actually

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.160 
awesome the ad s sensitivity X actually
been<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.410> think<00:01:10.830> lowered<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.510> remember

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
been I think lowered because I remember

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.090 
been I think lowered because I remember
a<00:01:13.200> lot<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.560> were<00:01:13.620> complaining<00:01:13.800> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
a lot of people were complaining that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.430 
a lot of people were complaining that
the<00:01:14.480> sensitivity<00:01:15.480> of<00:01:15.510> extra<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.990> looking

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
the sensitivity of extra just looking

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.050 
the sensitivity of extra just looking
around<00:01:16.530> versus<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> sensitivity<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.730> looking

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
around versus the sensitivity of looking

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.250 
around versus the sensitivity of looking
down<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.210> sights<00:01:18.480> was<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.110> off

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
down your sights was a little bit off

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.480 
down your sights was a little bit off
compared<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.800> other<00:01:19.890> games<00:01:20.160> so<00:01:20.340> they've

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
compared to other games so they've

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.870 
compared to other games so they've
tweaked<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.410> more

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
tweaked that to make a little more

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.100 
tweaked that to make a little more
closer<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.030> other<00:01:24.150> game<00:01:24.420> experiences<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
closer to other game experiences and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
then the a.a n.a y 69 submachine gun

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.510 
then the a.a n.a y 69 submachine gun
which<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.830> secondary<00:01:29.190> weapon

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
which is actually a secondary weapon

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
which is actually a secondary weapon
they<00:01:30.210> increase<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> damage<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.200> if

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
they increase the damage on that if

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.899 
they increase the damage on that if
you've<00:01:31.590> ever<00:01:31.680> used<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.550> unload<00:01:32.760> an

entire magazine to a guy anyone die so
that's<00:01:35.310> good<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:36.150> pinger<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.040> restrike

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
that's good the pinger has a restrike

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.820 
that's good the pinger has a restrike
unit<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:39.900> tripod<00:01:40.409> where<00:01:40.560> you're<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
unit of the tripod where you're going to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.920 
unit of the tripod where you're going to
call<00:01:40.980> it<00:01:41.010> right<00:01:41.730> now<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.030> before<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.750> patch

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
call it right now or before the patch

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.300 
call it right now or before the patch
you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.290> who's<00:01:43.500> moved<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:44.159> slow

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you know who's moved really really slow

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.740 
you know who's moved really really slow
and<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:44.520> wasn't<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.790> huge<00:01:45.000> issue<00:01:45.120> on<00:01:45.360> pc

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and that wasn't a huge issue on pc

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
and that wasn't a huge issue on pc
because<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> higher

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
because you can you know have a higher

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
because you can you know have a higher
DPI<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:47.970> maybe<00:01:48.120> switch<00:01:48.300> your<00:01:48.450> dpi<00:01:48.690> just<00:01:48.990> move

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
DPI or maybe switch your dpi just move

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
DPI or maybe switch your dpi just move
your<00:01:49.229> mouse<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.650> quickly<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
your mouse really quickly but on the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.430 
your mouse really quickly but on the
console<00:01:51.000> side<00:01:51.120> of<00:01:51.210> things<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:52.080> can<00:01:52.140> only<00:01:52.260> put

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
console side of things you can only put

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.320 
console side of things you can only put
your<00:01:52.530> joystick<00:01:53.040> all<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.850> way<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.000> ones<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
your joystick all the way to ones that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.850 
your joystick all the way to ones that
you<00:01:54.570> can't<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.290> keep<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.740> after

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
you can't like you know keep going after

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
you can't like you know keep going after
that<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.460> increase<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.150> rotation<00:01:57.479> speed

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that so they increase the rotation speed

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.550 
that so they increase the rotation speed
of<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.140> pinger<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.620> thus<00:01:59.310> warmer<00:02:00.560> killstreak

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
of the pinger and thus warmer killstreak

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.770 
of the pinger and thus warmer killstreak
reward<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.220> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.520> call<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.450> increase

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
reward or going to call it they increase

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.560 
reward or going to call it they increase
the<00:02:03.900> damage<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.650> so<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.210> first

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the damage on that so that's the first

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.149 
the damage on that so that's the first
beta<00:02:06.930> patch<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.440> think<00:02:07.710> they're<00:02:07.830> calling<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
beta patch I think they're calling a

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.740 
beta patch I think they're calling a
version<00:02:08.429> 1<00:02:08.580> point<00:02:08.789> 0<00:02:08.879> hopefully<00:02:09.390> we'll<00:02:09.569> see

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
version 1 point 0 hopefully we'll see

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.300 
version 1 point 0 hopefully we'll see
another<00:02:09.929> patch<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.159> day

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
another patch that's you know like a day

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.460 
another patch that's you know like a day
one<00:02:11.490> patch<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.970> maybe<00:02:12.120> fixes<00:02:12.480> other<00:02:12.630> bugs<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
one patch to maybe fixes other bugs and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.510 
one patch to maybe fixes other bugs and
issues<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:13.920> there's<00:02:14.100> still<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> lot<00:02:14.430> of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
issues because there's still a lot of

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.380 
issues because there's still a lot of
things<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.760> weren't

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
things that weren't

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.790 
things that weren't
fixed<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.440> patch<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:18.440> they<00:02:19.440> did<00:02:19.620> say

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
fixed in this patch and they did say

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.430 
fixed in this patch and they did say
that<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.100> plan<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:20.850> future<00:02:21.030> balancing<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that they plan for future balancing you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.660 
that they plan for future balancing you
know<00:02:22.530> we'll<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.220> see<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.490> they<00:02:23.640> actually

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
know we'll have to see if they actually

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.100 
know we'll have to see if they actually
follow<00:02:24.090> through<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:24.390> those<00:02:24.510> plans<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.990> on

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
follow through with those plans and on

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.000 
follow through with those plans and on
top<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.440> they<00:02:25.620> also<00:02:25.740> talked<00:02:25.980> about

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
top of that they also talked about

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.610 
top of that they also talked about
hacking<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.610> bit<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.970> they<00:02:27.720> say<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.319> they<00:02:28.560> do

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
hacking a bit and they say that they do

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.320 
hacking a bit and they say that they do
have<00:02:28.950> hacking<00:02:29.280> measures<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.700> place<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.240> right

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
have hacking measures in place and right

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.760 
have hacking measures in place and right
now<00:02:30.480> they're<00:02:30.720> kind<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.290> monitoring

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
now they're kind of just monitoring

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.500 
now they're kind of just monitoring
everybody<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.430> seeing<00:02:32.760> how<00:02:32.970> people<00:02:33.030> are

everybody and seeing how people are

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.540 
everybody and seeing how people are
hacking<00:02:33.750> because<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:34.740> are<00:02:34.890> plenty<00:02:35.340> of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
hacking because there are plenty of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.160 
hacking because there are plenty of
people<00:02:35.820> running<00:02:36.090> around<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.510> with<00:02:36.810> cheats

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
they they're going to be kind of locking

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.520 
they they're going to be kind of locking
down<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.120> people<00:02:42.450> once<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.080> full<00:02:43.260> game<00:02:43.380> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
down on people once the full game is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.309 
down on people once the full game is
released<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.970> banning<00:02:45.600> people<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.230> know

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
released and banning people you know

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.110 
released and banning people you know
perma<00:02:46.590> ban<00:02:46.830> wherever<00:02:47.130> depending<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.670> what

perma ban wherever depending on what
type<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> hacking<00:02:48.840> they're<00:02:48.989> using<00:02:49.310> all<00:02:50.310> right

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
type of hacking they're using all right

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.800 
type of hacking they're using all right
so<00:02:50.580> now<00:02:50.700> let's<00:02:50.850> talk<00:02:50.940> about<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.330> game<00:02:51.600> modes

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
so now let's talk about the game modes

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.880 
so now let's talk about the game modes
that<00:02:51.840> were<00:02:51.959> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.500> full

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
that were going to have in the full

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860 
that were going to have in the full
retail<00:02:53.790> version<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.180> crysis<00:02:54.540> 3's<00:02:54.750> multiplayer

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
retail version of crysis 3's multiplayer

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.620 
retail version of crysis 3's multiplayer
the<00:02:55.709> first<00:02:56.010> two<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.370> obvious<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.360> hunter

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
the first two are obvious we have hunter

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.360 
the first two are obvious we have hunter
and<00:02:57.989> crash<00:02:58.230> site<00:02:58.500> obviously<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.070> have<00:02:59.190> those

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and crash site obviously you have those

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.009 
and crash site obviously you have those
because<00:02:59.700> those<00:02:59.820> were<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.360> game<00:03:00.570> modes<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.930> had

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
because those were the game modes we had

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.620 
because those were the game modes we had
in<00:03:01.230> open<00:03:01.680> beta<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.090> top<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.390> we<00:03:03.540> have

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
in open beta but on top of that we have

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.759 
in open beta but on top of that we have
a<00:03:03.660> couple<00:03:03.840> returning<00:03:04.290> game<00:03:04.470> modes<00:03:04.650> from

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
a couple returning game modes from

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.520 
a couple returning game modes from
crisis<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:06.239> first<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.630> team<00:03:07.110> instant

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
crisis to the first one is team instant

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.440 
crisis to the first one is team instant
action<00:03:07.680> which<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.640> essentially<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.090> team

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
action which is essentially just team

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.720 
action which is essentially just team
deathmatch<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.769> have<00:03:10.980> instant<00:03:11.550> action

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
deathmatch and we have instant action

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790 
deathmatch and we have instant action
which<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.269> essentially<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:13.080> free-for-all

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
which is essentially just free-for-all

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.550 
which is essentially just free-for-all
and<00:03:14.070> then<00:03:14.670> we<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:15.000> classic<00:03:15.660> mode<00:03:15.900> now<00:03:16.380> this

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
and then we have classic mode now this

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770 
and then we have classic mode now this
one<00:03:16.830> isn't<00:03:17.250> confirmed<00:03:17.700> but<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.120> about<00:03:18.420> you

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
one isn't confirmed but it's about you

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.180 
one isn't confirmed but it's about you
know<00:03:18.870> highly<00:03:19.170> speculative<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.829> part<00:03:20.070> going

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
know highly speculative it is part going

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.229 
know highly speculative it is part going
to<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.430> them<00:03:20.579> as<00:03:20.670> well<00:03:20.910> as<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> other

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
to be one of them as well as the other

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.750 
to be one of them as well as the other
three<00:03:21.450> men<00:03:21.600> talk<00:03:21.720> about<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.459> classic<00:03:23.459> mode<00:03:23.610> is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
three men talk about but classic mode is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.280 
three men talk about but classic mode is
going<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.940> be<00:03:24.030> no<00:03:24.239> nanosuit<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.019> probably

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
going to be no nanosuit and probably

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.630 
going to be no nanosuit and probably
like<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> death<00:03:25.680> match<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.190> might<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.610> a

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
like a death match it might be a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.940 
like a death match it might be a
modifier<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.750> maybe<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.410> play<00:03:28.620> like

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
modifier so maybe you can play like

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.850 
modifier so maybe you can play like
classic<00:03:29.730> hunter<00:03:30.090> or<00:03:30.660> classic<00:03:31.260> crash<00:03:31.620> site

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
classic hunter or classic crash site

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.960 
classic hunter or classic crash site
where<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.220> play<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.489> crash<00:03:32.640> site<00:03:32.850> without

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
where you play and crash site without

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.190 
where you play and crash site without
banana<00:03:33.420> suit<00:03:33.630> but<00:03:33.750> we'll<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.019> wait<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
banana suit but we'll have to wait and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.530 
banana suit but we'll have to wait and
see<00:03:34.350> another<00:03:35.280> speculation<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.390> might

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
see another speculation is that we might

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600 
see another speculation is that we might
have<00:03:36.690> capture<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.290> relay<00:03:37.709> which<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.459> similar

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
have capture the relay which is similar

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.120 
have capture the relay which is similar
to<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:39.120> know<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.420> capture<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> flag<00:03:40.130> now

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
to you know just capture the flag now

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.819 
to you know just capture the flag now
that<00:03:41.459> next<00:03:41.910> speculation<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.840> called<00:03:43.230> Spears

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
that next speculation is called Spears

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.280 
that next speculation is called Spears
which<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> be<00:03:44.579> similar<00:03:44.880> to

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
which is going to be similar to

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.259 
which is going to be similar to
domination<00:03:46.290> type<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.160> layout<00:03:47.579> for<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.090> all

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
domination type of layout for like all

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.789 
domination type of layout for like all
do<00:03:48.420> your<00:03:48.570> conquest<00:03:49.049> from<00:03:49.200> battlefield<00:03:49.650> where

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
do your conquest from battlefield where

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.850 
do your conquest from battlefield where
you<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.070> maybe<00:03:50.760> like<00:03:51.000> three<00:03:51.470> flag<00:03:52.470> points

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
you have maybe like three flag points

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.319 
you have maybe like three flag points
one<00:03:53.070> in<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.250> middle<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.730> towards<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.180> this

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
one in the middle one towards you this

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.660 
one in the middle one towards you this
team<00:03:54.989> spawn<00:03:55.350> point<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.310> try<00:03:56.489> and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
team spawn point and you just try and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.190 
team spawn point and you just try and
control<00:03:56.910> as<00:03:57.180> many<00:03:57.360> flies<00:03:57.540> as<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.810> can<00:03:57.989> for<00:03:58.140> a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
control as many flies as you can for a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.140 
control as many flies as you can for a
longer<00:03:58.380> period<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.739> time<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.670> last<00:03:59.820> one

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
longer period of time and the last one

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.970 
longer period of time and the last one
is<00:04:00.360> extraction<00:04:01.110> which<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.650> also<00:04:01.950> a

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
is extraction which is also a

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.199 
is extraction which is also a
speculation<00:04:02.519> we'll<00:04:02.760> have<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.910> wait<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.060> see

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
speculation we'll have to wait and see

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.670 
speculation we'll have to wait and see
you<00:04:03.600> know<00:04:03.660> once<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.900> full<00:04:04.049> game<00:04:04.170> comes<00:04:04.410> out<00:04:04.530> to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you know once the full game comes out to

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.560 
you know once the full game comes out to
confirm<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.070> these<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.450> extraction<00:04:06.450> which

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
confirm all these but extraction which

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.710 
confirm all these but extraction which
is<00:04:06.720> supposedly<00:04:06.959> like<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> attack<00:04:07.739> defend<00:04:08.720> this

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
is supposedly like a attack defend this

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.970 
is supposedly like a attack defend this
is<00:04:09.840> once<00:04:09.989> again<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.200> returning<00:04:10.620> game<00:04:10.739> o<00:04:10.769> from

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
is once again a returning game o from

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.970 
is once again a returning game o from
crisis<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.310> where<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.150> attack<00:04:12.450> these<00:04:12.660> uh

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
crisis to where you attack these uh

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.620 
crisis to where you attack these uh
they're<00:04:13.980> called<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.340> alien<00:04:14.760> bio<00:04:15.030> ticks<00:04:15.450> or

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
they're called like alien bio ticks or

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.779 
they're called like alien bio ticks or
something<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.109> once<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.130> will<00:04:17.280> be<00:04:17.370> defending

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
something and once you will be defending

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.060 
something and once you will be defending
one<00:04:17.910> people<00:04:18.120> team<00:04:18.479> will<00:04:18.600> be<00:04:18.739> attacking<00:04:19.739> try

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
one people team will be attacking try

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.640 
one people team will be attacking try
and<00:04:20.250> capture<00:04:20.489> those<00:04:21.019> couple<00:04:22.019> points<00:04:22.320> around

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
and capture those couple points around

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.500 
and capture those couple points around
the<00:04:22.800> map<00:04:23.039> so<00:04:23.760> overall<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.150> think<00:04:24.240> that's<00:04:24.419> a

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
the map so overall I think that's a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.230 
the map so overall I think that's a
pretty<00:04:24.930> good<00:04:25.200> selection<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.950> game<00:04:26.250> modes<00:04:26.520> that

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
pretty good selection of game modes that

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.740 
pretty good selection of game modes that
we're

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
we're

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.390 
we're
have<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.170> full<00:04:28.380> game<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:28.830> don't<00:04:29.040> know<00:04:29.250> how

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
have in the full game I don't know how

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.980 
have in the full game I don't know how
many<00:04:29.430> maps<00:04:29.790> are<00:04:30.000> going<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.360> be<00:04:30.480> hopefully

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
many maps are going to be hopefully

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.360 
many maps are going to be hopefully
there's<00:04:31.170> a<00:04:31.230> good<00:04:31.380> selection<00:04:31.530> as<00:04:31.920> well<00:04:32.100> and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
there's a good selection as well and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.680
