00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.359
 [Music]

 yeager beauty pentagram back to bring 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.779
 This is going to tell you about more bars. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.340
 once wondering at the strange 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.349
 that the game really is great and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.869
 surprising and how few know 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.520
 Many are starting to play. I'm 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.380
 dedicating to the game trying to bring 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.360
 contents about it for you 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
 so get ready, because every week I go 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.239
 try to bring at least one video to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.160
 you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.500
 always when there is new content 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.289
 feels right 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.020
 I have come here to give you some tips on 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.879
 play then sit in the chair and 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.879
 only hearing and 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.270
 there is no beauty and how am I to do 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.290
 a video talking about him I'll explain 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.300
 for you 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.450
 This game is not much different from 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.250
 other shutters but its engine allows 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.460
 that you are strategic when it comes to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.100
 play or is this game totally 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.880
 strategy here is how the times are 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.730
 death 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.830
 so you can not go running today 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.830
 map without keeping it now 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.140
 one thousand bat usually only xote 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.329
 always the enemy is in the way he 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.430
 Lifts looks really pectoral to 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.040
 players will always come in the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.500
 and it's where it 's stronger 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.019
 the melee would be great you 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.540
 is in cover mode expect an enemy and 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.400
 from your side of the base or 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.470
 anywhere you stand 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.239
 so you take it by surprise and with two 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.250
 blows and call the floor 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.720
 then you can choose how to kill or with 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.709
 shots was so capitalization and did not want 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.720
 take advantage of the error 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.819
 and look that this tip is for videos 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.230
 it is only you to use your imagination and 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:37.480
 creativity that you can make a 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:41.639
 great video decided to death make it great 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.079
 videos of this game know how to use everything game 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.909
 continuing advises you always 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.220
 hit the first hit do not miss 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.530
 because if the guy is smart in can 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.989
 kill right on your first second fault 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.909
 hit you might even think you still 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.220
 You'll have bullets to kill him so if you 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.220
 do not want to risk giving the third goal 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.459
 I call you machine gun spear 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.830
 flames and audi launches grenades 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.200
 are as third item in your bag for 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.730
 use only that when he changes his weapon he falls 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.370
 automatically on the floor 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.350
 ie you do not smooth exchanges for one 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.140
 those of you just stay with her you want 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.510
 you change it will make another or the Cabala 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.760

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.500
 push the button to get her going to play 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.720
 the weapon you were holding and the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.610
 exchange for what you've got so always 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.800
 You're out of bullet, enjoy your 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.690

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.690
 he to get his gun 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.200
 pulling this idea is to use other weapons 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.210
 in the battles where you buy them is a 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.490
