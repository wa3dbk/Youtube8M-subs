00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
believe I just killed or that squirrel

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170 
believe I just killed or that squirrel
or<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.409> ninja<00:01:43.710> star<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.640> jump<00:01:44.880> off<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
or that ninja star is to jump off the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.690 
or that ninja star is to jump off the
wall<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> hit<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.229> midair<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.579> touch

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
wall and hit it in midair if you touch

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.030 
wall and hit it in midair if you touch
anything<00:01:48.000> while<00:01:48.210> still<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> wall<00:01:49.110> like

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
anything while still on the wall like

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
anything while still on the wall like
that<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.610> will<00:01:50.790> fall<00:01:51.000> off<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> will<00:01:51.600> die

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
that you will fall off and you will die

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.319 
that you will fall off and you will die
so<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> end<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.579> once<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.090> gets<00:01:54.240> towards

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so again the end at once it gets towards

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.399 
so again the end at once it gets towards
you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> harder<00:01:54.930> levels<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.229> gets<00:01:55.350> very

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you know the harder levels it gets very

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
you know the harder levels it gets very
very<00:01:55.619> tricky<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:56.880> simple

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
very tricky but it's a very simple

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
very tricky but it's a very simple
concept<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:57.990> pretty<00:01:58.229> interesting<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
concept and it's pretty interesting the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.810 
concept and it's pretty interesting the
graphics<00:01:59.070> look<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.520> great<00:01:59.670> especially

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
graphics look really great especially

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.240 
graphics look really great especially
I'm<00:02:00.180> loose<00:02:00.329> retina<00:02:00.869> display<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.439> there's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I'm loose retina display and there's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.499 
I'm loose retina display and there's
certain<00:02:02.460> power-ups<00:02:02.820> their<00:02:02.939> shields<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
certain power-ups their shields and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.639 
certain power-ups their shields and
their<00:02:03.600> stuff<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.930> only<00:02:04.380> thing<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
their stuff like that only thing that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.170 
their stuff like that only thing that
kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> wish<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.700> ad<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:06.030> go

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
kind of wish was like that ad would go

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.219 
kind of wish was like that ad would go
away<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.450> course<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.020> wouldn't<00:02:07.140> be

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
away of course but then it wouldn't be

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.990 
away of course but then it wouldn't be
free<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.369> there's<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.729> bit<00:02:08.849> more

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
free and there's a little bit more

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.460 
free and there's a little bit more
variety<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.599> enemies<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.289> maybe

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
variety of enemies and maybe

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.750 
variety of enemies and maybe
some<00:02:11.680> more<00:02:11.860> power-ups<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.340> would<00:02:12.550> pop<00:02:12.730> up

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
some more power-ups that would pop up

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.300 
some more power-ups that would pop up
along<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.210> way<00:02:13.240> but<00:02:14.200> other<00:02:14.710> than<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:14.980> I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
along the way but other than that I

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.470 
along the way but other than that I
would<00:02:15.490> highly<00:02:15.700> recommend<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.150> game<00:02:16.240> it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
would highly recommend this game it's

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.870 
would highly recommend this game it's
free<00:02:16.750> want<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.320> go<00:02:17.380> check<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.710> out<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:18.490> don't

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
know if hero you'll be a big fan of this

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.280 
know if hero you'll be a big fan of this
personally<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.130> can't<00:02:21.850> see<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
personally I can't see the see the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.810 
personally I can't see the see the
general<00:02:23.740> appeals<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.250> but<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:24.520> kind<00:02:24.730> of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
general appeals to this but it's kind of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.390 
general appeals to this but it's kind of
like<00:02:24.940> doodle<00:02:25.240> jump<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:26.170> ninja<00:02:26.860> style<00:02:27.070> and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
like doodle jump but ninja style and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.330 
like doodle jump but ninja style and
freakin<00:02:27.880> asian<00:02:28.240> style<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.130> have<00:02:30.190> it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
freakin asian style so there you have it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.490 
freakin asian style so there you have it
this<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.790> ninjump<00:02:31.210> as<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.230> see<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.470> can

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
this is ninjump as you can see you can

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.780 
this is ninjump as you can see you can
also<00:02:32.800> turn<00:02:32.950> into<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> squirrel<00:02:33.430> which<00:02:33.580> is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
also turn into a squirrel which is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.210 
also turn into a squirrel which is
obviously<00:02:34.600> which<00:02:35.440> obviously<00:02:35.710> happens<00:02:36.130> in

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
obviously which obviously happens in

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.070 
obviously which obviously happens in
real<00:02:36.340> life<00:02:36.520> because<00:02:36.940> it's<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:37.660> agents<00:02:37.960> do

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
real life because it's what agents do

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.990 
real life because it's what agents do
but<00:02:38.800> as<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.640> enemies<00:02:39.880> get

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
but as you can see the enemies get

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.220 
but as you can see the enemies get
harder<00:02:40.240> they<00:02:40.330> start<00:02:40.540> throwing<00:02:40.630> more<00:02:40.840> stuff<00:02:41.080> at

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
harder they start throwing more stuff at

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.260 
harder they start throwing more stuff at
you<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.160> because<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.490> pretty<00:02:42.760> challenging

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
you and because it's pretty challenging

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.390 
you and because it's pretty challenging
so<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.959> highly<00:02:44.440> recommend<00:02:44.620> when<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.220> free

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
so I highly recommend when it's free

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.530 
so I highly recommend when it's free
