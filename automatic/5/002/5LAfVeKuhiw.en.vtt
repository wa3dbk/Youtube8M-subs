00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.419
 the number of settlers in the series has become seven 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.010
 determined to return to the roots of the series and we are here 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.500
 in our election campaign it draws the title 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 Petrov in Roses factor 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.640
 also in this settler part the player starts again with the dismantling of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.650
 raw materials 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.010
 This is done by building a base building such as one 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.740
 Farm and one of three outbuildings accomplished 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.809
 in the three outbuildings the primary 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.550
 Rome and processing instead 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.260
 so can a farm at the same time for grain 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 Pig breeding for the production of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.920
 be used more 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.390
 If you sum up the number of building types, then Settler contains 7 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.430
 alone for the productions 28 different 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.290
 the economic beach is now so much more complex you need 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.550
 for example, for the production of weapons for the training of new soldiers 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.430
 The raw materials needed are iron ore, coal and wood 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.730
 Once again, they have to fear several production steps 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.909
 To have iron ore and coal in the Enz Schmieder processed at prices 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.520
 and thus be carried to the wood together in the armourers 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
 So that the soldier finally forfeits his finished 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.170
 and accelerate the production of individual raw materials 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.120
 the player has the option in the bars buildings of the production lines 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.720
 to determine the catering of this building 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.440
 which then depending on the chosen food are more productive but also 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.630
 is more expensive 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.890
 so that their raw materials produced can also reach their destination 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.740
 the popular Trier again 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740
 what results each one's the environment 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.260
 they transport in a traditional way 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 the raw materials and products from one place to another 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.570
 to keep the transport routes short 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.180
 the player has to do some optimization and can 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.650
 send more applications for the roads by building more warehouses 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:17.009
 With the help of the so-called logistics panel, the player can set priorities for the player 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.939
 Order of construction project recruitment set jump from educational processes 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.139
 to forward the valuable resources to important positions 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.399
 can 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:31.129
 But all that does not really contribute to a game in itself 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.329
 to decide 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.599
 On the one hand the victory of his military is possible in order to win the victory 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.150
 to take advantage of it and thus to be completely under his control 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
 or about the newly introduced points system 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.259
 in the military everything becomes very transparent 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.209
 and so the outcome of a battle is usually predictable 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.170
 but one or the other surprise you should here by the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.099
 Research on technologies is getting a positive impact on the strength of the technology 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.559
 Military can affect 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:06.019
 Victory points, unlike the military, can often prematurely end the game 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.070
 decide 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.019
 A player achieves the number of points lost from card to card 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.579
 so starts a counter 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.669
 The opponents will not make it back to him within this time 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.669
 if you lose points he wins this game 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.109
 the coveted points can be acquired in a variety of ways 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.979
 for example, by researching technologies 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.179
 Technologies are researched with the help of clergymen 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.970
 if they have then once in their own possession 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.829
 can no longer be used by any other player 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.509
 this then gives a serious advantage and can be a deciding game 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:42.389
 A technology is very important to you 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.689
 But there is also the possibility of competition during the research 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.709
 by praying for more clergy to do his research 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.219
 Further victory points can be gained through the construction of certain buildings and through the 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.149
 Conquest of other areas are snatched 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.889
 out 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.889
 we had five points 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.669
 So we can not say that much campaign yet 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.159
 that our test version is just the first three missions 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.179
 achieved 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.999
 in the area of â€‹â€‹the multiplayer there will be the possibility 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.530
 together or individually against human or computer-controlled opponents 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.650
 to compete 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.000
 the graphic in Siedler 7 once again convinces with its attention to details 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.090
 With the comic-look time again a clear picture too windy 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.770
 due to the numerous expansion Other possibilities 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.960
 Every party insider looks different 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.570
 The first impression holds what Blue Byte promised us 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.530
 one sees the title with the old good concepts 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.599
 and many advanced possibilities and innovations in detail outstanding 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.669
 From now on you have a new mix of drama at your disposal 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.049
 They are looking forward to the final version and then a detailed test 

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:57.050
 to be able to offer 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.009
 Target of 7 makes targeting various limit
