does is to train the muscles and extend
your<00:00:26.580> changes<00:00:27.119> making<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> muscle<00:00:28.259> stronger

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
your changes making the muscle stronger

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.470 
your changes making the muscle stronger
with<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.250> stretch<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.180> vulnerable

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
with that stretch and very vulnerable

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.080

option<00:02:15.180> now<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> option<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> use<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
option now the option is to use the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.479 
option now the option is to use the
hands<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:18.170> little<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.319> more<00:02:19.620> difficult<00:02:20.220> but

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
hands a little bit more difficult but

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.690 
hands a little bit more difficult but
can<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:21.000> done

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.640 

pushing<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.720> hands<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.620> legs

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
pushing with the hands and the legs

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:40.240 
pushing with the hands and the legs
traveling<00:02:26.489> out<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:32.220> back

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.210 

notice<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.570> have<00:02:41.950> ankle<00:02:42.950> weights

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
notice that if you have ankle weights

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.340 
notice that if you have ankle weights
what's<00:02:43.910> going<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.090> happen<00:02:44.540> here<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:44.930> roughly

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
what's going to happen here it's roughly

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.850 
what's going to happen here it's roughly
from<00:02:45.590> here<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.850> here<00:02:47.210> this<00:02:47.990> range<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.410> motion

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
from here to here this range of motion

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.320 
from here to here this range of motion
is<00:02:48.980> not<00:02:49.190> going<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.490> be<00:02:49.550> work<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.970> ankle

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
is not going to be work with ankle

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.900 
is not going to be work with ankle
weights<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.750> if<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.470> use<00:02:51.620> bodyweight<00:02:52.220> just

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
weights and if you use bodyweight just

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.270 
weights and if you use bodyweight just
your<00:02:53.060> leg<00:02:53.210> can<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> same<00:02:53.960> thing<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.160> it

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
your leg can be the same thing so it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.010 
your leg can be the same thing so it
makes<00:02:55.490> sense<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.210> pull<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> little<00:02:56.900> bit

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
makes sense that you pull a little bit

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.260 
makes sense that you pull a little bit
with<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.290> hands<00:02:57.650> they're<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.700> resistance

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
with the hands they're in the resistance

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.850 
with the hands they're in the resistance
and<00:02:59.540> then<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.170> know<00:03:00.290> how<00:03:00.500> much<00:03:00.680> resistance

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
and then you know how much resistance

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.150 
and then you know how much resistance
you<00:03:01.280> need<00:03:01.490> for<00:03:01.730> 10<00:03:01.910> repetitions<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.780> 24:34<00:03:03.770> 50

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
you need for 10 repetitions the 24:34 50

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.720 
you need for 10 repetitions the 24:34 50
and<00:03:04.340> working<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.210> exercise<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.900> way<00:03:06.730> make

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
and working this exercise this way make

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.340 
and working this exercise this way make
sure<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.090> your<00:03:08.300> body's<00:03:08.630> warmed<00:03:09.020> up<00:03:09.140> before

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350
