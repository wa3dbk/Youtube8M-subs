00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
frustrating you won't be able to compete

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.050 
frustrating you won't be able to compete
at<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> World<00:01:29.070> Championships<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.909> how<00:01:30.000> do

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
at the World Championships but how do

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
at the World Championships but how do
you<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.299> Australia<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.710> battle

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you think Australia do a little battle

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.109 
you think Australia do a little battle
you<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.340> always<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.759> always<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.060> out

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
you know we always we always go out

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
you know we always we always go out
there<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.450> surprise<00:01:33.630> teams<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.409> we

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
there and surprise teams because we

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
there and surprise teams because we
played<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.280> hard<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> play<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.720> know

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
played very very hard and play you know

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630 
played very very hard and play you know
a<00:01:36.840> rough<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.259> rough<00:01:37.409> solid<00:01:37.799> game<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.189> physical

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
a rough a rough solid game but physical

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.980 
a rough a rough solid game but physical
and<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.119> don't<00:01:39.210> take<00:01:39.450> crap<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.689> any<00:01:39.930> other

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and we don't take crap from any other

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
and we don't take crap from any other
countries<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.909> chance<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
countries so I think we have a chance to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.580 
countries so I think we have a chance to
surprise<00:01:42.479> some<00:01:42.780> people<00:01:42.810> obviously<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.500> need

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
surprise some people obviously we need

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
surprise some people obviously we need
to<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> good<00:01:44.610> run<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.090> three

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to just get a good run to two or three

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.310 
to just get a good run to two or three
games<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> never<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.229> what

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
games going on and you never know what

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.020 
games going on and you never know what
could<00:01:46.380> happen<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.310> world<00:01:47.490> championships<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
could happen the world championships and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
could happen the world championships and
only<00:01:48.210> peace<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> start<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.500> roll<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> play

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
only peace if you start to roll and play

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.800

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
all the way to a final and you've got a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.370 
all the way to a final and you've got a
couple<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> teammates<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.110> playing<00:01:55.290> at

probably<00:02:14.860> always<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.100> dark<00:02:15.400> horse<00:02:15.610> because

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
probably always a dark horse because

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520 
probably always a dark horse because
they're<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.150> well<00:02:16.300> structured<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.440> know

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
they're so well structured and you know

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.440 
they're so well structured and you know
they<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.400> basketball<00:02:18.700> academy<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
they have a basketball academy in that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.150

country<00:02:19.780> for<00:02:19.960> many<00:02:20.050> people<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:20.920> keeps

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
country for many people that just keeps

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.710
