00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.800
 good afternoon item like 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 they like pose a big problem 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.580
 tell me I have to do something about Christmas 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.279
 now you see such fantastic james 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.900
 bond suit hanger the tuxedo 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.890
 I've hung here but I'd been 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 attract 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.420
 then let's continue 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.420
 [Music] 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 this is already a different picture we have 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 still some things to finish 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 yes, because the machete can of course 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.190
 don't stay that way 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.399
 fluttering belongs to him set button then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.129
 also a fashion like things in fashion 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.620
 now less is more 'I think smoking 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.500
 is already a festive outfit of its own 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 so with all the shiny details drop the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 cufflink allowed 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.090
 subtle that money left over if you get it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.059
 very classic would not want for the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.160
 shoe that you need your glimmer that needs 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.890
 or shine again outrageously early 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.340
 that bow how do you see it like that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 thing here such a pen and stretch you there 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.670
 but one option and self-striker and true 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.200
 we are going we are going to the other side 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.770
 to the size bill comes there we go 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:19.820
 bow tie suitable 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:22.159
 first so you now have a free and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.079
 smoking from 2013 to of course one 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.179
 modern tuxedo with a cut up 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.340
 repair what you see here on the tire 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.719
 often also opted for in the matrix 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.250
 be if you're looking for a whole 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.049
 classic smokey 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.179
 then one will be chosen for one 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.219
 shawl collar like fashion 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.200
 especially that there is sometimes something in it 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.759
 the tuxedo not too intense but we 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.619
 are due to this switch from a scarf 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.679
 jaw to a cut repair and then 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.810
 preferably not too wide but somewhat narrower 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.720
 the word just fell 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.579
 the bow tie is kids the bow tie is anyway 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.530
 really a horror 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.959
 I have to practice for a few years 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.789
 mouth with such a package and you come 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.439
 Jort basement in that you laugh hard 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.869
 being done in your family is also right 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.239
 a bit rightly mix against you at the 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.409
 Experience shows that to yourself around the neck 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.390
 bows in front of the mirror 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.429
 a little more complicated than that 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.200
 when the self can look up so it 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.319
 motto is always just start on it 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.750
 thigh and so start for it for it 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.389
 Grab a white with a black tie 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.760
 is of course not a white tie but it is 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:26.120
 nice and visible and then you actually lay 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.790
 all the bow like you finally got it 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.790
 also then one goes over it 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:35.480
 I had it underneath and had the bow tie 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.050
 goes again 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.450
 through the lesson 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.900
 [Music] 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.400
 none for long 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.400
 [Music] 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.100
 who and to 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.060

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.689
