00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 and 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.540
 very good everyone 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.300
 welcome to minecraft wheat which is 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.330
 pretty new has I think just a 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.240
 pair of old so that indeed is 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.460
 for 1.2 and it's the inverse kripper and it's 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.440
 a game that is worth jumping very curious and 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.150
 I wanted to show you the inprÃ©s kripper 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.310
 as it says its own name can be a 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.870
 clip that is totally the inverse normal 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.570
 for example that normally travel to you 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 would explode and flee the ocelots 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.120
 example, this one is not there when he sees you 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.620
 flees when the bush does not explode well 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.059
 explodes but otherwise quite 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.190
 different let's do the active test 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.110
 a hit to the creative if not do so 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.199
 but good of you is worth more runs runs 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.450
 run until you give when you give 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.150
 is going to piss off go for you 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.640
 and it will explode otherwise 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.330
 exploit them totally in this club has 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.330
 exploited 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.430
 in this way creating blocks 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.400
 usually gravel lands and things like that 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.480
 ok but how are you going to find 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.130
 well how are you seeing coal here and 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.320
 even many times I was explaining why 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.070
 down here you may even find 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.810
 iron is worth it as I am generating 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.910
 but you can also find it out there 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.670
 you can mostly by forest biomes 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.710
 is where most were sent over forest 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.570
 and what else do we have for example if it's all 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.189
 the opposite that there is a crime against 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.830
 an ocelot run so what does this 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.869
 ocelot control revenge that the 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.000
 priests are always listening to the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.640
 clippers to their brothers the clippers 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.799
 green and there goes the Christmas king that you 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.420
 you can catch what you can catch what 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:50.820
 look what uncle fuck has been left 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:54.360
 there in plan to exploit exploits explodes 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.370
 ends with the cat is not very by the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.050
 work is that you can already have it 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:08.520
 almost but why not exploit delayed 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.990
 I'll give it 'll give're set 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.940
 the cat has remained as within the 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:20.520
 blocks of that is burning there is 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.290
 a block a block of a pencil in a text 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.050
 of the anticrisis but this one not descriptor 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 inverted as you want to call but everything 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.980
 I already tell you you can find everything 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.440
 iron and other diamond I do not think that 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.610
 I found diamond but I already say irons and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.739
 that leads to see even I think I've 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.510
 seen some gold block but good 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.489
 look at these this and now that look 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.860
 quite access because mostly not 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.450
 weigh nothing is not a bowl that is going to give 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.860
 incompatibilities with others surely 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.230
 because it's a pretty independent way 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.120
 and also the grace you have that good you 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.110
 you put them and when you go through forest and 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.360
 baltar contaminates from chaves 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.130
 here we have gold but diamond and audio 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.690
 that diamond I have not seen anywhere 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.519
 so I do not think that obviously 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.540
 let's find but hey look, it's not bad 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.980
 You find one 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.209
 makes you explode try not to let you 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.819
 inside because like three events you're going to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.620
 burst and look you take out some blocks and 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.090
 two for the face like that, girl, let's go 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.280
 see how the scripts are installed in the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.079
 right from both sides that's why it took 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.269
 of these pimps to extract we are 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.590
 it is done like all the others the only thing 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.900
 What you need to have is the chelotti forum 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.060
 file in this case for 1.7 points since 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.349
 the world was another version and download 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.549
 also from the description because this 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.290
 I said how sad the decision 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.519
 in case you want to know how it's done and 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.590
 download the description this file 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.090
 hence, it would be the modem itself and that 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.650
 we have to have it copied in our 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.909
 minecraft folder and for it only 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.709
 we have to do the following press the 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.299
 button of windows 7 at a time the button 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.819
 very is to the left of the keyboard before 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.069
 control and al and I put both at once and 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.169
 that's exactly ready to run there 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.180
 you put percentage data percentage percentage 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.909
 give to accept enter in point 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.980
 minecraft you enter in mods and copies the 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.180
 file as you copy it from there and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.709
 are you with that I would work 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.689
 perfectly triple mode 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.879
 inverted and if you like to go out and give it 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.379
 a like is more with a lot of creepers 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.090
 that go behind the ocelots though 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.349
 it costs a bit to kill them and see you 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.349
 in the video price up
