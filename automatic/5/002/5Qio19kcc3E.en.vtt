00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 and the winner of last week after 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.039
 a crime 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.039
 [Music] 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.779
 hello to all of you I am the volume 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.119
 pp in this volume or been accompanying a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.310
 beaten the mod gamer but with his 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 composting worse than mine for now 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.220
 will see as in what levels but a greeting 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.690
 and so they go to their channel so 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.149
 let's start with volume 2 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.489
 we started with a play by alfred 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:47.079
 jets in the number 10 place that seems 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.180
 a whale the whales have to go 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.530
 to the water their habitat can walk 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.769
 walking around there who was a 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.769
 penguin 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.830
 now he sees us as a child 22 047 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:07.630
 how good this explains itself 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:10.570
 and is in love with this goal 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.180
 now at number 8 higher than this 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.079
 barÃ§a and has an excellent aim 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.240
 humala who knows and to make matters not know 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.820
 suddenly it rolls up with a falcon 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.950
 led to the hotel is missing 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.010
 I take it and grabbed it from the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.010
 hand 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.670
 the love between the baths and the falcons 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.670
 they grow but they make species 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.120
 and now at number 7 of kira here 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.290
 it is not clear exactly what happened 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.290
 but bring a grenade launcher 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.800
 now in the number 6 796 that brought the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.900
 jetpack and suddenly it stays that no 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.350
 I know skating and what do I know 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.420
 is a magical godfather is not this one of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.750
 the new powers that it's about 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.750
 rollerblading 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:24.230
 and you can just float that's how 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:26.410
 if nothing else like that was too good 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.410
 for 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.440
 It was too unique to be so super 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.440
 trained 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:47.560
 [Laughs] 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:50.550
 and so being able to pronounce their number was 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.550
 too hard to pronounce 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.040
 and now follow danny rock 11 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.030
 that also ends up killing and also the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.030
 counts as tradition 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.740
 and now in the post 31 of xp of 117 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.360
 but there is another tradition through a 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.360
 vehicle 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.170
 and now at number 2 a move of 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.700
 it's my life that is here trying to 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.700
 make a ninja jump and 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.540
 at number 17 that launched two missiles 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.950
 and it's like he did it well but also 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.950
 He exploded onto her balcony thanks friends 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:06.300

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:12.690

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:15.769
 Developed missing many more click 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.769
 I was weekly 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:28.970

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.970

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.890

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.890

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.890
 studying 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.030
