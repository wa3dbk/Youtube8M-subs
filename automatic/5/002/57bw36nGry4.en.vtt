to it this card was basically just used
continuously<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.600> because<00:01:12.320> there<00:01:12.650> was<00:01:12.799> loops

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
continuously and because there was loops

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.980 
continuously and because there was loops
out<00:01:13.310> there<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.880> would<00:01:14.060> go<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.509> graveyard

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
