 marlos 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.480
 the numbers however are not known to at least two thousand and six hundred euros 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.029
 the mathematicians of ancient Greece were intrigued by the mysteries 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.049
 of these curious numbers that can only be divided by themselves 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:27.259
 euclides of alexandria proved that infinite prime numbers can exist 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.909
 and scraped the Brazilian tennis created a method to decide if a number was 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.219
 or is not a crime and how to generate the sequence of prime numbers 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.020
 but nobody has been able to explain why the sequence of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.740
 prime numbers and also regular 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.840
 with the emergence of computers 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.219
 new applications of prime numbers have been discovered 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.070
 such as the credit card password protection system 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.609
 current accounts and computer programs 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.899
 are protected by passwords that involve numbers formed by the 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.070
 multiplication of two giant prime numbers with hundreds of thousands of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.910
 cases 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.600
 the number 45 million six hundred and fifty-one thousand one hundred and seven per 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.330
 example 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.560
 is a compound number it was obtained by multiplying two first 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.619
 awards of the order of thousands 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.770
 but to find out who the authors are, you need to do about 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.920
 800 viewed by the thousands 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.550
 if the speed to make a division for about 2 minutes would be 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.880
 more than 24 hours uninterrupted to complete this 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.800
 case 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.180
 the banking institutions work with compound numbers obtained from the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.160
 multiplication of prime numbers with thousands and even millions of digits per 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.550
 It is impossible for individuals or even machines to make the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.280
 decomposition - of thousands of years working uninterruptedly 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.219
