00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
injury and wasn't able to be the person

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.350 
injury and wasn't able to be the person
who<00:02:31.530> he<00:02:31.769> can<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.610> field<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.269> what

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
who he can be on the field you know what

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.850 
who he can be on the field you know what
i<00:02:33.420> mean<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.690> i<00:02:33.959> think<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.319> was<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> good<00:02:34.799> thing

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
i mean and i think that was a good thing

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.120 
i mean and i think that was a good thing
is<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.220> they're<00:02:35.580> rushing<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.590> game<00:02:37.590> kind<00:02:38.010> of

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
is that they're rushing a game kind of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.710 
is that they're rushing a game kind of
suffered<00:02:38.610> after<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.420> that's<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
suffered after that and that's the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.740 
suffered after that and that's the
reason<00:02:39.840> why<00:02:40.019> they<00:02:40.890> wasn't<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:41.670> close<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.420> they

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
reason why they wasn't as close as they

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.840 
reason why they wasn't as close as they
could<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:43.230> our<00:02:43.410> potentially<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.580> game

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
could be our potentially in this game

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.880 
could be our potentially in this game
you<00:02:45.030> know<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.330> mean<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:46.019> say<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.470> like
