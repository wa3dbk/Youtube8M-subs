 and is related to the group 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.350

 of the medical area all over Brazil, 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.260
 this group has been bringing 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.670
 information of the difficulties 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.530
 that professionals at Nintendo 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.570
 country interior 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.390
 material difficulties 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.989
 difficulties in recourse to contracts 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.720
 which does not guarantee the fixing of the 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.190
 professional is the remuneration itself that 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.860
 sometimes offered at the beginning of a 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.010
 hiring is maintained until the end 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.900
 many mayors use hiring 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.269
 professional as a monitoring and not 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.160
 like fixing professional life 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.040
 indoor city in that everything but are 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.540
 issues that have to be discussed in the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.630
 Brazil, all right 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.209
 What is perceived today is that the government 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.459
 and comes with the panacea of 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.310
 hiring thousands of doctors 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.110
 Cubans to resolve the situation of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.440
 public health in the interior where it knows that 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.989
 that the internalization of the physician is a 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.329
 step but it is not the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.269
 The essence of the whole process is 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.410
 a framework of change that has 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.090
 that be carried out this when 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.950
 we asked the minister sharing what 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.770
 we question the government itself dilma 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.720
 about the construction projects 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.190
 of a medium-term project and not 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.160
 has no return 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.170
 This is my suggestion and it was sent 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.720
 directly to president dilma 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.910
 through communication channels of the 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.030
 presidency of the republic because the 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.580
 of the national forum that could 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.320
 bring together all stakeholders related to 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.740
 health academy 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.690
 the government itself in the legal areas 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.720
 general health professions doctors 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.750
 nurses to therapists to 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.060
 inside one of one of a collection 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.210
 of professionals could be discussed 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.760
 In this health, we want Brazil in the next 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.370
 50 years including a very 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.470
 similar in this respect was carried out 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:19.700
 called el here in brazil in curitiba 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:24.120
 called is the global latin america forum 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:29.010
 and if they were supported by the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.980
 fiep using the methodology is called 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.980
 appreciative investigation at the site 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.750
 brought together numerous actors from all 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.760
 areas to discuss precisely this 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.190
 issue of sustainability in companies 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.440
 in the whole world, it's for me this 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.240
 tool and left research 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.970
 appreciative was developed by dvd 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.210
 cup goes from pomegranate was from here this is always 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.610
 solves the question is this is a model that 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.350
 is being adopted and disseminated in the 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.750
 whole world through the organization of 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.820
 united nations to UN 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.010
 the question is why Brazil does not one 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.780
 percentage methodologies such as 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.240
 to discuss issues such as health 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.990
 public safety education in the country 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.670
 just was a return to the motivation 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.930
 streets of the great part of the population 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.240
 Brazilian, right? 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.560
 are issues that must be far more elusive 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.570
 a bit of the motivation of video in 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.550
 fact an initial reason precisely 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.860
 teach them how to invite all 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.990

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.950
 public 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.710
 I hope this video has helped 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.720
 us to expand but account number and 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.950
