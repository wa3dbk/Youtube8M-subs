00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
writing that kind of thing so it comes

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.310 
writing that kind of thing so it comes
with<00:00:15.179> some<00:00:15.360> fairly<00:00:15.719> conventional<00:00:16.020> looking

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
with some fairly conventional looking

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560 
with some fairly conventional looking
keys<00:00:16.800> there<00:00:17.160> which<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:17.940> access<00:00:18.090> under

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
keys there which you can access under

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.400 
keys there which you can access under
the<00:00:18.690> seat<00:00:21.619> that<00:00:22.619> accesses<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.220> charging<00:00:24.410> pop

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the seat that accesses your charging pop

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
the seat that accesses your charging pop
I've<00:00:25.619> got<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> standard<00:00:26.189> three-pin<00:00:26.609> plug<00:00:26.670> on

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
I've got a standard three-pin plug on

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.500 
I've got a standard three-pin plug on
there<00:00:27.859> and<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.160> charge<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> also<00:00:29.820> built<00:00:30.330> in

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
there and the charge is also built in

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.139 
there and the charge is also built in
that<00:00:33.800> most<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> work<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> bike<00:00:35.880> really

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that most of the work on the bike really

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.970 
that most of the work on the bike really
goes<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.719> around<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.170> rear<00:00:37.590> wheel<00:00:37.829> area<00:00:38.160> here

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
goes on around this rear wheel area here

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.900 
goes on around this rear wheel area here
there's<00:00:40.980> much<00:00:41.250> else<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.610> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
there's much else to it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
there's much else to it
I<00:00:41.969> guess<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> motors<00:00:42.780> probably<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I guess the motors probably in that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
I guess the motors probably in that
anyway<00:00:43.890> yeah<00:00:44.190> probably<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:48.020> turn

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
anyway yeah probably in there so turn

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.840 
anyway yeah probably in there so turn
the<00:00:49.140> ignition<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.520> dash

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the ignition on you can see the dash

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
the ignition on you can see the dash
lights<00:00:51.120> come<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
lights come on there and what you do is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.299 
lights come on there and what you do is
you<00:00:55.530> select<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.949> power<00:00:56.219> button<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.149> there

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
you select the power button one there

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.650 
you select the power button one there
that<00:00:59.309> clears<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> -<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.359> you're<00:01:00.480> then

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that clears the - there you're then

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.369 
that clears the - there you're then
ready<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.359> select<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.960> power

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
ready to go you can select that power

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
ready to go you can select that power
button<00:01:04.619> again<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.010> give<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.250> more<00:01:05.430> pack<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
button again to give you more pack it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.330 
button again to give you more pack it
takes<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.479> thirty<00:01:06.750> miles<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.340> but

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
takes out about thirty miles now but

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.410 
takes out about thirty miles now but
obviously<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> shorten<00:01:09.299> them

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
obviously it's going to shorten them

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.460 
obviously it's going to shorten them
range<00:01:09.750> which<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.260> plenty<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.250> fifty<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.470> think

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
range which is plenty is fifty I think

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.520 
range which is plenty is fifty I think
it's<00:01:13.560> 20<00:01:13.860> miles<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:15.200> on<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.259> full

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's 20 miles I think on lot on a full

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's 20 miles I think on lot on a full
charge<00:01:16.729> considering<00:01:17.729> most<00:01:17.850> people<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.240> about

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
charge considering most people do about

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.219 
charge considering most people do about
three<00:01:19.200> miles<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.950> time<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> moped<00:01:21.229> they're

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
three miles at a time on a moped they're

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
three miles at a time on a moped they're
accelerating<00:01:22.650> away<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.420> out<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
accelerating away so you get out of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.310 
accelerating away so you get out of
eighty<00:01:24.869> mile<00:01:25.259> down<00:01:25.500> power<00:01:25.830> setting<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:27.320> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
eighty mile down power setting one you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.580 
eighty mile down power setting one you
press<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.680> again<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.900> power<00:01:31.140> off<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.500> then

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
press it again the power off and then

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.760 
press it again the power off and then
your

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.800 

I<00:01:35.829> said<00:01:36.609> then<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.969> can<00:01:37.060> get<00:01:37.149> more<00:01:37.329> power<00:01:37.600> that

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
I said then you can get more power that

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.320 
I said then you can get more power that
way

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.200 

it's<00:01:41.930> very<00:01:42.470> light<00:01:42.800> it<00:01:43.370> feels<00:01:43.610> like<00:01:43.940> an<00:01:44.090> old

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
it's very light it feels like an old

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.060 
it's very light it feels like an old
sort<00:01:44.660> of<00:01:44.720> fashion<00:01:45.260> in<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.470> way<00:01:45.620> so<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.920> old

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
sort of fashion in a way so the old

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.680 
sort of fashion in a way so the old
two-stroke<00:01:46.610> sort<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.910> nope<00:01:47.090> any<00:01:47.330> kind<00:01:47.600> of

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
two-stroke sort of nope any kind of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.980 
two-stroke sort of nope any kind of
thing<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:51.910> think<00:01:52.910> it'd<00:01:53.000> be<00:01:53.030> properly<00:01:53.510> advocate

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
thing I think it'd be properly advocate

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.930 
thing I think it'd be properly advocate
for<00:01:54.170> doing<00:01:55.630> five<00:01:56.630> miles<00:01:57.340> five<00:01:58.340> or<00:01:58.520> six<00:01:58.700> miles

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
for doing five miles five or six miles

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.150 
for doing five miles five or six miles
of<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.180> time<00:01:59.420> something<00:01:59.720> like<00:01:59.900> that<00:02:00.230> you

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
of the time something like that you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.830 
of the time something like that you
wouldn't<00:02:01.310> want<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.580> use<00:02:01.760> in<00:02:01.940> heavy<00:02:02.150> traffic

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.060 

you<00:02:05.840> will<00:02:05.960> be<00:02:06.050> in<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.290> gutter<00:02:06.440> with<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.830> bikes

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
you will be in the gutter with the bikes

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.500 
you will be in the gutter with the bikes
and<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.370> kind<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.700> thing<00:02:07.910> oh<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.180> is<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> bit

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
and that kind of thing oh that is a bit

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.220 
and that kind of thing oh that is a bit
quicker<00:02:08.750> than<00:02:08.930> a<00:02:08.960> bicycle<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:10.960> actually<00:02:11.960> quite

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
quicker than a bicycle I actually quite

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.990 
quicker than a bicycle I actually quite
like<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.710> thing

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.700 

finally<00:02:17.660> more<00:02:17.810> than<00:02:18.020> happy<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.260> use<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.680> a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
finally more than happy to use on a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.900 
finally more than happy to use on a
regular<00:02:18.800> basis<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.700> either<00:02:19.910> need<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.240> use<00:02:20.390> one

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
regular basis if either need to use one
