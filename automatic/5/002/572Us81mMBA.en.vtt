00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.830
 hello to all you tell me with the turns and fraser 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.869
 the bra will close with this mine 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.960
 video and this time boy I bring them a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.300
 other super gameplay I dare indeed port 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.220
 387 killings and four dead two horns 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.320
 immediately of the gameplay because I have several 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 things to tell you in four minutes then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 I have to brother very fast or the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.610
 gameplay guys obviously is like i have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.410
 said a 307 who had it too 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.140
 anticipated in commenting I did in the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.469
 cda plan for those who were crazy 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.520
 that he felt in 182 bis on e'gia 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.350
 games however is a more fluid 400 487 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.329
 killings very little indeed I could 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.039
 very well because 400 more like though 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.129
 ancient from the point of the comments of the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.079
 plan now I'm going to wake up the reason 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.699
 so I am a lot because it is true when 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.320
 I had distributed I was pulling for 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 not to see therefore it does not receive anyway 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.229
 recycle them also because I made one 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.729
 search for those then quietly 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.710
 recycled lion 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.510
 obviously the simons as in the other 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 team and also Italian killed me 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 while driving the beatle and putting it there 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.570
 a minute less than half to get me all 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.759
 how many lists of which without actually between 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 the other then I explained obviously a 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.060
 400 easier peace can do it 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.650
 quietly, however, because of this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.630
 yes monica also put the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.790
 right on facebook guys who got me 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 killed twice not everything as piero 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.509
 put that I do my result like 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 what to do you will say 70's stuff of 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.850
 gender 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.200
 and if today I today after twice 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.880
 giuseppe siri by name of the genus 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.229
 however if I can I will put you where 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.970
 screenshot that my friend made up 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 facebook on 2 after he had it 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.659
 published practically so it is usa 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.590
 also quite nice because 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.000
 anyway 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.530
 They know that you actually owe too 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.270
 break your dick enough like I have 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.950
 also made others of the other in iran 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.390
 in love of one creating another who cannot 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.649
 after that I made the temple to the point 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.359
 is a 387 kill the Italian record of 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.569
 killing so there are flies in 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.969
 italy to make you understand better of course 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.920
 on console because on pc and I'm not here to 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.270
 tell you that it is quite different from the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.829
 what between pc and console 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 because there is novi check that one 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.420
 earthlings will see demolitions here 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.450
 on consoles and then we dream of it here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.250
 there are ten of them starting from 15 29 people 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.709
 let it be short, you have understood 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.630
 so things are very different 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.160
 so for quantity from console this 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.890
 Italian rule of least greater number 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.049
 of killings and to the world and we have taken 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.849
 second place after bob marley who 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.940
 he wants me to say harry days two 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.349
 spain and sons byoc doom that now not 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.579
 I'm still there, I've done the package 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.940
 seen on that channel 403 0 doubtfully 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.430
 bustato are not an idea then for now 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.840
 the second is not the major decisions to 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.819
 spot world is being able to beat it too 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.829
 because I think I can do it too 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.690
 know with this bari very early 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.930
 so very very few this time 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.030
 I'm trying to optimize to do more 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.739
 comments on the possible gameplay as possible 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.870
 live diva for fun 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.130
 otherwise and maybe even a few times 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.750
 it is not cowardly escarpments to put two steps 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.220
 the clip of late cylinders that are 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.540
 putting it lately 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.590
 so come on guys and you need to 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.569
 concentrating a lot on this quest 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.109
 last minute also because it really is 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.930
 very little 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.389
 two episodes 400 percent practically and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.329
 I wanted to tell you that first of all in the 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.400
 lobby this note says this simoni 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.480
 that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.670
 it's not that yes because he can 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.680
 kill but practically put precisely 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.850
 in series and therefore was Italian 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.380
 at the beginning there was the start of the game 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.960
 all of them were all not 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.730
 I knew and what or if none 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.800
 that enters where I knew it I have method 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.810
 that skitters can tell you that not 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.620
 there is now discharged among friends 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.970
 quietly 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.620
 the only thing guys that means that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.870
 they have been many Italians after they have 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.340
 limited the first enemies then by you 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.600
 to throw wicker we hear two 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.550
 sti worst then at the end of the year 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.930
 scandalous Arab 10 joystick 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.750
 I am up to see them complaining about how many 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.470
 find ourselves these hats find 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.720
 also bought the one in the first round 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.600
 all of you have entered fury towards 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.380
 last minute a clan of either 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.090
 no villa d'almÃ¨ is wrong perhaps 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.000
 amount of resources from the beginning 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.590
 he, too, and then of course simoni e 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.210
 many other people with boys are not 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.420
 that at the beginning we were these people but 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.640
 all voice rotated let's say the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.799
 people from gameplay start up to 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.390
 end there were all of them 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.950
 different then connected 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.750
 they left us abandoned 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.980
 because they abandoned and if not cases like 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.270
 the whole game even if the 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.910
 end between these example the summer ones 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.560
 4 5 people on average at least three if not 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.910
 I am wrong once even here for ends 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.460
 round first round ie in other three 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.560
 people so nothing apart from that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.860
 boy or did I just want to say them 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.740
 that I thank him so much 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.569
 for the two precedents of the small disadvantage 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.939
 of mandating we say must be 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.469
 postponed above all that everyone 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.449
 positive comments that left because 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.520
 really hydrant we don't see all those 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.780
 comments of so many people from so many 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.939
 I really don't owe you for so long 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.159
 I have been commenting for a long time because i 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.840
 multiples to comment on the 14 non-girls 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.979
 he doesn't even think how obviously he's not 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.509
 that a comment is made and what 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.189
 I try to do it every time there is the 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.210
 prescribed progress also active 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.590
 other channels of many youtuber fiction 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.919
 always leaves a small comment 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.969
 it's a like and so I'm very happy 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.250
 also because many have shared 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.870
 my idea and see if even that 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.120
 to serve some other my story with 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.060
 some other professor and if wanted 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.099
 maybe a video a little more young 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.379
 I add that in which they talk about theirs 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.300
 personal stories or stories of 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.469
 professors why not too many 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.659
 other 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.279
 many more strange we say of stories and 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.960
 I hope to be able to bring in some 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.580
 else to comment in a non live way 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.199
