00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:52.220 
know what's that tilt you're tilting
people<00:04:50.090> when<00:04:51.090> he<00:04:51.330> thinks<00:04:51.600> about<00:04:51.660> games<00:04:52.050> he

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
people when he thinks about games he

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.230 
people when he thinks about games he
thinks<00:04:52.440> about<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.770> like<00:04:53.100> you<00:04:53.640> pretty<00:04:53.820> much<00:04:54.000> ask

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
thinks about it like you pretty much ask

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.150 
thinks about it like you pretty much ask
you<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:54.660> he<00:04:54.780> goes<00:04:54.900> what's<00:04:55.200> cheap<00:04:55.470> what<00:04:55.890> works

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
you this he goes what's cheap what works

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.430 
you this he goes what's cheap what works
and<00:04:56.550> he<00:04:57.060> sticks<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.419> that<00:04:57.720> if<00:04:57.990> something's

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
and he sticks to that if something's

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.750 
and he sticks to that if something's
working<00:04:58.650> right<00:04:58.919> he's<00:04:59.010> gonna<00:04:59.100> keep<00:04:59.280> doing<00:04:59.340> it

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
working right he's gonna keep doing it

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.310 
working right he's gonna keep doing it
and<00:04:59.970> so<00:05:00.210> it's<00:05:00.419> not<00:05:00.540> surprising<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:01.110> he's

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
and so it's not surprising that he's

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.510 
and so it's not surprising that he's
using<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:01.740> poker<00:05:01.890> because<00:05:02.070> whatever

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
using that for poker because whatever

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.070 
using that for poker because whatever
he's<00:05:02.640> doing<00:05:02.730> is<00:05:02.910> working<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:03.419> he<00:05:03.510> just<00:05:03.660> keeps

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
he's doing is working so he just keeps

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:13.100 
he's doing is working so he just keeps
doing<00:05:04.140> it<00:05:04.440> is<00:05:04.560> what<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.710> assume<00:05:10.820> claim<00:05:11.820> 24<00:05:12.390> table

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
doing it is what I assume claim 24 table

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.600 
doing it is what I assume claim 24 table
at<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.260> same<00:05:13.410> time<00:05:13.680> it's<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.430> lot<00:05:14.550> of

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
at the same time it's a lot of

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.020 
at the same time it's a lot of
information<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:15.240> goes<00:05:15.450> through<00:05:15.690> my<00:05:15.720> head

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
information that goes through my head

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.390 
information that goes through my head
when<00:05:18.030> I'm<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.419> a<00:05:18.510> session<00:05:18.720> I'm<00:05:19.410> really<00:05:20.100> into<00:05:20.370> it

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
when I'm in a session I'm really into it

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.590 
when I'm in a session I'm really into it
and<00:05:20.729> I'm<00:05:21.210> just<00:05:21.240> kind<00:05:21.479> of<00:05:22.160> maybe<00:05:23.360> maybe<00:05:24.360> in<00:05:24.510> a

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
and I'm just kind of maybe maybe in a

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
and I'm just kind of maybe maybe in a
trance<00:05:24.870> so<00:05:25.229> I<00:05:25.260> suppose

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
trance so I suppose

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.909 
trance so I suppose
all<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.580> dots<00:05:28.760> connect<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.449> know<00:05:29.570> like<00:05:29.990> one

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
all the dots connect you know like one

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.860 
all the dots connect you know like one
hand<00:05:31.130> goes<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.610> next<00:05:31.760> hand<00:05:32.060> into<00:05:32.600> next

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
hand goes to the next hand into next

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.280 
hand goes to the next hand into next
hand

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
hand

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.500 
hand
so<00:05:33.889> just<00:05:34.100> so<00:05:34.280> many<00:05:34.520> decisions<00:05:34.790> happen<00:05:35.210> at<00:05:35.419> the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
so just so many decisions happen at the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.740 
so just so many decisions happen at the
same<00:05:35.690> time<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.410> it<00:05:37.370> never<00:05:37.550> stops<00:05:37.910> until<00:05:38.690> I

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
same time and it never stops until I

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.850 
same time and it never stops until I
choose<00:05:39.050> to<00:05:39.199> end<00:05:39.350> my<00:05:39.470> session<00:05:41.500> you<00:05:42.500> know<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.620> just

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
choose to end my session you know I just

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.260 
choose to end my session you know I just
