00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.059
 June 20 at 10 am 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.350
 this morning we are at the cemetery 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.300
 monumental of staglieno 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.580
 from here the poetic journey will start 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.590
 dedicated to the twentieth century of literature 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.720
 but now we leave space for the path 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.289
 politician and to the people there 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.199
 participate in making a poetic journey 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.540
 staglieno is quite complicated in the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:39.040
 sense that there are so many things to 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.590
 certainly tell the nineteenth-century nucleus 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.650
 the arcade with the great monuments of the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.290
 great nineteenth-century sculptors of saint 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.159
 varni of lorenzo orengo etc. are 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.720
 important 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:58.690
 But today we brought people one 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.180
 ideally, even if you don't really go 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.619
 on the place as they actually are 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.080
 a bit fragmented places that 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.140
 we should visit and we have brought 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.890
 people to discover the twentieth century a 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.890
 staglieno 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.070
 death will suddenly have the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.539
 your lips your eyes will cover from a 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.420
 veil of an bru 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.560
 I have adapted to the glasses that I 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.280
 driving license makes me obliged by now in a 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.469
 couple of days I see everything more clear 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.860
 but nothing has become for me this 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.689
 better in truth a traffic light is always 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.409
 a traffic light a sidewalk a 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.970
 sidewalk and I'm always like that 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.310
 as for the painful sense of dizziness 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.679
 vaticinato with migraine from a 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.110
 optical institute of course buenos aires al 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.479
 which I turned to this time I have it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.030
 experienced and passed it 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.380
 the ophthalmologist stated that with time I 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.140
 I had built my own 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.750
 arbitrary representation of reality 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.420
 now designed with a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.319
 fall apart suddenly and I could hope 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.829
 for a moment to be able to do again a little 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:39.200
 price 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:42.350
 a life and a sight you who live 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.480
 sure in your lukewarm homes that you 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.269
 find the hot food coming back in the evening and 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.579
 face friends consider if this is a 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.310
 man working in the mud who does not 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.519
 he knows peace that he fights for half bread 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.290
 who dies for a yes or a no 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.660
 consider if this is a woman without 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.090
 hair and nameless without more strength than 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.880
 remember empty eyes and cold the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.250
 womb like a frog in winter 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.709
 meditate that this was I command you 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.780
 these words carve into yours 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.540
 heart firm in the house going away 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.419
 when you lie down, stand up and repeat them 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.940
 your children or you pass off the house there 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:23.780
 sickness will prevent your births 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.090
 they twist your face from you I look around 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.060
 who shook the knife he had killed 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.859
 basic had been cleaned up several times 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.949
 until there remained the slightest 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.049
 stain was shiny and shone as it had 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.000
 killed the painter so he would kill 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.609
 the painter's work and all that 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.919
 this meant he would kill the 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.440
 dead this would have been 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.299
 free would have killed the monstrous one 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.250
 life of the lime and without the horrendous 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.579
 these admonitions would have been in 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.579
 peace grabbed alarm and hit them stretch 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.560
 a cry was heard is a scream, a cry 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.870
 so horribly heartbreaking that you serve 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.229
 frightened they woke up and left the 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.229
 their rooms 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:24.460
 we have almost finished and noon 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:28.930
 the bells are ringing and de andrè is 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.800
 died January 11 of 99 was enough 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.770
 young because he was 40 and as they say 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.590
 often he could write again 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.300
 very nice things 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.910
 in a vortex of dust the others 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.970
 he saw the drought reminded me of the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.310
 jenny's skirt not values ​​many years ago 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.740
 I felt my land of sounds was 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.979
 my hours so why cultivate it 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.870
 still how to think of it as better freedom 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.419
 I saw her sleeping in cultivated fields 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.900
 to heaven and money to heaven and love 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.639
 protected by a barbed wire freedom I have it 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.889
 sight waking up every time he has 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.190
 played for a rustle of girls a 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.770
 dance for a briaco comrade and then if la 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.110
 people know it's people know that if they play 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.020
 playing touches you for life and you 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.910
 like to let you listen to ends with i 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.669
 fine nettle fields with a flute 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:25.289
 broken and a hoarse laugh and memories 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.289
 many and not even a regret 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.130
