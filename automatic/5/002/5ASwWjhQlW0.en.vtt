a Porsche for an hour or two drive and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.800 
a Porsche for an hour or two drive and
it's<00:03:19.190> not<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:19.670> end<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.060> world<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.660> mean

you're<00:03:21.170> in<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.350> floor<00:03:22.480> alright<00:03:24.250> let's<00:03:25.250> do<00:03:25.460> an

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
you're in a floor alright let's do an

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.230 
you're in a floor alright let's do an
acceleration<00:03:26.270> test<00:03:26.600> here

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:47.309 

drop<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:34.110> first<00:03:34.440> gear<00:03:34.770> from<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> standstill

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.280 

it<00:03:47.829> scores<00:03:48.129> fast<00:03:48.599> yeah<00:03:49.599> I<00:03:49.629> like<00:03:50.079> it

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.530 

you<00:03:54.739> know<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:54.950> think<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.610> you're<00:03:56.030> buying<00:03:56.299> an

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
you know you think that you're buying an

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.949 
you know you think that you're buying an
older<00:03:56.900> Porsche<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.560> reason<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.010> that

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
older Porsche and the reason that that

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.990 
older Porsche and the reason that that
it<00:03:59.959> cost<00:04:00.200> so<00:04:00.439> much<00:04:00.620> less<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.189> that<00:04:01.400> it's<00:04:01.879> going

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
it cost so much less is that it's going

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.729 
it cost so much less is that it's going
to<00:04:02.060> be<00:04:02.180> unreliable<00:04:02.659> and<00:04:03.170> it's<00:04:03.379> not<00:04:03.530> going<00:04:03.650> to

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
to be unreliable and it's not going to

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.160 
to be unreliable and it's not going to
be<00:04:03.829> that<00:04:04.010> faster<00:04:04.519> exciting<00:04:05.060> but<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:05.900> car

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
be that faster exciting but this car

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.040 
be that faster exciting but this car
rocks
