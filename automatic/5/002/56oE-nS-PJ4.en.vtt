also just something that will keep it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.830 
also just something that will keep it
from<00:01:25.549> sticking<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.299> I'm<00:01:26.420> going<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.630> scoop<00:01:27.020> my

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
from sticking and I'm going to scoop my

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.880 
from sticking and I'm going to scoop my
ice<00:01:29.840> cream<00:01:30.140> dibs<00:01:30.380> my<00:01:31.280> batter<00:01:31.520> onto<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.149> and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
ice cream dibs my batter onto this and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.429 
ice cream dibs my batter onto this and
when<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:33.920> do<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.820> use<00:01:35.570> this<00:01:36.020> kind<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.320> a

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
when I do this I use this kind of a

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.999 
when I do this I use this kind of a
scoop<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:38.630> have<00:01:38.659> a<00:01:38.869> cup<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.140> hot<00:01:39.259> water<00:01:39.440> here

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
scoop and I have a cup of hot water here

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.820 
scoop and I have a cup of hot water here
because<00:01:40.459> it<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:40.970> scoops<00:01:41.270> better<00:01:41.709> if<00:01:42.709> you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
because it just scoops better if you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.649 
because it just scoops better if you
don't<00:01:43.009> have<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> scoop<00:01:43.700> like<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.509> is

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
don't have a scoop like this this is

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.990 
don't have a scoop like this this is
about<00:01:44.840> two<00:01:45.259> tablespoons<00:01:45.679> sized<00:01:46.190> scoop<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:46.880> a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
about two tablespoons sized scoop it's a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.859 
about two tablespoons sized scoop it's a
smaller<00:01:47.299> 1/3<00:01:47.869> doing<00:01:48.679> cookies<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.509> use<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.720> for

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
smaller 1/3 doing cookies I use it for

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.230 
smaller 1/3 doing cookies I use it for
this<00:01:51.020> because<00:01:51.289> I<00:01:51.709> like<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.069> way<00:01:52.190> they<00:01:52.399> they

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
this because I like the way they they

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.690 
this because I like the way they they
come<00:01:53.450> out<00:01:53.590> but<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.619> always<00:01:54.830> rinse<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.340> off<00:01:55.490> in

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
come out but I always rinse it off in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.770 
come out but I always rinse it off in
between<00:01:55.850> because<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:57.170> just<00:01:57.439> helps<00:02:01.780> whatever

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
between because this just helps whatever

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.679 
between because this just helps whatever
you<00:02:02.929> call<00:02:03.170> them<00:02:03.289> for<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> dips<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:05.299> come<00:02:05.509> out

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
you call them for the dips to come out

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.660 
you call them for the dips to come out
easier<00:02:09.519> mix<00:02:10.519> nice<00:02:10.820> uniform<00:02:12.430> little<00:02:13.430> balls

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
easier mix nice uniform little balls

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.009 
easier mix nice uniform little balls
that<00:02:14.540> we<00:02:15.530> put<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> freezer

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
that we put in the freezer

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.750 
that we put in the freezer
and<00:02:18.019> after<00:02:18.380> what<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.709> do<00:02:18.769> this<00:02:19.160> I'm<00:02:19.519> gonna

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
and after what I do this I'm gonna

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.870 
and after what I do this I'm gonna
freeze<00:02:20.150> them<00:02:20.480> for<00:02:20.780> about<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:21.410> hour<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.760> then

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
freeze them for about one hour and then

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.420 
freeze them for about one hour and then
I'm<00:02:22.940> gonna<00:02:23.060> make<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.540> chocolate<00:02:24.220> topping<00:02:25.220> or

and<00:02:32.130> we're<00:02:32.280> gonna<00:02:32.400> dip<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.970> coating

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and we're gonna dip it in the coating

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.140 
and we're gonna dip it in the coating
and<00:02:33.450> you'll<00:02:33.600> see<00:02:33.810> how<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> turns<00:02:34.260> out<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.150> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and you'll see how it turns out and you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.140 
and you'll see how it turns out and you
can<00:02:36.300> also<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.050> with<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.920> mix<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.940> nut

the mix and you can just fold it in a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.090 
the mix and you can just fold it in a
hard<00:02:58.950> time<00:02:59.150> thinking<00:03:00.150> talking<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.950> working

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
hard time thinking talking and working

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.330 
hard time thinking talking and working
at<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> same<00:03:02.670> time<00:03:03.000> I'm<00:03:03.210> just<00:03:03.450> not<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:04.340> much

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
of a multitasker in one so you get about

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.430 
of a multitasker in one so you get about
nine<00:03:10.170> full<00:03:10.710> dibs<00:03:11.580> here<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:13.140> about<00:03:13.290> a

nine full dibs here but I have about a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.770 
nine full dibs here but I have about a
half<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.090> comes<00:03:15.270> out<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.630> almost

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
half on one so it comes out to almost

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.590 
half on one so it comes out to almost
ten<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.880> I'm<00:03:17.940> gonna<00:03:18.030> put<00:03:18.240> these<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
ten so I'm gonna put these in the
