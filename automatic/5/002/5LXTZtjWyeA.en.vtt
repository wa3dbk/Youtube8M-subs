00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.380
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.379
 new video first of all I'm going to download a 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.379
 little the volume of all this history 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.990
 so you can hear me a little bit 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.369
 best 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.289
 well I hope you hear me a 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.480
 little bit better we are here with this 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.130
 new champion this brown what's called 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.830
 we have bravo as it is called this 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.380
 fuck brawn and it's the new support 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.020
 league of legends as you see then good 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.820
 He is a warrior uncle in a pretty hard plan 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.500
 and this is the skin that is going to have already 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.850
 used to make the same video 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.720
 that would be the presentation of the champion and 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:44.019
 the appearance the skin the original is very 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.160
 similar and it's instead of red so it's blue 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.120
 I do not want much change, so let's go 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.620
 to start with the skills to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.210
 prove good before starting a 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.979
 exit without anything starting explaining that 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.229
 this is going to be a pretty support 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.690
 people say that after in super pretty 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.089
 defensive on the subject of that from that 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.729
 well it's pretty hard so do not put much 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.409
 I see it more I think we can give it 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.420
 one more turn to this character and give him 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.580
 also an offensive character as could 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.689
 be a lioness or something similar because if 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.850
 our this change is a champion that 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.240
 he holds pretty that his functions of 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.740
 protect support to death but I 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.960
 I think instead of focusing on being 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.939
 back and simply support when employing 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.200
 as a tank not to adapt up the ass to 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.369
 enemy 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.380
 that that can be a pretty point 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.640
 pretty good let's start 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.350
 explaining a little the passive that the 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.090
 we see here as you see has this 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.890
 sign of passing some horns and that 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.710
 just every time we wait for a 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.409
 champion you see what comes out as the brand 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.630
 and he evans according to hill hits him third 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.250
 hit and the fourth hit buzzes peta the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.850
 mark that makes him one year 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.039
 the truth is always fine 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.750
 interesting is to that passive counted less 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.850
 we just have to go charging like 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.100
 you see the colla and the fourth hit then 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.259
 we are going to burst worth zumba there you see it 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.119
 let's spend nothing with the cv that is expensive 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.530
 alive because this character which it 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.880
 we can make quite a video like 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.310
 you see my seven are of action of life and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.869
 It is an excursion that we can give and if not 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.939
 We fail because it hurts worth what happens 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.739
 is that if you fail, it usually happens that 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.789
 you hurt because that's why because 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.650
 fail so let's get to the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.810
 most extreme height and as you can see it is 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.910
 a hit that hurts you according to life already 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.160
 seems to slow down the truth that is 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.450
 quite well it's not that I do harm 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.470
 tremendous but well I do not have any 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.670
 systems too serious for 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.920
 hurt but as you see scale with 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.650
 life and then you see that it is doing 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.099
 hurt the second skill is this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.620
 what does it do then is to give a plus to 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.659
 our ally a plus that you are me 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.430
 counting then of armor and resistance 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.140
 magical here you are seeing it and also 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.579
 serves to interpose you before him is 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.379
 say you can throw it so here we go 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.720
 to have a little bit more complicated because 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.689
 how am I playing alone without any 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.010
 mate, I can not go to him 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.810
 well saying so but this is used 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.159
 about an ally and apart from the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.170
 resistors as it puts you between 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.000
 half of the enemy and ally so to speak 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.980
 so that they stick to you is not in plan 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.340
 I am here because you may be medium 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.500
 zasca and there you put yourself you see that and then 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.840
 we have the ability to be 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.030
 increase him basically not I think that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.889
 It would be like a kind of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.439
 very strange template not as you see it 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.780
 can I teach it, you can see here what 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.340
 you see and this what is a wall 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.980
 but it would not be a wall like what it would be 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.840
 I already upload that you put it avoids spells and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.760
 it is already there is a wall that what 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.739
 It is because you are following and you 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.829
 reduces damage from attacks in this 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.840
 level then 30% but as I say is a 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.980
 wall that is moving that I mean 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.569
 with this that is moving because it already 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.580
 You will see what TÃ¡riq comes for example 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.230
 I put on the wall but I move 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.060
 down and the shield is still in 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.100
 the front position as it was 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.630
 put then that because it was quite 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.160
 ok here we are going to use the double vee for 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.560
 that you see then a little that wins a 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.250
 little bit more of resistance as you see 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.980
 now I have as you see now I have 50 to 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.950
 40 of resistance and as soon as I use the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.460
 I've doubled since I have this plus 23 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.410
 and 23 so you can see it 35 and have 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.420
 these would apply to both us and the 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.460
 ally in case we put it to 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.980
 him and finally we have the last 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.570
 skill what is this that what does 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.520
 well plant as a kind of skewers 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.200
 of ice in this case as the aspect is 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.480
 different, I do not know if they are fire 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.120
 let's see now and what it does 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.489
 is that first the first enemy that 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.780
 we'll see what's up 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.170
 up and then everyone who is there 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.210
 slows them down and you see warm and apart 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.380
 it obviously inflicts damage that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.510
 scale with ap 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.100
 and there we have it in this case are 150 of 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.830
 years but basically it's more like a 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.730
 kind of start of struggle we could 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.960
 say it can be a good gates 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.480
 if we want to catch some weak enemy 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.400
 if we caught him with this more what the 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.840
 damage that does more to throw up 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.700
 that we already leave it there is a little bit touched 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.460
 who does not know when to move more then the 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.520
 slow that applies this as you see is a 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.990
 Slow stool of 60% for 15 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.820
 seconds because the truth is that whoever 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.650
 we caught with this we can give it 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.090
 we can give candela and then apart 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.770
 put all those who are in that 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.660
 zone will see network slowed down so 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.700
 we can can be a good engage of 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.980
 departure so nothing more than 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.960
 add I'm going to leave already here so good 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.670
 seeing a little bit of the crazy things that 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.280
 can do with brawn 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.380
 and here we see it and nothing I hope you 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.630
 like we'll see how this champion is going 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.220
 and see you in the next video a 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.220
 greeting and until next time
