knife a split second after you want to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.200 
knife a split second after you want to
crouch<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> want<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> come<00:00:32.759> around<00:00:32.880> where

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
crouch and you want to come around where

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
crouch and you want to come around where
i<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.079> come<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.559> barrier

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
i do here so come on to this barrier

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.590 
i do here so come on to this barrier
you're<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> move<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.480> what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you're going to move over and then what

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.270 
you're going to move over and then what
you're<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> stand<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:38.070> what

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you're going to do is stand up now what

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
you're going to do is stand up now what
I<00:00:38.309> suggest<00:00:38.399> there<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:38.910> moving<00:00:39.300> over<00:00:39.480> slightly

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I suggest there is moving over slightly

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.020 
I suggest there is moving over slightly
so<00:00:40.260> basically<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.100> clear<00:00:41.460> knife<00:00:41.760> lunge

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
so basically you get clear knife lunge

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.369 
so basically you get clear knife lunge
so<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> hit<00:00:42.809> any<00:00:42.960> barriers

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so you're not going to hit any barriers

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
so you're not going to hit any barriers
