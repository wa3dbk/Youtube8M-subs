anyway what is this video is today I
received<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.600> think<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> package<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.260> has<00:00:19.439> been

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
received I think a package that has been

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.859 
received I think a package that has been
waiting<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> very<00:00:20.160> long<00:00:20.640> time<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.270> think

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
waiting for a very long time I think

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.500 
waiting for a very long time I think
it's<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.109> low<00:00:22.260> tide<00:00:22.500> level<00:00:22.769> X<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.130> well<00:00:23.510> so

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
it's from low tide level X as well so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990 
it's from low tide level X as well so
I'm<00:00:24.570> looking<00:00:24.689> forward<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.849> only<00:00:26.849> thing

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
I'm looking forward to this only thing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.769 
I'm looking forward to this only thing
is<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.420> looks<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.970> being<00:00:29.970> examined<00:00:30.390> by

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is it looks like it's being examined by

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
is it looks like it's being examined by
customs<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.890> probably<00:00:32.099> why<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.700> taken

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
customs which is probably why it's taken

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.569 
customs which is probably why it's taken
a<00:00:33.120> long<00:00:33.270> time<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:34.320> says<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.829> examined<00:00:35.430> by
