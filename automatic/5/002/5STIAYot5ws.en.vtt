00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
you the American sound pedal by Jo this

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.220 
you the American sound pedal by Jo this
is<00:00:10.679> basically<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.280> tech21<00:00:11.820> blonde<00:00:12.509> version<00:00:13.019> one

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
is basically a tech21 blonde version one

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.980 
is basically a tech21 blonde version one
and<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.790> fraction<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> price<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.870> don't

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
and it's a fraction of the price I don't

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
and it's a fraction of the price I don't
know<00:00:16.049> how<00:00:16.170> they<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.500> anyway

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
know how they do it anyway

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.849 
know how they do it anyway
it's<00:00:17.760> really<00:00:18.180> cool<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.660> an<00:00:18.779> amp<00:00:19.080> simulation

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
it's really cool it's an amp simulation

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.710 
it's really cool it's an amp simulation
pedal<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:20.820> does<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
pedal so what it actually does it

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990 
pedal so what it actually does it
replicates<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.650> sound<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.640> Fender

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
replicates the sound of a Fender

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.620 
replicates the sound of a Fender
amplifier<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> mic<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.710> front<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
amplifier with a mic in front of it and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.670 
amplifier with a mic in front of it and
basically<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.779> run<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.050> guitar<00:00:28.349> straight

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
basically can run your guitar straight

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.919 
basically can run your guitar straight
into<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.670> through<00:00:30.029> pedals<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.510> I'll<00:00:30.689> show

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
into it or through pedals like I'll show

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.410

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.170 

now<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.829> sort<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.250> sound<00:03:00.519> although<00:03:00.909> it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
now that sort of sound although it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.830 
now that sort of sound although it
sounds<00:03:01.329> really<00:03:01.629> nasally<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:07.450> really

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
sounds really nasally it's really

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.479

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
reminiscent of some of those small tweet

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.949 
reminiscent of some of those small tweet
amps<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:09.909> that's<00:03:10.060> how<00:03:10.209> they<00:03:10.359> sound<00:03:10.689> it's

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
amps and that's how they sound it's

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.699 
amps and that's how they sound it's
fantastic<00:03:15.629> not<00:03:16.629> really<00:03:16.780> my<00:03:17.049> sound<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.439> really

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
fantastic not really my sound I really

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.740 
fantastic not really my sound I really
like<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.980> deluxe<00:03:18.370> reverb<00:03:18.700> supersonic<00:03:19.540> kind

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
like the deluxe reverb supersonic kind

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.729 
like the deluxe reverb supersonic kind
of<00:03:19.840> vibe<00:03:19.989> on<00:03:20.230> clean<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.739> let's<00:03:21.489> um<00:03:21.760> let's<00:03:22.739> just

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
of vibe on clean so let's um let's just

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.030 
of vibe on clean so let's um let's just
turn<00:03:24.069> this<00:03:24.280> back<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.579> little<00:03:24.700> bit<00:03:25.859> see<00:03:26.859> if<00:03:26.950> we

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
turn this back a little bit see if we

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.399 
turn this back a little bit see if we
can't<00:03:27.310> get<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.730> similar<00:03:28.359> sort<00:03:28.719> of<00:03:28.840> sound<00:03:29.109> with<00:03:29.379> a

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
can't get a similar sort of sound with a

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:40.500 
can't get a similar sort of sound with a
deluxe<00:03:30.280> reverb<00:03:30.579> breaking<00:03:31.120> up<00:03:31.239> basically

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:55.470 

you
