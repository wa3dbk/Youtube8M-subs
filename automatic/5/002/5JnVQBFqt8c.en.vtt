some<00:02:01.440> bugs<00:02:01.650> that<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.460> also<00:02:02.820> noticed<00:02:03.330> that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
some bugs that way I also noticed that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.730 
some bugs that way I also noticed that
the<00:02:03.570> wave<00:02:03.750> forms<00:02:04.230> for<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.540> 1840<00:02:06.540> 33<00:02:07.050> was<00:02:07.320> more

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the wave forms for the 1840 33 was more

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.950 
the wave forms for the 1840 33 was more
much<00:02:07.950> bigger<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.790> smoother<00:02:09.150> than<00:02:09.300> those<00:02:09.630> from

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
much bigger and smoother than those from

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.730 
much bigger and smoother than those from
the<00:02:10.670> 1820<00:02:11.670> 50<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.240> think<00:02:12.960> overall<00:02:13.440> has<00:02:13.710> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the 1820 50 I think overall has a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.400 
the 1820 50 I think overall has a
smoother<00:02:14.220> style<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.750> much<00:02:15.930> bigger<00:02:16.140> sound

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
smoother style on a much bigger sound

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.820 
smoother style on a much bigger sound
that's<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> main<00:02:17.220> difference<00:02:17.390> as<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.650> 80<00:02:19.650> Hertz

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that's the main difference as a 80 Hertz

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.610 
that's the main difference as a 80 Hertz
high-pass<00:02:20.370> filter<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.600> has<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.920> 10<00:02:22.920> DB<00:02:23.250> pad
