phlebotomist is going to take some blood

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.200 
phlebotomist is going to take some blood
for<00:00:07.170> me<00:00:07.380> first<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.430> all<00:00:08.550> she's<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.030> put

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
for me first of all she's going to put

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.870 
for me first of all she's going to put
the<00:00:09.330> toner<00:00:09.570> k<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:11.100> watch<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.700> this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the toner k on and just watch how this

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.259 
the toner k on and just watch how this
is<00:00:12.090> done<00:00:13.100> you<00:00:14.100> collect<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.730> together<00:00:15.030> and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
is done you collect it together and

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.620 
is done you collect it together and
because<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.320> elastic<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.890> pull<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.630> so

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
because it's elastic you pull on it so

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.230 
because it's elastic you pull on it so
that<00:00:18.900> then<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:20.660> venous<00:00:21.660> return<00:00:22.100> is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
that then the venous return is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.029 
that then the venous return is
abstracted<00:00:24.240> when<00:00:25.140> you're<00:00:25.289> taking<00:00:25.619> blood<00:00:25.830> from

sterile swab this sometimes hurts the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.850 
sterile swab this sometimes hurts the
veins<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.160> stand<00:03:13.580> up<00:03:13.760> but<00:03:14.330> be<00:03:14.540> most<00:03:14.810> careful<00:03:15.230> to

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
veins to stand up but be most careful to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.690 
veins to stand up but be most careful to

allow the spirit to dry completely first

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.570 
allow the spirit to dry completely first
that's<00:03:19.700> for<00:03:19.910> two<00:03:20.060> reasons<00:03:20.650> firstly<00:03:21.650> the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
that's for two reasons firstly the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.600 
that's for two reasons firstly the
cleansing<00:03:23.270> action<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.959> spirit<00:03:24.590> works<00:03:25.040> as<00:03:25.310> it

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
cleansing action of spirit works as it

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.710 
cleansing action of spirit works as it
dries<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:27.380> second<00:03:27.800> thing<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:29.360> patient

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
dries the second thing is the patient

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.990 
dries the second thing is the patient

the venipuncture one thing is to line

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.629 
the venipuncture one thing is to line
yourselves<00:04:48.020> up<00:04:48.169> completely<00:04:48.770> correctly<00:04:49.340> and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
apply slight pressure on the vein but

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.930 
apply slight pressure on the vein but
not<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.449> much<00:04:53.690> that<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.880> obliterated<00:04:55.880> by

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
not so much that you obliterated by

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.540 
not so much that you obliterated by
pulling<00:04:56.240> too<00:04:56.419> hard<00:04:57.940> then<00:04:58.940> you<00:04:59.210> approach<00:04:59.660> the

pulling too hard then you approach the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.270 
pulling too hard then you approach the
skin<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:02.560> slip<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.740> needle<00:05:04.039> through<00:05:04.220> the

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
skin and up into the vein you then what
