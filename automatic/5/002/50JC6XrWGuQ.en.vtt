 When others see prosperity 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:00.040
 And your feet claudicate after their evil 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.600
 Count the riches that you will have by faith 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:19.000

 Although great is your affliction here 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:38.080
 Do not be discouraged, God is for you 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:48.120
 Not even his own Son was not reserved 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:56.960
 You will still see riches that eye never saw.
