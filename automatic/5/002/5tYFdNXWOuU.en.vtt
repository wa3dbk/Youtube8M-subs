00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.750 

I<00:05:24.840> don't<00:05:25.500> know<00:05:25.590> from<00:05:25.830> which<00:05:25.950> position<00:05:26.160> you<00:05:26.460> can

I don't know from which position you can
see<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.120> best

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:42.680 

okay<00:05:36.620> so<00:05:39.290> I<00:05:40.290> don't<00:05:41.040> know<00:05:41.310> looks<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.270> same<00:05:42.450> to

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
okay so I don't know looks the same to

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.280 
okay so I don't know looks the same to
me<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:43.050> put<00:05:43.980> my<00:05:44.100> glasses<00:05:44.250> on<00:05:44.730> oh<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:48.870> looks<00:05:48.900> the

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
me I put my glasses on oh it looks the

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.950 
me I put my glasses on oh it looks the
same<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.770> me<00:05:49.800> to<00:05:50.160> me<00:05:50.340> I<00:05:51.020> think<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:53.540> don't<00:05:54.540> know

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
same to me to me I think I don't know

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.150 
same to me to me I think I don't know
I'm<00:05:55.110> not<00:05:55.260> sure<00:05:55.590> but<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.669> think<00:05:57.650> this<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.919> looks

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
I'm not sure but I think this I looks

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.140 
I'm not sure but I think this I looks
better<00:05:59.370> without<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.480> prep<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:00.870> prime

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
better without the prep and prime

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.550 
better without the prep and prime
because<00:06:03.150> with<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.480> person<00:06:03.870> prime<00:06:04.110> it<00:06:04.350> just

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
because with the person prime it just

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.420 
because with the person prime it just
gets<00:06:04.800> all<00:06:05.630> clumpy<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:06.660> sticky<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:07.710> without

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
gets all clumpy and sticky and without

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.950 
gets all clumpy and sticky and without
the<00:06:08.580> purpose<00:06:08.910> but<00:06:09.090> I<00:06:09.150> think<00:06:09.240> it<00:06:09.570> looks<00:06:09.600> even

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
the purpose but I think it looks even

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.480 
the purpose but I think it looks even
longer<00:06:10.320> right

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
longer right

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.170 
longer right
I<00:06:11.520> think<00:06:11.940> it<00:06:12.060> looks<00:06:12.270> longer

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.330 

yeah<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:20.000> so<00:06:21.000> that's<00:06:21.240> it<00:06:21.590> the<00:06:22.590> mascara<00:06:23.190> is

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
yeah so so that's it the mascara is

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.590 
yeah so so that's it the mascara is
pretty<00:06:23.670> good<00:06:23.910> is<00:06:24.680> it<00:06:25.680> promise<00:06:26.370> volume<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:27.360> the

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
pretty good is it promise volume and the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.230 
pretty good is it promise volume and the
stop<00:06:27.870> and<00:06:28.140> it<00:06:28.260> does<00:06:28.500> lift<00:06:29.010> up<00:06:29.250> your<00:06:29.430> lashes<00:06:29.940> and

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
stop and it does lift up your lashes and

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.060 
stop and it does lift up your lashes and
give<00:06:30.840> them<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.170> volume<00:06:31.530> a<00:06:31.680> little<00:06:31.740> bit

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
give them the volume a little bit

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.420 
give them the volume a little bit
clumping<00:06:32.670> but<00:06:33.800> not<00:06:34.800> bad

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430
