00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.939
 I am the first to use a blush of molar 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.160
 July 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.310
 and it's probably not the whole one 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.110
 famous brand but yes and then I use 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.650
 a kind of chewie stitch this is from 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.730
 the virtual and yes it's just one 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.949
 purple color and then a kind of 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.510
 glitter lip gloss over it 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.309
 you use the lever of a dior 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.030
 light pink eye shadow and that on ordinary 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.030
 all over my eyelid 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 neighborhood and loose purple eye shadow and me 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.280
 are you where this is so fake but yes it does 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.960
 just number creased is from the purple 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.960
 find eye shadow that curiel over all 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.490
 and then her husband does coincidence 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.790
 that only passed boilie and here I come 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.960
 start with a red lipstick and that on 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.940
 run thinks even though that just became common 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.220
 is to do outside the lips but 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.810
 whatever you want and then I use this palette 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.230
 this such an essence that was used 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.400
 always 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.560
 and with this I clear my eyebrows 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.910
 ugly in that she sometimes does 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.590
 and we continue with the hair okay me 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.940
 just do it loose and then I'll do two 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.560
 types in 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.760
 and then I pick up an online office 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.010
 knowing the smallest I do just a little 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.540
 backwards and then clip it tight one may 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.940
 a bit of messing around because she doesn't do either 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.080
 nice and speak some beach pairing 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.890
 I also do a bit above my head 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.050
 and I let my hair do your thing ok now 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.420
 I see you make the kitten and you 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.100
 starts with the eyeliner and you make it 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.100
 just with stripes on your face 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.980
 then you make a nose for yourself 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.820
 just yes just a kind of dot 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.820
 actually make it on your nose 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.430
 I know a little loose around yes see 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.510

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.700
 do what you want and some more offices 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.890
 man is giving birth in her star candy and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.170
 those are very famous films and I am starting 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:38.560
 just with eyeliner and then make one 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:42.700
 workshop your face here more easily 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.200
 logo what you often look good then 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.740
 use this blue and i'm going with that 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.740
 fill it in 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.390
 and actually three exactly yourself at the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.540
 top but then inside 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.540
 wide 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.319
 use the white color here and with it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.760
 fill in the other and then go 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.350
 scarlet for me in the inside of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.640
 The cloud of fine writing because it says 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.870
 very often in the film 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.870
 that's just part of the cloud 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.280
 and at the top you write after it 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.110
 a question mark him at the bottom one 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.090
 point 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.230
 and then I continue with the eyeliner 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.150
 and then I make a kind 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.350
 yes stars on my husband just have to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.020
 but some do what you like 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.100
 and I have this too few dots 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.380
 and then I added some blue ones 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:49.410
 over it to make it a bit more 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:51.239
 falls and there store softer and that 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.600
 is the look and here you can ride some mascara 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.600
 on 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.000
