was like nice house but and as the more
we<00:00:38.600> consulted<00:00:39.600> with<00:00:39.660> our<00:00:40.350> adviser<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:42.260> looked

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
we consulted with our adviser and looked

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.770 
we consulted with our adviser and looked
at<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.969> at<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.780> hill<00:00:46.710> method<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.750> sat<00:00:48.750> down

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
at the at the hill method and sat down

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.760 
at the at the hill method and sat down
with<00:00:50.149> Don<00:00:51.149> who<00:00:51.600> introduced<00:00:52.199> us<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
with Don who introduced us to the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.569 
with Don who introduced us to the
program<00:00:54.289> when<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.440> introduced<00:00:56.010> us<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
program when you introduced us to the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.920 
program when you introduced us to the
program<00:00:58.309> we<00:00:59.309> knew<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.059> transferable

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
program we knew that it was transferable

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
program we knew that it was transferable
we<00:01:01.350> knew<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.219> sense<00:01:02.489> not

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
we knew that it could make sense not

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.840 
we knew that it could make sense not
only<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> property<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.199> were<00:01:04.350> in

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
only for the property that we were in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
only for the property that we were in
but<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.240> wanted<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> move<00:01:07.049> into<00:01:07.470> another

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
but if we wanted to move into another

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
but if we wanted to move into another
property<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.180> began<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.159> math<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.240> an

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
property we began to do some math and an

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
property we began to do some math and an
exploration<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.310> came<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> conclusion

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
exploration and came to the conclusion

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.679 
exploration and came to the conclusion
that<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:17.040> could<00:01:17.520> afford<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.150> very

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that we actually could afford this very

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.249 
that we actually could afford this very
beautiful<00:01:19.080> home<00:01:20.299> we<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:21.479> afford<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> pay<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
beautiful home we could afford to pay it

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890 
beautiful home we could afford to pay it
off<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:23.130> would<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.580> locked<00:01:24.060> into<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
off we would not be locked into it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.340 
off we would not be locked into it
at<00:01:25.080> our<00:01:25.290> age<00:01:25.369> for<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> number<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.240> years<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
at our age for a number of years and I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.230 
at our age for a number of years and I
mean<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.979> 30<00:01:29.400> years<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.970> mean<00:01:30.360> we'd<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.810> 90

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
mean for 30 years I mean we'd be 90

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.039 
mean for 30 years I mean we'd be 90
hundred<00:01:35.150> that's<00:01:36.150> definitely<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
hundred that's definitely not going to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.999 
hundred that's definitely not going to
happen<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.630> happened<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.650> looked

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
happen so so what happened is I looked

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.480 
happen so so what happened is I looked
at<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.490> looked<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> house<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:44.280> our

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
at we looked at the house and in our

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.050 
at we looked at the house and in our
consultation<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
consultation we could see that it was a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
consultation we could see that it was a
dream<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:49.259> could<00:01:49.470> come<00:01:49.680> true<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
dream that really could come true that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.840 
dream that really could come true that
made<00:01:50.670> sense<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.920> we<00:01:52.920> looked<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.700> an

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
made sense and we looked at it as an

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.200 
made sense and we looked at it as an
investment<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.619> Don<00:01:56.340> Daniel<00:01:56.880> put<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
investment and the way Don Daniel put it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.370 
investment and the way Don Daniel put it
to<00:01:57.420> us<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.710> pill<00:01:58.979> method<00:01:59.460> makes<00:02:00.380> your

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and it's not like it was hidden

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.650 
and it's not like it was hidden
information<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.150> laying<00:02:48.390> right<00:02:48.629> there

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
information it was laying right there

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.080

everybody<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.590> don't<00:02:49.830> see<00:02:50.129> it<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
I think that's a strength of most of the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.530 
I think that's a strength of most of the
financial<00:02:53.310> institutions<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.269> hope

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
financial institutions is that they hope

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.690
