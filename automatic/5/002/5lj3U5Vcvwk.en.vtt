00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.170
 Y 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.070
 let's make some pork jets in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.590
 bears- style sauce to start this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.590
 recipe I'm going to sound of Chamorro 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.480
 gonzÃ¡lez pepper put a little bit of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.859
 olive oil 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.859
 today I'm going to use grain salt 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:45.310
 and you have to face the meat a little 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.400
 what is that area well on all sides 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.190
 I'm going to place them on a pan of 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.750
 drained steel 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.410
 we're going to bathe in English sauce 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.530
 Apple vinager 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.100
 and then put a cup of water 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.009
 at the bottom half cubito de caldo de res 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.860
 for each chamorro and a little garlic 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.620
 chopped on top 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.720
 to each chamorro and now if we're already 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.600
 ready to go on the grill 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.240
 let's put the Chamorros near the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.040
 fire but not on top you have to cover 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 and you have to check them every half hour 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.530
 to make sure that they do not miss 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.530
 Water 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.860
 the chamorro was ready, I'm going to 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.900
 put on a plate to rest a while and 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.600
 the pan where I have the liquids that 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.670
 I left over cooking, I'm going to put 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.530
 fire fire medium 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.610
 I'm going to add two large spoons 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.550
 of sugar 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.620
 and we will leave it 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.620
 there for about 10 minutes 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.710
 while in another pan I will put a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.430
 Butter cube starts to 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.259
 melt 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.319
 and in that ten be we are going to put 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.790
 a slice of onion like that for 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.790
 accompany the samur 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.920
 I do not shut up 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.640
 It's easier if you take it out with the spoon 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 I just discovered it 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.800
 this was one more of the episodes of 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.800
 perversion of kitchen
