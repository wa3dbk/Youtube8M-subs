00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.050
 today we are going to do 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.050
 sugar nails 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.960
 we are going to need colored enamel to 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.990
 his taste 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.490
 a base so that the nails do not get 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 put yellow gloss or blotter or 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.980
 good in this case this is a shine of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.939
 fast dry 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.939
 to sugar 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.670
 or failing these letters that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.210
 Do you sell 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.000
 in white or transparent then 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.200
 now we go with the step by step 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.250
 the first thing is to apply a layer of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.210
 basis for this design we can use both 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.190
 sugar like scar cheetahs I'm going to 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.020
 I'm going to do it in one nail 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.270
 with frost and in the others I'm going to 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.070
 do with sugar but can make them 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.920
 all with sugar or all with the cachito 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.290
 and it is to your liking then 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.770
 I'm going to grab my two enamels I'm going to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.770
 use these two one purple and one blue 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 and I'm going to start 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.420
 I am going to place the blue enamel now 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.560
 I'm going to apply the frost type 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.740
 this is also going to be pressed with 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.740
 great care 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.430
 and wait for it to dry I'll 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.430
 continue then with the other nails 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:57.080
 and you want you to love yourself if the one 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.670
 I want you to want me not want me as 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.670
 I do not want me like me 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.289
 because you are here, you are applied 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.140
 a gloss layer to last longer and 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.620
 They look nice but do not last almost 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:17.360
 then it is best to apply a 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.500
 layer of a layer apenitas and fast so 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.970
 the so that the sugar melts 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.970
 do not complain 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.440
 and this is the final result I do not have left 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.180
 more nothing to say to them see you 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.930
 until next and a lot of life 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.930
 do not tell me not
