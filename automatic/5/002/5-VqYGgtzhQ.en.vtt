one that was seen in Return of the Jedi

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.210 
one that was seen in Return of the Jedi
that<00:00:23.689> night<00:00:24.110> can<00:00:24.230> have<00:00:24.320> one<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:24.680> lot<00:00:25.130> of<00:00:25.160> people

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
that night can have one a lot of people

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.440 
that night can have one a lot of people
have<00:00:25.430> been<00:00:25.550> asking<00:00:25.849> me<00:00:25.910> for<00:00:26.000> one

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
have been asking me for one

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.330 
have been asking me for one
I<00:00:26.480> did<00:00:26.779> try<00:00:27.020> before<00:00:27.200> and<00:00:27.649> failed<00:00:28.189> miserably

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
I did try before and failed miserably

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.249 
I did try before and failed miserably
this<00:00:29.029> is<00:00:29.149> pretty<00:00:29.360> much<00:00:29.419> the<00:00:29.720> closest<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.200> can

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
this is pretty much the closest I can

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.270 
this is pretty much the closest I can
get<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:30.770> it<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.640> completely<00:00:32.210> out<00:00:32.570> of<00:00:32.599> scale<00:00:33.280> I

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
get and it is completely out of scale I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.580 
get and it is completely out of scale I
think<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.239> total<00:00:35.450> is<00:00:35.660> supposed<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.020> be<00:00:36.140> free

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
think the total is supposed to be free

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.590 
think the total is supposed to be free
meters<00:00:36.920> long<00:00:37.160> suppose<00:00:38.000> be<00:00:38.120> three<00:00:38.300> or<00:00:38.420> four

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
meters long suppose be three or four

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.569 
meters long suppose be three or four
meters<00:00:38.780> long<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:39.079> that<00:00:39.410> would<00:00:39.530> be<00:00:39.680> in<00:00:39.890> blocks

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
meters long so that would be in blocks

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.160 
meters long so that would be in blocks
or<00:00:40.820> at<00:00:40.879> least<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.180> scale<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.420> use<00:00:41.690> one<00:00:41.930> two

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
or at least in the scale I use one two

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.590 
or at least in the scale I use one two
three<00:00:42.469> four<00:00:42.770> can't<00:00:43.700> really<00:00:43.880> fit<00:00:44.060> anything<00:00:44.360> in

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
three four can't really fit anything in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.240 
three four can't really fit anything in
there<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.260> I've<00:00:45.350> had<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.500> kind<00:00:45.680> of<00:00:45.770> extend<00:00:46.040> it

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
there so I've had to kind of extend it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.040 
there so I've had to kind of extend it
almost<00:00:46.460> like<00:00:46.640> twice<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.030> size<00:00:47.210> but<00:00:47.540> it<00:00:47.720> still

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
almost like twice the size but it still

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.780 
almost like twice the size but it still
looks<00:00:48.290> kind<00:00:48.620> of<00:00:48.650> in<00:00:48.800> scale<00:00:49.130> which<00:00:49.400> is<00:00:49.430> kind<00:00:49.760> of

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
looks kind of in scale which is kind of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.810 
looks kind of in scale which is kind of
interesting<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.500> I've<00:00:51.770> got<00:00:51.920> two<00:00:52.130> variants<00:00:52.670> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
interesting so I've got two variants I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.240 
interesting so I've got two variants I
guess<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.270> this<00:00:53.570> one<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.800> I<00:00:54.860> was<00:00:54.980> one<00:00:55.100> with

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
guess of this one and I was one with

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.890 
guess of this one and I was one with
just<00:00:55.370> two<00:00:55.520> chests<00:00:55.790> at<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:55.970> back<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.420> didn't

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
just two chests at the back I didn't

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.090 
just two chests at the back I didn't
want<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.079> put<00:00:57.200> stuff<00:00:57.380> in<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.560> chest<00:00:57.590> obviously

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
want to put stuff in the chest obviously

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.890 
want to put stuff in the chest obviously
haven't<00:00:58.310> texted<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.790> in<00:00:58.970> might<00:00:59.480> extract

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
haven't texted that in might extract

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.900 
haven't texted that in might extract
which<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.020> LD<00:01:00.350> modern<00:01:00.590> oh<00:01:00.770> I've<00:01:01.460> got<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.640> stair

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
which is LD modern oh I've got a stair

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.430 
which is LD modern oh I've got a stair
and<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.090> actually<00:01:02.180> prefer<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.660> stair<00:01:02.960> one<00:01:03.200> I

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
and I actually prefer the stair one I

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.770 
and I actually prefer the stair one I
think<00:01:03.860> it<00:01:04.040> looks<00:01:04.339> more<00:01:05.059> like<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.269> singular

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
think it looks more like a singular

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.499 
think it looks more like a singular
piece<00:01:06.130> so<00:01:07.130> really<00:01:07.640> really<00:01:07.790> simple<00:01:08.030> tutorial

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
piece so really really simple tutorial

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:09.490 
piece so really really simple tutorial
I'm<00:01:08.600> just<00:01:08.630> going<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.869> show<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.079> guys<00:01:09.259> in

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
I'm just going to show you guys in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.649 
I'm just going to show you guys in
default<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.340> we'll<00:01:10.460> get<00:01:10.579> started<00:01:10.850> okay<00:01:11.240> so

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
default and we'll get started okay so

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:12.670 
default and we'll get started okay so
this<00:01:11.899> is<00:01:11.960> what<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.170> looks<00:01:12.290> like<00:01:12.409> in<00:01:12.560> the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
this is what it looks like in the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.260 
this is what it looks like in the
default<00:01:13.070> text<00:01:13.369> practical<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.820> still<00:01:14.090> looks

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
default text practical it still looks

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.359 
default text practical it still looks
pretty<00:01:14.360> cool<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:15.020> think<00:01:15.409> actually<00:01:15.979> doesn't

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
pretty cool I think actually doesn't

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.760 
pretty cool I think actually doesn't
look<00:01:16.490> too<00:01:17.060> much<00:01:17.210> different<00:01:17.749> so<00:01:18.289> obviously<00:01:18.649> if

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
look too much different so obviously if

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.709 
look too much different so obviously if
you<00:01:18.829> use<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:19.100> any<00:01:19.249> other<00:01:19.429> text<00:01:19.670> packs<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.600> can

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
you use in any other text packs you can

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.929 
you use in any other text packs you can
kind<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:20.929> base<00:01:21.109> it<00:01:21.350> off<00:01:21.499> the<00:01:21.710> default<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.280> you

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
kind of base it off the default and you

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.580 
kind of base it off the default and you
know<00:01:23.030> see<00:01:23.299> what<00:01:23.329> happens<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.049> let's<00:01:24.499> get

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
know see what happens so let's get

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.379 
know see what happens so let's get
started<00:01:24.950> okay<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.789> materials<00:01:26.270> you're<00:01:26.359> going

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
started okay the materials you're going

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:29.289 
started okay the materials you're going
to<00:01:26.509> need<00:01:26.569> are<00:01:27.020> spruce<00:01:27.770> wood<00:01:27.920> slab<00:01:28.280> spruce<00:01:29.149> wood

here which is just to put on these fence
gates<00:01:50.479> like<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:51.100> now<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.639> actually<00:01:52.909> place<00:01:53.090> a

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
gates like this now to actually place a

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.269 
gates like this now to actually place a
block<00:01:53.299> on<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.810> back<00:01:53.959> of<00:01:54.139> this<00:01:54.319> fence<00:01:54.950> gate<00:01:55.219> you

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
block on the back of this fence gate you

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.010 
block on the back of this fence gate you
have<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.490> do<00:01:55.729> shift<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.539> you're<00:01:56.659> doing<00:01:56.810> sneak

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
place down a block and place down block

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.269 
place down a block and place down block
then<00:02:02.179> go<00:02:02.329> up<00:02:02.389> like<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.709> now<00:02:03.709> going<00:02:03.859> to<00:02:03.920> do<00:02:04.069> is

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
you're going to have a slab and you have

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.150 
you're going to have a slab and you have
a<00:02:06.679> block<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.849> gave<00:02:07.999> a<00:02:08.030> stair<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:09.800> got<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> slab

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
a block we gave a stair so got a slab

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.730 
a block we gave a stair so got a slab
flocs<00:02:10.490> there<00:02:10.789> right<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.270> back<00:02:11.420> here<00:02:11.740> now

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
flocs there right on the back here now

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.410 
flocs there right on the back here now
if<00:02:12.860> we<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.010> build<00:02:13.310> up<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.520> little<00:02:13.760> bit<00:02:13.880> here<00:02:14.300> or

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
if we just build up a little bit here or

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.730 
if we just build up a little bit here or
maybe<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.959> side<00:02:15.080> I'll<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.349> different

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
maybe on the side I'll do a different

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.470 
maybe on the side I'll do a different
block<00:02:16.310> here<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:16.849> we<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.090> build<00:02:17.270> up<00:02:17.360> one

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
block here so if we just build up one

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.509 
block here so if we just build up one
here<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:17.930> example<00:02:18.110> put<00:02:18.830> down<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.250> number

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
here for example put down to number

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.110 
here for example put down to number
brick<00:02:19.670> slabs

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
brick slabs

this<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.380> guess<00:02:33.530> now<00:02:34.520> on<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.820> sides<00:02:35.030> were<00:02:35.120> just

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
this I guess now on the sides were just

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.730 
this I guess now on the sides were just
gonna<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.660> lever<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.050> then<00:02:36.170> point<00:02:36.590> that

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
gonna have a lever and then point that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.910 
gonna have a lever and then point that
down<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.190> kind<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.490> supposed<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.760> be<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
down this kind of supposed to be the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.920 
down this kind of supposed to be the
footholds<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.390> when<00:02:41.390> you're<00:02:41.510> sitting<00:02:41.870> on

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
footholds that when you're sitting on

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.420 
footholds that when you're sitting on
the<00:02:41.990> bike<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.010> actually<00:02:43.130> get<00:02:43.340> your
