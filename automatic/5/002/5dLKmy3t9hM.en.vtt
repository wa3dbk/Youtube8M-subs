think<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.770> course<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.490> got<00:01:19.640> 12<00:01:19.880> volt

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
think and of course you got 12 volt

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.670 
think and of course you got 12 volt
outlets<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.479> can<00:01:20.630> use<00:01:20.750> also<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.650> me
