00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
implied odds is pretty much like the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.740 
implied odds is pretty much like the
same<00:00:41.520> thing<00:00:41.790> except<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.180> when<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> make

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
same thing except that when you make

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.260 
same thing except that when you make
your<00:00:42.780> hand<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.710> actually<00:00:44.340> make<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> second

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
your hand you actually make the second

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.650 
your hand you actually make the second
best<00:00:45.420> hand<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.960> you'll<00:00:46.140> lose<00:00:46.399> more<00:00:47.399> chips<00:00:47.730> so

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
best hand so you'll lose more chips so

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.580 
best hand so you'll lose more chips so
for<00:00:48.960> example<00:00:49.610> maybe<00:00:50.899> you're<00:00:51.899> chasing<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> flush

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
for example maybe you're chasing a flush

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.580 
for example maybe you're chasing a flush
draw<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:54.030> three<00:00:54.350> parts<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
draw with like two three parts like the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.240 
draw with like two three parts like the
lowest<00:00:55.860> flush<00:00:56.070> draw<00:00:56.250> possible<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> think

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
lowest flush draw possible and you think

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.040 
lowest flush draw possible and you think
that<00:00:59.430> when<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> hit<00:00:59.850> your<00:00:59.969> flush<00:01:00.239> just

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that when you hit your flush just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
that when you hit your flush just
because<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:01.949> questions<00:01:02.520> strong<00:01:02.789> hand

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
because you have questions strong hand

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.750 
because you have questions strong hand
that<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> make<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> lot<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> chips

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
that you're going to make a lot of chips

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
that you're going to make a lot of chips
but<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> other<00:01:06.299> guys<00:01:06.510> holding<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
but if the other guys holding like a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
but if the other guys holding like a
higher<00:01:07.350> flush<00:01:07.650> draw<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> ace<00:01:08.250> high<00:01:08.430> flush

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
higher flush draw like a ace high flush

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.270 
higher flush draw like a ace high flush
draw<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.570> both<00:01:09.720> make<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> flush<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.590> pinch

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
draw you both make a flush and pinch

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580 
draw you both make a flush and pinch
your<00:01:11.369> hand<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.729> strong<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.930> guys<00:01:13.080> acquiring<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
your hand so strong you guys acquiring a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830 
your hand so strong you guys acquiring a
lot<00:01:13.740> chips<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.250> lose<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.540> chips<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
lot chips and lose a lot of chips that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.020 
lot chips and lose a lot of chips that
way<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.369> example<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
way so that's a that's one example and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.240 
way so that's a that's one example and
the<00:01:18.180> final<00:01:18.540> example<00:01:18.900> would<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.350> you've

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the final example would be like you've

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.800 
the final example would be like you've
got<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> ace<00:01:21.229> nine<00:01:22.229> preflop<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:24.720> know

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
got like a ace nine preflop and you know

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.870 
got like a ace nine preflop and you know
it's<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.140> weak<00:01:25.439> kicker<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.979> flop<00:01:26.159> an<00:01:26.310> ace<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's a weak kicker if you flop an ace so

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
it's a weak kicker if you flop an ace so
if<00:01:27.000> someone<00:01:27.240> else<00:01:27.330> has<00:01:27.479> ace<00:01:27.630> king<00:01:27.869> rice<00:01:28.049> queen

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
if someone else has ace king rice queen

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.249 
if someone else has ace king rice queen
you<00:01:28.680> both<00:01:28.860> whoppin<00:01:29.220> ace<00:01:29.840> even<00:01:30.840> though<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> hit

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you both whoppin ace even though you hit

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.109 
you both whoppin ace even though you hit
your<00:01:31.409> hand<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.400> tend<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.939> no

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
your hand you actually tend your no

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
your hand you actually tend your no
loose<00:01:33.299> chips<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.439> pretty<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
loose chips so that's pretty much it I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.149 
loose chips so that's pretty much it I
feel<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.970> concept<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.619> click

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
feel like this concept is one that click

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
feel like this concept is one that click
the<00:01:38.189> second<00:01:38.640> step<00:01:38.850> once<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.509> learn<00:01:39.990> what

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the second step once you learn what

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
the second step once you learn what
hands<00:01:40.590> win<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> second<00:01:42.180> step<00:01:42.270> in

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
hands win it's like the second step in

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
hands win it's like the second step in
realizing<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.049> even<00:01:43.320> though<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:44.040> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
realizing that even though you have this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
realizing that even though you have this
surgeon<00:01:44.790> hand<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.360> lot<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> times<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
surgeon hand a lot of times you have to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.740 
surgeon hand a lot of times you have to
be<00:01:46.920> aware<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.820> relative<00:01:48.270> hamstring
