yeah so I was wondering how to convert
these<00:01:08.329> files<00:01:08.750> from<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:10.490> Meuse<00:01:10.850> files<00:01:11.210> that

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
these files from the Meuse files that

to<00:01:17.409> so<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:19.509> figured<00:01:20.509> out<00:01:20.600> how<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.810> do<00:01:21.049> it<00:01:21.200> here's

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
to so I figured out how to do it here's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.240 
to so I figured out how to do it here's
how<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:22.189> do<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:25.509> so<00:01:26.509> converting<00:01:27.500> these<00:01:27.799> Muse

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
how you do it so converting these Muse

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.859 
how you do it so converting these Muse
files<00:01:28.610> into<00:01:28.970> something<00:01:29.450> usable<00:01:30.159> usable<00:01:31.869> this

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
files into something usable usable this

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.029 
files into something usable usable this
is<00:01:33.110> take<00:01:33.500> 29<00:01:34.220> I'm<00:01:34.549> not<00:01:34.729> doing<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.149> again

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
is take 29 I'm not doing it again

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.399 
is take 29 I'm not doing it again
okay<00:01:37.039> so<00:01:37.399> in<00:01:37.759> your<00:01:37.789> minecraft<00:01:38.720> resources

directory that owner word is the only

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.469 
directory that owner word is the only
possible<00:01:51.439> discrepancy<00:01:52.369> or<00:01:52.580> difference<00:01:53.179> that

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
possible discrepancy or difference that

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.469 
possible discrepancy or difference that
we<00:01:53.599> have<00:01:54.099> alright<00:01:55.099> so<00:01:55.429> there's<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:56.030> link<00:01:56.299> in<00:01:56.420> the

we have alright so there's a link in the
description<00:01:56.689> as<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.560> jar<00:01:58.130> file<00:01:58.429> I<00:01:59.950> copied<00:02:00.950> that

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
description as a jar file I copied that

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.630 
description as a jar file I copied that
thing<00:02:01.399> over<00:02:01.670> here<00:02:01.909> here<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:03.099> okay<00:02:04.099> here's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
thing over here here it is okay here's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.520 
thing over here here it is okay here's
the<00:02:04.819> jar<00:02:05.030> file<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.450> just<00:02:05.479> downloaded<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.349> off

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
the jar file I just downloaded it off

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.800 
the jar file I just downloaded it off
this<00:02:06.799> video<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.490> I'm<00:02:07.610> watching<00:02:07.939> how<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.660> that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
this video that I'm watching how is that

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.069 
this video that I'm watching how is that
possible<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.769> is<00:02:10.429> possible<00:02:11.359> and<00:02:11.570> that's<00:02:11.870> all

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
possible it is possible and that's all

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:12.880 
possible it is possible and that's all
that<00:02:12.290> matters

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
that matters

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.330 
that matters
time<00:02:13.609> doesn't<00:02:14.060> exist<00:02:14.630> alright<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:15.980> make<00:02:16.310> a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
time doesn't exist alright so you make a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.809 
time doesn't exist alright so you make a
bat<00:02:16.700> file<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.390> batch<00:02:17.690> file<00:02:18.079> a<00:02:18.380> bat<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:19.010> batches<00:02:19.579> a

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
bat file a batch file a bat of batches a

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.610 
bat file a batch file a bat of batches a
batch<00:02:20.359> of<00:02:20.390> bats<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:22.989> that's<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.109> text<00:02:24.440> file

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
batch of bats and that's a text file

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.759 
batch of bats and that's a text file
that<00:02:24.769> you<00:02:25.010> write<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.370> crap<00:02:25.579> in<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:27.530> I

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
that you write this crap in and like I

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.620 
that you write this crap in and like I
grew<00:02:27.829> up<00:02:28.160> with<00:02:28.340> das<00:02:28.579> you<00:02:28.940> guys<00:02:29.180> probably

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
grew up with das you guys probably

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.840 
grew up with das you guys probably
didn't<00:02:30.109> so<00:02:30.650> you're<00:02:31.069> like<00:02:31.430> derp<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.680> well<00:02:33.850> if

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
you got Windows you probably have to put

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.650 
you got Windows you probably have to put
this<00:02:37.069> in<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.639> you<00:02:38.000> probably<00:02:38.180> had<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.540> do
