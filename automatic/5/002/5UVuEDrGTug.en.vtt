grill so real aggressive look Kristen
that's<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.609> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.359> very<00:00:24.510> powerful

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
that's how it going to be very powerful

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's how it going to be very powerful
as<00:00:25.289> well<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.650> still<00:00:25.890> don't<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.369> specs

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
as well we still don't know the specs

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.109 
as well we still don't know the specs
they're<00:00:27.269> saying<00:00:27.480> next<00:00:28.130> generation<00:00:29.130> EcoBoost

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
they're saying next generation EcoBoost

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.260 
they're saying next generation EcoBoost
engine<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.430> figure<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:32.969> it'll<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
engine so we can figure then it'll be a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.000 
engine so we can figure then it'll be a
little<00:00:33.480> more<00:00:33.750> powerful<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
little more powerful than what we have a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
little more powerful than what we have a
little<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.510> fuel<00:00:36.510> economy<00:00:36.989> than<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.260> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
little more fuel economy than what we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
little more fuel economy than what we
have<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.800> money<00:00:38.129> tell<00:00:38.430> them<00:00:38.550> about<00:00:39.210> our

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
have right money tell them about our

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780 
have right money tell them about our
current<00:00:39.960> EcoBoost<00:00:40.590> engine<00:00:40.950> well<00:00:41.399> our<00:00:41.489> current

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
ego booster has been really popular with

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
ego booster has been really popular with
our<00:00:43.739> truck<00:00:44.129> owners<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.570> v6<00:00:47.300> 365

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
our truck owners it's a v6 365

our truck owners it's a v6 365
horsepower<00:00:48.600> 420<00:00:49.590> pound-feet<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> torque<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
horsepower 420 pound-feet of torque that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
horsepower 420 pound-feet of torque that
edge<00:00:51.930> comes<00:00:52.410> home<00:00:52.710> eleven<00:00:53.430> thousand<00:00:53.879> three

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
edge comes home eleven thousand three

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.200 
edge comes home eleven thousand three
hundred<00:00:54.149> pounds<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> f-150<00:00:56.489> application

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
hundred pounds in the f-150 application

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.720 
hundred pounds in the f-150 application
yeah<00:00:57.449> they

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
yeah they

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.830 
yeah they
payload<00:00:59.570> capacity<00:01:00.079> 3,100<00:01:00.980> pounds<00:01:01.570> so<00:01:02.570> it's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
payload capacity 3,100 pounds so it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.649 
payload capacity 3,100 pounds so it's
great<00:01:03.079> for<00:01:03.200> us<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:03.650> great<00:01:03.890> for<00:01:04.040> our<00:01:04.159> customers

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
great for us and great for our customers

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.109 
great for us and great for our customers
so<00:01:05.659> powertrain<00:01:06.620> innovations<00:01:07.220> like<00:01:07.310> ecoboost

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
so powertrain innovations like ecoboost

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.290 
so powertrain innovations like ecoboost
direct<00:01:08.390> injected<00:01:09.190> turbocharging<00:01:10.190> those<00:01:10.970> are

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
direct injected turbocharging those are

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.660 
direct injected turbocharging those are
just<00:01:11.450> part<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.229> fuel<00:01:12.710> economy<00:01:13.130> equation

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
just part of the fuel economy equation

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.310 
just part of the fuel economy equation
so<00:01:13.909> what<00:01:14.150> if<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.330> big<00:01:14.570> truck<00:01:14.600> like<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.020> can

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
so what if a big truck like this can

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.780 
so what if a big truck like this can
actually<00:01:15.710> cut<00:01:16.009> through<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.280> wind<00:01:16.400> like<00:01:16.610> a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
actually cut through the wind like a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.050 
actually cut through the wind like a
smaller<00:01:17.210> more<00:01:17.920> aerodynamic<00:01:18.920> impulse<00:01:19.820> and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
smaller more aerodynamic impulse and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.249 
smaller more aerodynamic impulse and
Brian's<00:01:20.420> going<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.630> tell<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.900> little<00:01:20.990> bit

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
Brian's going to tell you a little bit

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.350 
Brian's going to tell you a little bit
about<00:01:21.920> how<00:01:22.160> they<00:01:22.400> have<00:01:22.520> shaved<00:01:22.790> off<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.060> few

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
about how they have shaved off a few

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.180 
about how they have shaved off a few
more<00:01:23.540> facts<00:01:23.840> forgiving<00:01:24.500> that's<00:01:24.979> right

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
more facts forgiving that's right

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.950 
more facts forgiving that's right
several<00:01:25.670> things<00:01:25.880> we've<00:01:26.090> done<00:01:26.240> starting<00:01:26.810> with

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
several things we've done starting with

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.690 
several things we've done starting with
the<00:01:27.110> roofline<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:27.800> look<00:01:27.979> at<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:28.190> roof<00:01:28.430> line

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the roofline you look at this roof line

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.300 
the roofline you look at this roof line
yes<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.180> modern<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:29.780> muscular<00:01:30.470> but<00:01:31.070> fully

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
yes it's modern and muscular but fully

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.920 
yes it's modern and muscular but fully
functional<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.180> will<00:01:32.360> cut<00:01:32.539> down<00:01:32.570> on<00:01:32.899> wind

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
functional this will cut down on wind

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.880 
functional this will cut down on wind
turbulence<00:01:33.670> up<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.970> one<00:01:35.240> mile<00:01:35.539> per<00:01:35.570> gallon<00:01:35.960> so

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
turbulence up to one mile per gallon so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.889 
turbulence up to one mile per gallon so
they<00:01:37.310> sound<00:01:37.580> little<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.090> but<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.600> lot

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
they sound little to you but it is a lot

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.600 
they sound little to you but it is a lot
of<00:01:38.960> all<00:01:39.200> those<00:01:39.440> add<00:01:39.710> up<00:01:39.740> now<00:01:40.100> looking<00:01:40.430> in<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
of all those add up now looking in the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.880 
of all those add up now looking in the
front<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.030> vehicle<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.990> also<00:01:42.110> have<00:01:42.259> active

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
front of the vehicle we also have active

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.800 
front of the vehicle we also have active
grille<00:01:43.160> shutters<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:43.880> at<00:01:43.970> highway<00:01:44.390> speeds

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
grille shutters so at highway speeds

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.710 
grille shutters so at highway speeds
these<00:01:45.080> shutters<00:01:45.380> will<00:01:45.680> close<00:01:46.420> reducing<00:01:47.420> drag

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
these shutters will close reducing drag

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.870 
these shutters will close reducing drag
and<00:01:48.050> then<00:01:48.440> they<00:01:48.560> hope<00:01:48.800> it<00:01:49.070> back<00:01:49.280> up<00:01:49.520> at<00:01:49.640> slower

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
and then they hope it back up at slower

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.060 
and then they hope it back up at slower
speeds<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.390> cool<00:01:50.600> down<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.960> engine<00:01:51.380> looking

this<00:01:55.280> lowers<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.940> highway<00:01:56.390> speeds<00:01:56.840> improving

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
this lowers a highway speeds improving

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.550 
this lowers a highway speeds improving
underbody<00:01:58.100> airflow<00:01:58.820> again<00:01:59.539> getting<00:02:00.289> better

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
underbody airflow again getting better

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.440 
underbody airflow again getting better
fuel<00:02:00.830> economy<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.399> over<00:02:01.700> here<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.420> have

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
fuel economy and over here we have

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.749 
fuel economy and over here we have
active<00:02:03.140> wheel<00:02:03.500> shutters<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:04.250> at<00:02:04.369> highway

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
active wheel shutters so at highway

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.320 
active wheel shutters so at highway
speeds<00:02:05.179> these<00:02:06.140> will<00:02:06.380> close<00:02:07.330> reducing

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
speeds these will close reducing

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.270 
speeds these will close reducing
resistance

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
resistance

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.380 
resistance
there<00:02:10.670> they<00:02:10.850> go<00:02:11.560> improving<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:13.180> improving<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
there they go improving on improving the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.360 
there they go improving on improving the
airflow<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.290> little<00:02:15.500> better<00:02:15.680> give<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.340> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
airflow a little better give you a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.740 
airflow a little better give you a
better<00:02:16.459> fuel<00:02:16.880> economy<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.390> then<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.720> course

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
better fuel economy and then of course

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.350 
better fuel economy and then of course
at<00:02:18.200> slower<00:02:18.470> speeds<00:02:18.500> they<00:02:19.280> will<00:02:19.520> open<00:02:19.760> back<00:02:19.970> up

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
at slower speeds they will open back up

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.240 
at slower speeds they will open back up
busy<00:02:20.810> course<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.380> got<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.620> cool<00:02:21.800> down<00:02:21.830> those

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
busy course you got to cool down those

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.550 
busy course you got to cool down those
Briggs<00:02:22.610> we<00:02:23.090> also<00:02:23.240> have<00:02:23.540> retractable<00:02:24.140> right

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
Briggs we also have retractable right

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.309 
Briggs we also have retractable right
boards<00:02:25.160> they<00:02:25.910> will<00:02:26.120> lower<00:02:26.450> what<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.020> get<00:02:27.170> over

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
boards they will lower what you get over

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.199 
boards they will lower what you get over
to<00:02:27.530> your<00:02:27.650> vehicle<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.100> after<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:28.730> your<00:02:28.940> get

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
to your vehicle and after it as your get

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.870 
to your vehicle and after it as your get
up<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.510> under<00:02:29.720> way<00:02:29.900> they<00:02:30.500> will<00:02:30.680> retract<00:02:31.160> once

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
up and under way they will retract once

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.670 
up and under way they will retract once
again<00:02:32.209> reducing<00:02:32.840> drag<00:02:33.050> give<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.530> little

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
again reducing drag give it a little

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.160 
again reducing drag give it a little
better<00:02:33.800> fuel<00:02:34.130> economy<00:02:34.220> that's<00:02:35.030> right<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.450> also

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
better fuel economy that's right so also

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.870 
better fuel economy that's right so also
