00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.049
 from me today again an app review 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.420
 something else i want you one today 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.759
 Free app namely spirit calculator 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.190
 imagine a very practical like 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.839
 said free app for the sprit 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.970
 need for a specific route too 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.470
 additionally determine with some 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.420
 Extra features I like you in 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.769
 I would like to introduce this video 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.769
 I wish you much fun in this video 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 since I have quite a few adult spectators 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.980
 have and personally by own car 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.020
 also know how expensive fuel is 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 it always makes sense for a particular one 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.190
 then calculate the fuel price 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.840
 and that's really possible with this app 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 that's why I wanted her 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 Just imagine we start 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.750
 here to put the app and then see 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.579
 this animation is here now 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.410
 once two big points a stretch 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.789
 calculate and calculate price and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.230
 additional and my little info 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.670
 button on what can sound 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 there has with the information regarding 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 this app but let's see the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 main function and this sounds like it 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.180
 calculated on the route 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.510
 and we have the opportunity now 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.159
 either post our address book here 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.619
 So from a go from the entry 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.880
 address book for a specific person 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.780
 example that I am to the and the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 onn 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 and we can click on this location button 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 click next to it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.369
 our current position is taken 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.439
 or we can easily do it here too 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 choose a place so for example 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.340
 Hamburg as this is also stated 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 from hamburg to munich and then you can 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 we just once the route 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.430
 calculate and then of course afterwards too 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.840
 the price we have in addition 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.880
 the possibility of round trip 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 or just calculate the easy ride 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 and can stretch here now 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.600
 calculate and then click us 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.640
 then shown here how far this 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.700
 because the distance is in kilometers and the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 driving time of a track and that will be her 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 then with google maps again 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.619
 illustrates graphically that takes then 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.420
 a little moment and then that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.100
 shown here on continue 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.930
 click and then we have the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 possibility here directly the route 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.799
 then you entered the price 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.170
 we of course reduce here or 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.380
 can increase for our current 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.240
 consumption 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.150
 We can also specify that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.070
 7.5 liters on average and the price 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.050
 in euro , of course, then based 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.640
 your current gas station to 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.990
 give an example here 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.700
 and then we come in addition 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.380
 choose how many people involved 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.990
 with a bicycle, for example, three people 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.660
 when consuming son of 7.5 liters 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.760
 100 kilometers and then just here 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.470
 the price per liter and then the distance 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.630
 and next we'll just shoot 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.360
 to calculate and already be here 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.130
 the total cost displayed that is 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.050
 of course, now for this example 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.820
 expensive but if you have a smaller one 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.040
 track fibers are here as well 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.510
 lower prices indicated the advantage 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.890
 that is also directly the cost per 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.180
 person so if you are 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.800
 you have to divide if you have several 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.690
 you have a personal ride here directly 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.220
 this division we can on good 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.780
 then we will never start 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.790
 google maps the apple website 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.620
 forwarded and then we can do that 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.870
 just as navigation we can use 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.820
 to share the fuel costs or back to 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.620
 main menu or input 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.480
 change if we put on the amount 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.040
 go and calculate on price then go 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.780
 we have the possibility that all still 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.480
 to give once but just one 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.350
 self-selected distance kilometers 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.780
 select and then again the price 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.880
 the consumption and of course the number 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.310
 the person and overall, I find that 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.870
 actually very practical 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.760
 simply summarized but we have 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.020
 all important functions in one 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.650
 look and can then directly 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.780
 divide 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.400
 How many people paid how much 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.290
 We must be able to use the consumption 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.780
 Enter the route we then too 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.070
 directly in the navi via the apple maps app 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.840
 then you can play 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.940
 and I like that really well 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.380
 and because the app is also free 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.320
 I only recommend you if you are 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.670
 stretch calculated euro distances are 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.100
 and that's why I can do it personally 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.810
 also really recommend it because they are 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.340
 It is worth this app for free 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.459
 once download and on each 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.140
 case to test from me so a whole 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.340
 clear recommendation i would like now 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.500
 your opinion below in the comments 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.420
 I would very much like to know what 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.370
 do you think of this app or do you know it 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.540
 other alternatives write it to me 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.490
 everything in the comments 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.900
 I would be very interested in you 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.850
 like to bypass the video a download 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.620
 if you liked more wanted 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.570
 apple views if yes write me 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.950
 the apps that you like to view tab want 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.419
 and in the comments
