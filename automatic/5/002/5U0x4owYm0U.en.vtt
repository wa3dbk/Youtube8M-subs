this<00:00:22.060> has<00:00:22.119> to<00:00:22.419> be<00:00:22.509> the<00:00:22.630> one<00:00:22.810> that<00:00:22.960> caught<00:00:23.199> me

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
this has to be the one that caught me

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.170 
this has to be the one that caught me
most<00:00:23.650> off-guard<00:00:24.220> because<00:00:24.460> counter-strike<00:00:25.119> is

most off-guard because counter-strike is

most off-guard because counter-strike is
world<00:00:25.840> renowned<00:00:26.289> for<00:00:26.439> being<00:00:26.770> such<00:00:27.099> a<00:00:27.130> PC

was<00:00:29.769> a<00:00:29.800> ported<00:00:30.250> thing<00:00:30.490> from<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.849> console

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
was a ported thing from a console

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.060 
was a ported thing from a console
apparently<00:00:32.050> while<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.439> port<00:00:32.680> was<00:00:32.739> actually

apparently while the port was actually
being<00:00:33.220> developed<00:00:33.430> valve<00:00:34.000> said<00:00:34.300> hey<00:00:34.540> this<00:00:34.960> is

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
being developed valve said hey this is

being developed valve said hey this is
actually<00:00:35.290> really<00:00:35.710> good<00:00:35.980> maybe<00:00:36.280> we<00:00:36.400> should

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
actually really good maybe we should

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.610 
actually really good maybe we should
make<00:00:36.850> this<00:00:37.000> into<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.360> pool<00:00:37.660> game<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.230> then<00:00:38.530> a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
make this into a pool game and then a

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.970 
make this into a pool game and then a
few<00:00:38.800> years<00:00:38.860> later<00:00:39.250> we<00:00:39.760> got<00:00:39.790> csgo<00:00:40.710> number<00:00:41.710> four

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980

balance this one seems actually very

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.350 
balance this one seems actually very
weird<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:48.069> know<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.429> one<00:01:48.640> side<00:01:48.880> has<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.090> more

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
weird to know that one side has a more

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
dollars that's a good show

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.280 
dollars that's a good show
could<00:02:24.939> change<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.360> just<00:02:25.540> playing<00:02:25.810> some<00:02:25.989> games

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
could change for just playing some games

could change for just playing some games
but<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.860> doesn't<00:02:27.159> even<00:02:27.189> compare<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.879> the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
but it doesn't even compare to the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
millions of dollars this is definitely

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.599 
millions of dollars this is definitely
better<00:02:32.109> than<00:02:32.260> years<00:02:32.650> ago<00:02:32.920> when<00:02:33.099> these<00:02:33.310> players

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
better than years ago when these players

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.339 
better than years ago when these players
were<00:02:33.879> making<00:02:34.209> next<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.659> nothing<00:02:35.019> it's<00:02:35.200> just

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349

showing how far eSports are coming and
if<00:02:37.599> it's<00:02:37.750> gonna<00:02:37.870> be<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.109> bigger<00:02:38.379> thing<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
if it's gonna be a bigger thing in the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.559 
if it's gonna be a bigger thing in the
future<00:02:39.430> where<00:02:39.609> players<00:02:39.790> are<00:02:40.060> making<00:02:40.150> bigger

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569

salaries<00:02:41.170> teams<00:02:41.680> are<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> little<00:02:42.159> more<00:02:42.310> stable

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
salaries teams are a little more stable

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.399

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.199 
and overall the game has just played a
bit<00:02:44.680> better<00:02:44.859> this<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.519> good<00:02:45.700> because<00:02:45.879> if<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
bit better this is good because if the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.940 
bit better this is good because if the
money<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.599> there<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.989> means<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.500> talent

eSports wasn't paying that much maybe

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.190 
eSports wasn't paying that much maybe
now<00:02:57.909> that<00:02:57.939> eSports<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.659> starting<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.989> become<00:02:59.079> a

bigger<00:02:59.439> thing<00:02:59.769> maybe<00:02:59.980> players<00:03:00.310> will<00:03:00.549> start<00:03:00.670> to

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
bigger thing maybe players will start to

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.729 
bigger thing maybe players will start to
actually<00:03:01.030> get<00:03:01.359> paid<00:03:01.569> so<00:03:01.989> they<00:03:02.109> can<00:03:02.260> live<00:03:02.500> off

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.920 
there they can just keep practicing and
overall<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.669> competition<00:03:07.329> should<00:03:07.629> get

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
overall the competition should get

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.839

better into the future until this

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.339 
better into the future until this

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
becomes a real big legitimate thing

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.440 
becomes a real big legitimate thing
number<00:03:15.040> one<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.700> something<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.060> lot<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.239> you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
number one and something a lot of you

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.210 
number one and something a lot of you
new<00:03:16.689> players<00:03:16.989> probably<00:03:17.260> didn't<00:03:17.620> know<00:03:17.739> csgo

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
new players probably didn't know csgo

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.129 
new players probably didn't know csgo
when<00:03:18.669> it<00:03:18.760> launched<00:03:19.030> actually<00:03:19.510> didn't<00:03:19.930> have

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
when it launched actually didn't have

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.740 
when it launched actually didn't have
skins<00:03:20.650> csgo<00:03:21.189> gained<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.730> lot<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.000> popularity<00:03:22.120> I

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
skins csgo gained a lot of popularity I

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.420 
skins csgo gained a lot of popularity I
think<00:03:22.959> part<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.500> due<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.739> skins<00:03:24.189> and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
think part of that is due to skins and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.949 
think part of that is due to skins and
skins<00:03:24.669> being<00:03:24.879> worth<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.299> much<00:03:25.450> money<00:03:25.659> that's

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
skins being worth so much money that's

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.509 
skins being worth so much money that's
what<00:03:26.109> brought<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.319> lot<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.680> general<00:03:27.040> intrigue

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
what brought a lot of general intrigue

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.979 
what brought a lot of general intrigue
into<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.000> game<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.419> that's<00:03:28.540> why<00:03:28.720> case

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
into the game and that's why case

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.229 
into the game and that's why case
openings<00:03:29.500> are<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:29.829> popular<00:03:30.129> yeah<00:03:30.940> actually

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
openings are so popular yeah actually

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.699 
openings are so popular yeah actually
when<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.720> game<00:03:31.900> started<00:03:32.260> there<00:03:32.409> wasn't<00:03:32.560> a

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
when the game started there wasn't a

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.830 
when the game started there wasn't a
competitive<00:03:33.220> mode<00:03:33.489> or<00:03:33.699> skins<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.569> lot<00:03:34.810> of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
competitive mode or skins and a lot of

you are just probably like what the fuck

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.819 
you are just probably like what the fuck
did<00:03:36.970> people<00:03:37.239> do<00:03:37.599> then<00:03:37.900> they<00:03:38.379> played<00:03:38.650> either

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
did people do then they played either

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.580 
did people do then they played either
arms<00:03:39.459> race<00:03:39.790> or<00:03:40.359> they<00:03:40.569> went<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.019> community

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590

surfers<00:03:42.159> like<00:03:42.879> I<00:03:43.000> said<00:03:43.209> personally<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.720> don't

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
surfers like I said personally I don't

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.780 
surfers like I said personally I don't
think<00:03:44.139> csgo<00:03:44.590> would<00:03:44.889> be<00:03:45.040> where<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.579> right

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
think csgo would be where it is right

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.550 
think csgo would be where it is right
now<00:03:45.970> if<00:03:46.180> they<00:03:46.299> didn't<00:03:46.629> actually<00:03:46.810> introduce

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
now if they didn't actually introduce

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.289 
now if they didn't actually introduce
these<00:03:47.769> skins<00:03:48.129> because<00:03:48.340> they<00:03:48.609> are<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.120> popular

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
these skins because they are so popular

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.330 
these skins because they are so popular
now<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.169> adds<00:03:50.379> another<00:03:50.500> feature<00:03:51.099> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340
