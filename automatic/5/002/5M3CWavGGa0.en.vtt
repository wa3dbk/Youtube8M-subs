place on minecraft xbox one and

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.480 
place on minecraft xbox one and
playstation<00:04:46.290> 4<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.190> could<00:04:47.340> download

community maps and upload your own
community<00:04:49.800> maps<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.220> think<00:04:50.730> that<00:04:50.820> would<00:04:50.910> be<00:04:50.970> a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
community maps I think that would be a

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.700 
community maps I think that would be a
great<00:04:51.270> addition<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:51.900> I'd<00:04:52.020> love<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.320> see<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.530> I

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
great addition so I'd love to see that I

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.500 
great addition so I'd love to see that I
did<00:04:52.980> tweet<00:04:53.190> it<00:04:53.280> towards<00:04:53.670> them<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.360> just

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
did tweet it towards them and I just

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.550 
did tweet it towards them and I just
think<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.720> would<00:04:54.840> be<00:04:54.900> overall<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.410> great

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
think that would be overall a great

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.590 
think that would be overall a great
experience<00:04:56.250> but<00:04:56.520> we<00:04:56.970> do<00:04:57.090> have<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.300> hold<00:04:57.450> out<00:04:57.570> a

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
experience but we do have to hold out a

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.820 
experience but we do have to hold out a
little<00:04:57.690> bit<00:04:57.810> longer<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.410> i<00:04:58.470> would<00:04:58.620> expect

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
little bit longer but i would expect

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.830 
little bit longer but i would expect
