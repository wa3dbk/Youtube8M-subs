00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.979
 in his review of xbox 360 emulators for 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.990
 personal computer 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:09.640
 I casually stated that the working emulator 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.950
 playstation 3 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.530
 I donâ€™t have my videos 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.359
 be based on primary sources in this 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.869
 case of official emulator website 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:22.179
 playstation 3 called rcc with 3 where 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.769
 it is written in black and white that the launch 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.119
 commercial games at the moment 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.829
 impossible and generally emulator very raw 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.560
 the vigilant viewer countered me how 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.200
 recently updated and there even more 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.060
 I want to run games 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.040
 say thank you for this comment 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.950
 and since the topic is interesting not only to us 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.410
 two people want to answer it in this video 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.340
 the main problem is that this site is on 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.070
 Russian language 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.060
 you all know very well how I feel about 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.580
 any translations 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.310
 if the official emulator site was 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.500
 Russian-speaking bazaar is not but in this 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.320
 case the site of the emulator is in English 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.450
 and let's go to the source there 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.250
 there is a forum for launching commercial games 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.239
 that is, available on discs or in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.390
 playstation network 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.590
 here we are interested in two sections of the floor 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.560
 running 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.960
 and starting let's start with the floor 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.390
 Starting as you can see the list of titles 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.240
 fits on one page and they all 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.240
 fucked up what famous and interesting and 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.729
 just one right playstation 3 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.890
 exclusives of more or less known 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.280
 street fighter 3 and sonic titles only 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.080
 sit down 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.520
 when you start the street fighter visible 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.490
 screen saver and main menu 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.670
 as well as the side menu of the characters themselves are not 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.830
 no game can be seen at this stage 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.620
 out of question sonic situation 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.150
 a little better it starts but slows down 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.010
 godlessly it seems to me he gives the floor fps then 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.770
 there is one frame drawn for 2 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.409
 seconds besides the last improvements 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.960
 emulator and do hang the game too 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.080
 unplayable go to section 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.270
 playable games here list is much 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.880
 more modest and consists of only one 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.369
 Tetris title goes more or less 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.069
 tolerably well we always dreamed of playing 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.650
 in tetris on 5 ready multi-core 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.849
 water cooled 16th processor 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.099
 gigami RAM 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.409
 this processor alone is comparable by 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.780
 price with stitched playstation 3 complete 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.969
 so my statement remains valid 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.980
 despite the fact that the work goes 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.109
 some progress has been made and in general 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.329
 Well done guys emulator 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.299
 playstation 3 on a personal computer 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.129
 at the moment there is no 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.169
 take the first blur with 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.290
 exclusive type heavy rain or metal 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:40.859
 gear solid 4 and start chopping into it at 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.859
 computer
