00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
nature of warning people with

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.100 
nature of warning people with
killstreaks<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.040> ridiculous<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.509> just

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
killstreaks was just ridiculous and just

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
some of the community parts were messed

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.969 
some of the community parts were messed
up<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.299> overall<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.020> did<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> game

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
up but overall I did like the game

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.450 
up but overall I did like the game
itself<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.200> problems<00:01:31.740> even

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
itself you know with this problems even

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
itself you know with this problems even
with<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> danger<00:01:33.030> close<00:01:33.270> even<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> new

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
with the danger close even with the new

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.149 
with the danger close even with the new
tubes<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.770> IW<00:01:37.770> net<00:01:37.950> just

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
tubes and go on and on but IW net just

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.660 
tubes and go on and on but IW net just
made<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> unplayable<00:01:39.950> especially<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> pc

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
made it unplayable especially on the pc

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
made it unplayable especially on the pc
platform<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.540> relied<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:42.930> was

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
platform because one relied on was

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.999 
platform because one relied on was
peer-to-peer<00:01:43.740> connections<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.790> you'd<00:01:45.450> be

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
peer-to-peer connections and you'd be

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
peer-to-peer connections and you'd be
it's<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.189> rolling<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> dice<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:47.970> terms<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it's like rolling the dice in terms of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
it's like rolling the dice in terms of
finding<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.560> match<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.549> won't<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> lot<00:01:51.630> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
finding a match that won't have a lot of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.520
