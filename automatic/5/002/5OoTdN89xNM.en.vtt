came<00:00:16.650> out<00:00:16.830> out<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.210> manufacturing<00:00:18.210> some<00:00:18.480> fake

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
came out out of manufacturing some fake

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.840 
came out out of manufacturing some fake
goods<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> scanner<00:00:20.310> balls<00:00:20.640> is

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
goods so the scanner balls is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.970 
goods so the scanner balls is
manufacturer<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.050> process<00:00:22.830> they're

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
manufacturer and the process they're

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.279 
manufacturer and the process they're
using<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.460> make<00:00:23.670> medicine<00:00:24.180> capsules<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
using to make medicine capsules and so

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.269 
using to make medicine capsules and so
how<00:00:25.410> they're<00:00:25.560> doing<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.099> they're

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
how they're doing is that they're

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
how they're doing is that they're
collecting<00:00:26.699> wasted<00:00:27.240> leather<00:00:27.510> from<00:00:27.900> landfills

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
collecting wasted leather from landfills

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.130 
collecting wasted leather from landfills
dipping<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> some<00:00:30.000> chemicals<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> then

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
dipping in it is some chemicals and then

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
dipping in it is some chemicals and then
eventually<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.890> making<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.369> gelatin<00:00:32.790> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
eventually the making that gelatin that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.940 
eventually the making that gelatin that
seems<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> capsules<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
seems to make the capsules and so this

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
seems to make the capsules and so this
is<00:00:35.040> dangerous<00:00:35.250> because<00:00:35.520> actually<00:00:36.000> supply<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
is dangerous because actually supply to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.590 
is dangerous because actually supply to
China<00:00:37.350> one-third<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> capsule<00:00:39.180> they<00:00:39.300> use

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
China one-third of the capsule they use

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.139 
China one-third of the capsule they use
and<00:00:39.989> tests<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.710> shown<00:00:40.739> their<00:00:41.579> capsules<00:00:42.000> have

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and tests have shown their capsules have

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.810 
and tests have shown their capsules have
high<00:00:42.420> traces<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.140> metal<00:00:43.440> chronium<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.640> good

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
high traces of metal chronium so good

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.209 
high traces of metal chronium so good
thing<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.120> calm<00:00:45.629> fuck<00:00:46.379> one-third<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
thing they got calm fuck one-third of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.690 
thing they got calm fuck one-third of
