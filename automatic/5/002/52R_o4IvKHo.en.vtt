00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.460
 Hello dear 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.650
 I am a visitor to our site with 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.530
 winner we take off 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 how many videos and you 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:22.480
 why did not the wings of angels grow from seed and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.529
 want to see what's next 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 it turns out 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 and in general, there is something to tell 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:36.070
 Please look at our tits from 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.079
 About 12 seeds I grew first 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.540
 two seeds and it was just 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.149
 the most mature seeds with dark 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.969
 the shell the rest were white and I think 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.699
 that all here on 2 seedlings everything stopped 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.339
 the rest will not sprout here dear 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.039
 friends please look here in this 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:59.859
 I first planted these 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:02.859
 roses and look here they are here 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:07.270
 came out much, much later 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:10.180
 probably three weeks after 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.140
 and even a month after that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.479
 These roses have grown here successfully is 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.420
 there is now need not despair and 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:25.600
 keep watering your crops and quite 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:27.430
 maybe you have these roses and go yes 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.659
 what else do I want to say here in this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.670
 I became a lot 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.250
 and from tea you expect that I have here that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.890
 then grow I sowed the delphiniums 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.189
 and put it on a stratification that's how 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.909
 probably once stratification could 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.630
 that these seeds here are two more seeds 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.240
 ascended 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.350
 but look dear friends what's here 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.049
 I got another one 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 the seed has slipped and here it is 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.679
 apparently in store at swordplay here she is 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.679
 this little sprout that's when he 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.789
 I apparently amusement along with this 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.960
 for families 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.410
 took and with a lump of earth, too, moved there 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.840
 in the soil here this seed that I have in the first place 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.070
 I want to show here that he has a seed cap 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.500
 did not fly off to shoot his hand in any way 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.580
 the case is not necessary here so quietly just 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.870
 lukewarm water poured over him 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.240
 two or three times a day 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.730
 little by little then with the rolls it's seed 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.010
 case of lukewarm water 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.880
 he soaks and takes off himself later 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.820
 so now 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.010
 what else do I want to say ask need 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.710
 Do you already feed these roses if 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.070
 so they have grown up with us and what can 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.780
 I want to introduce it to you 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.290
 very comfortable and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.520
 fertilizer this fertilizer ava 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.980
 probably everyone knows this brand but here it is 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.920
 Available in various modifications for 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.060
 annual flowers for vegetable crops and 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.780
 here it is with us here for perennial 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.150

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.640
 we have with you roses angel wings 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.730
 perennial plant and we will have it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.570
 grow in the ground and we can well 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.640
 Now use this time to get here 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.560
 how to use it 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.750
 separate instruction is offered and 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.000
 in fact, you can on the Internet 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:37.560
 find the way here on this packaging even 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.430
 It is written that the dose is much lower 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.830
 than ordinary other fertilizers that is it 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.709
 Keep in mind here is no need to strew 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.830
 how we attracted accustomed with you taught 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.530
 Well, what kind of sypanuli 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:57.150
 plus or minus bast Here's Who for 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.800
 introduction is much lower for indoor 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.220
 colors for example they are well with us 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.459
 perennial with you till 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.250
 one and 1 3 granules used 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.370
 just think about 1 3 granule 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.130
 used on liter shelf so 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.840
 it's concentrated in general 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.299
 fertilizer and long acting i.e. 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.989
 she did not immediately take her concentrate 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.660
 releases the soil and gradually when the bang 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.870
 Khan metered so dissolves and 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.300
 nourishes your plants exactly 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.969
 because once you contributed and you can 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.819
 further calm 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.909
 care for your plants knowing that she 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:40.789
 getting enough food here i am you 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.779
 show such little blue look 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.319
 graphics 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:48.049
 and there it was written and that 1 3 large 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.309
 large granules see they are different here 

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:53.059
 different caliber 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:54.349
 1 3 large granules per 1 liter of soil and 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.709
 since we are here 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:01.069
 you are a little pot so small 

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:04.159
 some kind of granule q and somewhere in 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:08.289
 little corner here so that it is still not very 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:12.799
 close to the roots were here I am here here here 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:17.719
 about a centimeter I deepen here from 

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:19.759
 2 pot I also put here now 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.239
 see here I am in the little corner now 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:26.059
 I 'll put it the same for deeper and when i 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:28.779
 I will water here gradually 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:31.879
 it all dissolve and mine 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:34.909
 the plant will feed this fertilizer 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:37.759
 comprehensive here is all nutritious 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.689
 the substances of the plant are very good on them 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:45.050
 responds improves leaf color 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:47.119
 color intensity is improved then 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.819
 I have enjoyed this approval 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:52.249
 for example on a violet I definitely saw 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.069
 I have the result of a tethering violet 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:58.279
 It was which I bought at the store 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.139
 You know such was was selling at a discount 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:02.809
 sleep sick plant sorry for him I was 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.479
 You bought without flowers I was told that 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:08.360
 rose blossomed first dirty-pink 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.610
 of some strange color further I 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.949
 start caring for her to feed 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.039
 this fertilizer is remarkably bright 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.269
 pink is a good remedy that is 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.579
 Normal fertilizer such can 

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:22.299
 enjoy and of course dear friends 

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:25.569
 take any seedling fertilizer 

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:28.969
 what is now sold in the store and 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:32.619
 dare feed your roses 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:36.110
 the only thing i want to say i would 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:38.490
 probably reduced the dose of this fertilizer 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.270
 once again get away quite a small lower 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.250
 their roots are thin and in general 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.860
 probably you should not immediately remove the full 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:51.389
 a friend has a lot of burden for such plants 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:55.319
 still do not need dressing here is not a delphinium 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:58.169
 not rosettes here quite so 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.960
 small enough food and then already 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.599
 feed your plants by 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.050
 as their development will see that the leaves 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:09.990
 for example, turn yellow as they somehow turn pale 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.509
 it means they need food 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.610
 if not then don't care much 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:17.970
 why i say so because here 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:21.060
 now dear friends we still march go 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.789
 not very long light from the window we do not 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.520
 enough and if we will stimulate 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:29.400
 our plant active feedings then 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.699
 she can begin to draw that is 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.979
 grow actively with a lack of light on 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:38.639
 will begin to draw well so expensive 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:41.270
 friends make us happy will stretch their own 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:43.729
 nice cheerful green leaves 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:49.340
 we will rejoice with him 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:49.340
 spring sunshine will wait for them to bloom
