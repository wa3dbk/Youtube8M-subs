00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
along the way you can break them down

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.830 
along the way you can break them down
into<00:00:22.080> components<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.880> materials<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.750> you

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
into components and materials that you

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.330 
into components and materials that you
can<00:00:25.019> use<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.170> crafting<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.010> course<00:00:26.220> that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
can use for crafting and of course that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.730 
can use for crafting and of course that
also<00:00:26.369> gives<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> some<00:00:27.359> experience<00:00:27.840> items

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
also gives you some experience items

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.040 
also gives you some experience items
that<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:28.980> find<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.519> jute<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> plants

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that we find so jute that's the plants

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.560 
that we find so jute that's the plants
that<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.289> were<00:00:31.410> harvesting<00:00:32.239> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.390> load

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that we were harvesting you can load

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.959 
that we were harvesting you can load
them<00:00:33.690> up<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.079> it'll<00:00:34.530> create<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.700> jute

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
them up and it'll create the jute

them up and it'll create the jute
materials<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> need<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.290> create<00:00:40.559> cloth

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
materials that you need to create cloth

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.840 
materials that you need to create cloth
items<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.140> also<00:00:43.260> find<00:00:43.590> rawhide<00:00:44.190> scraps

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
items you can also find rawhide scraps

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
items you can also find rawhide scraps
and<00:00:45.920> those<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.250> find<00:00:47.550> usually<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.329> animals

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and those we find usually from animals

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.160 
and those we find usually from animals
and<00:00:49.879> you<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.090> scan<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.600> anything<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.110> just

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and you don't scan or anything it's just

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.979 
and you don't scan or anything it's just
it's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.739> drop<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:54.030> need<00:00:54.180> 10<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it's a drop you need 10 of them to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
it's a drop you need 10 of them to
create<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.899> Rama<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.890> refine<00:00:59.219> material<00:00:59.730> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
create the Rama the refine material so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.689 
create the Rama the refine material so
right<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.690> can't<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.699> that's

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
right now we can't do that that's

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
right now we can't do that that's
basically<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.359> refining<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.260> breaking

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
basically it for refining and breaking

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
basically it for refining and breaking
down<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:05.159> into<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> creation<00:01:06.290> I've<00:01:07.290> got

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

great items now the same thing goes with
anything<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.049> you<00:02:35.140> create<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.160> then<00:02:37.319> d

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
anything that you create you can then d

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.460 
anything that you create you can then d
destruct<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:41.019> get<00:02:41.140> some<00:02:41.319> of<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
destruct and you can get some of the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.190 
destruct and you can get some of the
components<00:02:41.769> back<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.519> need<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.420> then

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
so basically you can just basically keep

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.319 
so basically you can just basically keep
going<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.959> creating<00:02:47.530> stuff<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:48.850> you're<00:02:49.120> if

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
going and creating stuff if you're if

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.910 
going and creating stuff if you're if
you're<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.600> leveling<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.470> create

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you're just leveling you create

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.220 
you're just leveling you create
deconstruct<00:02:51.790> create<00:02:52.209> deconstruct<00:02:52.959> until

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
deconstruct create deconstruct until

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.729 
deconstruct create deconstruct until
you're<00:02:53.320> out<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.470> materials<00:02:54.209> once<00:02:55.209> you're<00:02:55.739> out

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
you're out of materials once you're out

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.590 
you're out of materials once you're out
of<00:02:56.980> materials<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.489> got<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.790> go<00:02:57.850> out<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.000> start

of materials you got to go out and start

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.410 
of materials you got to go out and start
harvesting<00:02:58.840> again<00:02:59.350> again<00:03:00.130> when<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.209> find

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
harvesting again again when you find

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.610 
harvesting again again when you find
weapons<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.959> stuff<00:03:02.079> you're<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.560> to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
weapons and stuff you're not going to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.530 
weapons and stuff you're not going to
use<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.519> aren't<00:03:03.850> assigning<00:03:04.239> on<00:03:04.329> doing

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
use and you aren't assigning on doing

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.630 
use and you aren't assigning on doing
crafting<00:03:04.959> save<00:03:05.470> everything<00:03:05.890> break<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.549> all

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
crafting save everything break it all

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.870 
crafting save everything break it all
down<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:08.680> even<00:03:08.859> if<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.130> don't<00:03:09.459> use<00:03:09.549> that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
down because even if you don't use that

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.580 
down because even if you don't use that
particular<00:03:10.060> material<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.139> can<00:03:11.260> trade<00:03:11.500> it

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
particular material you can trade it

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.620 
particular material you can trade it
with<00:03:11.620> other<00:03:11.829> crafters<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.940> if<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.180> break<00:03:13.420> down

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
with other crafters so if you break down

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.449 
with other crafters so if you break down
the<00:03:13.959> or<00:03:14.170> items<00:03:15.000> trade<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.120> or<00:03:16.269> for<00:03:16.660> jute<00:03:17.019> and

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
the or items trade the or for jute and

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.440 
the or items trade the or for jute and
because<00:03:18.459> all<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:18.730> crafters<00:03:19.090> will<00:03:19.180> be<00:03:19.239> doing

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
because all the crafters will be doing

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.970 
because all the crafters will be doing
the<00:03:19.540> same

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the same

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.660 
the same
and<00:03:20.250> then<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:20.940> way<00:03:22.129> you'll<00:03:23.129> save<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.459> time

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
and then this way you'll save you time

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.580 
and then this way you'll save you time
from<00:03:26.150> harvesting<00:03:27.150> hopefully<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.230> helps<00:03:28.500> a

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
from harvesting hopefully that helps a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.739 
from harvesting hopefully that helps a
bit
