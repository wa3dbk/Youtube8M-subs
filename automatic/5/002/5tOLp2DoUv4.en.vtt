00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
of the old Christ not little not that he

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.399 
of the old Christ not little not that he
would<00:04:09.989> return<00:04:10.229> himself<00:04:11.509> when<00:04:12.509> he<00:04:12.659> comes<00:04:12.959> his

main task would be to break the cross
which<00:04:17.340> means<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.470> break

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
which means the to break

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.689 
which means the to break
the<00:04:20.829> central<00:04:21.509> argument<00:04:22.509> of<00:04:23.520> Christianity<00:04:24.520> in

the central argument of Christianity in

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.680 
the central argument of Christianity in

favor of Trinity this is cross this is a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.620 
favor of Trinity this is cross this is a
symbol<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.050> cross<00:04:29.289> Trinity<00:04:30.150> so<00:04:31.150> he<00:04:31.300> would<00:04:31.419> come

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
symbol of cross Trinity so he would come

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.080 
symbol of cross Trinity so he would come
and<00:04:31.930> break<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.830> cross<00:04:33.070> spiritually<00:04:33.910> in<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
and break the cross spiritually in the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
and break the cross spiritually in the
sense<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.630> he<00:04:35.500> would<00:04:35.669> offer<00:04:36.690> provide<00:04:37.690> such

sense that he would offer provide such

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.640 
sense that he would offer provide such
powerful<00:04:38.530> arguments<00:04:39.780> against<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.169> Trinity

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
powerful arguments against the Trinity

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.659 
powerful arguments against the Trinity
as<00:04:41.860> if<00:04:42.250> cross<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.759> broken<00:04:44.130> not<00:04:45.130> literally<00:04:45.520> of

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
as if cross is broken not literally of

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
course he would kill swine means that he

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.240 
course he would kill swine means that he
would<00:04:50.139> raise<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.710> war<00:04:51.039> against<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:52.060> culture

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250

permissive as you find this - so it is

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.000 
permissive as you find this - so it is
again<00:05:09.220> an<00:05:09.789> expression<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.510> rejection<00:05:11.410> of<00:05:11.770> a
