00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.570 

so<00:00:00.780> here's<00:00:01.020> my<00:00:01.230> vertical<00:00:01.650> takeoff<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.460> the

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
so here's my vertical takeoff in the

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.410 
so here's my vertical takeoff in the
yard<00:00:02.850> right<00:00:03.149> now<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.570> 3-cell<00:00:04.140> battery

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
yard right now it's on a 3-cell battery

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.589 
yard right now it's on a 3-cell battery
when<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:06.569> going<00:00:06.779> up<00:00:07.140> or<00:00:07.500> hovering<00:00:08.160> like

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
when it's going up or hovering like

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.450 
when it's going up or hovering like
still<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.870> not<00:00:10.050> gaining<00:00:10.410> out<00:00:10.740> or<00:00:11.040> not<00:00:11.219> losing

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
still and not gaining out or not losing

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.089 
still and not gaining out or not losing
altitude<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:12.509> pretty<00:00:12.750> stable<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.830> when<00:00:13.980> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
altitude it's pretty stable but when it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.430 
altitude it's pretty stable but when it
starts<00:00:14.370> going<00:00:14.549> down<00:00:14.940> like<00:00:15.389> right<00:00:15.599> here<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
starts going down like right here it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.580 
starts going down like right here it
starts<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.490> go<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.510> circles<00:00:18.750> not<00:00:19.320> not

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
starts to like go in circles not not

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.490 
starts to like go in circles not not
spin<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.670> starts<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> kind<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.539> go<00:00:22.380> in

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
spin but it starts to kind of like go in

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380 
spin but it starts to kind of like go in
circles<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> gets<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.670> unstable<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
circles and it gets really unstable and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.599 
circles and it gets really unstable and
it's<00:00:24.539> coming<00:00:24.810> down<00:00:24.920> but<00:00:25.920> when<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.369> up

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
it's coming down but when it's going up

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's coming down but when it's going up
it's<00:00:26.849> fine<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it's fine so I think when it's on the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.919 
it's fine so I think when it's on the
actual<00:00:29.220> plane<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.420> up

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
actual plane and it's going up

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
actual plane and it's going up
that's<00:00:31.410> good<00:00:31.740> it'll<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.279> stable<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.820> doing

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that's good it'll be stable as doing

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.790 
that's good it'll be stable as doing
that<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.329> when<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.630> coming<00:00:33.960> down<00:00:34.200> would<00:00:34.620> be

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that but when it's coming down would be

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.770 
that but when it's coming down would be
the<00:00:34.920> problem<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the problem but I think with all the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
the problem but I think with all the
wing<00:00:36.989> area<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:38.190> would<00:00:38.370> add<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> lot<00:00:38.760> more

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
wing area it it would add a lot more

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.170 
wing area it it would add a lot more
stability<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.280> you'll<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.940> right

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
stability so you'll see that like right

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.360 
stability so you'll see that like right
there<00:00:42.360> where<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> was<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.960> down<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.190> kind

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
there where I was going down it was kind

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:59.520 
there where I was going down it was kind
of<00:00:44.399> serpent

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.990 

now<00:01:00.530> here<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.829> is<00:01:00.860> with<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.160> two<00:01:01.370> cell<00:01:01.640> battery

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
now here it is with a two cell battery

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.200 
now here it is with a two cell battery
of<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.020> to<00:01:03.230> sell<00:01:03.559> nothing<00:01:04.370> gets<00:01:04.519> us<00:01:04.670> hot<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
of the to sell nothing gets us hot the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.200 
of the to sell nothing gets us hot the
ESC<00:01:05.659> stays<00:01:05.930> cooler<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:07.820> still<00:01:08.060> has<00:01:08.180> enough

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
ESC stays cooler and it still has enough

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.290 
ESC stays cooler and it still has enough
power<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:09.320> hover<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.710> go<00:01:10.220> up<00:01:10.490> but<00:01:10.820> just<00:01:11.030> not<00:01:11.150> as

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
power to hover and go up but just not as

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:21.420 
power to hover and go up but just not as
much

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.710 

so<00:01:22.430> another<00:01:22.850> thing<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.150> I<00:01:23.360> can't<00:01:23.600> really

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
so another thing is I can't really

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.149 
so another thing is I can't really
control<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.260> because<00:01:24.770> it's<00:01:24.920> really

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
control it because it's really

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.250 
control it because it's really
disorienting<00:01:25.940> there's<00:01:26.240> really<00:01:26.600> no<00:01:26.840> front<00:01:27.140> and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
disorienting there's really no front and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.020 
disorienting there's really no front and
back<00:01:27.409> on<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.740> that's<00:01:27.920> why<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.159> had<00:01:28.580> that<00:01:28.610> little

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
back on it that's why I had that little

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.090 
back on it that's why I had that little
tail<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:29.869> I<00:01:30.050> still<00:01:30.350> didn't<00:01:30.740> try<00:01:30.950> and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
tail on it but I still didn't try and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.490 
tail on it but I still didn't try and
fly<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.280> much<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.479> I<00:01:32.509> think<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:32.930> like<00:01:33.200> build

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
fly it much then so I think I like build

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.320 
fly it much then so I think I like build
a<00:01:33.590> little<00:01:33.830> fake<00:01:34.070> fuselage<00:01:34.670> around<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.150> like

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
a little fake fuselage around it like

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.980 
a little fake fuselage around it like
I'm<00:01:35.479> full

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
I'm full

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.040 
I'm full
fake<00:01:36.530> fuselage<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.700> then<00:01:37.970> try<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:38.600> also

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
fake fuselage and then try it and also

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.580 
fake fuselage and then try it and also
that'll<00:01:39.619> tell<00:01:39.920> me<00:01:40.040> how<00:01:40.220> like<00:01:40.970> if<00:01:41.240> it'll<00:01:41.590> like

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
that'll tell me how like if it'll like

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.290 
that'll tell me how like if it'll like
an<00:01:42.890> air<00:01:43.190> brake<00:01:43.430> when<00:01:43.640> they're<00:01:43.759> trying<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.060> go

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
an air brake when they're trying to go

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.540 
an air brake when they're trying to go
up<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.810> if<00:01:45.140> it'll<00:01:45.320> keep<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.649> more<00:01:45.800> stable<00:01:46.130> and

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
up and if it'll keep it more stable and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.969 
up and if it'll keep it more stable and
it's<00:01:46.670> trying<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.970> come<00:01:47.119> down<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:48.290> I'll<00:01:48.649> do<00:01:48.920> that

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
it's trying to come down so I'll do that

00:01:48.979 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's trying to come down so I'll do that
later

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:15.220 

I<00:02:04.790> should<00:02:05.790> go<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.060> way
