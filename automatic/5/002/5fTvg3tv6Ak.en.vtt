00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.240
 what wave gamers are welcome 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.340
 what is the video presentation of the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.639
 good channel without first saying no thank you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.590
 when writing with for leaving me to be in 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.109
 a small space of your channel and good 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 so let's start my channel is based on 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.560
 pure gameplay commented but right now 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.780
 I'm getting halo reach tutorials 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.150
 good because I've been five years when 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.930
 competitive and not competitive and it got me 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.600
 He made a very good idea to give him tips on how 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.820
 to get better faster because when I 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.800
 start from scratch I had to go play and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.129
 playing when one year two years three years 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.949
 to be improving well if you have 11 12 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.690
 years but if there is someone older than 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.120
 is teaching you that yes it is 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.309
 giving good tips to be improving more 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 quick then what better then I 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 He made a very good idea and well, those are the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.549
 tutorials that I'm uploading right now 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 on the other side I have gears of war 3 and 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.109
 modern warfare 2 of gameplays commented 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.639
 that are good gameplays and so 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.129
 obviously I comment them very logically 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:08.040
 there are some that are not commented but 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.810
 12 but they are still good and their is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.710
 my channel itself 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.049
 and the simple comments of my good self 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.390
 I'm 16 years old that I did not do this like 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.640
 a month or two months and I'm just going 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 mission subscribers my subscribers 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.100
 well they call me jacobo 22 because there was a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.830
 program of a guy who repeated two 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.049
 times things a lot and well I repeat 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.079
 things sometimes come out to me because I do not 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.560
 is that purpose but I repeat it two 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.450
 times 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.490
 equally between are because to see if it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.770
 I get offered a cannon that's not my 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.539
 equal fault is not intentionally and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.399
 like five more points but I no longer 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.459
 agreement that I do remember was one 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.409
 I was a gamer who was recontracted 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.110
 But what can you do ? 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.390
 subscribers and I love them and well they are already 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.220
 take a little about the subject yeah yeah I want you 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.899
 the channel grows I want it to have many 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.849
 subscribers who have many views 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.080
 well that they do not want that but 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.240
 obviously I'm going to win it with 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.849
 effort and dedication and obviously a 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.030
 little support in other channels I'm not 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:11.099
 For me, I am one of those who 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.720
 they really earn them and when they 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.239
 present these opportunities 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.800
 present your work in other channels in 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.620
 other channels and more 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.180
 Well what better to grab it and have it 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.430
 I do not say I'm jacobo the two already 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.830

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.740
 I was saying of the tutorials I have 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.160

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.110

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.280
 that you have already done it or that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.590
 think that if you can do it 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.810
 you can not do it I like the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.310
 Challenges complicated the challenges equal 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.060

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.650
 I usually keep them as long as 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.510
 you know be realistic 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.129
 I got along well with the subscribers 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.049
 I have never plated any 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.269
 I always listen to them in what I 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.159
 they ask in what they answer me if 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.290
 someone tells me that he did not like it 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.180
 the video always ask them why and 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.489
 if they do not answer me anymore 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.560
 I just take it with a troll and so 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.200
 they answer me I take it as something that is going 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.150
 to help improve my channel and so 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.829
