00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.190
 let's start with a tutorial for 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.190
 make link movements that are like that 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.010
 the initial position is going to be the grip 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.640
 palms backwards 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.480
 let's see the right left ring 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.019
 we get to the right side, locating towards 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 behind the right hand pull the hoop towards 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.880
 your body and at the same time 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.030
 while the left is going to go up 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.640
 until we reach this position that we are going to 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.310
 say x's position here to the palms 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.860
 they are facing forward 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.670
 and little by little I will move it 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.100
 enlarged left 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.649
 when I reach this position the hand 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.380
 left endovascular to the side 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.850
 left 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.440
 to lower 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 and you continue with the movement 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.940
 Y 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.450
 if I go to the side it's also 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.450
 important 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.360
 in the same base we go back 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.250
 on the left and moving the right 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.800
 for me to get to the mx position and 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.660
 take it out 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.950
 let's add other more movements 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.720
 when we are in the position in x here 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.050
 let's do it I want 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.500
 let's totally spin half first 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.910
 I turn back and then the front returned 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 here the legs when you can first the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.170
 right leg then on the leg 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.560
 left alternately well 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 can do the other turn 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.400
 then including the sequence I do 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.510
 this first without turning then with turning in 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.510
 X and turns 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.909
 we add one more movement that is going to be 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.820
 another shift to the side 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.100
 right here I turn around in the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.740
 extended up and down 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.800
 and to the left now seeing the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.400
 right I was going to strain it we included it in the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400
 sequence 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.510
 they wanted 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.780
 and we end with the movement of 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.730
 one more movement I'm here in the face 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.370
 with the right hand the left goes to 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.780
 be like 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.780
 to slide 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.780
 movement 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.250
 here back to the hoop and points for 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.250
 behind 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.310
 it can include other movements that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.810
 have seen in other places 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:06.760
