um I think personal would be the best
because<00:01:36.930> everything<00:01:37.829> simple<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.299> percents

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
because everything simple the percents

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.469 
because everything simple the percents
are<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.409> uh<00:01:42.110> standard<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.270> what
