wouldn't expect this good like this go
to<00:01:45.990> quality<00:01:46.560> from<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to quality from there so it's just a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
to quality from there so it's just a
damask<00:01:48.299> budding<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.619> has<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.130> black<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
damask budding and it has this black and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
damask budding and it has this black and
white<00:01:50.880> pattern<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.259> also

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
white pattern on it and then it's also

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.069 
white pattern on it and then it's also
reversible<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> reverse<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.270> pillow<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.049> it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
reversible so I reverse the pillow so it

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.620 
reversible so I reverse the pillow so it
can<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:56.520> pattern<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.420> this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
can go this pattern and then this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.870 
can go this pattern and then this
pattern<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> did<00:01:58.880> opposite

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
pattern so I kind of did opposite

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.969 
pattern so I kind of did opposite
patterns<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.509> my<00:02:00.600> bed<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
white with black damask and then the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.149 
white with black damask and then the
black<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.170> white<00:02:04.320> damask<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:04.829> pillows

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
black with white damask on my pillows

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.880 
black with white damask on my pillows

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
really like the like the buildings are

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.740 
really like the like the buildings are
velvet<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:25.269> really<00:02:25.360> pretty

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
velvet so it's really it's really pretty

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.600 
velvet so it's really it's really pretty
and<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> really<00:02:26.410> works<00:02:26.739> with<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.129> room<00:02:27.340> and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
and it really works with the room and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.479 
and it really works with the room and

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
then I also have this really fuzzy

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.770 
then I also have this really fuzzy
blanket<00:02:30.489> at<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> end<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.269> this<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.510> from

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
blanket at the end and this is from

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.410 
blanket at the end and this is from
target<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.830> think<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.670> fuzzy<00:02:34.090> and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
target I think and it's so fuzzy and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.259 
target I think and it's so fuzzy and
then<00:02:34.569> what<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> really<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.040> about<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.610> it

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
more funkier fact so so then at the end

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.670
