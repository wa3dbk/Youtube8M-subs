00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the conifer this is a chamois Cypress

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770 
the conifer this is a chamois Cypress
and<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> catch<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.510> stem

and what you do is you catch the up stem

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
and what you do is you catch the up stem
like<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.379> pull<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> away<00:00:40.770> from<00:00:41.040> the

like this and you pull it away from the
main<00:00:41.430> stem<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.600> brings<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> little<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
main stem and it brings a little bit of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.340 
main stem and it brings a little bit of
bark<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:46.170> is

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
bark with it like that here and this is

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.950 
bark with it like that here and this is
the<00:00:46.469> part<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> roots<00:00:47.039> grow<00:00:47.280> from<00:00:47.780> any<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the part of the roots grow from any of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.400 
the part of the roots grow from any of
the<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.649> heal<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.989> pick<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> top

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the little heal you can pick up the top

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.439 
the little heal you can pick up the top
there<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> little<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.190> smaller<00:00:53.449> these

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
there to make a little bit smaller these

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.880 
there to make a little bit smaller these
cuttings<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> rooting

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
cuttings can be put into the rooting

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.040 
cuttings can be put into the rooting
hormone<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.360> cheap<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.660> buy<00:00:57.809> and

there's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.710> health<00:00:59.039> promotion<00:00:59.340> new<00:00:59.640> roots<00:01:00.050> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
there's a health promotion new roots so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.599 
there's a health promotion new roots so
you<00:01:01.109> dipped<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.219> give<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you dipped in and just give this a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.820 
you dipped in and just give this a
gentle<00:01:02.940> tap<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.870> remove<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> excess<00:01:04.589> powder

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
gentle tap just remove the excess powder

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
gentle tap just remove the excess powder
and<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.240> pop<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and then you pop that into this

and then you pop that into this
vanishing<00:01:07.650> contrast<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.990> maintain<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
vanishing contrast I maintain you to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
vanishing contrast I maintain you to
consider<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.680> you're<00:01:10.830> collecting<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
consider when you're collecting the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
consider when you're collecting the
coating<00:01:12.090> material<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.500> age<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
coating material is the the age of the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
coating material is the the age of the
plant<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.220> you're<00:01:14.400> collecting<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:14.909> young

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
plant that you're collecting from young

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.120 
plant that you're collecting from young
plants<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.290> Ruth<00:01:16.619> much<00:01:16.830> easier

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
plants will actually Ruth much easier

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.810 
plants will actually Ruth much easier
than<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.460> very<00:01:17.939> old<00:01:18.150> tree<00:01:18.890> also<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.460> health<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
than a very old tree also the health of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.880 
than a very old tree also the health of
the<00:01:20.909> plant<00:01:21.090> too<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.259> show<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the plant too and they can show you this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.070 
the plant too and they can show you this
plant<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.820> camellia<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.840> plant

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
plant here this is a camellia this plant

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
plant here this is a camellia this plant
here<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> yellow<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.430> unhealthy

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
here is like a yellow and very unhealthy

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
here is like a yellow and very unhealthy
looking<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:28.140> full<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> flower<00:01:28.560> buds

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
looking and there's full of flower buds

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
looking and there's full of flower buds
so<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.090> bad<00:01:30.600> run<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
so this one is actually a bad run to the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
so this one is actually a bad run to the
cuttings<00:01:31.500> from<00:01:31.619> because<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.939> also<00:01:33.090> use<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
cuttings from because you can also use a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600 
cuttings from because you can also use a
nice<00:01:33.689> healthy<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:35.460> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
nice healthy one like this here which is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.110 
nice healthy one like this here which is
nice<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.970> green<00:01:36.060> healthy<00:01:36.600> no<00:01:36.780> cloud

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
nice and green healthy no cloud

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.030 
nice and green healthy no cloud
then<00:01:38.270> actually<00:01:39.020> rose<00:01:39.170> much<00:01:39.380> easier<00:01:39.680> than<00:01:39.830> the
