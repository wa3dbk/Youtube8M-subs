00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.559
 story 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 Email text 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.689
 Hayato Kisaragi 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.909
 Chuhoku doubleclick 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.619
 Well this is my opponent 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.509
 I did it though 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.249
 From that 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.870
 If you say that you are in a wide room, that operation is 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.510
 If you are born 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.039
 This is so slender 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.230
 Personally, farmers are strong 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.730
 High 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.730
 Roll is strong 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.580
 2 day schedule 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.140
 But quite 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 That bus net runs 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 The third term since becoming Okuma 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.640
 If it comes 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 For example, not talking 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 Step on the pretext of pulling straight 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 No matter who 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 The neck is easy in class 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.670
 I'm having trouble with a great opportunity 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 Because the movement distance is small 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.080
 If you want to use strongly put in a large 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.220
 It is fine even at the deadline date but I want to pull small fish 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380
 If 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.890
 If I put it in my mouth 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.920
 Two girls 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 It's a tiny bit done but it's bigger 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.870
 With the emperor 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.350
 like that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.020
 This strongest 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.200
 It is how to use 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.440
 It is benniek's first municipal Jupiter 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.190
 This is the largest size of three types of trees 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.590
 I will wear the Eco Mark 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.700
 Then you are silhouette and start of that actor 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.269
 Make free invite 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.940
 It's pretty, I'll put it on the other side of the water 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.239
 In such a big movement it invites and the trace distance is short 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.349
 Perfect when the activity of the fish is low in the line or even mind 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.510
 When you're wearing baggy shoes 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.510
 Well the system is narrow seed and face height 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.859
 Such Jupiter is such an activity when I come 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.859
 To do 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.569
 Most 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.339
 Led with the strategy 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.439
 I mean 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.679
 Like this 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.679
 h 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.050
 Opposition Orange will hear 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.650
 Introduce customer system 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.899
 After all, it is a little cloudy 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.209
 Appealed in flashy colors 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.519
 Paxonong Island
