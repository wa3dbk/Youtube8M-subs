00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.799
 save guys are here for a 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.759
 detectors program and today we have a 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.780
 special guest the salgadinho is a 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.730
 body 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.460
 What do you think of this activity? 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.390
 extracurricular 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.410
 I think it's a very 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.680
 modified 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.050
 I think people should accept 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.640
 more and get to know this world of the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 magnetism that fascinates so much 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.510
 researchers and archaeologists do not 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.390
 popular and this was the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.519
 adventure companion today 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.359
 and we went back to smoking when we arrived at 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.789
 archaeological site defined 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:53.899
 here we are in the renovation of the 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.719
 high tech city launched here 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.920
 salgadinha trying to catch an album 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:04.510
 relic is prehistoric that you are 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.510
 thinking so far knew of this adventure 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.409
 no meeting is archaeological because 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.600
 and low conditions 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.050
 of resources that we have 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:29.770
 enough this manual then to 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:32.270
 to enjoy the whole place is not 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.050
 we would need more resources to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.840
 explore such a large and historic area 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.300
 Site reforms facilitate 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.460
 because they have dug holes and 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.460
 we will not be working anything 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.680
 just messing with land 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.900
 So I think it'll be enough. 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.470
 useful when we can have more 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.470
 resource 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.190
 here the salgadinho will try a 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:18.440
 invested with magnetic fishing salgadinho 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:20.600
 will throw in the water the name because they have 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.800
 fear of appearing with the cameras doing 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 cool stuff is totally cool 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:39.470
 We are here on this fishing adventure. 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:45.160
 magnetic salgadinha and I say some 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.160
 What are you thinking about fishing? 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:58.410
 the scoreboard 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:08.800
 Do you think anything there thinks not? 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:10.870
 Carefully fall into the trap on one 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.160
 specialist do this you are not the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.030
 computer technician knows a 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.030
 played business 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.760
 then the saltiness made a find 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:31.260
 interesting that you found it strange 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:35.739
 stone must have ferrous constitution 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.129
 also dirty and rusty by the way the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.500
 eternal and then we go back there 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:46.230
 the first finding of the new salgadinho 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.230
 treasure hunter is that the narration pity 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:55.950
 we found a bottle here we will see the 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 that has inside it is only going to catch the 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:05.430
 I saw the bottle to see a tooth come 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.230
 has wine wine 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.100
 so she was half floating and 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.020
 we finished our research today 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.370
 we find only one stone one 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:22.770
 short search in only one place 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.750
 and we pretend we were cursed by the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.320
 researchers asked whether people 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.020
 was fishing very large fish and 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.920
 so we'll end another day of 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:40.680
 fishing for the blog detector and then our 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:44.070
 find a stone cracked by the 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:50.280
 Mister saltine, that's it 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:55.440
 the location here has very many classes are 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.470
 very one thing that is good that can turn 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.650
 Good thing I had with him yesterday came out a 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.030
 high propensity in competition to 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.360
 capacity is a thing of ability 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.150
 has great potential and I know if here 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.610
 however, it is very potential if the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.610
 people use appropriate equipment 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.980
 quality equipment provided by 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:24.680
 any donor who is determined 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.139
 our financial situation only allows us to 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.300
 imagine the corn actually their function 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:35.500
 it 's this personal follow the 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.500
 blog ok later
