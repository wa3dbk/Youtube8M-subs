00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.260
 video of cod 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.690
 you have to know what this is a video 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 so there is a guest name on it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.430
 its channel treats almost only cod 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.969
 so i thought it's gameplay 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 October 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.250
 among other things he played he would have been 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.850
 best for the right video only stretch 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.390
 almost cod 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.770
 then zero is the fact that then 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.540
 in live streams apple because also done 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.150
 what a great time and now that I remember it 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.650
 that I confirm because it was like mine 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.080
 idea if not wrong among other things was 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.020
 I think I organized it all by him 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.390
 I think and I hope because if you were already in 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.979
 then fight if the idea started from one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.170
 you know, however, evening you go in league then there is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.450
 a group to suffice 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 the flai disconnected for a problem of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.890
 connection etc. let's start with 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.929
 guys we find fox we find fox 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.340
 just start again even if you see everything 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.649
 tell him you can't see anything you don't 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 see nothing 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.189
 I am poor wretch and he has put himself 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.609
 to stream and blue everyone to do 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:56.340
 fox is really made me 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.409
 disconnect two or three more times 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.689
 then it was so i wanted to talk in 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.450
 this commentaries of the finds 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.939
 no, because now the world is not the same now 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.049
 now follows the fashions always follows the fashions 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.539
 and all a fashion in the world 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.470
 unfortunately yes therefore as the fashion of the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.750
 moment seems to be and find in 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.660
 general, however, find them don't do it 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.910
 he represents god so it came out of fashion 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.430
 also the verb to prolong if however there is 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.319
 now sees all the people have fun 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.660
 I don't really understand what's trilling 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.579
 be amusing that is then more than 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.329
 other like candid 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.829
 yes, but there is she found it is nice 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.180
 the one that made me 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.540
 and then there are the pro ones you ca n't 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.060
 support type I do not understand is there and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.639
 they take go to the channel they post 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.970
 casino comments and then type when i 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:50.849
 blocks of go crazy I wanted to collapse 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.200
 then you don't find right way no 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.180
 because the tonne aside must be 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.950
 a smart thing but it must be 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.700
 also innocent that is, it does not have to be 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.010
 nothing offensive or sparkling spam 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.870
 as no there is more than that it must not 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.000
 be nothing too much weight want to 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 that is to say, I can't imagine I won't take it 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.790
 if one arrives he tells me you are a jerk 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.940
 in the channel, however, it counts if there is one 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.760
 start a 240 times 50 times type a 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.889
 it happened to me ok what kind but they came 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.450
 comments I get personal messages 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.880
 ok where one tells me go and suck 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.980
 festival and in the end I blocked it yes 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.870
 creates another channel makes me is but from that 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.840
 I just wanted to collapse 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.750
 where he wanted to be like that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.830
 make the inscriptions become famous 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.290
 arguing with other people more 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:44.379
 popular of them they had a name as well 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:47.709
 with yes it is me that 43 16 is true yes 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.569
 they all call it this but that 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.829
 would be with fists in the face of fans of 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.269
 mario well then i can because i 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.769
 even a punch in the face sealine 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.780
 another thing I don't understand is one 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.569
 address book of atoll tron ​​the community 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.310
 no also melbourne however there is type a 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.709
 that is, even that doesn't make sense because 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.230
 I remember I saw only one episode in which 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.609
 throughout the game there was like 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.660
 three other friends of ours we did before 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.609
 to be followers of al qaida e 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.609
 present terrified to death sti 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.579
 kids throwing them to death ergo 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.370
 found femoral bubbles are real bullshit 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.500
 and own as far as I'm concerned but me 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.570
 I've got this opinion but it has collapsed 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.280
 I think it's fine but it must be law 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.070
 that is, it must be something fun 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.479
 not heavy because then when it is 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.330
 when it's heavy at the end a do 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:38.080
 laugh must be made purpose of 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.460
 pure fun nothing I know about it 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.810
 I'm smarter, I 'm smarter 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.780
 because I made you do a figure of 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.240
 shit only need to serve for 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.830
 snatch a smile is that all this 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.660
 bonn already then as we have l 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.200
 it was almost lunch time ideas and 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.729
 we can conclude therefore it is here it is 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.020
 all from that fox step and close 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.020
 safe and secure 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.049
 this
