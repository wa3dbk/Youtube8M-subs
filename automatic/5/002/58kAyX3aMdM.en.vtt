know you have to charge or recharge when
you're<00:00:36.540> flying<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.980> right<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.640> then

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
you're flying it so right there and then

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.020 
you're flying it so right there and then
down<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> gives<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> iOS<00:00:41.579> D

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
down here it gives you the kind of iOS D

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.600 
down here it gives you the kind of iOS D
of<00:00:42.809> your<00:00:42.930> distance<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.680> high<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
of your distance how high you are and
how<00:00:44.760> fast<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.210> flying<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.110> also<00:00:46.260> down

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
how fast you're flying it and also down

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
how fast you're flying it and also down
here<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.010> radar<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.000> see

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
here it's a little radar so you can see

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
here it's a little radar so you can see
when<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> tilt<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.809> phone<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.320> depending<00:00:50.190> on

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
when I tilt the phone or depending on

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
when I tilt the phone or depending on
where<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.539> heading<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
where I go and the heading of the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.389 
where I go and the heading of the
phantom<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> tells<00:00:52.739> me<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.190> where

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
phantom it tells me and you know where

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.389 
phantom it tells me and you know where
it<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.660> according<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.840> where<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> met<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.829> it's

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it is according to where I met so it's

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.279 
it is according to where I met so it's
pretty<00:00:56.550> neat<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:56.879> oh<00:00:57.000> sure<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.390> 65<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
pretty neat but oh sure you know 65 you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
pretty neat but oh sure you know 65 you
tap<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> how<00:00:58.859> far<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.280> away<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.390> not

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
tap it how far you are away so it's not

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
tap it how far you are away so it's not
really<00:01:00.750> exactly<00:01:01.230> where<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
really exactly where it's at but it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
really exactly where it's at but it
gives<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.579> an<00:01:02.640> idea<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.879> where<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
gives you an idea of where you know to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
gives you an idea of where you know to
look<00:01:04.500> forward<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> grab<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> loose<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.430> Faneuil

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
look forward to grab it loose or Faneuil

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480 
look forward to grab it loose or Faneuil
for<00:01:05.909> any<00:01:06.030> reason<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> then<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
for any reason so and then it's the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.390 
for any reason so and then it's the
taupe<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.570> pretty<00:01:09.840> smooth<00:01:10.110> enough<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.590> find

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
taupe it's pretty smooth enough I find

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.750 
taupe it's pretty smooth enough I find
it<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.610> smooth<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.890> then<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> good

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it pretty smooth and then this is good

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
it pretty smooth and then this is good
when<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> app<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.900> tilt<00:01:16.170> down

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
when you use the app you can tilt down

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.219 
when you use the app you can tilt down
like<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> use<00:01:17.909> your<00:01:18.150> phone<00:01:18.330> but

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like this you want to use your phone but

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.990 
like this you want to use your phone but
it's<00:01:19.350> probably<00:01:19.740> easier<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> go<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.460> way<00:01:20.670> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's probably easier to go this way so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
it's probably easier to go this way so
let<00:01:21.150> me<00:01:21.240> put<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.630> down<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.770> up

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
let me put this one down and take it up

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.080 
let me put this one down and take it up
you<00:01:23.580> guys<00:01:23.759> how<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> works<00:01:24.259> to<00:01:25.259> arm<00:01:25.939> just<00:01:26.939> move

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
you guys how it works to arm just move

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.760 
you guys how it works to arm just move
both<00:01:27.270> sticks<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.200> lower<00:01:28.380> corner

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
both sticks to the lower corner

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
both sticks to the lower corner
one<00:01:31.770> thing<00:01:31.920> I'm<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.159> used<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.880> hovering

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
one thing I'm not used to is hovering

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.389 
one thing I'm not used to is hovering
with<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> remote<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.859> let<00:01:35.039> go<00:01:35.219> it

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
with the remote and you let go it

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.709 
with the remote and you let go it
automatically<00:01:36.000> goes<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:37.250> 50%<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.539> know<00:01:39.659> if

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
automatically goes to 50% so you know if

y'all<00:03:43.659> with<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.290> Phantom<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.730> know<00:03:45.849> I

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
y'all with the Phantom so you know I

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.589 
y'all with the Phantom so you know I
guess<00:03:46.150> that's<00:03:46.329> just<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:47.260> make<00:03:47.889> it<00:03:47.919> follow<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
guess that's just to make it follow the

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.270 
guess that's just to make it follow the
direction<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:50.319> you<00:03:50.500> want<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.829> look<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.099> lot

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
direction that you want to look a lot

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.009 
direction that you want to look a lot
quicker<00:03:51.669> so<00:03:51.790> they<00:03:52.090> kind<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.359> mixed<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.840> that

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
quicker so they kind of mixed in that

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:00.750 
quicker so they kind of mixed in that
follow<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.829> manual<00:03:54.430> control<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.419> y'all

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.490 

so<00:04:01.330> they<00:04:01.480> go<00:04:01.599> right<00:04:01.900> by<00:04:02.080> this<00:04:02.140> tree<00:04:02.590> over<00:04:02.830> here

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.780 

look<00:04:07.860> down<00:04:08.070> at<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> iPhone<00:04:09.150> app

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.080 

that's<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.569> Steve<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.470> how<00:04:16.850> stable<00:04:17.850> it

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
that's it Steve you know how stable it

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.170 
that's it Steve you know how stable it
is<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:19.739> three<00:04:20.010> axis<00:04:20.400> really<00:04:20.850> makes<00:04:21.090> a

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
is the three axis really makes a

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.120 
is the three axis really makes a
difference<00:04:21.209> with<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.290> know<00:04:22.440> any<00:04:22.710> way<00:04:22.889> any

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
difference with you know any way any

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.879 
difference with you know any way any
flying<00:04:23.639> motor<00:04:24.060> builders<00:04:24.419> just<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.470> can<00:04:25.650> see

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
flying motor builders just you can see

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.270 
flying motor builders just you can see
there's<00:04:26.190> barely<00:04:26.850> any<00:04:27.150> awe<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.360> movement<00:04:28.280> and

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
there's barely any awe of movement and

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.650 
there's barely any awe of movement and
right<00:04:29.520> now<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.729> winds<00:04:30.060> kind<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.330> glowing<00:04:30.510> a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
right now the winds kind of glowing a

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.300 
right now the winds kind of glowing a
phantom<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.169> little<00:04:31.410> bit<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.650> can<00:04:31.800> see<00:04:31.830> this<00:04:32.070> is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
phantom a little bit you can see this is

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.400 
phantom a little bit you can see this is
really<00:04:32.789> nice<00:04:33.600> when<00:04:33.810> we<00:04:33.870> bring<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.199> little

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
really nice when we bring it a little

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.680 
really nice when we bring it a little
bit<00:04:34.560> lower<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:35.010> little<00:04:35.789> bit<00:04:36.000> risky<00:04:36.150> bring<00:04:36.600> a

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
bit lower a little bit risky bring a

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.490 
bit lower a little bit risky bring a
little<00:04:36.870> bit<00:04:37.050> lower

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.420 

let's<00:04:40.500> just<00:04:40.620> say<00:04:40.710> I'm<00:04:40.800> right<00:04:40.919> on<00:04:41.039> top<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.370> this

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
let's just say I'm right on top of this

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.460 
let's just say I'm right on top of this
tree<00:04:41.699> over<00:04:41.910> here<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.630> actually<00:04:42.990> looks<00:04:43.169> closer

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
tree over here it actually looks closer

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.629 
tree over here it actually looks closer
than<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.039> stream<00:04:44.340> but<00:04:44.550> I'm

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
than it is on the stream but I'm

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.060 
than it is on the stream but I'm
actually<00:04:44.789> pretty<00:04:45.060> far<00:04:45.360> from<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.139> tree<00:04:46.710> itself

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
actually pretty far from the tree itself

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:55.279 
actually pretty far from the tree itself
if<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.400> want<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.639> look<00:04:47.760> up<00:04:47.910> right<00:04:48.090> now<00:04:54.289> let's

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
if you want to look up right now let's

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.640 
if you want to look up right now let's
look<00:04:55.470> down<00:04:55.830> at<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.190> app<00:04:57.199> then<00:04:58.199> you<00:04:58.229> can<00:04:58.410> see

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
look down at the app then you can see

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.010 
look down at the app then you can see
right<00:04:58.919> now<00:04:59.130> I'm<00:04:59.639> talking<00:04:59.880> I'm<00:05:00.120> about<00:05:00.270> 16<00:05:00.750> feet

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
right now I'm talking I'm about 16 feet

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:09.170 
right now I'm talking I'm about 16 feet
up<00:05:01.970> if<00:05:02.970> I<00:05:04.280> look<00:05:05.280> up<00:05:05.490> here<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:08.580> then<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.090> can

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
up if I look up here and then you can

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.850 
up if I look up here and then you can
see<00:05:09.389> when<00:05:09.539> I<00:05:09.570> climb

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.339 

goes<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.099> about<00:05:16.159> 50s<00:05:16.849> how<00:05:17.689> to<00:05:17.839> stop<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.229> boss

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
goes to about 50s how to stop the boss

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.839 
goes to about 50s how to stop the boss
50<00:05:18.680> feet<00:05:18.919> you<00:05:19.069> know<00:05:19.189> I'm<00:05:19.249> in<00:05:19.369> my<00:05:19.400> neighborhood

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
50 feet you know I'm in my neighborhood

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.540 
50 feet you know I'm in my neighborhood
I'm<00:05:20.240> gonna<00:05:20.419> fly<00:05:20.599> too<00:05:20.659> far<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:21.919> if<00:05:22.069> I<00:05:22.159> do<00:05:22.219> fly

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
I'm gonna fly too far and if I do fly

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.070 
I'm gonna fly too far and if I do fly
around<00:05:22.699> you<00:05:22.909> can<00:05:23.029> see<00:05:23.119> the<00:05:23.210> speed<00:05:23.539> changes<00:05:24.050> a

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
around you can see the speed changes a

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.379 
around you can see the speed changes a
little<00:05:24.259> bit

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
little bit

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.909 
little bit
so<00:05:26.389> I'm<00:05:26.509> barely<00:05:27.050> flying<00:05:27.409> around<00:05:27.589> trying<00:05:27.800> to

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
so I'm barely flying around trying to

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.859 
so I'm barely flying around trying to
keep<00:05:28.069> it<00:05:28.219> over<00:05:28.369> in<00:05:28.430> my<00:05:28.520> house<00:05:28.699> I<00:05:29.059> want<00:05:29.569> to<00:05:29.689> fly

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:29.869 
keep it over in my house I want to fly

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:31.179 
keep it over in my house I want to fly
to<00:05:29.930> every<00:05:30.110> neighbor<00:05:30.289> Todd<00:05:30.589> you<00:05:30.770> know<00:05:30.800> what

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:31.189 
to every neighbor Todd you know what

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:37.200 
to every neighbor Todd you know what
they<00:05:31.279> think<00:05:31.520> I'm<00:05:31.639> spying<00:05:31.999> on<00:05:32.149> him<00:05:32.330> or<00:05:32.419> anything

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.540 

we<00:05:37.540> put<00:05:37.690> in<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.960> camera<00:05:38.920> resolution<00:05:39.100> is

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
we put in the camera resolution is

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.070 
we put in the camera resolution is
actually<00:05:39.670> not<00:05:39.970> that<00:05:40.030> bad<00:05:40.330> so<00:05:40.750> I<00:05:40.780> mean<00:05:40.990> I'm

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
actually not that bad so I mean I'm

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.400 
actually not that bad so I mean I'm
going<00:05:41.230> to<00:05:41.290> impress<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.740> quality<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:42.490> far

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.020 

here<00:05:48.410> one<00:05:49.070> thing<00:05:49.160> I<00:05:49.250> didn't<00:05:49.400> remember<00:05:49.580> -<00:05:49.850> if

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
here one thing I didn't remember - if

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.909 
here one thing I didn't remember - if
you're<00:05:50.180> like<00:05:50.449> an<00:05:50.660> experienced<00:05:51.440> pilot<00:05:51.620> you

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
you're like an experienced pilot you

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:52.450 
you're like an experienced pilot you
supplying

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
supplying

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.040 
supplying
airplanes<00:05:52.880> or<00:05:53.000> RC<00:05:53.210> helicopters<00:05:53.780> when<00:05:53.960> you

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
airplanes or RC helicopters when you

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.050 
airplanes or RC helicopters when you
want<00:05:54.199> to<00:05:54.260> go<00:05:54.410> down<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:55.340> have<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.669> manually

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
want to go down you have to manually

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.879 
want to go down you have to manually
tell<00:05:56.389> that<00:05:56.510> they<00:05:56.690> go<00:05:57.199> down<00:05:57.350> lower<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:57.800> when

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
tell that they go down lower and when

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.310 
tell that they go down lower and when
you<00:05:57.979> let<00:05:58.160> go<00:05:58.190> it<00:05:58.610> hovers<00:05:59.389> itself<00:05:59.870> so<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.139> mean

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
you let go it hovers itself so I mean

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.150 
you let go it hovers itself so I mean
that's<00:06:00.440> one<00:06:00.560> of<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.740> things<00:06:00.919> that<00:06:01.010> I'm<00:06:01.070> not

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.360 
really used to yet but you know I'm
pretty<00:06:03.290> sure<00:06:03.530> I'll<00:06:03.590> get<00:06:03.770> used<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:04.040> it<00:06:04.220> this

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
pretty sure I'll get used to it this

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.629 
pretty sure I'll get used to it this
deej<00:06:04.610> I<00:06:04.820> made<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.210> to<00:06:05.889> beginner-friendly<00:06:06.889> in

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
deej I made it to beginner-friendly in

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.310 
deej I made it to beginner-friendly in
my<00:06:07.850> opinion<00:06:08.330> that's<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:08.660> good<00:06:08.810> thing<00:06:08.990> for<00:06:09.139> a<00:06:09.199> lot

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
my opinion that's a good thing for a lot

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.250 
my opinion that's a good thing for a lot
of<00:06:09.440> people<00:06:09.770> but<00:06:09.919> for<00:06:10.449> guys<00:06:11.449> like<00:06:11.479> me<00:06:11.720> I'm<00:06:12.050> just

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
of people but for guys like me I'm just

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.870 
of people but for guys like me I'm just
used<00:06:12.440> to<00:06:12.500> having<00:06:12.740> you<00:06:13.550> know

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
used to having you know

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.420 
used to having you know
Xero's<00:06:14.410> throttle<00:06:15.410> all<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.680> way<00:06:15.830> down<00:06:16.100> and<00:06:16.280> not

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
Xero's throttle all the way down and not

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.920 
Xero's throttle all the way down and not
in<00:06:16.669> the<00:06:16.760> middle<00:06:16.790> like<00:06:17.360> how<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:17.570> way<00:06:17.900> I

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
in the middle like how the way I

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.100 
in the middle like how the way I
programmed<00:06:18.500> it<00:06:18.650> so<00:06:18.860> let's<00:06:19.669> look<00:06:20.210> at<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:20.419> quiet

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.540 

so<00:06:23.199> you<00:06:23.289> can<00:06:23.439> see<00:06:23.650> when<00:06:24.009> you<00:06:24.069> want<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.310> bring<00:06:24.460> it

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
so you can see when you want to bring it

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.540 
so you can see when you want to bring it
down<00:06:25.139> just<00:06:26.139> lower<00:06:26.500> down<00:06:26.650> the<00:06:26.949> throttle<00:06:27.310> stick

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
down just lower down the throttle stick

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.429 
down just lower down the throttle stick
remember<00:06:28.509> and<00:06:28.629> lower<00:06:28.780> because<00:06:29.050> when<00:06:29.169> you<00:06:29.259> let

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:29.439 
remember and lower because when you let

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:36.989 
remember and lower because when you let
go<00:06:29.639> it's<00:06:30.639> gonna<00:06:30.729> hold<00:06:30.939> it<00:06:31.090> out<00:06:31.270> of<00:06:31.419> food<00:06:31.629> so

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:36.999 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.509 

and<00:06:37.239> it's<00:06:37.629> trick<00:06:37.869> when<00:06:38.049> you<00:06:38.139> land<00:06:38.379> it<00:06:38.559> is

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:39.519 
and it's trick when you land it is

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.809 
and it's trick when you land it is
slowly<00:06:40.239> gift<00:06:40.749> although<00:06:41.139> when<00:06:41.289> you<00:06:41.349> go<00:06:41.469> down

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
slowly gift although when you go down

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.440 
slowly gift although when you go down
and<00:06:42.819> it<00:06:42.969> touches<00:06:43.239> the<00:06:43.479> ground

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
and it touches the ground

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.030 
and it touches the ground
like<00:06:45.320> so<00:06:45.560> just<00:06:45.950> pulled<00:06:46.220> down<00:06:47.530> about<00:06:48.530> three

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
like so just pulled down about three

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.680 
like so just pulled down about three
seconds<00:06:49.490> four<00:06:49.700> seconds<00:06:49.970> later<00:06:50.150> I'll<00:06:50.330> cut<00:06:50.570> off

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
seconds four seconds later I'll cut off

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.750 
seconds four seconds later I'll cut off
you<00:06:50.930> can<00:06:51.050> see<00:06:51.230> no<00:06:51.890> more<00:06:52.010> throttle<00:06:52.280> so<00:06:52.610> that's

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
you can see no more throttle so that's

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.160 
you can see no more throttle so that's
pretty<00:06:53.000> much<00:06:53.120> it<00:06:53.270> I<00:06:53.480> mean<00:06:53.630> this<00:06:53.810> phantom
