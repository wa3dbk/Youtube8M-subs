00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.100
 hello hello welcome to paper pop in 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.470
 this video we will learn how to make a 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.630
 super original detail because they are two 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.670
 crafts in one is a card 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.500
 The most beautiful portrait is 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.360
 super super easy to do you can 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.650
 put the little message that you want and the 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.140
 photo that you want with your 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.970
 friends with the boyfriend you know to me the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.039
 I really loved it, I liked it very much 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.770
 because they see the picture is like in 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.390
 depth in 3ds looks terrific and 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.159
 It can be a super nice detail for 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.109
 give away this Valentine's day or in 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.120
 any special day this time I hope 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.190
 that this craft they like very much 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.729
 as well as me and then we will not see anything 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.729
 how it is done 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.080
 to make our cards 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.030
 closeup we are going to need 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.610
 thicker than normal cardboard or 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 cardboard colored markers or paints for 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.710
 Decorate your pencil and cutter rule card 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.110
 to mark and cut glue either in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.820
 school bar or cold silicone and optional 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.920
 decorated paper 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.560
 let's start by drawing a rectangle 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.240
 11 x 15 centimeters long is the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.070
 As I recommend, but you can 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.560
 make your cards smaller or more 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.570
 big after we're going to mark 4 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.580
 centimeters on each side and we draw some 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.950
 lines on those marks in this way 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.200
 then we put a horizontal line on 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.420
 the 4 centimeters and abajito of that line 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.009
 we mark 5 centimeters that we are going to join 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.009
 with the corners in this way 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.100
 we will have a trapeze below the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.360
 rectangle that we draw and we're going to 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.360
 cut out that figure 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.670
 then we will mark the fold line 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.280
 with the back of the cutter in this 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.870
 way and we bend that way very easy 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.790
 we have the base of our card and 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.190
 now we're just going to decorate it as more 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.470
 we like it, I'm going to use watercolors and 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.210
 I will draw many many little hearts but 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.840
 If you are not very good at drawing and 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.180
 the painting 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.890
 you can use decorative paper or print 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.470
 the templates that he gave you in paper 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.180
 point mx in the downloadable part that 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.040
 they are already bought there all in case you 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.040
 letter is also not the best we say 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.010
 and good since you have decorated your 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.989
 card you are going to print the photo that you go 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.849
 to put I will use this where I am with 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.129
 my friends and cut in circle 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.900
 then we are going to align it in the part 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.640
 where we want it I'm going to leave a 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.709
 Larger space up to be able 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.959
 write and we're going to draw a figure a 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.150
 little bigger than the photo as my photo 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.920
 It is circled I'll use a compass and 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 that you traced the figure uses an exact 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.040
 to cut that part do it with a lot 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.040
 watch out 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.840
 you will have something like that and now we are going to 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.760
 write a nice message in the part 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.920
 from above or below depending as to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.420
 lines of your photo first do it with 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.189
 pencil so you can erase if you 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.769
 you're wrong and then you re mark it with 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.390
 markers or paintings a terrific tip is 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.280
 paint this part with paint to 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.349
 chalkboard and write him with jokes 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.790
 true colors is very nice or 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.099
 also print only your phrase 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.900
 cut it out and paste it that would be good 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.900
 option if you do not have such a beautiful handwriting 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.280
 and good since you have something like that just 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.070
 your photo is missing let's cut two strips 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.750
 about 7 mm wide one of 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.580
 the same card you used for your 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.740
 card and another one sheet of paper 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.780
 normal and we're going to paste the strip of 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.270
 cardboard to your photo in this way 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 taking care that the photo is well aligned 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.500
 and let it dry a little 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.860
 then we align the photo to our 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.960
 card so trying to make your photo 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.180
 be at the center in my case the circle 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.550
 that you cut and you decide how far behind 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.290
 you're going to hit for the depth and 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.150
 that you decided you cut the strip to the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.560
 measure marks the fold line and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.970
 stick it to the back of your 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.970
 card in this way 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.170
 and so that it does not go to your photo towards 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.270
 back sticks up the other strip that is the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.190
 of plain paper and see pulling the little to 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.620
 little in this way until you have left 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.920
 well aligned everything then cuts the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.920
 surplus 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.350
 and that's how easy we have our 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.570
 ideal card for a gift 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.520
 on special occasions and remind 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.350
 that person at some time food that 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.510
 have lived together and good with the 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.430
 templates that I left you in paper point mx 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.320
 they are also super nice 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.480
 just cut out the white part of the center 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.520
 you stick it to your card and you're done 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.770
 you will find four designs two for 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.780
 boy and two for girl if you like and 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.220
 as decoration they look very nice for 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.110
 so the person to whom they are 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.150
 You can put them in a place 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.860
 special of your house or your room and not 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.330
 have to keep it out there 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.330
 which is great for me 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.710
 this craft then I did not have them 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.870

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.120
