00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
rather the reason is just that you

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.300 
rather the reason is just that you
always<00:02:04.149> think<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:04.959> win<00:02:05.140> every<00:02:05.950> time<00:02:05.979> you

play you get so close to beating the
current<00:02:08.920> world<00:02:09.039> but<00:02:09.670> most<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.209> time<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
current world but most of the time the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.199 
current world but most of the time the
real<00:02:11.019> winning<00:02:11.379> factor<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.920> blocked<00:02:12.220> plain<00:02:12.880> and

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
real winning factor is blocked plain and
