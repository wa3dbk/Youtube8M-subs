Proclamation<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.230> think<00:00:10.380> part<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
Proclamation and I think part of the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.650 
Proclamation and I think part of the
reason<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.309> gospel<00:00:11.880> Proclamation<00:00:12.030> is

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
reason is is that gospel Proclamation is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.620 
reason is is that gospel Proclamation is
by<00:00:13.110> its<00:00:13.259> nature<00:00:13.940> difficult<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.120> sometimes

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
by its nature difficult and sometimes

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.689 
by its nature difficult and sometimes
there's<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.619> rejection<00:00:17.460> maybe

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
there's going to be rejection maybe

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.670 
there's going to be rejection maybe
sometimes<00:00:18.210> too<00:00:18.390> weak<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> word<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.140> lot<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
sometimes too weak of a word a lot of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.230 
sometimes too weak of a word a lot of
times<00:00:20.010> there's<00:00:20.160> gonna<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.400> rejection<00:00:20.850> because

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
times there's gonna be rejection because

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.700 
times there's gonna be rejection because
the<00:00:21.539> Bible<00:00:21.810> says<00:00:22.020> I'll<00:00:22.199> always<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the Bible says I'll always be the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.519 
the Bible says I'll always be the
stumbling<00:00:23.100> block<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.060> cross<00:00:24.289> people<00:00:25.289> like

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
stumbling block of the cross people like

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
stumbling block of the cross people like
the<00:00:25.740> idea<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.220> maybe<00:00:26.970> being<00:00:27.210> recruited<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the idea of maybe being recruited to

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.779 
the idea of maybe being recruited to
being<00:00:28.080> spiritual<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:28.800> being<00:00:29.070> recruited<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.760> a

community of people who seem like good
folks<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.550> they'll<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.850> likely<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
folks and so they'll be likely to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.620 
folks and so they'll be likely to
respond<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.649> recruitment<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.640> church<00:00:35.940> but

respond to a recruitment to church but

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.150 
respond to a recruitment to church but
what<00:00:36.750> they<00:00:36.899> need<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.620> recruitment<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that people need to think about what it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
that people need to think about what it

traumatic crisis or some sort of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.479 
traumatic crisis or some sort of
challenge<00:01:04.769> along<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.369> they're

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
challenge along the way if they're

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160 
challenge along the way if they're
younger<00:01:05.729> maybe<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.360> teenager<00:01:06.659> there's<00:01:06.990> always

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
younger maybe a teenager there's always

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
younger maybe a teenager there's always
a<00:01:07.500> traumatic<00:01:07.860> crisis<00:01:08.189> along<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> way<00:01:08.610> but

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a traumatic crisis along the way but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.340 
a traumatic crisis along the way but
what<00:01:09.299> happens<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.930> come<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> church

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
what happens is they come to church

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
what happens is they come to church
wanting<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> turn<00:01:10.950> over<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.250> new<00:01:11.430> leaf<00:01:11.670> what

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
wanting to turn over a new leaf what

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
wanting to turn over a new leaf what
they<00:01:12.510> need<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.110> new<00:01:13.350> life<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
they need is new life and and and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.030 
they need is new life and and and
ultimately<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.840> means<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> be

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
ultimately that means that we have to be

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.910 
ultimately that means that we have to be
clear<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:17.939> gospel<00:01:18.479> Proclamation<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:19.320> think

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
clear in our gospel Proclamation I think

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
clear in our gospel Proclamation I think
too<00:01:20.040> often<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.400> assume<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> gospel<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> so

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
too often we assume the gospel and so

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.149 
too often we assume the gospel and so
the<00:01:21.960> assumption<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> people<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:22.979> get

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the assumption is that people will get

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
the assumption is that people will get
it<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:23.430> already<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.450> need<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it or already know it or don't need to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
it or already know it or don't need to
be<00:01:24.750> told<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.040> ultimately<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.729> need<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
be told it and so ultimately we need to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.420 
be told it and so ultimately we need to
be<00:01:27.030> constantly<00:01:27.720> reminding<00:01:28.259> ourselves<00:01:28.430> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
be constantly reminding ourselves that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
be constantly reminding ourselves that
the<00:01:29.820> world<00:01:30.180> needs<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> hear<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.710> good<00:01:31.829> news<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the world needs to hear the good news of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.710 
the world needs to hear the good news of
the<00:01:32.250> gospel<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.790> Jesus<00:01:33.090> Christ<00:01:33.150> that's<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the gospel of Jesus Christ that's a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
the gospel of Jesus Christ that's a
