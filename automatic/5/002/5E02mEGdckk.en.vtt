00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.750
 hello to all tom's friends always here 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.089
 from the Taiwan comet 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.580
 we are visiting the lire stand at ii 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.160
 that we know it with producer who 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.080
 creates point that sma has gone a little further 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.180
 this time in fact decided to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.920
 match a desk a better case 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.000
 transform a desk into a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.429
 In other words, call it what you want 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.949
 look at what created this 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.739
 in fact, a real desk with a shelf 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.620
 where to put the keyboard and mouse but 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.780
 opens 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 this is the biggest model e 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.770
 allows you to install up to two 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.530
 complete systems 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.150
 obviously as of tradition of the whole 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.760
 in steel aluminum 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.170
 for the legs, however, the parts more 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 important with a little bit material 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.260
 all the hard drive supports are harder 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.410
 of the part that is practically from above 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.530
 a twin system precisely for a double 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.110
 system then we also see the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.470
 support for a tumor where between 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.050
 tempered however there is also two models a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.900
 little bit smaller you come with me 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.260
 so we have the model we say 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.640
 the medium one still for the desk with the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.530
 possibility of installing a single 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.840
 system I don't know if it opened it opened it 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.610
 so let's always see glass here 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.229
 also tempered the whole system of 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.130
 there is a nutrition that really is 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.900
 huge all aluminum once again 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.910
 let's say at the desk for the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.600
 single system and we also have one 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.670
 smaller this way we see this 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.130
 in short, it may be something in between 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.030
 also be used as a system for 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.369
 average for media center type of use 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.980
 you want to imagine it as you invent it 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.350
 you want and replicate also on all 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:01.540
 other models the various front doors e 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.930
 support for dvd or blu ray player 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.420
 these are two or three products instead 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.370
 they will come out after the summer about 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.750
 we already know the prices at least in dollars 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.300
 to the next already imagine 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.459
 as far as the price in euros for the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.440
 model this intermediate we are around 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.209
 to the 8 900 euros for the model more 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.880
 great that we have seen before is overcome 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.739
 1,000 euros plus or minus 1,200 euros per 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.660
 the small model is still not known 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.610
 very special products from here 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.200
 years from the competence so thank you 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.549
 once again for following me there 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.549
 see you in the next videos hello
