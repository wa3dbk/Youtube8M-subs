00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.310
 That is why it is already a new episode comes deming linearly unique 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.750
 in the newspaper in jerusalem she was secretly living a whole life 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.149
 the number left 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.219
 I have included in one of your columns 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.839
 and that was to come that means a dragon must go but I am tasty 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.839
 I have been playing well 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.159
 that is perhaps it seems wonderful to experience a bit of uplifting news 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.319
 update the dragon with role and rushed 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.970
 Robben still leaves his mouth 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.110
 I put it down, it became unclear to your audience 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.030
 take 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.940
 and I have come to see if my 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.730
 the corsa 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.590
 We are making progress under loud, much attention on the side 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.690
 shall go 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.530
 I am very late world is not a small also better for the wire 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.180
 silently enter the output 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.070
 in this case, it becomes a bit silent 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.070
 breukink rumsfeld 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.700
 he wants i have players i have tried the same 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.440
 type of debate 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 more dangerous and more dangerous support package 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.120
 network third place 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.120
 the and become punch breaks 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.720
 that way the poll not only called to steer at the beach 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.170
 the next drake you have to look at what gets you going 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.100
 I live here all sides sober with that I want to make you there you look 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.790
 to the matter 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.740
 to the weather 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.590
 the website of 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.230
 breeders 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.320
 here we can we can get away from it in between we can 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.170
 to take a look here how it looks 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.490
 and now you see it 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 first a date dragon head driver sticks out 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.690
 no little one either 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.940
 That made fun because the bigger you build things like this 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.590
 how realistic do this often remain terribly fascinating with now 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.200
 Staying Markets continues to work with blocks that does not make it very much 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.270
 easier 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.740
 yes this way 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.670
 can make sure that what you build is still somewhat whole screw after 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.189
 much more realistic than this I can make you more of that 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.529
 but I think it is quite secretly we were still in touch with you 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.339
 to connect 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.959
 for the rest of them this is a very short delivery you will be busy long enough 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:20.609
 been 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.349
 certainly such smoke in it that looks like this 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.739
 that comes out of his nostrils 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.279
 and we are going to end the episode with the all point was fun to look at 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.779
 as soon as it comes out 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.779
 but of course it is completely free if you come from 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.609
 in the dragon head 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.479
 to have 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.599
 nice place in the morning 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.829
 we look up from the dragon 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.879
 after our castle 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.069
 h 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.679
 Roan the D Mark might also do a little converted to do this 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.149
 the exact route 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.259
 and on the roof 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.829
 what can be on the roof here 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.159
 if we can take a look at us 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.939
 hofstra castle 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.089
 with still more community newspaper of light downstairs 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.009
 and that we will close this short episode with it 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.479
 emmen if you have many more ideas on offer I have to build in 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.589
 communication leaves that below a commons 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:34.099
 the castle is not nearly finished yet and there are, as I said, a whole lot 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.229
 things that I build in mogul 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.749
 including days a the big tower in big access road to the gate goes there 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.929
 likely to come up here who came by somewhere 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:49.559
 are we all going to make a look or maybe that is going behind me 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:50.769
 do not know yet 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.319
 go see but this time the dragons cool 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.489
 in his eyes he will have had controls out of the way 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.119
 thank you or you share 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.019
 xls standardizing the place more in the blankvoort contracts does not matter 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.779
 blue dovecote mood to do for the time and effort that comes to an end 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.629
 make fit videos 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.749
 and then we see that you shape it
