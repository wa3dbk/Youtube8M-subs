tbsp of cocoa powder unsweetened one so
I<00:02:31.349> am<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.459> gonna<00:02:33.000> beat<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.660> until<00:02:34.019> we<00:02:34.530> get

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
I am just gonna beat this until we get

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.180 
I am just gonna beat this until we get
firm<00:02:35.549> Peaks<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.269> I'll<00:02:36.450> first<00:02:36.840> start<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
firm Peaks so I'll first start with the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
firm Peaks so I'll first start with the
low<00:02:38.459> speed<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.150> then<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.630> going<00:02:39.750> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
low speed and then we are going to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.020 
low speed and then we are going to
increase<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.410> speed<00:02:43.549> so<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:44.730> way<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.910> will

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
increase the speed so this way I will

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.300 
increase the speed so this way I will
continue<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.840> one<00:02:46.110> minute<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.650> low<00:02:46.950> speed

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
continue for one minute on low speed

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190 
continue for one minute on low speed
then<00:02:47.850> we<00:02:48.000> are<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.360> increase<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.959> speed

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
then we are going to increase the speed

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.280 
then we are going to increase the speed
to<00:02:49.410> high<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.610> will<00:02:50.850> do<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.750> another

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
to high and we will do it for another

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.250 
to high and we will do it for another
three<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.250> four<00:02:53.489> minutes<00:02:53.750> until<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.900> get<00:02:55.080> that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
three to four minutes until we get that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.740 
three to four minutes until we get that
form<00:02:55.590> Peaks<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.060> what<00:02:57.299> we<00:02:57.450> are<00:02:57.600> looking

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
form Peaks this is what we are looking

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.960 
form Peaks this is what we are looking
for<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.209> should<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.599> like<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.760> took<00:03:02.910> me

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
for so it should be like this it took me

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.600 
for so it should be like this it took me
around<00:03:03.239> three<00:03:03.660> minutes<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.459> my

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
cookies flat on the bottom so we are

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.979 
cookies flat on the bottom so we are
going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.530> make<00:03:14.000> like<00:03:15.000> three<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.420> four<00:03:15.690> layers

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
until we are on the top so here we go so

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.099 
until we are on the top so here we go so
now<00:03:21.269> i'm<00:03:21.600> gonna<00:03:23.989> put<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.049> cream<00:03:25.910> I'm<00:03:27.680> okok

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
mixture on the top of this and we are

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.620 
mixture on the top of this and we are
gonna<00:03:35.790> spread<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.480> flat<00:03:36.900> over<00:03:37.590> here<00:03:41.630> here

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
gonna spread this flat over here here

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.309 
gonna spread this flat over here here
was<00:03:42.900> my<00:03:42.930> another<00:03:43.500> layer<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:43.890> cookies<00:03:48.319> here
