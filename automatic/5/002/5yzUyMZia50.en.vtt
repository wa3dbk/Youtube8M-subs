00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.980
 to 1 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.599
 Hello 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.750
 At the time of serving the good 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.610
 cooks and housewives already know 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.340
 salads alone itaim leg at the time of eating 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.040
 The reason is simple sheets on the floor 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.090
 when we put it on and you know why 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.090
 that happens 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.780
 the name of the phenomenon is very popular among 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.269
 you 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.550
 the osmosis today we will perform a 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.580
 experiment to better understand how 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.010
 to modes happens in this activity 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.019
 let's use the store tense a little plant 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.400
 aquatic found in clothing stores 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.799
 for aquarium 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.470
 the idea is to observe how the process of 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.570
 osmosis happen their cells 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.979
 for the experiment we will need in the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.640
 following materials 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:20.150
 note there glass blade glass blade 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:24.290
 thin-line metal thinks a branch of 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:29.689
 dense store paper absorbent paper towel 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:33.469
 the paper filter paste pipettes' bottle with 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.350
 distilled water or faucet 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.469
 5% sodium chloride which is nothing more than 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.490
 that 5 grams of cooking salt 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.490
 dissolved in 100 ml of water 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.679
 first put a drop of water 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:51.409
 distilled on the glass slide in 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.969
 then remove a young elody sheet 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:00.140
 dense and places it on the water 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.869
 now cover the blade with a blade and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.719
 let's go to the microscope 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.360
 One tip is to observe the edges of the sheet 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:11.300
 because there is a smaller number of layers of 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.390
 cells and this will facilitate the visualization 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.520
 you see the rectangular cells with 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.180
 small circular structures of 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.819
 green coloration are the chloroplasts 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.340
 organelles responsible for photosynthesis 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.959
 they are scattered all over the cello and 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.510
 it is possible that they are moving 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.290
 by the cytoplasm this movement 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.600
 called cyclosa 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.660
 Now fill a pipette solution 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.390
 sodium chloride touches tip of peta 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.170
 on the edge of the squid blade and drop 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.720
 a few drops do not remove the blade from the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.890
 microscope just slopes a little bit 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.410
 filter paper 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.510
 on the other the edge of the blade to absorb 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.570
 the solution that drains in excess 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.000
 let's observe again will the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.530
 chloroplasts are still spread throughout the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.200
 cell as before not they are now 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.190
 concentrated in the innermost regions 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.760
 of cells 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.680
 but why did the solution of 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.320
 sodium chloride you put into the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.820
 blade contains more mourning than the 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.880
 cell cytoplasm 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.010
 so the water went out of the cell what it did 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.950
 with which the plasma membrane retracted 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.900
 away from the cell wall and retaining 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.370
 chloroplasts in the more central region 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.710
 of cells 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.230
 when the foot cell of water like this 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.940
 we say that it is embodied more 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.930
 is it possible to reverse this 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.910
 situation 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.910
 Let's try to see what happens. 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.700
 with a new piece of filter paper 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.460
 absorb as much of the solution as possible 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.310
 salt that caused plasmapheresis now 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.350
 fill the other pipette with water and 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.120
 same way you did with the solution 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.310
 of sodium chloride 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.920
 let many drops penetrate between the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.750
 she null me and look again at the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.580
 cells or microscope 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 are the cells still at 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.760
 mobilizations where the 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.760
 chloroplasts this time 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.820
 note that they have returned to occupy all 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:23.390
 volume of cells but how can we 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:26.060
 explain this fact the water that was 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.180
 placed yesterday - solutes that the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.940
 cytoplasm with the water that was in the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.190
 external medium entered the cell and 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.830
 plasma membrane that was retracted 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.170
 she rested against the cell wall 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.940
 now chloroplasts can circulate 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.940
 freely by every cell 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.460
 we come to the end of our experiment 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.230
 I hope this activity has helped 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.610
 understand how the process of 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.270
 osmosis in cells 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.270
 to the next
