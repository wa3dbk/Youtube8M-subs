important<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.269> map<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> team<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> a

important in this map and as a team in a
player<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.310> need<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.640> aware<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
player you really need to be aware of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030 
player you really need to be aware of
what<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.720> happening<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> ground<00:00:31.320> with

what is happening on the ground with

what is happening on the ground with
your<00:00:32.309> team<00:00:32.550> where<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.090> are<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.510> where<00:00:34.020> you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
your team where they are and where you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.290 
your team where they are and where you
are<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.770> sort<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.700> correlate<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
are and sort of you know correlate that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299 
are and sort of you know correlate that
with<00:00:36.690> where<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> enemy<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:37.950> putting<00:00:38.190> their

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
with where the enemy are putting their

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
with where the enemy are putting their
pressure<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.690> respond<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
pressure and if you don't respond to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
pressure and if you don't respond to
that<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.760> fail<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that in the right way you can fail and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
that in the right way you can fail and
it's<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> reasons<00:00:42.750> why<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.170> map<00:00:43.469> can

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it's one of the reasons why this map can

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.260 
it's one of the reasons why this map can
either<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.960> total<00:00:46.160> strong<00:00:47.270> domination

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
either be a total strong domination

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.100 
either be a total strong domination
defense<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.789> critical<00:00:50.789> steamroll<00:00:51.510> every

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
defense or a critical steamroll every

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.619 
defense or a critical steamroll every
single<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.120> if

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
single time and it's really because if

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.049 
single time and it's really because if
you<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> team<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> reason<00:00:56.940> why

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you have a team and it is a reason why

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.310 
you have a team and it is a reason why
it's<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> good<00:00:57.360> map<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> reason<00:00:58.199> why<00:00:58.289> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it's a good map and it's a reason why I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
it's a good map and it's a reason why I
put<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.680> server<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.460> reason<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> good

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
put up my server the reason it's a good

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.779 
put up my server the reason it's a good
map<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.730> your<00:01:02.730> honor

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
map is because if you have it your honor

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.030 
map is because if you have it your honor
screaming<00:01:03.600> analytics<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.379> wasn't<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.860> much

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
screaming analytics that wasn't as much

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
screaming analytics that wasn't as much
as<00:01:05.100> an<00:01:05.339> explosion<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.030> I'd<00:01:06.180> hoped<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:07.170> like

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
as an explosion as I'd hoped I was like

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
as an explosion as I'd hoped I was like
I'll<00:01:07.710> create<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> distraction<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.119> by

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I'll create a distraction right here by

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
I'll create a distraction right here by
setting<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.810> massive<00:01:10.470> gas<00:01:10.710> canister

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
setting up this massive gas canister

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
setting up this massive gas canister
yeah<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.890> didn't

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
yeah it was just like this little didn't

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
yeah it was just like this little didn't
really<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:15.049> anyway<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.409> moved<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
really do it anyway so I moved up the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.990 
really do it anyway so I moved up the
roof<00:01:17.040> here<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> first<00:01:17.520> thing<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> do

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
roof here the first thing I want to do

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
roof here the first thing I want to do
is<00:01:18.030> clear<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.450> rooftop<00:01:18.720> failed<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.950> mean<00:01:20.130> they

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
is clear this rooftop failed I mean they

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.630 
is clear this rooftop failed I mean they
all<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.580> ran<00:01:20.820> away<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:23.070> point<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
all just ran away but the point was to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.410 
all just ran away but the point was to
get<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.600> roof<00:01:24.930> killed<00:01:25.860> or<00:01:26.159> not

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
get them off this roof killed or not

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.370 
get them off this roof killed or not
because<00:01:27.420> from<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.810> roof<00:01:28.049> they<00:01:28.259> can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
because from up on that roof they can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.080 
because from up on that roof they can
obviously<00:01:28.560> sit<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> lay<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.670> fight<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
obviously sit and lay down the fight to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
obviously sit and lay down the fight to
us<00:01:30.210> coming<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.840> I've<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.470> gone<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
us coming in here I've just gone for the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160 
us coming in here I've just gone for the
quick<00:01:32.130> spread<00:01:32.520> around<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.180> catch<00:01:33.810> him<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
quick spread around and catch him on the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.450 
quick spread around and catch him on the
way<00:01:34.320> back<00:01:35.240> but<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.659> saying<00:01:37.020> anyway<00:01:37.460> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
way back but as I was saying anyway it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
way back but as I was saying anyway it's
a<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.850> good<00:01:38.939> map<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.290> reason

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
a really good map because the reason

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.300 
a really good map because the reason
it's<00:01:41.640> excellent<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.299> sort<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.689> detecting

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
it's excellent for sort of detecting

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.609 
it's excellent for sort of detecting
game<00:01:44.310> played<00:01:44.549> between<00:01:44.670> two<00:01:45.240> sides<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.990> because

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
game played between two sides is because

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770 
game played between two sides is because
of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.860> prediction<00:01:47.399> element<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> have

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
of the prediction element so if you have

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.069 
of the prediction element so if you have
a<00:01:48.810> defensive<00:01:49.619> team<00:01:49.890> who<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.479> really<00:01:51.479> keyed

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
a defensive team who are really keyed

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.350 
a defensive team who are really keyed
into<00:01:52.590> their<00:01:52.710> defense<00:01:53.100> abilities<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.210> are

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
into their defense abilities if they are

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.450 
into their defense abilities if they are
able<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.780> predict<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.350> move<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> very<00:01:55.950> fluid

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
able to predict a move in a very fluid

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
able to predict a move in a very fluid
way<00:01:56.790> through<00:01:57.270> different<00:01:57.630> areas<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.140> map

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
way through different areas of the map

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
way through different areas of the map
it<00:01:58.590> means<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.759> are<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.119> able

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it means that they are going to be able

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.139 
it means that they are going to be able
to<00:02:00.329> respond<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.960> any<00:02:01.259> move<00:02:02.070> made<00:02:02.549> by<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to respond to any move made by the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.209 
to respond to any move made by the
attackers<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> attackers<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.950> pretty

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
attackers and the attackers are pretty

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.940 
attackers and the attackers are pretty
much<00:02:05.369> solely<00:02:05.969> infantry<00:02:06.719> okay<00:02:07.229> yeah<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.710> have

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
much solely infantry okay yeah we have

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.850 
much solely infantry okay yeah we have
got<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> whatever<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> Phoenix<00:02:09.869> okay<00:02:10.229> but

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
got the whatever the Phoenix okay but

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.580 
got the whatever the Phoenix okay but
for<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.730> most<00:02:11.910> part<00:02:12.030> pretty<00:02:12.390> much<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.870> attack

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
for the most part pretty much you attack

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.940 
for the most part pretty much you attack
goes<00:02:13.739> down<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.099> fast<00:02:14.340> anyway<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.830> really<00:02:16.830> it's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
goes down so fast anyway so really it's

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
goes down so fast anyway so really it's
just<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.250> case<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.489> predicting<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.480> engaging

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
just a case of predicting and engaging

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.290 
just a case of predicting and engaging
now<00:02:19.050> look<00:02:19.260> look<00:02:19.470> at<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.790> taken<00:02:21.060> be

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
now look look at this we just taken be

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.509 
now look look at this we just taken be
and<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:22.019> gun<00:02:22.379> down<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.769> same<00:02:22.980> time<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.370> fact

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
and a gun down at the same time in fact

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.280 
and a gun down at the same time in fact
they<00:02:23.670> went<00:02:23.849> down<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.330> fast<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.900> defenders

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
they went down so fast the defenders

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.600 
they went down so fast the defenders
really<00:02:25.470> put<00:02:25.650> up<00:02:25.739> no<00:02:25.980> opposition<00:02:26.340> here

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
really put up no opposition here

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.210 
really put up no opposition here
whatsoever<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:28.530> could<00:02:28.739> be<00:02:28.830> down<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.190> a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
whatsoever and this could be down to a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.589 
whatsoever and this could be down to a
few<00:02:29.400> things<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.790> wasn't<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> defending

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
few things I wasn't on the defending

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.809 
few things I wasn't on the defending
team<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.019> can<00:02:31.140> only<00:02:31.260> speculate<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
team so I can only speculate but it

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.920 
team so I can only speculate but it
could<00:02:32.940> be<00:02:33.030> down<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> couple<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.629> things<00:02:33.810> I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
could be down to a couple of things I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.199 
could be down to a couple of things I
see<00:02:34.230> regularly<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.220> game<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:35.970> which

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
see regularly in the game one of which

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.600 
see regularly in the game one of which
is<00:02:36.480> people<00:02:37.019> don't<00:02:37.319> get<00:02:37.709> into<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.099> game<00:02:38.250> fast

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
is people don't get into the game fast

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.509 
is people don't get into the game fast
enough<00:02:38.879> now<00:02:39.620> some<00:02:40.620> maps<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.010> might<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.280> okay

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
enough now some maps you might be okay

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.309 
enough now some maps you might be okay
to<00:02:41.580> spend<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.970> little<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.480> time<00:02:42.690> setting<00:02:43.200> up

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
to spend a little bit of time setting up

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.979 
to spend a little bit of time setting up
let's<00:02:43.680> think<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.040> things<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.480> rush<00:02:45.480> caspian

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
let's think of things like rush caspian

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.650 
let's think of things like rush caspian
border<00:02:46.019> okay<00:02:46.709> large<00:02:47.340> distance<00:02:47.940> at<00:02:48.569> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
border okay large distance at the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.030 
border okay large distance at the
beginning<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.049> round<00:02:49.170> there<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.620> course

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
beginning of the round there of course

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.220 
beginning of the round there of course
you<00:02:50.220> need<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> watch<00:02:50.579> out<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:50.819> sort<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.239> as<00:02:51.450> you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
you need to watch out for sort of as you

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.170 
you need to watch out for sort of as you
know<00:02:52.349> fast<00:02:52.739> insertions<00:02:53.459> from<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> transport

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
know fast insertions from the transport

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.699 
know fast insertions from the transport
helicopter<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.049> for<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.260> most<00:02:55.380> part<00:02:55.500> is

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
helicopter but for the most part is

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.960 
helicopter but for the most part is
going<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.890> take<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> little<00:02:56.519> bit<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.760> time

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
going to take a little bit of time

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.089 
going to take a little bit of time
cargile<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.989> things<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.829> take<00:02:59.069> a

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
cargile and things like that and take a

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.559 
cargile and things like that and take a
little<00:02:59.220> bit<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.459> time<00:02:59.700> people<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.329> get<00:03:00.450> in

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
little bit of time people to get in

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.140 
little bit of time people to get in
there<00:03:00.750> but<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.500> map<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.549> attackers<00:03:02.970> are

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
there but on this map the attackers are

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.930 
there but on this map the attackers are
right<00:03:03.450> by<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.290> first<00:03:04.560> base<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.340> cannot

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
right by that first base you cannot

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.910 
right by that first base you cannot
waste<00:03:06.209> time<00:03:06.390> screwing<00:03:07.290> around<00:03:07.440> trying<00:03:07.829> to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
waste time screwing around trying to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.770 
waste time screwing around trying to
pick<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> perfect<00:03:08.760> setup<00:03:09.000> for<00:03:09.120> your<00:03:09.329> gun<00:03:09.510> okay

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
pick a perfect setup for your gun okay

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.839 
pick a perfect setup for your gun okay
just<00:03:10.230> pick<00:03:10.410> anything<00:03:10.709> anything<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.579> half

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
just pick anything anything that's half

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.610 
just pick anything anything that's half
decent<00:03:12.090> as<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.480> defender<00:03:12.930> okay<00:03:13.140> just<00:03:13.349> look<00:03:13.500> at

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
decent as a defender okay just look at

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.500 
decent as a defender okay just look at
your<00:03:13.709> setup<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.360> know

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
your setup and go is that you know

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.479 
your setup and go is that you know
vaguely<00:03:15.959> acceptable<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.129> answer<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.459> yes

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
vaguely acceptable if the answer is yes

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.309 
vaguely acceptable if the answer is yes
and<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.180> roll<00:03:18.420> with<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.810> get<00:03:19.049> into<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
and just roll with it and get into the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.860 
and just roll with it and get into the
game<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.310> being<00:03:20.790> prepared<00:03:21.299> being<00:03:21.630> ready

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
game and this being prepared being ready

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.319 
game and this being prepared being ready
to<00:03:21.959> set<00:03:22.319> up<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.100> very<00:03:23.549> very<00:03:23.670> important

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
to set up is so very very important

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.970 
to set up is so very very important
especially<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.350> beginning<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.889> know

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
more specially you know sort of really

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.759 
more specially you know sort of really
be<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> bit<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.269> specific<00:03:33.480> than<00:03:33.989> sure<00:03:34.440> go<00:03:34.739> for

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
be a bit more specific than sure go for

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.640 
be a bit more specific than sure go for
that<00:03:35.099> but<00:03:35.430> at<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.639> initial<00:03:36.180> push<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.380> saw

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
that but at the initial push as you saw

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.589 
that but at the initial push as you saw
there<00:03:37.680> what<00:03:38.040> happened<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.120> didn't<00:03:39.420> have

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
there what happened that we didn't have

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.550 
there what happened that we didn't have
enough<00:03:39.630> they<00:03:40.079> didn't<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.349> enough<00:03:40.500> to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
enough they didn't have enough to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.319 
enough they didn't have enough to
defenders<00:03:40.859> on<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.040> ground<00:03:41.280> meaning<00:03:41.880> we<00:03:42.120> could

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
defenders on the ground meaning we could

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.629 
defenders on the ground meaning we could
just<00:03:42.540> wipe<00:03:42.780> them<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.919> that<00:03:44.099> really<00:03:44.400> and

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
just wipe them and and that really and

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.640 
just wipe them and and that really and
then<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.299> worst<00:03:45.599> part<00:03:45.900> about<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.260> it's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
then the worst part about that is it's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.129 
then the worst part about that is it's
then<00:03:46.889> sits<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.480> precedent<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.599> momentum

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
then sits like a precedent a momentum

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.289 
then sits like a precedent a momentum
precedent<00:03:49.950> where<00:03:50.280> they<00:03:50.519> can't<00:03:50.819> kind<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.120> get

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
precedent where they can't kind of get

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.699 
precedent where they can't kind of get
back<00:03:51.450> up<00:03:51.630> on<00:03:51.750> their<00:03:51.870> feet<00:03:51.930> because<00:03:52.530> you've

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
back up on their feet because you've

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.199 
back up on their feet because you've
knocked<00:03:53.040> them<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.549> hard<00:03:53.849> at<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.120> beginning

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
knocked them so hard at the beginning

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.629 
knocked them so hard at the beginning
that<00:03:54.690> they<00:03:55.319> can't<00:03:55.590> get<00:03:55.739> back<00:03:55.950> into<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.459> game

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
that they can't get back into the game

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.210 
that they can't get back into the game
and<00:03:56.849> that's<00:03:57.239> what's<00:03:57.540> awful<00:03:58.290> now<00:03:59.010> all<00:03:59.190> I

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
left somewhere I'm not always thinking

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.320 
left somewhere I'm not always thinking
about<00:05:27.110> every<00:05:28.010> little<00:05:28.160> thing<00:05:28.330> however

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
thinking about recall that's not

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.470 
thinking about recall that's not
something<00:05:31.160> that<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.610> can<00:05:31.640> consider<00:05:32.150> should

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
something that you can consider should

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.270 
something that you can consider should
be<00:05:32.630> overlooked<00:05:33.140> and<00:05:33.350> it's<00:05:33.800> something<00:05:34.040> that<00:05:34.220> I

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
be overlooked and it's something that I

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.400 
be overlooked and it's something that I
need<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.490> address<00:05:34.910> and<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.810> point<00:05:36.020> is<00:05:36.140> is<00:05:36.380> that

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
need to address and the point is is that

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.290 
need to address and the point is is that
hilariously<00:05:37.310> when<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:37.730> started<00:05:38.120> playing

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.120 
hilariously when I started playing
battlefield<00:05:38.750> 3<00:05:38.990> if<00:05:39.169> you<00:05:39.380> actually<00:05:39.530> go<00:05:39.740> back<00:05:39.919> to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
battlefield 3 if you actually go back to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.130

some<00:05:40.280> of<00:05:40.370> my<00:05:40.430> videos<00:05:40.550> like<00:05:40.940> way<00:05:41.180> back<00:05:41.390> a<00:05:41.630> lot<00:05:42.020> of

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
some of my videos like way back a lot of

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.720 
some of my videos like way back a lot of
people<00:05:42.260> kind<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:42.620> criticized<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:43.370> fact<00:05:43.610> that

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
people kind of criticized the fact that

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.480 
people kind of criticized the fact that
I<00:05:43.850> was<00:05:44.120> tap<00:05:44.510> firing<00:05:44.840> too<00:05:45.290> much<00:05:45.530> like<00:05:46.190> I'd<00:05:46.370> be

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
I was tap firing too much like I'd be

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.150 
I was tap firing too much like I'd be
like<00:05:46.640> tap<00:05:46.910> tap<00:05:47.240> tap<00:05:47.510> tap<00:05:47.780> tap<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.680> reason<00:05:49.010> for

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
like tap tap tap tap tap the reason for

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.860 
like tap tap tap tap tap the reason for
that<00:05:49.190> was<00:05:49.490> that<00:05:49.820> I<00:05:50.180> was<00:05:50.360> coming<00:05:50.510> from<00:05:50.600> bad

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
that was that I was coming from bad

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.840 
that was that I was coming from bad
company<00:05:51.260> 2<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.770> in<00:05:51.860> bad<00:05:52.040> company<00:05:52.220> 2<00:05:52.550> that<00:05:52.760> was

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
company 2 and in bad company 2 that was

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.730 
company 2 and in bad company 2 that was
generally<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.390> way<00:05:53.419> to<00:05:53.600> play<00:05:53.990> your<00:05:54.169> tap<00:05:54.440> fire

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
generally the way to play your tap fire

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.770 
generally the way to play your tap fire
tap<00:05:55.010> fire<00:05:55.280> even<00:05:55.669> more<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:56.330> than<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:56.570> would<00:05:56.690> in

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
tap fire even more so than you would in

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.659 
tap fire even more so than you would in
battlefield<00:05:57.200> 3<00:05:57.260> and<00:05:58.130> again<00:05:58.370> don't<00:05:58.580> forget

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
battlefield 3 and again don't forget

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.220 
battlefield 3 and again don't forget
probably<00:05:59.300> because<00:05:59.570> of<00:05:59.600> the<00:05:59.780> controller

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
probably because of the controller

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.050 
probably because of the controller
aspect<00:06:00.680> as<00:06:00.800> well<00:06:00.830> playing<00:06:01.250> with<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.520> gamepad

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
aspect as well playing with the gamepad

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.240 
aspect as well playing with the gamepad
that<00:06:02.720> was<00:06:02.840> another<00:06:03.050> reason<00:06:03.140> why<00:06:03.500> tap<00:06:03.740> fine<00:06:04.010> was

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
that was another reason why tap fine was

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.380 
that was another reason why tap fine was
good<00:06:04.430> thing<00:06:04.610> to<00:06:04.730> do<00:06:04.850> give<00:06:05.060> you<00:06:05.180> more<00:06:05.360> control

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
good thing to do give you more control

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.530 
good thing to do give you more control
more<00:06:05.810> accuracy<00:06:06.440> but<00:06:07.400> now<00:06:07.640> as<00:06:08.030> well<00:06:08.270> two

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
more accuracy but now as well two

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.300 
more accuracy but now as well two
reasons<00:06:08.690> battlefield<00:06:09.410> 3<00:06:09.560> plays<00:06:09.800> a<00:06:09.830> little<00:06:10.190> bit

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
reasons battlefield 3 plays a little bit

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.190

like<00:06:16.850> a<00:06:16.880> bit<00:06:17.150> more<00:06:17.300> control<00:06:17.660> and<00:06:17.930> but<00:06:18.530> I'm<00:06:18.620> kind

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
like a bit more control and but I'm kind

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.930 
like a bit more control and but I'm kind
of<00:06:18.890> going<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.220> other<00:06:19.250> way<00:06:19.400> I'm<00:06:19.669> sort<00:06:19.880> of

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
of going the other way I'm sort of

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.490 
of going the other way I'm sort of
overcompensating<00:06:20.690> for<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.140> fact<00:06:21.200> that<00:06:21.380> I

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
overcompensating for the fact that I

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.050 
overcompensating for the fact that I
have<00:06:21.650> a<00:06:21.680> little<00:06:21.890> bit<00:06:22.040> more<00:06:22.130> control<00:06:22.460> and<00:06:22.700> in

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
have a little bit more control and in

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.480 
have a little bit more control and in
the<00:06:23.180> end<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.450> ends<00:06:23.690> up<00:06:23.780> effect<00:06:24.140> of<00:06:24.260> me

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
the end it ends up effect of me

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.890 
the end it ends up effect of me
affecting<00:06:25.490> me<00:06:25.580> negatively<00:06:25.610> so<00:06:26.510> I've<00:06:26.630> kind<00:06:26.840> of

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
affecting me negatively so I've kind of

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.050 
affecting me negatively so I've kind of
gone<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.260> other<00:06:27.290> way<00:06:27.880> but<00:06:28.880> it's<00:06:29.000> an

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
gone the other way but it's an

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.310 
gone the other way but it's an
interesting<00:06:29.300> one<00:06:29.570> I<00:06:29.690> did<00:06:29.900> I<00:06:29.930> want<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.169> make<00:06:30.290> a

interesting one I did I want to make a

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.050 
interesting one I did I want to make a

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
but looking at ARMA 3 have been

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.710 
but looking at ARMA 3 have been
researching<00:07:07.520> a<00:07:07.700> few<00:07:07.910> things<00:07:08.150> and<00:07:08.330> there's

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 
researching a few things and there's

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.320 
researching a few things and there's
things<00:07:08.900> like<00:07:08.990> the<00:07:09.320> IR<00:07:10.310> track<00:07:10.640> that<00:07:11.030> you<00:07:11.150> can

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
things like the IR track that you can

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.600 
things like the IR track that you can
use<00:07:11.690> a<00:07:11.840> helicopter<00:07:12.350> piloting<00:07:13.100> and<00:07:13.220> stuff<00:07:13.430> in

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
use a helicopter piloting and stuff in

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.520 
use a helicopter piloting and stuff in
armor<00:07:13.940> there's<00:07:14.330> other<00:07:14.570> bits<00:07:14.780> and<00:07:14.960> pieces<00:07:15.320> and

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
armor there's other bits and pieces and

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.659 
armor there's other bits and pieces and
you<00:07:15.650> can<00:07:15.770> obviously<00:07:15.950> have<00:07:16.160> pedals<00:07:16.550> for

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
you can obviously have pedals for

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.970 
you can obviously have pedals for
helicopter<00:07:17.150> piloting<00:07:17.600> and<00:07:17.690> stuff<00:07:17.930> it<00:07:18.590> gives<00:07:18.830> a

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
helicopter piloting and stuff it gives a

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.340 
helicopter piloting and stuff it gives a
massive<00:07:19.580> advantage<00:07:19.760> for<00:07:20.750> anyone<00:07:21.020> who<00:07:21.080> wants

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
massive advantage for anyone who wants

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.870 
massive advantage for anyone who wants
the<00:07:21.440> pilot<00:07:21.830> things<00:07:22.040> like<00:07:22.220> this<00:07:22.310> like<00:07:22.550> like

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
the pilot things like this like like

the pilot things like this like like
ridiculously<00:07:23.530> huge<00:07:24.530> advantage<00:07:24.980> and<00:07:25.160> there's

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
ridiculously huge advantage and there's

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.400 
ridiculously huge advantage and there's
lots<00:07:25.850> of<00:07:25.970> other<00:07:26.060> peripheral<00:07:26.630> things<00:07:26.660> and<00:07:26.990> I

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410

unfair should we care there's a huge
range<00:07:32.960> of<00:07:33.200> sort<00:07:33.410> of<00:07:33.470> issues<00:07:33.770> there<00:07:33.980> with<00:07:34.130> that
