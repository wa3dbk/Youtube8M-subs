00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
 yes 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.160
 how are we all have new 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:38.340
 supplement in the protein area of 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 today in protein nutrition we are going 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.640
 of laboratories today in nutrition we 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.700
 bring your protein your protein system 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.370
 Total and call them is not a 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.220
 protein as well known as other 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.790
 laboratories like other proteins that already 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.660
 already have a lot to market and that 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.309
 Many prefer those to opt for 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.310
 this type of protein why why not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.009
 there is a lot of information on the internet, not what 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.990
 It represents 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.210
 the marks or anything if I do reliable 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.610
 but it's not the case it's a protein 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.440
 highly recommended for 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 lactose intolerant is a 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.640
 excellent option also then and 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.420
 apart winner winner last year from 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.110
 the best taste in terms of proteins 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.270
 so you have to take into account a lot 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.580
 this protein then I do not talk to them 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.060
 more bastards and we're going to commission what is 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.430
 what this protein brings here 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:49.509
 hey labs oh yeah system 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.399
 total protein that is what this brings 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.570
 protein first of all I'm going to 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.299
 to say that it is a protein is a mixture 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.740
 of protein that comes concentrated from 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:06.820
 almost innate and free whey protein 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.599
 lactose is a low supplement in 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.420
 carbohydrates and I repeat again 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:17.680
 awarded as the protein with the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.190
 better taste in the United States then 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.930
 what it brings brings because it gives 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.299
 service 45 grams are 40 and 40 40 forgiveness 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.319
 extra services for 40 services per 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:36.670
 service try 180 calories of which 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:40.569
 25 are total fat fat are 3 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.780
 grams of cholesterol 3 75 milligrams of 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.110
 carbohydrates only 35 grams is very 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.220
 low in carbohydrates in sugar 3 grams 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:55.480
 protein per service per service 32 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:01.060
 grams of calcium brings 335 milligrams of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.550
 sodium 150 milligrams and potassium 260 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.760
 milligrams then it comes very complete 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.780
 very complete this protein now in 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.790
 question of whether it dissolves is 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.370
 dissolves quite well from right is not 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.130
 necessary a blender and with the pure 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.260
 stay that dissolves quite well not 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.010
 there are lumps you do not feel that feeling 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.470
 pasty in the mouth or that the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.120
 protein at the bottom of the check with the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.170
 pure sei that comes pretty well not what 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.590
 I repeat, you do not need 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.440
 a blender go then dissolve 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.010
 pretty good now in terms of flavor 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.560
 I insist that this award that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.880
 they gave 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.220
 it is not for less knows quite enough 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.230
 rich 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.530
 the one I've tried is bread lacrim is 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.720
 the one that I've tried but there are the others 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.349
 flavors that are chocolate with 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.080
 peanut butter and strawberry 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.590
 with cream does not seem strawberry concurren 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.480
 but any of the flavors is 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.549
 pretty rich then 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.250
 is a protein that in the to be 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.150
 honest you should try it you should 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.430
 of trying another protein many times 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.750
 I repeat, we married with a certain 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.470
 protein because if it worked for us 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.780
 etcetera but maybe we do not like it 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.430
 something we do not like the taste or not 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.870
 dissolves also but as it is a 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.180
 protein with which we have already been 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.510
 so many years we do not give ourselves the opportunity 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.020
 to try another protein or if you're 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.600
 just the lactose and you're forcing 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.970
 and forcing forcing that protein that 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.690
 is not lactose-free or hungary is 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.949
 protein can be the solution if you do not 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.500
 they like the flavors of the others 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.300
 proteins this can be a very good 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.840
 solution because because it's free of 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.419
 lactose and because the taste is pretty 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.940
 pretty good and 32 gram protein 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.190
 of protein per service let's come 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.580
 quite complete this protein then 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.620
 is going to enter my top 5 that already comes my 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.289
 new top 5 I will include a top 5 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.990
 amino acids 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.509
 top 5 of proteins will come today in 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.279
 proteins sure it's going to come 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:31.789
 then this was augier review 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:34.460
 high level protein nutrition if you 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.099
 interested in this protein you know where 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.189
 get it you know where where 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.169
 buy it safe shipping you know where 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:47.389
 then you need a code of 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:50.449
 clear discount with that code of 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.240
 discount also enters then that was 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.809
 review of this joining tradition 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.349
 product do not forget that any doubt 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:03.439
 any question about this and others 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:05.569
 supplements there goes my mail if you liked 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:09.110
 the video give me a like on the button 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:16.149
 that is down here very well shares the 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:16.149
 video and if you are not yet subscribed 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.630
 what the fuck are you waiting for and remember 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.630
 what 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:29.989
 this was a tip and we'll see you in the 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.989
 following
