00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
not expect over a thousand the first

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.300 
not expect over a thousand the first
five<00:00:22.099> hours<00:00:22.450> moto<00:00:23.450> well<00:00:23.890> obviously<00:00:24.890> we<00:00:25.130> got<00:00:25.279> a

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
five hours moto well obviously we got a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.089 
five hours moto well obviously we got a
lot<00:00:25.489> more<00:00:25.520> than<00:00:25.849> we<00:00:25.970> can<00:00:26.360> actually<00:00:26.540> handle<00:00:27.099> so

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
lot more than we can actually handle so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.589 
lot more than we can actually handle so
I<00:00:28.130> think<00:00:28.250> those<00:00:28.460> democratic<00:00:29.239> way<00:00:29.360> that<00:00:29.540> we

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
I think those democratic way that we

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.630 
I think those democratic way that we
possibly<00:00:29.809> can<00:00:30.110> do<00:00:30.290> is<00:00:30.860> leave<00:00:31.070> it<00:00:31.220> down<00:00:31.369> to<00:00:31.550> the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
possibly can do is leave it down to the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.530 
possibly can do is leave it down to the

right<00:00:52.370> in<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.550> middle<00:00:52.730> that's<00:00:52.879> going<00:00:53.059> to

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
right in the middle that's going to

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.239 
right in the middle that's going to
provide<00:00:53.329> great<00:00:53.749> defensive<00:00:54.260> strength<00:00:54.499> so<00:00:55.039> tan

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
by having a farming base clearly need to

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.280 
by having a farming base clearly need to
farm<00:01:04.309> hard<00:01:04.730> doing<00:01:05.360> good<00:01:05.510> job<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.780> those<00:01:06.020> walls

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
farm hard doing good job of those walls

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
ball actually I'd say it's probably the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.110 
ball actually I'd say it's probably the
wizard<00:01:12.350> towers<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.860> more<00:01:13.640> tires<00:01:13.880> were<00:01:14.090> a

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
wizard towers and the more tires were a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.240 
wizard towers and the more tires were a
little<00:01:14.240> bit<00:01:14.390> mixed<00:01:14.600> up<00:01:14.810> you've<00:01:15.770> got<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:15.920> lot<00:01:16.220> of

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
little bit mixed up you've got a lot of

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.430 
little bit mixed up you've got a lot of
splash<00:01:16.640> damage<00:01:16.850> right<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.300> middle<00:01:17.480> as

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
splash damage right in the middle as

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.070 
splash damage right in the middle as
wizard<00:01:18.740> towers<00:01:19.100> don't<00:01:19.370> have<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.870> dead<00:01:20.870> area

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
wizard towers don't have a dead area

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.450 
wizard towers don't have a dead area
around<00:01:21.380> them<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:21.620> I<00:01:21.860> probably<00:01:22.160> put<00:01:22.430> the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
around them so I probably put the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.920 
around them so I probably put the
wizard's<00:01:22.790> house<00:01:22.940> on<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.120> outside<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.780> wall

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
attracted towards them the columns of

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.569 
attracted towards them the columns of
course<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.349> clang<00:03:03.650> castles<00:03:04.010> great<00:03:04.310> places

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
and I can see from the fact that you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.930 
and I can see from the fact that you
have<00:03:09.170> been<00:03:09.379> attacked<00:03:09.769> from<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.220> bottom<00:03:10.730> right

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
have been attacked from the bottom right

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.119 
have been attacked from the bottom right
but<00:03:11.569> it's<00:03:11.720> actually<00:03:11.840> working<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.500> you've<00:03:12.920> got

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129

but it's actually working you you've got
good<00:03:13.400> segregation<00:03:14.360> so<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.470> know<00:03:15.879> if<00:03:16.879> an

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
good segregation so you you know if an

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.789 
good segregation so you you know if an
attack<00:03:17.450> gets<00:03:17.660> into<00:03:17.930> one<00:03:17.959> pocket<00:03:18.470> they're

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
attack gets into one pocket they're

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.000 
attack gets into one pocket they're
gonna<00:03:18.890> get<00:03:19.040> stuck<00:03:19.430> there<00:03:19.670> Leah<00:03:19.910> bombarded

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
gonna get stuck there Leah bombarded

looking<00:03:22.010> at<00:03:22.069> your<00:03:22.190> air<00:03:22.370> defense<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.150> possibly

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
looking at your air defense so possibly

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.440 
looking at your air defense so possibly
put<00:03:24.200> swap<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.620> defense<00:03:25.239> put<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.329> in<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
put swap the a defense put it in a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.240 
put swap the a defense put it in a
little<00:03:26.630> bit<00:03:26.720> deeper<00:03:26.930> because<00:03:27.620> if<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:27.980> do<00:03:28.130> get

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
little bit deeper because if you do get

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.250 
little bit deeper because if you do get
attacked<00:03:28.549> from<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.880> air<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.120> pretty<00:03:29.959> pretty

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
attacked from the air it's pretty pretty

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.390 
attacked from the air it's pretty pretty
exposed<00:03:32.139> so<00:03:33.139> yeah<00:03:33.349> I<00:03:33.620> mean<00:03:33.739> depending<00:03:34.190> on<00:03:34.280> how

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400
