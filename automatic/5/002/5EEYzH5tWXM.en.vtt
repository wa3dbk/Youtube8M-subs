00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
well I really did based on the the

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.880 
well I really did based on the the
members<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.080> committee<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.589> were<00:00:04.680> put

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
members of the committee that were put

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.280 
members of the committee that were put
together<00:00:05.009> it<00:00:05.400> was<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> great<00:00:05.819> group<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.359> came

together it was a great group that came

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.320 
together it was a great group that came
in<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.680> immediately<00:00:08.010> had<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.700> best<00:00:08.910> interest

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
in and immediately had the best interest

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.140 
in and immediately had the best interest
to<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.540> sport<00:00:09.870> moving<00:00:10.200> forward<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:11.580> all<00:00:11.969> their

minds<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.870> evident<00:00:13.049> from<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
minds and that was evident from the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.810 
minds and that was evident from the
first<00:00:13.679> meeting<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.130> because<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.670> we

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
first meeting and because of that we

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.160 
first meeting and because of that we
were<00:00:15.030> able<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.870> something<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
were able to do it and it's something to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.810 
were able to do it and it's something to
be<00:00:16.199> really<00:00:16.350> excited<00:00:16.920> about<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.430> very<00:00:17.460> proud

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
circuit no matter where you're at was

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.369 
circuit no matter where you're at was
also<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:50.760> important<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> us<00:00:51.390> clearly

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
also very important to us clearly

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.260 
also very important to us clearly
important<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.489> reducing<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> cost

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
important as well was reducing the cost

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.450 
important as well was reducing the cost
of<00:00:54.449> participation<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.410> probably<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> first

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of participation so probably the first

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
of participation so probably the first
three<00:00:56.730> things<00:00:56.940> safety<00:00:57.539> good<00:00:57.930> race<00:00:58.079> ability

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
three things safety good race ability

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
three things safety good race ability
and<00:00:58.800> cost-effectiveness<00:00:59.789> were<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> first

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and cost-effectiveness were the first

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.229 
and cost-effectiveness were the first
three<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.960> looked<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.399> well<00:01:02.399> really

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
three things we looked at well really

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.880 
three things we looked at well really
anybody<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> beauty<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
anybody and that's the beauty of the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
anybody and that's the beauty of the
whole<00:01:05.040> thing<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.549> mean<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.180> faced<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> tremendous

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
whole thing I mean we faced a tremendous

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.530 
whole thing I mean we faced a tremendous
challenge<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.369> no<00:01:08.549> clear<00:01:08.820> mandate<00:01:09.180> on

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
challenge there was no clear mandate on

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
challenge there was no clear mandate on
where<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> series<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> whole

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
where to go with the series as a whole

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.539 
where to go with the series as a whole
but<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:13.049> couple<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> important

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
but there was a couple of important

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
but there was a couple of important
aspects<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> our<00:01:15.330> participants<00:01:15.960> needed<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
aspects of it our participants needed to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.980 
aspects of it our participants needed to
reduce<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.070> cost<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.490> participation<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
reduce the cost of participation and the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
reduce the cost of participation and the
fans<00:01:19.290> clearly<00:01:19.799> wanted<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.520> competition

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
fans clearly wanted to see competition

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.499 
fans clearly wanted to see competition
and<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.890> inherently<00:01:23.790> opposed<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and the two are inherently opposed to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.840 
and the two are inherently opposed to
each<00:01:24.659> other<00:01:24.900> at<00:01:25.049> least<00:01:25.140> historically

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
each other at least historically

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.690 
each other at least historically
whenever<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.030> had<00:01:28.040> competition<00:01:29.040> cost<00:01:29.460> goes

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
whenever you had competition cost goes

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
whenever you had competition cost goes
up<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.930> you've<00:01:31.110> had<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> ability<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
up and if you've had the ability to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.980 
up and if you've had the ability to
amortize<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> cost<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> entire<00:01:33.210> field<00:01:33.720> or

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
amortize the cost of the entire field or

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
amortize the cost of the entire field or
get<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> spec<00:01:34.470> series<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.520> costs<00:01:35.759> come

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
get a spec series then your costs come

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
get a spec series then your costs come
down<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> becomes<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.439> stale<00:01:37.650> series<00:01:38.159> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
down but it becomes a stale series so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 
down but it becomes a stale series so
the<00:01:39.299> challenge<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> try<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.560> create<00:01:41.280> both

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the challenge was to try and create both

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.100 
the challenge was to try and create both
of<00:01:41.880> those<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> beauty<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> what

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
