00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.619
 strap kind of like the exact model right here 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.480
 Here we are discharged from many hours with naked 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:39.210
 300h and so how would they seem to be like hd and 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.730
 additionally 1st and so beta clinics 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.510
 Well, in the plastic food with plastic bag 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:55.010
 the overall coefficient is these 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 changing hours there is a barometer altimeter and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.250
 turn the metanaut main chips chips these 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250
 o'clock 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.950
 The watch is made of plastic plastic and 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:20.150
 on top of metal is edging here 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.620
 we have a sensor but also a metal strap 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.270
 holder lock it is called such 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.270
 plan 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.270
 clamps 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:43.160
 But the type of button is the backlight button 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.080
 backlight so orange citron lighting 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:53.180
 this is an altimeter button 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:55.250
 you had 225 meters from you 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:02.500
 sort of like I'm on the road now more 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:08.920
 I am on the clock display 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:13.160
 the barometer and the thermometer here turn on 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.420
 was per liter in kilopascals now at 986 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.130
 kilopascals temperature 28 and a half 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.280
 degrees and even in some there I don't know 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.140
 in principle, here's the scale 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.690
 it is shown here now that's visible 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.280
 will be 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.540
 687 became his pressure was rising 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.959
 986 respectively the weather will be 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.640
 pressure improves weather falls 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.420
 worsening graphics here like 1 more accurately 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:54.010
 family man and climbed up here again grew and 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.010
