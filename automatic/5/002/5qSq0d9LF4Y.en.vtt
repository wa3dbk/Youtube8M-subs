00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.920 
flashing so this one here is ready
that's<00:03:49.489> taken<00:03:49.819> with<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.970> longer<00:03:50.150> brush<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.900> has

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
that's taken with a longer brush it has

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.059 
that's taken with a longer brush it has
got<00:03:51.380> cheaper<00:03:52.160> batteries<00:03:52.519> in<00:03:52.639> it<00:03:52.730> now<00:03:53.569> with

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
got cheaper batteries in it now with

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.920 
got cheaper batteries in it now with
this<00:03:55.069> power<00:03:55.940> setting<00:03:56.359> which<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.630> smaller

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
this power setting which is the smaller

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.930 
this power setting which is the smaller
set<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:58.220> can<00:03:58.400> test<00:03:58.730> fire<00:04:00.340> until<00:04:01.340> know

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
set and you can test fire until know

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.650 
set and you can test fire until know
you're<00:04:02.209> bored<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.510> guess<00:04:02.889> whereas<00:04:03.889> with<00:04:04.660> this

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
you're bored I guess whereas with this

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.640 
you're bored I guess whereas with this
one<00:04:06.069> movie<00:04:07.069> at<00:04:07.160> medium<00:04:07.549> power<00:04:07.670> they're

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
one movie at medium power they're

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.140 
one movie at medium power they're
everything<00:04:09.650> test<00:04:09.980> for<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:10.609> know<00:04:10.730> know

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
everything test for you you know know

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.750 
everything test for you you know know
how<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.299> recycle<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.889> the<00:04:13.220> full<00:04:13.549> power

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
how to recycle and that the full power

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.870 
how to recycle and that the full power
set<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.510> takes<00:04:15.139> an<00:04:15.380> age<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:16.250> recycle

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
set in it takes an age to recycle

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.390 
set in it takes an age to recycle
I<00:04:16.910> suppose<00:04:17.630> if<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.870> was<00:04:18.019> connected<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.220> power

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
I suppose if it was connected to a power

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.190 
I suppose if it was connected to a power
pack<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.849> would<00:04:19.940> precisely<00:04:20.269> over<00:04:20.419> a<00:04:20.599> second<00:04:21.109> or

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
pack it would precisely over a second or

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.149 
pack it would precisely over a second or
so<00:04:21.380> but<00:04:21.560> often<00:04:21.859> than<00:04:21.979> not

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
so but often than not

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.740 
so but often than not
they've<00:04:22.430> got<00:04:22.580> cheaper

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
they've got cheaper

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
is in decent batteries but office

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.030 
is in decent batteries but office
without<00:04:26.030> batteries<00:04:26.510> around<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.840> day<00:04:27.040> the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
without batteries around the day the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.110 
without batteries around the day the
both<00:04:28.220> came<00:04:28.430> with<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:28.670> cold<00:04:28.940> shoe<00:04:29.090> adapter

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
both came with this cold shoe adapter

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.360 
both came with this cold shoe adapter
inside<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.200> box<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:32.590> they<00:04:33.590> also<00:04:33.710> came<00:04:34.130> with

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
inside that box and they also came with

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.840 
inside that box and they also came with
a<00:04:34.790> velvet<00:04:35.480> bag<00:04:35.720> each<00:04:36.220> which<00:04:37.220> looks<00:04:37.490> like<00:04:37.550> this

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
a velvet bag each which looks like this

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.700 
a velvet bag each which looks like this
little<00:04:38.090> drawstring<00:04:38.480> bag<00:04:38.720> if<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:39.350> seen<00:04:39.530> my

what's in my bag video you've seen that

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.350 
what's in my bag video you've seen that
I<00:04:41.240> use<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:41.630> as<00:04:41.690> camera<00:04:41.930> protection<00:04:42.380> and

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
I use it as camera protection and

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.400 
I use it as camera protection and
because<00:04:44.360> we<00:04:44.540> have<00:04:44.660> no<00:04:44.690> communication<00:04:45.350> with

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410

because we have no communication with
camera<00:04:45.770> at<00:04:45.860> all<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.040> used<00:04:46.490> these<00:04:46.700> which<00:04:47.000> are<00:04:47.180> the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
camera at all I used these which are the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.520 
camera at all I used these which are the
cheaper<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.610> think<00:04:49.880> like<00:04:50.420> y'all<00:04:50.690> know<00:04:50.900> young

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
cheaper I think like y'all know young

Niro<00:04:51.920> ripoffs<00:04:52.340> radio<00:04:53.180> receivers<00:04:53.750> and

Niro ripoffs radio receivers and

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
transmitters like the 16 channel so I

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.220 
transmitters like the 16 channel so I
use<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.160> on<00:04:58.340> one<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.550> them<00:04:58.820> on<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.930> manual

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
use that on one of them on the manual

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.750 
use that on one of them on the manual
more<00:05:00.500> than<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:00.710> use<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.919> other<00:05:01.010> one<00:05:01.130> on<00:05:01.250> slave<00:05:01.490> 1

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760

a<00:05:06.650> flash<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:07.100> then<00:05:07.360> uses<00:05:08.360> that<00:05:08.540> then<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:09.380> fire

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
a flash and then uses that then to fire
