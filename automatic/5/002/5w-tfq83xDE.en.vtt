can<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:43.079> they're<00:01:43.229> some<00:01:43.320> pretty<00:01:43.350> strong

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
can see they're some pretty strong

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
can see they're some pretty strong
backlighting<00:01:44.399> coming<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> Sun<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
backlighting coming in from the Sun so I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.960 
backlighting coming in from the Sun so I
