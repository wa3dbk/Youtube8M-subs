00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 in these six years 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.230
 Argentina 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.460
 that started in May 2003 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.340
 with almost 25% unemployment 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.719
 quarter 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.619
 of its population economically 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.079
 active lacked work 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.069
 the workers were hardly participating 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.560
 in 34 percent 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.689
 from the pv 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 nine billion dollars just reserves 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the central bank 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.280
 a pension system 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.960
 that also during the 90s 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.230
 yes a day ant 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590
 appropriate 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.160
 the solidarity-based distribution system had been landed and it had been adopted 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.700
 a capitalization system 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 administered 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.790
 for the sector 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.030
 private 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.400
 after these six years 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.380
 we finished the year 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.380
 2008 konÃ© if this point 3 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.050
 of unemployment 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 by the workers 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.760
 participating in a 43 points 6 percent already much closer 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.210
 of the fit and city 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 of our gross domestic product 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 with a central bank 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890
 with more than 46 thousand 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.870
 millions 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.240
 of reservation dollars 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.110
 for more than 1,500 collective bargaining agreements negotiated 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.310
 for the first time 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.700
 after a long time 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.120
 reappeared 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.220
 collective bargaining 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.730
 between workers and employers 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.890
 that allowed to improve 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.000
 acquisitive power 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.620
 from the workers 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.500
 and at the same time 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.270
 shape 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.330
 an important a very important internal market 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 for the formalization of work 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.829
 with formalization of work approximately in the year 2003 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.859
 50% of the workers were in black in the Argentine Republic 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.959
 the last measurement 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.109
 we have managed to descend to 36% still missing but we are going 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.999
 in the good way 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.049
 we have incorporated 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.349
 to all millions of people 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.349
 to personal pension benefits 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.469
 what a bull 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.949
 the privatizations 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.629
 or by unscrupulous patterns 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629
 that they had not made their contributions or maybe 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.700
 for having lost his job during the long period 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 given the very high rates of unemployment that 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.389
 they were lacking 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.650
 of the possibility of benefiting from a pension benefit 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.139
 with a broad moratorium we incorporate two million more Argentines 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.489
 who hears integrate the protection network 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.829
 social security 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.909
 of the most important ones maybe 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.849
 of the whole continent but 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:20.919
 the most 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.199
 important 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.509
 because also 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.249
 we must say 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.709
 that one of the most important measures 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.139
 perhaps 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.259
 lamas important strangers as far as 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.099
 to its structural character to the model 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.179
 return 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:40.990
 by far te of the state 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.020
 the administration of the resources of the workers who were in hands 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.020
 from the private sector 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.419
 this has also been key 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.590
 why 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.819
 although it is not created 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.909
 it is a capitalization system 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.349
 private 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.819
 to be able to pay 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.099
 the minimum pension for those who had retired by the private system in the 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.099
 order of 60% of the contributors to the private system the national state the 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.709
 public sector 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.709
 had to take care of what the sector 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.310
 private 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.520
 I did not do it but also 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.699
 but also 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.090
 instead of developing 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.110
 a leafy 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.449
 tati tept capital market to which they could access 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:37.599
 SMEs 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.590
 different companies 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.789
 he had settled 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.789
 I will select 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:47.800
 our upo of companies that were the only ones that accessed 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.289
 to that market 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.080
 of capital 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.449
 in this way 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.809
 the resources of the workers 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:56.670
 Today are 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.700
 one 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.070
 of the instruments precisely pending to sustain the level of 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.150
 activity 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.189
 and in freedom from employment 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.400
 I will stay 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.749
 in order to have 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:12.669
 the capitalization that these systems demand today to overlook 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.629
 the billions of dollars that were lost 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.250
 in toxic assets that these administrators had and that is something 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.439
 similar to what has happened in other countries for you to have an idea 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.460
 the law 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.249
 the private capitalization system demanded 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:36.659
 that will be used 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.499
 to housing 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:39.770
 0 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.270
 eat percent without ccoo this meant the possibility of doing 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.889
 approximately 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.909
 half a million homes in the Argentine Republic 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.569
 only seven hundred fifty houses were made
