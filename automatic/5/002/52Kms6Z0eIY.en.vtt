public<00:00:12.630> hop<00:00:13.320> rod<00:00:13.500> ride<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:13.920> tasted<00:00:14.639> recently

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
public hop rod ride we tasted recently

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.029 
public hop rod ride we tasted recently
and<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.839> decided<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.289> make<00:00:16.859> our

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
and we just decided to make our

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.830 
and we just decided to make our
ingredients<00:00:17.760> sort<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.119> similar<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.630> by

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
ingredients sort of similar to that by

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.179 
ingredients sort of similar to that by
using<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.199> decent<00:00:19.529> amount<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.740> rye<00:00:19.890> we're<00:00:20.100> gonna

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
using a decent amount of rye we're gonna

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
using a decent amount of rye we're gonna
use<00:00:20.340> two<00:00:20.490> pounds<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.910> rye<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.630> pound<00:00:21.900> of

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
use two pounds of rye one pound of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.890 
use two pounds of rye one pound of
crystal<00:00:22.199> malt<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.800> then<00:00:23.310> eight<00:00:24.210> pounds<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
crystal malt and then eight pounds of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.750 
crystal malt and then eight pounds of
liquid<00:00:25.500> malt<00:00:25.650> extract<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.550> then<00:00:26.640> we're

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
liquid malt extract so and then we're

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
liquid malt extract so and then we're
gonna<00:00:26.849> use<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> combination<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
gonna use a combination of the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
gonna use a combination of the
Centennial<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.160> Cascade<00:00:29.670> hops<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.240> should

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
Centennial and Cascade hops this should

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.690 
Centennial and Cascade hops this should
be<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> great<00:00:30.840> huge<00:00:31.560> IPA<00:00:32.099> should<00:00:32.430> give<00:00:32.579> us<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
be a great huge IPA should give us a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.940 
be a great huge IPA should give us a
nice<00:00:32.969> floral<00:00:33.540> flavor<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.590> supposed<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
nice floral flavor and it's supposed to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.290 
nice floral flavor and it's supposed to
end<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.280> somewhere<00:00:35.640> between<00:00:35.850> somewhere

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
end up somewhere between somewhere

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
end up somewhere between somewhere
around<00:00:36.450> 8%<00:00:36.930> alcohol<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> very<00:00:38.100> big<00:00:38.309> IPA

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
around 8% alcohol so it's a very big IPA

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
around 8% alcohol so it's a very big IPA
almost<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> double<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.750> we're<00:00:40.230> excited<00:00:40.500> so

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
effort we started using this sanitizer

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
effort we started using this sanitizer
yeah<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> liquid<00:00:59.489> sanitizer<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.510> just

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
yeah it's a liquid sanitizer we just

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
yeah it's a liquid sanitizer we just
fill<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> bathtub<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.649> water<00:01:01.710> throw

is sanitizing all of our equipment is
we're<00:01:09.840> gonna<00:01:09.930> steep<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> grains<00:01:10.350> yeah<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.340> got

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it to 170 as you can see the rise turned

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
it to 170 as you can see the rise turned
this<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.990> red<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.920> getting<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
this very red and it's getting up to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340 
this very red and it's getting up to
near<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> temperature<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.320> we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
near the temperature we want to be so we

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.639 
near the temperature we want to be so we
got<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> at<00:01:58.770> 170<00:01:59.729> degrees<00:02:00.030> Fahrenheit<00:02:00.689> just

now and we're gonna add them at I have
the<00:02:26.079> sugar<00:02:26.290> water<00:02:26.439> from<00:02:26.709> here<00:02:26.950> into<00:02:27.310> here

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
the sugar water from here into here

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.459 
the sugar water from here into here
straight<00:02:27.939> up<00:02:27.969> the<00:02:28.150> grains<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:28.719> then<00:02:29.290> we'll<00:02:29.409> be

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
straight up the grains and then we'll be

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.319 
straight up the grains and then we'll be
good<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.889> boil<00:02:30.099> so<00:02:30.939> now<00:02:31.060> we're<00:02:31.180> going<00:02:31.269> to

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
good for the boil so now we're going to

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.300 
good for the boil so now we're going to
use<00:02:31.450> our<00:02:31.599> sanitized<00:02:32.049> scoops<00:02:32.439> strainers<00:02:33.040> in

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
use our sanitized scoops strainers in

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.039 
use our sanitized scoops strainers in
order<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.609> scoop<00:02:33.819> out<00:02:33.969> all<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
grades the specialty grains and put them

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.089 
grades the specialty grains and put them
in<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.290> holding<00:02:38.290> container<00:02:38.650> right<00:02:38.859> here

Bruins health so we took a big scoop of

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.119 
Bruins health so we took a big scoop of
the<00:02:46.389> grains<00:02:46.629> out<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.530> we're<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:47.799> letting<00:02:47.950> it

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
the grains out and we're just letting it

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.619 
the grains out and we're just letting it
drain<00:02:48.340> out<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.819> now<00:02:48.939> we're<00:02:49.120> gonna<00:02:49.209> pour<00:02:49.569> the

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
drain out and now we're gonna pour the

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.470 
drain out and now we're gonna pour the
remaining<00:02:50.109> bits<00:02:50.500> into<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.250> scoop<00:02:52.180> strainer

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
remaining bits into the scoop strainer

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.230 
remaining bits into the scoop strainer
right<00:02:53.230> into<00:02:53.560> our<00:02:53.590> brew<00:02:54.040> Co

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.370 

right<00:03:01.240> now<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> was<00:03:01.570> fudging<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.050> grains<00:03:02.230> with

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
right now I was fudging the grains with

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.660 
right now I was fudging the grains with
some<00:03:02.500> water<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:02.830> means<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.130> pouring<00:03:03.520> water

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
some water that means I'm pouring water

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.610 
some water that means I'm pouring water
over<00:03:04.000> them<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.450> they're<00:03:04.660> through<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.290> strainer

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
over them and they're through a strainer

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.650 
over them and they're through a strainer
so<00:03:05.890> I'm<00:03:06.100> getting<00:03:06.220> all<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.940> sugars<00:03:07.210> possible

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
so I'm getting all the sugars possible

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.410 
so I'm getting all the sugars possible
out<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.990> grains<00:03:08.970> now<00:03:09.970> we're<00:03:10.090> turning<00:03:10.180> up

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
out of the grains now we're turning up

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.120 
out of the grains now we're turning up
the<00:03:10.540> heat<00:03:10.570> on<00:03:10.840> our<00:03:10.990> main<00:03:11.200> group<00:03:11.500> pot<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:12.010> we're

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
the heat on our main group pot and we're

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.520 
the heat on our main group pot and we're
gonna<00:03:12.190> bring<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.490> up<00:03:12.520> to<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.700> boil<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.320> water

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
gonna bring it up to a boil so the water

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.230 
gonna bring it up to a boil so the water
that<00:03:14.710> we're<00:03:14.860> left<00:03:15.010> with<00:03:15.280> after<00:03:15.460> straining<00:03:15.970> is

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
that we're left with after straining is

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.590 
that we're left with after straining is
really<00:03:16.570> deep<00:03:17.020> dark<00:03:17.470> red<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:18.550> know<00:03:18.760> we're<00:03:19.420> now

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
really deep dark red you know we're now

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
bunch of salt in a water here to make

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.899 
bunch of salt in a water here to make
the<00:05:10.240> ice<00:05:10.449> really<00:05:11.289> activate<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.400> really<00:05:12.699> make

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
the ice really activate and really make

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.540 
the ice really activate and really make
the<00:05:13.030> water<00:05:13.240> show<00:05:13.840> that<00:05:14.050> really<00:05:14.349> fast<00:05:14.620> we're

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
the water show that really fast we're

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.370 
the water show that really fast we're
trying<00:05:15.819> to<00:05:15.880> get<00:05:15.970> it<00:05:16.120> down<00:05:16.270> just<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.870> room

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
trying to get it down just to room

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.260 
trying to get it down just to room
temperature<00:05:17.680> as<00:05:17.949> quickly<00:05:18.250> as<00:05:18.490> possible<00:05:19.060> so

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
temperature as quickly as possible so

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.969 
temperature as quickly as possible so
you're<00:05:19.719> gonna<00:05:19.810> fill<00:05:20.139> this<00:05:20.229> full<00:05:20.560> of<00:05:20.710> ice<00:05:20.949> and

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
you're gonna fill this full of ice and

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.219 
you're gonna fill this full of ice and
water<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.669> then<00:05:22.330> it's<00:05:22.509> going<00:05:22.599> to<00:05:22.659> really

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
water and then it's going to really

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.809 
water and then it's going to really
chill<00:05:23.590> down<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.830> world<00:05:24.130> it's<00:05:24.310> gonna<00:05:24.490> really

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
chill down the world it's gonna really

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.700 
chill down the world it's gonna really
work<00:05:25.030> well<00:05:25.270> all<00:05:25.840> right<00:05:25.900> now<00:05:26.289> we're<00:05:26.440> doing<00:05:26.530> our

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
work well all right now we're doing our

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.399 
work well all right now we're doing our
final<00:05:26.979> hop<00:05:27.400> addition<00:05:27.849> it's<00:05:28.360> Lisa<00:05:28.750> our<00:05:28.930> aroma

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
final hop addition it's Lisa our aroma

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.770 
final hop addition it's Lisa our aroma
hops<00:05:29.620> strictly<00:05:30.280> they<00:05:30.639> will<00:05:30.819> add<00:05:30.969> a<00:05:31.000> lot<00:05:31.389> to<00:05:31.419> the

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
hops strictly they will add a lot to the

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.860 
hops strictly they will add a lot to the
nose<00:05:32.169> but<00:05:32.530> not<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.770> lot<00:05:33.039> of<00:05:33.159> flavor<00:05:33.490> so<00:05:33.870> we're

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
nose but not a lot of flavor so we're

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.350 
nose but not a lot of flavor so we're
gonna<00:05:34.979> half<00:05:35.979> an<00:05:36.130> ounce<00:05:36.250> of<00:05:36.580> Centennial<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.300> a

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
gonna half an ounce of Centennial and a

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.230 
gonna half an ounce of Centennial and a
half<00:05:37.569> an<00:05:37.750> ounce<00:05:37.840> of<00:05:38.080> Cascade<00:05:38.289> all<00:05:39.280> at<00:05:39.430> once<00:05:39.580> all

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
half an ounce of Cascade all at once all

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.580 
half an ounce of Cascade all at once all
right<00:05:40.300> so<00:05:40.569> now<00:05:40.690> we're<00:05:40.900> going<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.080> transfer<00:05:41.500> the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
right so now we're going to transfer the

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.800 
right so now we're going to transfer the
hot<00:05:41.800> wort<00:05:42.130> right<00:05:42.759> into<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.210> freezing<00:05:43.599> cold

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
hot wort right into the freezing cold

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.779 
hot wort right into the freezing cold
water<00:05:44.139> that<00:05:44.319> I<00:05:44.380> prepared<00:05:44.770> earlier<00:05:44.949> so<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.639> key

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
water that I prepared earlier so the key

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.890 
water that I prepared earlier so the key
here<00:05:45.819> is<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.690> keep<00:05:46.930> stirring<00:05:47.469> old<00:05:48.250> one<00:05:48.599> because

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.209 

the<00:05:52.900> extremely<00:05:53.680> hot

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.399 

and<00:05:56.489> you<00:05:56.580> must<00:05:56.879> keep<00:05:57.179> this<00:05:57.419> coal<00:05:57.749> are<00:05:57.989> moving

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
and you must keep this coal are moving

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.559 
and you must keep this coal are moving
by<00:05:58.589> it<00:05:58.909> otherwise<00:06:00.259> won't<00:06:01.259> cool<00:06:01.499> very<00:06:01.770> fast

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
by it otherwise won't cool very fast

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.330 
by it otherwise won't cool very fast
make<00:06:04.569> sure<00:06:04.780> closed<00:06:05.080> out<00:06:05.259> very<00:06:05.530> quickly<00:06:05.710> 270

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
make sure closed out very quickly 270

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
make sure closed out very quickly 270
degrees<00:06:06.669> that's<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.120> time<00:06:07.300> 3<00:06:07.569> 1<00:06:09.030> so<00:06:10.030> now<00:06:10.150> we're

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
degrees that's the time 3 1 so now we're

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.969 
degrees that's the time 3 1 so now we're
going<00:06:10.449> to<00:06:10.539> siphon<00:06:10.720> right<00:06:11.169> into<00:06:11.470> a<00:06:11.500> strainer

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
going to siphon right into a strainer

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.990 
going to siphon right into a strainer
and<00:06:14.160> clarify<00:06:15.160> this<00:06:15.220> beer<00:06:15.520> as<00:06:15.669> much<00:06:15.819> as

before you before you throw the yeast is

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.529 
before you before you throw the yeast is
that<00:06:21.069> you<00:06:21.160> have<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.610> check<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.360> specific

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
that you have to check the specific

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.650 
that you have to check the specific
gravity<00:06:22.990> of<00:06:23.229> the<00:06:23.410> beer<00:06:23.759> to<00:06:24.759> check<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:25.300> see<00:06:25.330> how

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
gravity of the beer to check and see how

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.540 
gravity of the beer to check and see how
how<00:06:25.990> much<00:06:26.169> sugar<00:06:26.380> is<00:06:26.680> actually<00:06:26.860> dissolved<00:06:27.310> in

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
how much sugar is actually dissolved in

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.260 
how much sugar is actually dissolved in
here<00:06:27.699> and<00:06:28.199> we<00:06:29.199> seem<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:29.800> have<00:06:30.009> a<00:06:30.430> specific

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
here and we seem to have a specific

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.219 
here and we seem to have a specific
gravity<00:06:31.449> of<00:06:32.039> 1.12<00:06:33.750> all<00:06:34.750> right<00:06:34.900> well<00:06:35.110> we've

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
gravity of 1.12 all right well we've

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:36.779 
gravity of 1.12 all right well we've
loaded<00:06:35.380> this<00:06:35.620> thing<00:06:35.680> up<00:06:35.949> to<00:06:36.130> a<00:06:36.159> little<00:06:36.400> over<00:06:36.460> 5

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
loaded this thing up to a little over 5

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.999 
loaded this thing up to a little over 5
gallons<00:06:37.210> and<00:06:37.449> now<00:06:37.599> we<00:06:37.840> are<00:06:38.110> preparing<00:06:38.860> to

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
gallons and now we are preparing to

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:40.770 
gallons and now we are preparing to
pitch<00:06:39.159> the<00:06:39.340> east<00:06:39.490> but<00:06:40.090> before<00:06:40.360> you<00:06:40.419> pitch<00:06:40.599> the

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
pitch the east but before you pitch the

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.149 
pitch the east but before you pitch the
east<00:06:40.900> yet<00:06:41.169> to<00:06:41.259> aerate<00:06:41.500> it<00:06:43.770> all<00:06:44.770> right<00:06:44.919> we're

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159 
east yet to aerate it all right we're

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.860 
east yet to aerate it all right we're
going<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.340> be<00:06:45.430> using<00:06:45.550> a<00:06:45.819> liquid<00:06:46.150> yeast<00:06:46.449> for<00:06:46.720> our

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
going to be using a liquid yeast for our

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.200 
going to be using a liquid yeast for our
firm<00:06:47.409> attention<00:06:47.800> and<00:06:48.099> the<00:06:48.880> important<00:06:49.180> thing

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
firm attention and the important thing

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.270 
firm attention and the important thing
is<00:06:49.479> here<00:06:49.750> it's<00:06:49.990> got<00:06:50.169> a<00:06:50.199> little<00:06:50.560> bit<00:06:50.770> of<00:06:50.979> a<00:06:51.069> yeast

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
is here it's got a little bit of a yeast

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.399 
is here it's got a little bit of a yeast
bubble<00:06:51.909> inside<00:06:52.300> here<00:06:52.539> you<00:06:52.810> have<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:52.990> break<00:06:53.259> the

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
bubble inside here you have to break the

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:55.950 
bubble inside here you have to break the
bubble<00:06:53.590> before<00:06:54.039> you<00:06:54.400> can<00:06:54.550> pitch<00:06:54.699> it<00:06:54.849> so<00:06:55.419> it's

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
bubble before you can pitch it so it's

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.830 
bubble before you can pitch it so it's
got<00:06:56.139> locate<00:06:56.620> the<00:06:56.740> cocoa<00:06:57.039> packet<00:06:57.810> there<00:06:58.810> is

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
got locate the cocoa packet there is

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.689 
got locate the cocoa packet there is
then<00:06:59.590> you<00:06:59.680> just<00:06:59.830> hit<00:06:59.979> a<00:07:00.099> bunch<00:07:00.250> of<00:07:00.400> times<00:07:00.580> until

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
then you just hit a bunch of times until

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:06.270 
then you just hit a bunch of times until
the<00:07:00.909> bubble<00:07:01.210> breaks<00:07:03.840> alright<00:07:04.840> after<00:07:05.800> prepping

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
the bubble breaks alright after prepping

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.950
