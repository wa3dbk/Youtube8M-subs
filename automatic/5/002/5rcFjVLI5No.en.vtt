00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 g 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.869
 hello to all and welcome to my 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.270
 second tutorial today we will see 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:38.830
 how to apply a 3d effect on a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:42.610
 photo this effect here we go from a 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.710
 picture all neutral like this and you 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 go see that it's pretty easy enough 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.030
 to understand the method 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.710
 So here we go 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.160
 trim age you will look for it in your 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.450
 folders - she's here and not you the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.070
 drag 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.070
 on photoshop to open it 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:20.229
 on a little bug I see it you go 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:24.170
 in open files and you bring back 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.480
 your image paf 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.340
 and here we go 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.860
 unlock our calm so double 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.410
 click on layer background and paf 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.540
 it turns into a few zeros we're going 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.780
 power the public and so against olive 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.310
 or so right click public and the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.530
 calife that's the same control or 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.410
 duplicate the case once it's done 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.990
 we will create a new layer so in 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.470
 pressing the small icon at the bottom to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.180
 right 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.320
 or you go on layer 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.090
 new layer here are the selections you 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.790
 so here you are checking that you are 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.630
 position well on it and we will 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.900
 look in our 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.970
 of color the special color for the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.940
 blue so then the deal is very simple 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:22.580
 it's 0-0 fff of 0.4 is born there a pc on 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.370
 will just take on your calm so 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.060
 touch b brush or consider here 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.600
 so all this b and in color not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.520
 important 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.380
 yeah we duplicate this with control j 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.820
 and to apply a negative effect on 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.140
 the latter case we will support control y 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.650
 have required became red so c 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.580
 was the opposite color to the blues 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.600
 we have our layers once it's 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.850
 do you go wrong 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.220
 who knows of colored layers so in 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.350
 clicking on the little eye next to and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.120
 go to the upper layer so 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.760
 some zeros copy so our calix 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.220
 have masked well we go on our 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.610
 talk 0 copy and we will go down 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.770
 the opacity at 45% of the shots you press 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.630
 on the b key on your keyboard is on 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.370
 the left directional key for 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:27.400
 can the offbeat here we see that it is 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.750
 shifts and that's what will be able to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:37.000
 give a 3d effect at the end so we 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:41.500
 returns opacity to 100% and reactivates 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.500
 no2 layer of colors so here we are 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.120
 move the blue layer between the two 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.160
 other layer so that we are the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.710
 layer 0 the calculation the few zeros 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.300
 bobby and calculating a copy so we're going 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.810
 renault mende that all that to see 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:03.420
 clearer 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:03.420
 we will put blue background then 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.160
 background copy and red 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.410
 so where should have 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.750
 background blue copy background 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.220
 and red 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.690
 what are we going to do now we are going 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.670
 take we will put ourselves on our 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.030
 some blue we will change the mode of 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.050
 superimposed merger did click 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.590
 right on I have only the cac 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.700
 lower and we put everything in mode 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.700
 product that's all we do 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.220
 same manipulation on which that red 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.260
 evian changes the mode superposition I 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.100
 have only a few inferior come but 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:54.930
 all this in product mode 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:57.360
 and here you have your 3d effect against 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.630
 here it is we only have a small 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.380
 handling business and right flatten 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.890
 the picture and you go so you have 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.770
 all vocal merge so here we go 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.590
 just crop it took us the tool 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.390
 cropping one of course the sweet it's from 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.900
 your keyboard 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:21.180
 from the corner you go here 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.160
 take it because we have it 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.850
 shifted a little so that to spin off the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.830
 red band on the side it's normal 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.440
 do not worry and here you are 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.510
 crop and it's all clean is no longer 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.230
 than to record 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.230
 here and soon
