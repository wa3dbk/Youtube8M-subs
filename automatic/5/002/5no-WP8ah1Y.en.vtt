are in England don't you know now I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.509 
are in England don't you know now I
bought<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:18.140> while<00:00:19.140> ago<00:00:20.240> sighs<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.539> doom

bought of this while ago sighs of doom
I've<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> comparison<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.830> against

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
I've got a comparison here against

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.640 
I've got a comparison here against
another<00:00:26.130> bottle<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.730> made<00:00:27.439> Midsummer's<00:00:28.439> Mead

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
another bottle I made Midsummer's Mead

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.479 
another bottle I made Midsummer's Mead
yeah<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> difference<00:00:31.489> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
yeah you can see the difference this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.420 
yeah you can see the difference this
one's<00:00:32.759> cloudy<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:33.899> reason<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:35.100> one's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
one's cloudy for some reason this one's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.020 
one's cloudy for some reason this one's
clear<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> bell<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.320> clear<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.850> yes

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
clear as a bell really is clear and yes

clear as a bell really is clear and yes
what<00:00:40.190> got<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.640> sample<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.420> well

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
what got a bit of a sample here as well

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.380 
what got a bit of a sample here as well
have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> look<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.090> me<00:00:48.210> through

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
have a look at this you see me through

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.950 
have a look at this you see me through
there<00:00:51.140> unbelievably<00:00:52.140> clear<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.860> very<00:00:53.280> clear

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
there unbelievably clear very very clear

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.950 
there unbelievably clear very very clear
now<00:00:54.960> before<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.579> test<00:00:56.960> I'm

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
now before we do a bit of a test I'm

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
now before we do a bit of a test I'm
going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.460> get<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> old<00:00:59.730> book<00:00:59.910> out<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.399> tell

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
going to get the old book out and tell

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.789 
going to get the old book out and tell
you<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.579> went<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:04.559> four

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
you what went in there so it was four

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.500 
you what went in there so it was four
liters<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.430> apple<00:01:06.119> juice<00:01:06.680> four<00:01:07.680> jars<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> honey

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
liters or apple juice four jars of honey

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
liters or apple juice four jars of honey
think<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.750> where<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.049> went<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.409> little<00:01:10.439> bit

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
think that's where I went a little bit

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.179 
think that's where I went a little bit
wrong<00:01:11.900> because<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> OG<00:01:13.439> was<00:01:14.390> 103<00:01:15.390> 1.1<00:01:16.200> 35<00:01:16.890> in

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
wrong because the OG was 103 1.1 35 in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.300 
wrong because the OG was 103 1.1 35 in
fact<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:17.850> off<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.090> top<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.750> scale

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
fact it was off the top of the scale

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.590 
fact it was off the top of the scale
what<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.390> high<00:01:23.210> Naga<00:01:24.210> chili

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
what can I say very very high Naga chili

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.710 
what can I say very very high Naga chili
powder<00:01:25.549> one<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> hottest<00:01:26.970> chilies<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
powder one of the hottest chilies in the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
powder one of the hottest chilies in the
world<00:01:28.040> very<00:01:29.040> nice<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.960> used<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.500> VIN<00:01:31.740> gv3

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
world very nice and I used to go VIN gv3

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.890 
world very nice and I used to go VIN gv3
yeast<00:01:34.009> that<00:01:35.009> might<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.180> caused<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
yeast that might have caused a bit of a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.679 
yeast that might have caused a bit of a
problem<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:38.189> high<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.030> mean

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
problem because it's not high I mean

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
problem because it's not high I mean
it's<00:01:39.840> supposed<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.320> quite<00:01:40.560> high<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.070> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it's supposed to be quite high but it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.749 
it's supposed to be quite high but it's
not<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> massively<00:01:42.150> high<00:01:42.450> tolerating<00:01:43.259> yeast

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
not a massively high tolerating yeast

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.889 
not a massively high tolerating yeast
and<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.960> FG<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:48.030> point<00:01:48.540> zero<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and the the FG was one point zero to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.270 
and the the FG was one point zero to
four<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.670> high<00:01:51.950> fifteen<00:01:52.950> percent

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
four so really high fifteen percent

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.800 
four so really high fifteen percent
alcohol<00:01:53.579> by<00:01:54.210> volume<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:55.470> too<00:01:55.530> bad

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
alcohol by volume so that's not too bad

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.980 
alcohol by volume so that's not too bad
wrapped<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.049> twice<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:59.369> taken<00:01:59.790> seven<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
wrapped it twice it's taken seven and a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.940 
wrapped it twice it's taken seven and a
half<00:02:01.020> months<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> far<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
half months so far to get this to get to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.870 
half months so far to get this to get to
this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.070 
this
lovely<00:02:06.570> stuff<00:02:07.520> now<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:09.539> tried<00:02:10.020> this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
lovely stuff now I have tried this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.600 
lovely stuff now I have tried this
before<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:11.180> think<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.360> tried<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.080> about<00:02:13.890> two

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
before I think I tried it about two

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.559 
before I think I tried it about two
months<00:02:15.000> ago<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:18.000> going<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
months ago so this is going to be the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.080 
months ago so this is going to be the
final<00:02:18.959> product<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.650> I'm<00:02:20.610> really<00:02:20.849> looking

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
final product and I'm really looking

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.910 
final product and I'm really looking
forward<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.319> know<00:02:22.380> some<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.769> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
forward to it and I know some of you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.059 
forward to it and I know some of you
guys<00:02:23.069> are<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:24.470> going<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.530> move<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:26.010> of

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
guys are just going to move this out of

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.670 
guys are just going to move this out of
the<00:02:26.160> way<00:02:27.230> there<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.349> go<00:02:29.599> very<00:02:30.599> very<00:02:30.989> clean<00:02:31.410> very

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the way there we go very very clean very

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.059 
the way there we go very very clean very
clean<00:02:32.239> there's<00:02:33.239> one<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.989> can<00:02:34.260> see<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.680> tiny

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
clean there's one I can see a tiny

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.180 
clean there's one I can see a tiny
little<00:02:35.610> speck<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:39.440> looks<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.769> term

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
little speck in there looks like a term

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.630 
little speck in there looks like a term
seed<00:02:42.030> or<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.360> piece<00:02:42.599> of<00:02:42.650> dust<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.280> otherwise

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
seed or a piece of dust but otherwise

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.220 
seed or a piece of dust but otherwise
that<00:02:45.030> might<00:02:45.209> have<00:02:45.299> been<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.630> glass<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.110> be
