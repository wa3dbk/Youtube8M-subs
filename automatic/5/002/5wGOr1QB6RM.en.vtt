00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:09.240
 we will start now with this number you 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:16.510
 we have seven million 346 thousand 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 five hundred 21.30 and two thousandths 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.200
 let's think and I'll fix 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.580
 specifically in two numbers this 3 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.700
 and this 3 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.460
 I'll do it because we're going to analyze the value 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.510
 positional and we will compare in the sense 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.260
 how big is this 3 compared 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.220
 with this same 3 according to the value 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.019
 positional that each one is occupying and 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.809
 to analyze the positional value 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.699
 we will start from the units this one 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.570
 It is found in the units 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.150
 if we go to the right side 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.909
 we will be thinking that every change of 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.610
 positional value represents us a 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.479
 tenth of the value of the side 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.440
 left or a division between 10 so is 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.440
 what do we say 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.350
 a tenth or a tenth of this 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.160
 unity 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.070
 if we go to two hundredths 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.190
 we will have hundredths this is the value of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.450
 the hundredths and the place value of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.450
 the thousands and mos 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.830
 now to the left is different 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.610
 to the left what really 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.120
 we are doing is multiply by 10 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.670
 in every change of positional value is 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:47.420
 say that in the tens we will have 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.979
 10 units these are the tens is the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.890
 number that is here will be multiplied 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.520
 by 10 because that is the value that is 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.679
 representing towards the hundreds 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.780
 we go to the left 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.460
 multiplying by 10 in the same way 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.460
 the units of thousand 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.470
 these are the thousand units the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.470
 tens of thousands 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.440
 the hundreds of thousands 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.010
 hundreds of thousands and units of 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.010
 million 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.750
 units of million now if we think about 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.250
 this 3 and this 3 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:38.990
 what we have is this 3 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.990
 this is 100,000 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.240
 this 3 in the position of the hundreds of 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.680
 thousands represents 3 x 100 thousand 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.680
 what will be the same 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.750
 300,000 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.810
 300,000 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.209
 we go with the other three that we have here 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.760
 is exactly the same number is a 3 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.079
 however the place value 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.180
 we have in the hundredths and this what 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:19.319
 it means to us is that we have a 3 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.590
 multiplied by one hundredth or what 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.590
 It does not matter 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.340
 3 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.900
 hundredths how would we know what 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.970
 so big is this 3 regarding this 3 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.090
 We can not think in the following way 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.180
 if we multiply each position 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.720
 of value to the left we will be 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.720
 making a change multiplying by 10 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.840
 by 10 x 10 by 10 and so we would have to 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.830
 this 3 to reach positional value 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.120
 of this 3 I would make a change or I would make a 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:10.769
 multiplication by ten 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:17.880
 by 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 that is 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:21.389
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 displacements or 7 times 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.860
 x 10 so if we think about getting there 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:29.210
 these 3 hundredths to 300,000 we would think 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.210
 in multiply 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.700
 3 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.700
 hundredths 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:46.389
 by 17 times by 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 by 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.389
 10 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.139
 and for 10 remember that each of these 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.539
 are the change or displacement that 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.389
 we had to multiply by 10 from 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:02.160
 this position until this is so 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:05.280
 we have 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 if we 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.970
 multiply by 10 several times what 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:17.820
 we will have is a multiplication by 1 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:19.580
 with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 zeros 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 yes 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.889
 let's multiply by 10 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.689
 we would add zeros however in this 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:30.209
 moment we will only do it for 7 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:30.209
 and multiply then 3 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.630
 hundredths 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.630
 for 10 million 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.540
 if we do this multiplication 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:48.060
 we would really have 3 by 10 million 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.760
 these 10 million are really units 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.710
 they are about 1 so if we do the 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.940
 division 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:59.700
 we would have to eliminate two zeros and 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:03.140
 eliminate this 100 so it is that we 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.140
 we will be with 3 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:11.590
 and one two three four five zeros one 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.770
 two three four five zeros we have 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.300
 then 300,000 that yes indeed 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.300
 they are the same 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.400
 300,000 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.199
 that we have on this side we what 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.500
 we did was multiply these 3 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:34.280
 hundredths by 10 million to get 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.639
 to the positional value of the 300,000 if 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.599
 we write differently 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.599
 this 3 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.060
 10 million 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.400
 the value of this 3 only by the 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.270
 difference of place value in the 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.270
 that are found
