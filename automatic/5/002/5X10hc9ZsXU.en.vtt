00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.079
 hello to all the guys who came to this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 new video tutorial the g cramis channel 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.770
 in which I will explain very briefly 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.600
 how to install the new launcher 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:39.960
 minecraft cracked since the last one 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 sp version was beaten up 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.850
 so then you must first of all 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 go to linking description then 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.970
 comments 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.360
 then this and you download the launcher 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.239
 real that does not weigh either 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.990
 a lot of downloaded this will appear to you 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.070
 This also very trendy icon the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.549
 open and we could say the console 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.869
 command there is in everything will ask you 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.790
 directory for what you need to put 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:26.840
 I could put it in order to show you one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:31.440
 directory is the same where you put it now 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.610
 here he tells me I have to install it will be 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.380
 installed so we install the folder 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.390
 that won't even make us much like 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.740
 see this success not him 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.380
 updates and here is the console like 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.450
 now it's downloading everything is downloading 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.270
 so minecraft will take very little 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.820
 as you can see it's taking a minute 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:03.830
 minute 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.830
 you 're almost there 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.409
 and this version also works one 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.209
 version 1.6.4 memory also works on 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.480
 line so you can server with i 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:20.099
 your friends both sp and premium 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.680
 then we can add profiles 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.769
 then a profile you can put the name 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.530
 the game director and that is where he will take 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.550
 let's say minecraft and we can say that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:36.110
 version let him use now I used 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:40.990
 the latest latest will therefore be updated 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.990
 whenever this when i saw it 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.110
 you can also use snapshots 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.550
 therefore we can save ours 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.890
 profile 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.770
 as you can see the last one 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:58.040
 slapshot on 13 wooden 9 b 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:01.490
 now however I want 1164 here it is the last 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.460
 exit is therefore we put a username that 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:10.190
 indifferent which and we can block 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.800
 with networks is now installing the version 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.610
 a 64 because if you change every version 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.590
 once you change it will change version 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.650
 just finished the download that i will 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.870
 just once because the next times 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.380
 will start immediately you play off line and 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.930
 part you are there 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.880
 all clear it seems to me as you see a 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.800
 moments opens here is just you 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.050
 open this connectix small tx3 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.290
 evil and has just opened precisely 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.140
 single player minecraft 1.6.4 and how 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.300
 see this there is just the screen 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.050
 like the premium also with which game does not 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:56.420
 present in the sp and we immediately do a 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.980
 world to show you creative now 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.720
 we have a world as you see here 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:07.550
 console generated see here is the spoon 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.080
 and the fuck plan is generating the world 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.510
 right now and you can see it 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.970
 from the console here says it serves but it is 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:22.400
 starting a world that looks like pine 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:26.240
 see how I can see force 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:32.510
 here are the things of the 1 64 horses 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.350
 and there will also be b or even ip or mine 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.320
 various crap 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:42.110
 so I would say that for this video it is 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.600
 all leave a like and sign up if 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.699
 this mini was useful here 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.699
