 recipe were born the egg flour video 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.039
 ground bread oregano salt with garlic cheese 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.630

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.050
 manchego 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.300
 lettuce cat the first thing we have to 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.250
 to do is put the parmesan cheese on 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.530
 duster with garlic and oregano in our 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 bread we 're going to stir very well 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.480
 and now we take a piece of cheese 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.190
 manchego this has to be in 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.670
 rectangles we're going to go through the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.380
 game later for the flour we have it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.280
 that cover very very well so that it does not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280
 let the cheese come out 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.460
 now we have it again for the egg 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.360
 and finally for the ground bread 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.790
 we really have to make sure that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.930
 well covered so you do not go to 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.660
 leave the case when we are heating up 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.260
 and you're going to do the same thing is egg 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.260
 flour 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.119
 new again 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.050
 and bread crumbs and does the same with all 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.819
 so that you stay like this now we are going to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.890
 learn the structure you have to 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.390
 wait for it to be very hot you're going to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.670
 see that you 're ready when you do 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.480
 bubbles with the amount you are going to put 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.910
 go spinning our credit of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.410
 cheese until I crush it is a 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.640
 little bit and you feel soft and everything 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.190
 that means that the cheese is already 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.170
 melted and you're ready to do what 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.330
 same with everyone you have to give him four 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.630
 turns to warm everyone 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.390
 the sides 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.690
 we have to fry it very well without it 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.690

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.800

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.630

 we can take to school 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.440

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.290
