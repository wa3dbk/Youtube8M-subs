00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
40 uses so that is a regular idea I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.830

got a low in actually that must account

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.380 
got a low in actually that must account
for<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.049> very<00:02:22.260> refreshing<00:02:23.190> sensation<00:02:23.640> would

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
for the very refreshing sensation would

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.690 
for the very refreshing sensation would
highly<00:02:24.720> recommend<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.650> an<00:02:25.920> exfoliating

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
highly recommend this as an exfoliating

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.900 
highly recommend this as an exfoliating
treatment<00:02:27.019> for<00:02:28.019> someone<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.590> dry<00:02:28.980> skin<00:02:29.519> or

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
treatment for someone with dry skin or

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.110 
treatment for someone with dry skin or
more<00:02:30.150> mature<00:02:30.510> skin<00:02:30.840> or<00:02:31.290> skin<00:02:32.190> which<00:02:32.610> she<00:02:32.849> just

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
more mature skin or skin which she just

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.110 
more mature skin or skin which she just
can't<00:02:33.690> afford<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.849> inflamed<00:02:35.849> and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
can't afford to have inflamed and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.750 
can't afford to have inflamed and
aggravated<00:02:36.780> from<00:02:37.290> very<00:02:38.190> aggressive

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
aggravated from very aggressive

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.449 
aggravated from very aggressive
treatments<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.049> real<00:02:40.260> glycolic<00:02:41.069> peels

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
treatments like the real glycolic peels

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.110 
treatments like the real glycolic peels
so<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.720> really<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.319> this<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.459> think<00:02:44.519> in

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so I really like this and I think in

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.509 
so I really like this and I think in
terms<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:47.100> cost<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:49.220> alleviate<00:02:50.220> that

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
terms of the cost you can alleviate that

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.090 
terms of the cost you can alleviate that
to<00:02:50.910> some<00:02:51.090> extent<00:02:51.120> by<00:02:51.720> cutting<00:02:52.230> them<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.709> if

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
to some extent by cutting them and if

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.550 
to some extent by cutting them and if
you<00:02:53.220> think<00:02:53.489> about<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.480> cost<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.019> one

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
you think about it as the cost of one

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.229 
you think about it as the cost of one
facial<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.390> really<00:02:57.660> isn't<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.019> bad<00:02:58.350> so

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
facial then it really isn't that bad so

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.940 
facial then it really isn't that bad so
for<00:03:00.239> me<00:03:00.420> I've<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:01.170> I'm<00:03:01.829> on<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.310> cusp<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.970> youth

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
for me I've got I'm on the cusp of youth

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.280 
for me I've got I'm on the cusp of youth
so<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.730> use<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.540> more<00:03:06.750> aggressive

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
so I can use the more aggressive

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.410 
so I can use the more aggressive
treatments<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.459> use<00:03:08.609> this<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.209> I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
treatments and I can use this but I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.509 
treatments and I can use this but I
suspect<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.410> when<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.310> reach<00:03:11.639> beyond<00:03:13.519> 4050

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
suspect that when you reach beyond 4050

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.440 
suspect that when you reach beyond 4050
you<00:03:15.329> really<00:03:15.720> don't<00:03:15.959> want<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.410> aggravate<00:03:16.829> your

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
you really don't want to aggravate your

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.750 
you really don't want to aggravate your
aging<00:03:18.450> skin<00:03:18.870> using<00:03:19.380> moisturize<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.310> yet<00:03:20.609> it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
aging skin using moisturize but yet it

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.539 
aging skin using moisturize but yet it
still<00:03:21.090> has<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.690> effect<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.130> skin

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
still has that effect that the skin

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.180 
still has that effect that the skin
cells

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
cells

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.210 
cells
is<00:03:25.340> increased<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:27.110> have<00:03:27.320> noticed<00:03:27.830> that<00:03:27.980> my

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
is increased and I have noticed that my

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.670 
is increased and I have noticed that my
skin's<00:03:28.640> being<00:03:29.000> fairly<00:03:29.870> good<00:03:30.080> I've<00:03:30.290> been<00:03:30.320> very

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
skin's being fairly good I've been very

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680 
skin's being fairly good I've been very
surprised<00:03:31.190> by<00:03:31.400> how<00:03:31.610> often<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:32.060> can<00:03:32.240> use<00:03:32.450> this

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
surprised by how often I can use this

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.320 
surprised by how often I can use this
because<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.890> other<00:03:34.040> treatments<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.820> mentioned

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
because the other treatments I mentioned

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.180 
because the other treatments I mentioned
you<00:03:35.420> can<00:03:35.570> only<00:03:35.780> use<00:03:36.020> once<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.500> week<00:03:36.680> maybe<00:03:37.040> twice

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
you can only use once a week maybe twice

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.390 
you can only use once a week maybe twice
a<00:03:37.490> week<00:03:37.850> your<00:03:38.270> skin<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.630> quite<00:03:38.750> Hardy<00:03:39.320> but<00:03:40.040> this

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
a week your skin is quite Hardy but this

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.130 
a week your skin is quite Hardy but this
one<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:41.090> could<00:03:41.240> use<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.570> every<00:03:41.840> day<00:03:41.990> if<00:03:42.110> you

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
one you could use it every day if you

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.500 
one you could use it every day if you
wanted<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.890> I've<00:03:42.980> been<00:03:43.190> using<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.640> in<00:03:43.910> fact

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
wanted and I've been using it in fact

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.900 
wanted and I've been using it in fact
every<00:03:44.870> other<00:03:44.990> day<00:03:45.290> I've<00:03:45.830> heard<00:03:46.070> reviews<00:03:46.760> or

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
every other day I've heard reviews or

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.870 
every other day I've heard reviews or
makeup<00:03:47.240> a<00:03:47.420> day<00:03:47.480> use<00:03:47.720> some<00:03:47.990> ladies<00:03:48.980> who<00:03:49.460> have

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
makeup a day use some ladies who have

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.430 
makeup a day use some ladies who have
got<00:03:50.060> aging<00:03:50.480> around<00:03:50.570> their<00:03:50.840> neck<00:03:51.080> or<00:03:51.260> their

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
got aging around their neck or their

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.320 
got aging around their neck or their
hands<00:03:51.710> the<00:03:52.370> fact<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:52.730> there's<00:03:52.970> so<00:03:53.180> much

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
hands the fact that there's so much

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.510 
hands the fact that there's so much
moisture<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.140> every<00:03:54.440> pad<00:03:54.710> you<00:03:55.310> can<00:03:55.460> use

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
moisture and every pad you can use

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.810 
moisture and every pad you can use
access<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.270> your<00:03:56.360> hands<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.990> your<00:03:57.230> neck<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.890> it

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
access to your hands of your neck and it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.260 
access to your hands of your neck and it
really<00:03:59.060> will<00:03:59.300> help<00:03:59.990> a<00:04:00.170> lot<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.460> container

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
really will help a lot so the container

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.660 
really will help a lot so the container
is<00:04:02.570> very<00:04:02.840> airtight<00:04:03.470> which<00:04:03.710> is<00:04:03.890> very<00:04:04.130> important

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
is very airtight which is very important

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.180 
is very airtight which is very important
then<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:05.450> comes<00:04:05.690> with<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.990> foil<00:04:06.410> seal<00:04:06.830> which

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
then it comes with a foil seal which

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.450 
then it comes with a foil seal which
I've<00:04:07.400> kept<00:04:07.760> on<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.650> inside<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.980> don't<00:04:10.220> know<00:04:10.340> if

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
I've kept on and inside I don't know if

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.300 
I've kept on and inside I don't know if
you<00:04:10.580> can<00:04:10.760> actually<00:04:11.090> see<00:04:11.830> probably<00:04:12.830> not<00:04:13.040> but

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
you can actually see probably not but

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.970 
you can actually see probably not but
both<00:04:13.730> sides<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.270> textures<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.170> it's<00:04:15.470> dab<00:04:15.740> it

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
both sides of textures so it's dab it

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.270 
both sides of textures so it's dab it
all<00:04:16.160> around<00:04:16.489> my<00:04:16.730> face<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:18.440> my<00:04:18.650> neck<00:04:18.890> you

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
all around my face down my neck you

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.009 
all around my face down my neck you
don't<00:04:19.580> wash<00:04:19.850> these<00:04:20.090> off<00:04:20.239> by<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.540> way<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.750> just

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
don't wash these off by the way you just

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.900 
don't wash these off by the way you just
work<00:04:21.200> for<00:04:21.440> them<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.739> goes<00:04:21.950> very<00:04:22.250> quick<00:04:22.760> and
