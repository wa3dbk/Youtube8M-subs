hi<00:00:04.259> guys<00:00:04.470> got<00:00:04.830> one<00:00:04.950> two<00:00:05.100> three<00:00:05.279> four<00:00:05.430> five<00:00:05.580> six

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
hi guys got one two three four five six

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.589 
hi guys got one two three four five six
seven<00:00:05.910> eight<00:00:06.150> nine<00:00:06.210> zero<00:00:06.359> here<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.460> I<00:00:08.599> just

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
seven eight nine zero here and I just

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.299 
seven eight nine zero here and I just
wanted<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.900> give<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> quick<00:00:10.170> update<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
wanted to give a quick update on the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.270 
wanted to give a quick update on the
quadratic<00:00:11.969> grapher<00:00:12.300> than<00:00:12.450> I'm<00:00:12.570> doing<00:00:13.160> now<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
quadratic grapher than I'm doing now of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.890 
quadratic grapher than I'm doing now of
course<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.700> isn't<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.150> small<00:00:15.509> as<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.750> could

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
course this isn't as small as it could

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.370 
course this isn't as small as it could
be<00:00:15.929> or<00:00:16.320> as<00:00:16.650> fast<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.600> he'll<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.810> does<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.170> job

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
be or as fast but he'll it does the job

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.689 
be or as fast but he'll it does the job
um<00:00:21.230> basically<00:00:22.230> got<00:00:22.650> your<00:00:22.769> x<00:00:22.980> squared<00:00:23.430> term

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
um basically got your x squared term

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.849 
um basically got your x squared term
right<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.750> got<00:00:24.900> your<00:00:25.019> X<00:00:25.289> term<00:00:25.560> over<00:00:25.830> here

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
right here you got your X term over here

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.050 
right here you got your X term over here
and<00:00:27.740> got<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:28.890> constant<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.789> going

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and got your constant just going

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.550 
and got your constant just going
straight<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.929> place<00:00:31.140> where<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> add

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
straight into the place where you add

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.330 
straight into the place where you add
them<00:00:31.679> all<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:32.030> right<00:00:33.030> over<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:34.160> these<00:00:35.160> will

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
them all up right over here these will

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.139 
them all up right over here these will
do<00:00:35.670> both<00:00:35.969> addition<00:00:36.570> subtraction<00:00:36.750> eventually

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
do both addition subtraction eventually

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.180 
do both addition subtraction eventually
just<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.390> inverters<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> didn't<00:00:41.010> really

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
just my inverters kind of didn't really

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.299 
just my inverters kind of didn't really
work<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:43.910> this<00:00:44.910> version<00:00:45.120> minecraft<00:00:45.809> because

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
work in this version minecraft because

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.110 
work in this version minecraft because
of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.670> bud<00:00:47.910> glitch<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.870> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:50.120> caused

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
of the bud glitch which kind of caused

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
of the bud glitch which kind of caused
some<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.870> Pistons<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.829> using<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
some of the Pistons I was using to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.720 
some of the Pistons I was using to
invert<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.600> stay<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.280> should<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.640> off<00:00:58.730> but

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
invert to stay on this should be off but

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.000 
invert to stay on this should be off but
other<00:00:59.940> than<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:03.500> yeah<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.739> fully

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
other than that yeah it's fully

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
other than that yeah it's fully
functional<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.030> except<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
functional as it is except for the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.469 
functional as it is except for the
graphing<00:01:07.110> function<00:01:07.590> which<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.000> only<00:01:09.090> reason

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
graphing function which the only reason

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.910 
graphing function which the only reason
I'm<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.659> doing<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> moment<00:01:10.560> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I'm not doing that at the moment is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
I'm not doing that at the moment is
because<00:01:11.600> doing<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.720> decoder<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.900> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
because doing a decoder for that that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.550 
because doing a decoder for that that
right<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:18.210> huge<00:01:18.810> pain<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> ass

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
right there is a huge pain in the ass

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.999 
right there is a huge pain in the ass
and<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:20.009> feel<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.520> doing<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.119> now

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and I feel like doing that right now

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.859 
and I feel like doing that right now
anyway<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.840> will<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.259> fractions<00:01:25.939> or<00:01:26.939> at

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
anyway so it will do fractions or at

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.609 
anyway so it will do fractions or at
least<00:01:28.140> decimals<00:01:28.740> kind<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.970> will<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.299> one

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
least decimals kind of it will do one

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.770 
least decimals kind of it will do one
1628<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:32.450> fourth<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.930> half<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.820> then

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
1628 one fourth and one half and then

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
1628 one fourth and one half and then
I'll<00:01:36.960> start<00:01:37.140> doing<00:01:37.290> whole<00:01:37.560> numbers<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
I'll start doing whole numbers and the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.660 
I'll start doing whole numbers and the
only<00:01:38.729> way<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.450> those<00:01:40.340> fractions<00:01:41.340> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
only way you get those fractions is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.179 
only way you get those fractions is
through<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.750> shift<00:01:43.079> register<00:01:43.200> over<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
through the shift register over here and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.740 
through the shift register over here and
another<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:46.280> act<00:01:47.280> as

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
another one over there which act as

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.360 
another one over there which act as
fractional<00:01:48.750> constants<00:01:49.560> um

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.970 

basically<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.890> divide<00:01:56.670> bunner<00:01:57.570> number<00:01:58.020> by

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
basically and to divide bunner number by

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.940 
basically and to divide bunner number by
2<00:01:59.460> i'm<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.450> doing<00:02:00.720> any<00:02:00.870> other<00:02:01.350> dividing

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
2 i'm not doing any other dividing

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.670 
2 i'm not doing any other dividing
basically<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:03.300> dividing<00:02:03.900> by<00:02:04.170> anything

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
basically because dividing by anything

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.210 
basically because dividing by anything
other<00:02:04.770> than<00:02:05.070> 24<00:02:06.060> 8<00:02:06.450> or<00:02:06.780> any<00:02:07.160> 2<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.369> N<00:02:10.220> sort

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
other than 24 8 or any 2 to the N sort

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.700 
other than 24 8 or any 2 to the N sort
of<00:02:11.310> number<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:12.570> require<00:02:12.930> an<00:02:13.200> actual

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
of number would require an actual

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.370 
of number would require an actual
divider<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.250> those<00:02:14.520> are<00:02:14.730> rather<00:02:14.910> large<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.400 

difficult<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:21.390> um<00:02:23.300> yeah<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.480> also<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.260> other

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
difficult but um yeah and also the other

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.220 
difficult but um yeah and also the other
reason<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.800> because<00:02:26.010> graphing<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.870> graph

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
reason is because graphing it on a graph

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
reason is because graphing it on a graph
which<00:02:28.620> only<00:02:28.800> does<00:02:29.070> natural<00:02:29.580> numbers<00:02:29.970> would

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
which only does natural numbers would

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.580 
which only does natural numbers would
nope<00:02:32.450> which<00:02:33.450> only<00:02:33.630> those<00:02:33.840> natural<00:02:34.020> numbers

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
nope which only those natural numbers

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.870 
nope which only those natural numbers
would<00:02:34.800> be<00:02:35.510> difficult<00:02:36.510> because<00:02:37.400> usually<00:02:38.400> when

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
would be difficult because usually when

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.260 
would be difficult because usually when
you<00:02:39.000> divide<00:02:39.300> number<00:02:39.810> by<00:02:39.990> three<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:41.270> five

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
you divide number by three or five

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.370 
you divide number by three or five
unless<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.400> 35<00:02:44.400> or<00:02:44.730> something<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
unless it is 35 or something like that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.410 
unless it is 35 or something like that
some<00:02:46.380> multiple<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.040> it'll<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:48.000> come

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
some multiple of that it'll just come

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.450 
some multiple of that it'll just come
out<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.840> some<00:02:49.110> ugly<00:02:49.470> fraction<00:02:50.070> which<00:02:50.220> you

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
out as some ugly fraction which you

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.510 
out as some ugly fraction which you
really<00:02:51.650> can't<00:02:52.650> graph<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.280> game<00:02:53.490> like

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
really can't graph in a game like

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.090 
really can't graph in a game like
minecraft<00:02:54.300> too<00:02:54.900> easily<00:02:55.110> I'm<00:02:55.500> sure<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.860> can

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
minecraft too easily I'm sure you can

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.540 
minecraft too easily I'm sure you can
and<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:58.290> would<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.500> require<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:59.100> lot<00:02:59.520> of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
and it would just require a lot of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.360 
and it would just require a lot of
pixels<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.450> lot<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.020> lot<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.320> lot<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.680> pixels<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.280> I

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
pixels a lot a lot a lot of pixels and I

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.090 
pixels a lot a lot a lot of pixels and I
don't<00:03:02.610> want<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.940> lot<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.450> pixels<00:03:03.870> because

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
don't want a lot a lot of pixels because

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.890 
don't want a lot a lot of pixels because
really<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.310> maximum<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.940> could<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:08.900> not

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
really the maximum you could have is not

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.150 
really the maximum you could have is not
see<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:11.310> would<00:03:11.550> be<00:03:14.630> 64<00:03:15.630> really<00:03:16.200> could<00:03:16.410> have<00:03:16.440> 64

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
see it would be 64 really could have 64

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.020 
see it would be 64 really could have 64
vertical<00:03:17.640> pixels<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:21.170> given<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:23.489> range

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
vertical pixels and given that the range

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.790 
vertical pixels and given that the range
of<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.900> enormous<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.770> already<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
of this is enormous and already and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.640 
of this is enormous and already and
making<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.860> up<00:03:29.610> fractions<00:03:30.239> or<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:30.720> besides

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
making it up fractions or just besides

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
making it up fractions or just besides
those<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:33.030> those<00:03:33.180> aren't<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.480> need<00:03:33.600> graft

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
those but those aren't you need graft

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.430 
those but those aren't you need graft
anyway<00:03:34.290> those<00:03:34.980> are<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.280> basically<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:36.090> of

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
anyway those are just basically kind of

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.860 
anyway those are just basically kind of
pointless<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:38.310> having<00:03:38.880> those<00:03:39.090> when<00:03:39.540> your

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
pointless but having those when your

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.050 
pointless but having those when your
outputs<00:03:40.380> can<00:03:40.560> go<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:42.450> number<00:03:42.989> plus<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
outputs can go up to this number plus a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.190 
outputs can go up to this number plus a
bunch<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.180> those<00:03:45.360> I'm<00:03:45.630> not<00:03:45.750> really<00:03:45.870> sure<00:03:46.020> at

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
bunch of those I'm not really sure at

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.610 
bunch of those I'm not really sure at
the<00:03:46.290> maximum<00:03:46.709> output<00:03:46.950> if<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.780> but<00:03:51.620> having

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
the maximum output if this is but having

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.610 
the maximum output if this is but having
that<00:03:52.650> would<00:03:52.860> just<00:03:53.040> be

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.589 

enormous<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.830> decoder<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.819> also<00:03:58.150> be<00:03:58.269> enormous

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
enormous and decoder it also be enormous

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.929 
enormous and decoder it also be enormous
basically<00:03:59.500> doing<00:04:00.069> anything<00:04:00.310> other<00:04:00.640> than<00:04:00.730> this

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
basically doing anything other than this

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.149 
basically doing anything other than this
we<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:01.329> very<00:04:02.260> very<00:04:02.439> large<00:04:03.329> although<00:04:05.159> there

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
we get very very large although there

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.860 
we get very very large although there
are<00:04:06.310> dividers<00:04:06.670> which<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.150> can<00:04:07.269> do<00:04:07.450> or

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
are dividers which you can do or

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.589 
are dividers which you can do or
multipliers<00:04:08.379> which<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.680> can<00:04:08.829> do<00:04:08.980> which<00:04:12.599> which

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
multipliers which you can do which which

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.319 
multipliers which you can do which which
basically<00:04:14.560> do<00:04:14.799> exactly<00:04:15.129> what<00:04:15.310> this<00:04:15.549> does<00:04:15.819> only

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
basically do exactly what this does only

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.229 
basically do exactly what this does only
it<00:04:16.720> uses<00:04:17.109> shift<00:04:17.410> register<00:04:17.949> to<00:04:18.489> shift<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.120> over

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
it uses shift register to shift it over

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.479 
it uses shift register to shift it over
instead<00:04:19.539> of<00:04:19.900> what<00:04:20.260> i'm<00:04:20.410> using<00:04:20.650> where<00:04:21.220> i<00:04:21.250> have<00:04:21.459> a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
instead of what i'm using where i have a

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.909 
instead of what i'm using where i have a
system<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.300> gates<00:04:22.600> which<00:04:24.240> cancel<00:04:25.919> the

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
system of and gates which cancel the

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.000 
system of and gates which cancel the
terms<00:04:27.190> I'm<00:04:27.430> inputting<00:04:28.320> which<00:04:29.320> each<00:04:29.650> time<00:04:29.889> you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
terms I'm inputting which each time you

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.980 
terms I'm inputting which each time you
can<00:04:30.160> kind<00:04:30.370> of<00:04:30.400> see<00:04:32.729> this<00:04:33.729> is<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:33.940> term<00:04:34.750> I'm

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
can kind of see this is the term I'm

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.070 
can kind of see this is the term I'm
inputting<00:04:35.169> it's<00:04:36.039> shifting<00:04:36.520> over<00:04:36.639> one<00:04:37.539> full

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
inputting it's shifting over one full

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.450 
inputting it's shifting over one full
letter<00:04:38.320> every<00:04:38.620> time<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.910> can<00:04:40.030> kind<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.300> see<00:04:40.360> so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
letter every time you can kind of see so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.219 
letter every time you can kind of see so
it<00:04:42.460> basically<00:04:42.639> does<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.240> with<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> shift

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
it basically does it with a shift

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.960 
it basically does it with a shift
register<00:04:44.320> instead<00:04:44.949> of<00:04:45.070> physically<00:04:45.430> moving<00:04:45.789> it

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
register instead of physically moving it

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.790 
register instead of physically moving it
but<00:04:48.970> that<00:04:49.270> requires<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:50.430> bit<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:52.380> actually<00:04:53.380> it

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
but that requires a bit of actually it

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.469 
but that requires a bit of actually it
takes<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.460> lot<00:04:54.639> of<00:04:54.669> thinking<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.240> I'm<00:04:55.449> not

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
takes a lot of thinking and I'm not

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:03.000 
takes a lot of thinking and I'm not
willing<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.020> do<00:04:56.289> that<00:04:56.530> um<00:04:59.520> yeah<00:05:00.520> okay<00:05:02.010> what

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
willing to do that um yeah okay what

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:10.080 
willing to do that um yeah okay what
else<00:05:04.680> it's<00:05:05.680> about<00:05:05.800> it<00:05:06.870> anyway<00:05:07.870> um<00:05:08.470> I<00:05:09.160> should<00:05:09.940> be

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
else it's about it anyway um I should be

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.570 
else it's about it anyway um I should be
