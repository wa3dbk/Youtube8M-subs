00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.010
 hello youtube friends who greets you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.380
 rodolfo mÃ©ndez mixing with virtual 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.600
 gel in this person has brought them a 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.970
 tutorial about a comment that 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.580
 they left me here on youtube and that said 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.650
 how the software effect is put 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.260
 for example accelerate the speed good 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 sometimes it is sometimes difficult to explain 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.600
 well with a text so I decided to do 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.940
 this tutorial and I hope it helps them 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 all those who also have that doubt and 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.750
 before continuing to remember that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.409
 the download of the new one is available 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.539
 sampler bachata or cantina mix also the 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.800
 link I will be leaving you leaving here 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.379
 down in the description of the video or 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.440
 also here for you to go to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.629
 video where you can download it good 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 following with the tutorial and well but to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.010
 put that effect we go to our 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.739
 virtual 10 well after we have it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.499
 open we are going to sampler 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 here we have three buttons in this first 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.899
 button that we have up here is 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.359
 so that the sampler keeps sounding without 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.760
 stop if we remove this option will see 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.280
 that the two options disappear abajito 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.280
 and the sampler is reasoning only once 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 as they saw are only once and when 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 this button is activated then 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.770
 the sample what it does is repeat itself 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.770
 several times 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.630
 good to be able to put an effect on it 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.520
 it's raising the good of the good song 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.070
 but it would distort the song and the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.890
 sampler also depending on what bpm 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.079
 we are playing the song and the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
 again simply with these two 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.920
 buttons that we see but here I am going to 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.920
 give an example of how it is done 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.700
 how they saw with this is with these 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.250
 buttons the sampler speeds up 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.039
 it gets faster and a guy who gives them 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.920
 I can give this how to use this effect 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.250
 On their tables they can charge twice 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.110
 times the same sampler for example I'm going to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.299
 do an example here and I will load the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.680
 two sampler here the same so 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.810
 I'll be looking to change it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.020
 we just go here we're going to 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 change 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.150
 and we look for the sampler that we want 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.830
 we look for the samper where we have 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:33.280
 saved good let's suppose that 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.280
 is these 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.900
 do that effect and with the keys of the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.840
 keyboard that each of those broad 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.630
 represent from f 1 to f 12 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.390
 of the keyboard that is on the top so 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.300
 that we're just going to see what number is 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:58.210
 what this gives us is the f 7 and this 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.780
 would be 16 then a tip so that 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.850
 you can make the effect of so that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.470
 go faster what you can do is 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.980
 here activate and have your after 6 and 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.980
 The 17 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:26.150
 and so you can do this effect since 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.730
 with the virtual dj can not be done 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.459
 easily that effect and return it to its 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.799
 normality because you would have to turn off 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.760
 this button that is on the left side 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.760
 to return to normal 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.000
 then as we do not have that facility 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:48.420
 of the virtual and then what I do is 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.829
 load it twice the same we will know 22 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.829
 squares and half 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.780
 so good that 's it for this tutorial 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.150
 I hope we can help you remember that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.350
 can leave your comment any 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.990
 tutorial suggestion 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.160
 but you can do and see you in the 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.160
 next tutorial
