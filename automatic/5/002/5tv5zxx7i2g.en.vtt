00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
account and they have not shown up yet

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
account and they have not shown up yet
the<00:01:46.200> transaction<00:01:46.950> did<00:01:47.159> come<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.640> bank

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the transaction did come out of my bank

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.060 
the transaction did come out of my bank
account<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.560> given<00:01:49.799> me<00:01:49.920> the

account but they have not given me the
point<00:01:50.310> yet<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.670> hopefully<00:01:50.939> they'll<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.689> that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
point yet so hopefully they'll do that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
point yet so hopefully they'll do that
soon<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.290> maybe<00:01:52.380> later<00:01:52.680> tonight<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.250> give

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
soon and maybe later tonight they give
me<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> point<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.720> well<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
me the point I could do that as well so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
me the point I could do that as well so
why<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.040> ahead<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> jump<00:01:56.549> into<00:01:56.700> our

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
why don't we go ahead and jump into our

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.480 
why don't we go ahead and jump into our
first<00:01:57.540> pro<00:01:58.079> pack<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> hopefully<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.340> can

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
first pro pack and hopefully we can
