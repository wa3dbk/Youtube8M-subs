00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 hello to you all I'm not 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.929
 identical today we find ourselves 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.940
 to them or fuck we are 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 for an announcement that I make you all 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 the years since every year I fear 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.100
 this minecraft server in general these are 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.810
 roughly the statistics that we 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.420
 was given the floor to all 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.560
 French so except this year well 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.519
 sure it's even better than the year 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.430
 last as for the years 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.740
 previous ones since this year already 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.540
 it's going to be good so 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.739
 remember last year I had 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.579
 created a server argue they can 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.410
 and paybox on a server mg serve as 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.660
 slats unlimited 10 euros per month which 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.620
 was completely broken this year I 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.270
 will be able to invest in a real 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.910
 machine and I have a whole team that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.230
 with me so we are two founders there 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.210
 there altkirch 2 ci which was the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.289
 creator of the sunrise faction servers 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.460
 on which I was hungry the plains 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.510
 action you can see them if you 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 look again at a faction and its 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.680
 ally already now finally trend is 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.030
 more than I am here still holds 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 subscribers to his channel sees the band of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.839
 bastards so 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 so do not hesitate to watch them 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.520
 so he came to see me I had a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.530
 project which is the project so the concept 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.600
 increase in himself he came to see me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 he offered me to make him become again 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.130
 real in a more thorough way so I have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 spoke again we spoke again I put everything in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.119
 clear I gave everything to the project all 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 rewritten and so it's a project that 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.729
 is structured we have the plugin that are 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.130
 being developed we have 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.539
 already a twitter that I link you 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.090
 currently on the screen and that will be in 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.319
 the description and we also have a site 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.549
 who is not ready yet when I 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.409
 speak to you but that it normally tomorrow 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.470
 should be should be the version 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.539
 final site that will be used and that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.640
 so bah you'll see on is so 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.960
 prepared paypal in the description so 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.740
 what am I going to tell you about you 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.630
 explain a little bit about how it works 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.590
 of the server because it's not it's not 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.520
 extremely simple ie 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.470
 it's a server that will be based on 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.300
 as an argument to you that the 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.340
 three quarters of you do not have 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.740
 known with mantilla that's all 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.700
 just in fact a pvp boxing there we go 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.009
 add a training system 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.320
 expected p 1 v1 it comes out that it's more 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.820
 vast than a simple that vp box 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.610
 even if it's far from being a simple 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.840
 queue and paybox trust me so how 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.450
 it's going to happen so when you do 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.400
 one he's going to see you drop a 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.470
 number of xp a number of 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.760
 dollars iger that will allow you 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.310
 so it's dollars to buy you a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.870
 unpublished stuff that you go next 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.280
 power enchanted with the levels you 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.959
 will have acquired and so it is for example 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 if you have in the arena I you 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.930
 gave numbers no matter how 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.000
 imagine that you do you do 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.010
 quiet you win you win $ 300 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.170
 you buy a diamond plastron wanting 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.610
 sang with your tranquil from the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.170
 when you will not get me in the arena 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.989
 Either you keep your experience 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.250
 and that way you can sing it 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.450
 stuff if you have time to do 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.160
 the spawn command before dying 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.840
 since if you die in the pv paybox 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.970
 of course you do not go you do not have 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.100
 not kept high level the only thing that 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.239
 remains in sauce and money and I 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.709
 besides that spartacus that is not 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.790
 really aware of the end concept that 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.810
 know a little increased to mike not 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.970
 aware of the new concept 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 if I understand a little bit what I say is 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.060
 true yeah I know your mouth what I 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.079
 understand what I say if you are allowed 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.799
 who did not understand that they knew 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.850
 not because it's hard to be 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.070
 advise because it's not so simple 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.790
 that it goes coach yann subscribers end 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.380
 it's complicated to understand at Alania 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.640
 the server is called radcliffe box 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.049
 anyway you will come ige 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.519
 eat munich and you 're fine 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.070
 see what that gives so the server 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.450
 is called cliff boxing why cliff 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.549
 because montanier on the map will have 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.510
 mountains finally my client be 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.890
 it's the cliff but do not make me 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.540
 shit with english cliff it sounds good 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.280
 better than mankind so 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.340
 we are in partnership with a 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.200
 server pvp factions that is the server 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.489
 who was that so the know who has 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.140
 was created by the ancient sunrise which 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.010
 what server zenta faction this 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.969

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.349
