00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.980 
was very humid last night and warm 91
degrees<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> teams<00:02:07.880> at<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.360> basically

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
degrees so the teams at that basically

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.990 
degrees so the teams at that basically
run<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.530> engine<00:02:09.890> harder<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.459> try<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.729> make

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
run the engine harder to try to make

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.370 
run the engine harder to try to make
that<00:02:11.180> horsepower<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.810> make<00:02:11.959> up<00:02:12.140> for<00:02:12.350> that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
that horsepower to make up for that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.170 
that horsepower to make up for that
moisture<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.520> heat<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:13.850> what<00:02:14.000> they<00:02:14.120> do

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
moisture and the heat so what they do

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.970 
moisture and the heat so what they do
today<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.990> lower<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.320> compression<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
today is to lower the compression a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.380 
today is to lower the compression a
little<00:02:16.220> bit<00:02:16.310> maybe<00:02:16.700> take<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> little<00:02:17.180> bit<00:02:17.300> of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
little bit maybe take a little bit of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.449 
little bit maybe take a little bit of
supercharger<00:02:17.930> time<00:02:18.230> yeah<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.950> car<00:02:19.190> clacks

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
supercharger time yeah the car clacks

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.590 
supercharger time yeah the car clacks
you<00:02:19.550> make<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> little<00:02:20.000> bit<00:02:20.180> more<00:02:20.360> horsepower

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
you make a little bit more horsepower

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.800 
you make a little bit more horsepower
ease<00:02:21.320> more<00:02:21.620> easily<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.550> then<00:02:23.150> as<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.330> result

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
ease more easily and then as a result

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.330 
ease more easily and then as a result
you<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.050> see<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.350> time<00:02:24.560> step<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.220> that's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
you can see the time step up and that's

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.070 
you can see the time step up and that's
