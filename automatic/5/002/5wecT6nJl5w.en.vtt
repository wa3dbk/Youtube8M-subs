since demigod and allows us to go in
here<00:00:17.850> command<00:00:18.420> units<00:00:18.810> right<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.289> we've<00:00:19.529> got

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
here command units right now we've got

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
here command units right now we've got
some<00:00:19.859> tanks<00:00:20.279> some<00:00:20.609> UEF<00:00:20.939> tanks<00:00:21.330> fighting<00:00:21.720> these

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
some tanks some UEF tanks fighting these

some tanks some UEF tanks fighting these
cybron<00:00:22.680> bots<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.580> top<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.000> platform<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
cybron bots on top of this platform and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.650 
cybron bots on top of this platform and
getting<00:00:25.380> overwhelmed<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.130> destroyed<00:00:27.000> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
getting overwhelmed and destroyed so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.990 
getting overwhelmed and destroyed so
this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> concern<00:00:28.680> why<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this is a bit of a concern why the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is a bit of a concern why the
gunships<00:00:30.480> came<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.140> cyber<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
gunships came in these cyber and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.319 
gunships came in these cyber and
gunships<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.610> able<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> wipe<00:00:32.969> us<00:00:33.210> out

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
gunships and we're able to wipe us out

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030 
gunships and we're able to wipe us out
so<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.570> need<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> bring<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.320> support<00:00:34.739> what

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so we need to bring in some support what

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280 
so we need to bring in some support what
better<00:00:35.399> way<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> bring<00:00:35.940> support<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:37.110> with

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
better way to bring support in then with

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.770 
better way to bring support in then with
the<00:00:37.440> unit<00:00:37.829> cannon<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.790> unit<00:00:39.059> cannon<00:00:39.510> allows

the unit cannon the unit cannon allows
us<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> fire<00:00:40.350> units<00:00:40.829> clear<00:00:41.070> across<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> map<00:00:41.730> we

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
us to fire units clear across the map we

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
us to fire units clear across the map we
can<00:00:42.239> select<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> structure<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.290> queue<00:00:43.530> up

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
can select the structure we can queue up

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.310 
can select the structure we can queue up
units<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.090> launch<00:00:45.660> them<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.170> at

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
units we can then launch them all at

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.590 
units we can then launch them all at
once<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.710> come<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.129> cool

assault bots in the mix allowing us to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.229 
assault bots in the mix allowing us to
take<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.260> gunships<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.100> here's<00:01:03.059> some

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
take out these gunships and here's some

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.640 
take out these gunships and here's some
more<00:01:03.390> coming<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.229> wicked<00:01:04.500> and

again you know with full strategic zoom

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
again you know with full strategic zoom
and<00:01:06.720> watch<00:01:06.840> those<00:01:07.020> big<00:01:07.290> arcs<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:08.070> our

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and watch those big arcs because our

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.870 
and watch those big arcs because our
units<00:01:08.520> flight<00:01:08.820> clear<00:01:09.119> across<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> map<00:01:10.880> all

units flight clear across the map all

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.859 
units flight clear across the map all
right<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.840> very

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
right you can see that we're very

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.710 
right you can see that we're very
rapidly<00:01:14.060> mixing<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> big

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
rapidly mixing it up here with a big

battle we've got UEF gunships and cybron

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
battle we've got UEF gunships and cybron
gunships<00:01:18.990> both<00:01:19.290> mixing<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.700> can

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
gunships both mixing it up and you can

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.359 
gunships both mixing it up and you can
see<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> whole<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.740> wonderful<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
see the whole the this just wonderful to

Supreme Commander real-time simulation

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.980 
Supreme Commander real-time simulation
every<00:01:31.229> shot<00:01:31.590> calculated<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.579> 3d<00:01:33.090> everything

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
every shot calculated in 3d everything

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.700 
every shot calculated in 3d everything
carefully<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.689> non<00:01:36.990> determinate

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
carefully it's it's non determinate

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.499 
carefully it's it's non determinate
which<00:01:38.310> means<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.119> four<00:01:39.329> shots

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
which means we don't know four shots

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.609 
which means we don't know four shots
going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> hit<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:39.930> miss<00:01:39.960> until<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
simulation actually gets there just like

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
simulation actually gets there just like

you built a lot of tech to they weren't
useful<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.190> last<00:03:47.790> part<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.269> game<00:03:48.450> so

tech tree as we've said if you build a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530 
tech tree as we've said if you build a
tank<00:03:52.769> early<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.459> you'll<00:03:53.940> be<00:03:54.060> able<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.269> go<00:03:54.360> in

tank early on you'll be able to go in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.810 
tank early on you'll be able to go in
here<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.930> do<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.320> bunch<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.739> upgrades<00:03:56.220> on<00:03:56.459> that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
remember how the rock kids got

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.400 
remember how the rock kids got
completely<00:04:33.610> mauled<00:04:34.030> by<00:04:34.300> those<00:04:34.510> gunships<00:04:34.930> well

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
completely mauled by those gunships well

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.290 
completely mauled by those gunships well
we<00:04:35.530> can<00:04:35.680> do<00:04:35.770> upgrades<00:04:36.220> we<00:04:36.640> can<00:04:36.820> add<00:04:36.970> some

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
we can do upgrades we can add some

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.690 
we can do upgrades we can add some
longer<00:04:38.140> barrel<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:38.740> get<00:04:38.890> more<00:04:39.070> range<00:04:39.370> we<00:04:39.550> get

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
longer barrel we get more range we get

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.550 
longer barrel we get more range we get
more<00:04:39.880> muzzle<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.660> muzzle<00:04:40.930> velocity<00:04:41.320> gives<00:04:41.470> us

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
more muzzle the muzzle velocity gives us

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.900 
more muzzle the muzzle velocity gives us
more<00:04:41.680> firepower<00:04:41.920> we<00:04:42.490> want<00:04:42.670> even<00:04:42.880> more

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
more firepower we want even more

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.600 
more firepower we want even more
firepower<00:04:43.390> we<00:04:43.780> go<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:43.990> triple<00:04:44.410> barrel<00:04:44.650> we<00:04:45.340> want

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
firepower we go to triple barrel we want

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.430 
firepower we go to triple barrel we want
to<00:04:45.700> take<00:04:45.880> on<00:04:46.120> some<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.450> those<00:04:46.570> nasty<00:04:47.020> gunships

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
to take on some of those nasty gunships

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.980 
to take on some of those nasty gunships
we<00:04:47.650> can<00:04:47.770> go<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.950> anti-aircraft<00:04:48.370> capability

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
we can go to anti-aircraft capability

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.010 
we can go to anti-aircraft capability
right<00:04:49.990> on<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.710> rock<00:04:50.920> head<00:04:51.160> so<00:04:51.580> you'll<00:04:52.450> be<00:04:52.990> able

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
right on the rock head so you'll be able

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.140 
right on the rock head so you'll be able
to<00:04:53.440> send<00:04:53.890> out<00:04:54.040> a<00:04:54.070> group<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.370> Tanks<00:04:54.760> knowing

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
to send out a group of Tanks knowing

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.260 
to send out a group of Tanks knowing
that<00:04:55.300> they<00:04:55.450> won't<00:04:55.570> get<00:04:55.780> mauled<00:04:56.020> by<00:04:57.240> by<00:04:58.240> a

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
that they won't get mauled by by a

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.720 
that they won't get mauled by by a
gunship<00:04:59.260> quite<00:04:59.530> so<00:04:59.680> easily<00:04:59.890> in<00:05:00.190> bombers<00:05:00.550> and

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
gunship quite so easily in bombers and

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.550 
gunship quite so easily in bombers and
such<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.240> here<00:05:01.690> we<00:05:01.780> go<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.050> rock<00:05:02.200> hits<00:05:02.440> are

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
such and here we go the rock hits are

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.800 
such and here we go the rock hits are
now<00:05:02.650> going<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:02.980> finish<00:05:03.430> up<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:03.910> taking<00:05:04.660> out

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
now going to finish up and taking out

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.290 
now going to finish up and taking out
these<00:05:05.010> illuminant<00:05:06.010> gunships<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:07.180> can

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
these illuminant gunships and you can

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.900 
these illuminant gunships and you can
see<00:05:07.420> that<00:05:07.450> here<00:05:07.900> not<00:05:08.470> getting<00:05:08.800> whupped<00:05:09.490> quite

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
see that here not getting whupped quite

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.750 
see that here not getting whupped quite
so<00:05:10.090> badly<00:05:10.300> as<00:05:10.630> they<00:05:10.780> were<00:05:10.840> before<00:05:11.640> again<00:05:12.640> all

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
so badly as they were before again all

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.430 
so badly as they were before again all
of<00:05:12.880> this<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.120> happening<00:05:13.150> in<00:05:13.630> 3d<00:05:13.930> space<00:05:14.050> with

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
of this is happening in 3d space with

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.390 
of this is happening in 3d space with
with<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.180> true<00:05:16.180> simulation<00:05:17.670> and<00:05:18.750> this<00:05:19.750> game<00:05:20.020> is

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
with a true simulation and this game is

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.830 
with a true simulation and this game is
roughly<00:05:21.400> nine<00:05:21.550> months<00:05:21.820> into<00:05:22.000> development<00:05:22.450> so

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
roughly nine months into development so

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.760 
roughly nine months into development so
we've<00:05:23.200> got<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:25.030> know<00:05:25.120> we're<00:05:25.300> probably<00:05:25.770> you

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
we've got you know we're probably you

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
we've got you know we're probably you
know<00:05:26.830> we're<00:05:26.980> coming<00:05:27.190> out<00:05:27.250> early<00:05:27.490> next<00:05:27.520> year

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
know we're coming out early next year

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.270 
know we're coming out early next year
