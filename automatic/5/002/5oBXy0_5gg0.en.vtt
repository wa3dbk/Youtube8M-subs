00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
things I wanted to talk about was

things I wanted to talk about was
something<00:00:04.500> we<00:00:04.650> did<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.890> Foggy<00:00:05.100> Mountain

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
something we did in Foggy Mountain

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.160 
something we did in Foggy Mountain
breakdown<00:00:05.430> my<00:00:06.390> version<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.870> Foggy<00:00:07.080> Mountain

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
breakdown my version of Foggy Mountain

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.200 
breakdown my version of Foggy Mountain
breakdown<00:00:07.440> if<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.490> notice<00:00:08.790> was<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> little

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
breakdown if you notice was a little

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.009 
breakdown if you notice was a little
different<00:00:09.480> than<00:00:09.599> Earls

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
different than Earls

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.620 
different than Earls
and<00:00:10.309> the<00:00:11.309> reason<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.090> because<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.480> was

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
and the reason it is is because it was

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.390 
and the reason it is is because it was
for<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:12.900> intermediate<00:00:13.230> player<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.889> wasn't<00:00:14.190> for

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
for an intermediate player it wasn't for

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.880 
for an intermediate player it wasn't for
an<00:00:14.940> advanced<00:00:15.269> player<00:00:15.680> advanced<00:00:16.680> players

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
an advanced player advanced players

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.920 
an advanced player advanced players
already<00:00:17.070> know<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.940> what<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> did<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.779> I

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
already know it and what I did was I

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
already know it and what I did was I
worked<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.590> bit<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.460> make<00:00:20.580> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
worked out a little bit of it to make it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.580 
worked out a little bit of it to make it
easier<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.570> intermediate<00:00:22.109> player<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
easier for the intermediate player and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.339 
easier for the intermediate player and
that<00:00:23.189> means<00:00:23.430> instead<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> playing<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:28.050> instead

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that means instead of playing so instead

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.540 
that means instead of playing so instead
of<00:00:28.500> playing<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:30.920> did<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> might<00:00:35.219> seem<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
of playing I did so it might seem a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.100 
of playing I did so it might seem a
little<00:00:35.670> harder<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.450> easier<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
little harder but it's easier when I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.760 
little harder but it's easier when I
point<00:00:37.530> I'm<00:00:37.620> playing<00:00:37.829> fast<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:39.590> rather<00:00:40.590> than

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
point I'm playing fast to go rather than

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.850 
point I'm playing fast to go rather than
going<00:00:42.230> putting<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> brakes<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.829> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
going putting on the brakes on that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
going putting on the brakes on that
forward<00:00:44.219> roll<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:46.170> hard<00:00:47.059> especially<00:00:48.059> when

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
forward roll it's hard especially when

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.470 
forward roll it's hard especially when
we<00:00:48.600> go

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.780 

the<00:00:54.870> way<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.200> I<00:00:55.260> showed<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.790> get

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
the way that I showed you so I go I get

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.350 
the way that I showed you so I go I get
faster<00:01:02.270> just<00:01:03.270> coming<00:01:03.809> forward<00:01:04.140> roll<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
faster just coming forward roll and it's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700 
faster just coming forward roll and it's
a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.720> easier<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.440> intermediate

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
a little bit easier for the intermediate

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910 
a little bit easier for the intermediate
player<00:01:08.130> sorry<00:01:08.580> three<00:01:08.880> five<00:01:09.659> three<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.470> five

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
player sorry three five three on five

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.999 
player sorry three five three on five
o'clock<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.229> then<00:01:13.229> middle<00:01:13.470> finger<00:01:13.770> plucks

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
o'clock and then middle finger plucks

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.350 
o'clock and then middle finger plucks
the<00:01:14.310> first<00:01:14.550> ring<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.300> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the first ring so that's a bit of a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.609 
the first ring so that's a bit of a
stretch<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> middle<00:01:16.229> finger<00:01:16.350> up

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
stretch to get that middle finger up

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
stretch to get that middle finger up

here at the fourth string that's the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.550 
here at the fourth string that's the
same<00:01:18.840> thing<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.050> did<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> Foggy

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
same thing we did with the Foggy

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:35.020 
same thing we did with the Foggy

clinch button backs up I want to use

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.590 
clinch button backs up I want to use
that<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.720> backward<00:03:25.560> roll<00:03:25.770> as<00:03:25.980> well<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.670> what

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
that will make it a little bit easier so

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.190 
that will make it a little bit easier so
we're<00:03:30.569> gonna<00:03:30.660> play<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.120> three<00:03:36.480> five

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
three one three Bob at the second fret

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
three one three Bob at the second fret
and<00:03:41.300> then<00:03:42.300> first<00:03:43.110> ring<00:03:43.320> three<00:03:43.770> five<00:03:44.459> three<00:03:44.490> one

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
and then first ring three five three one

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.350 
and then first ring three five three one
three<00:03:45.450> five<00:03:45.870> one<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.680> then<00:03:47.280> three<00:03:47.700> one<00:03:48.000> five

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.539 

so<00:04:03.049> let's<00:04:03.200> try<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:03.379> in<00:04:03.590> slow<00:04:03.739> motion<00:04:03.950> three

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
so let's try that in slow motion three

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:13.000 
so let's try that in slow motion three
five<00:04:06.879> middle<00:04:07.879> at<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.450> first<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.200> just<00:04:12.010> hit

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
middle finger at the first string so

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.390 
middle finger at the first string so
three<00:04:28.039> five<00:04:28.940> three<00:04:28.970> one<00:04:29.479> three<00:04:30.199> all<00:04:30.560> off<00:04:30.830> first
