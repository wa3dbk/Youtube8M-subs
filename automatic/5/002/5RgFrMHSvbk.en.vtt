words what Sabre has finally realized

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.999 
words what Sabre has finally realized
that<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:29.600> think<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.929> lot<00:01:29.959> of<00:01:30.139> companies<00:01:30.319> haven't

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
that I think a lot of companies haven't

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.910 
that I think a lot of companies haven't
is<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.700> cops<00:01:31.939> are<00:01:32.240> not<00:01:32.509> fighting<00:01:32.920> standing

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
is that cops are not fighting standing

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.760 
is that cops are not fighting standing
up<00:01:34.069> facing<00:01:34.909> our<00:01:35.029> subject<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.840> doing<00:01:36.560> this

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
up facing our subject and doing this

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.590 
up facing our subject and doing this
like<00:01:37.219> we<00:01:37.399> do<00:01:37.579> in<00:01:37.729> training<00:01:38.209> that<00:01:38.359> we're<00:01:38.509> going

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
like we do in training that we're going

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.840 
like we do in training that we're going
to<00:01:38.659> end<00:01:38.899> up<00:01:39.079> going<00:01:39.259> down<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.859> ground<00:01:40.130> we

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
to end up going down to the ground we

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.179 
to end up going down to the ground we
may<00:01:41.029> have<00:01:41.179> to<00:01:41.329> go<00:01:41.479> like<00:01:41.689> this<00:01:41.899> like<00:01:42.319> this<00:01:42.590> we

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
may have to go like this like this we

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.279 
may have to go like this like this we
may<00:01:43.369> have<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.670> engage<00:01:43.819> multiple<00:01:44.240> subjects<00:01:45.049> and

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
may have to engage multiple subjects and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.679 
may have to engage multiple subjects and
again<00:01:45.950> we've<00:01:46.159> also<00:01:46.520> when<00:01:46.729> we're<00:01:46.880> using<00:01:46.999> OC

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
again we've also when we're using OC

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.719 
again we've also when we're using OC
spray<00:01:47.959> we<00:01:48.709> have<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:48.950> be<00:01:49.069> careful<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.520> we're

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
spray we have to be careful that we're

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.699 
spray we have to be careful that we're
not<00:01:49.849> spraying<00:01:50.209> who<00:01:50.450> our<00:01:50.869> back<00:01:51.200> up<00:01:51.409> coming

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
not spraying who our back up coming

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.440 
not spraying who our back up coming
behind<00:01:51.859> us<00:01:52.159> right<00:01:52.249> so<00:01:52.399> with<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.849> it's<00:01:53.090> much

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
behind us right so with this it's much

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.620 
behind us right so with this it's much
more<00:01:53.779> controllable<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:55.090> saber<00:01:56.090> has<00:01:56.299> thought

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
more controllable and saber has thought

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.999 
more controllable and saber has thought
