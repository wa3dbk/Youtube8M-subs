00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
wall or this could also be like running

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.669 
wall or this could also be like running
into<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.740> into<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.730> ditch<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.810> coming<00:00:31.380> across<00:00:31.590> a

you know Polly it's not from your form
your<00:00:39.210> frame<00:00:39.450> crumple<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.850> does<00:00:42.120> get

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
your frame crumple so this this does get

00:00:42.329 --> 00:01:30.499 
your frame crumple so this this does get
a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.600> sketchy<00:00:48.620> yeah

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.810 

it's<00:01:31.509> over<00:01:31.929> 2,000<00:01:32.679> yeah<00:01:32.860> there's<00:01:33.520> probably

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
it's over 2,000 yeah there's probably

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.600 
it's over 2,000 yeah there's probably
around<00:01:33.940> my<00:01:34.179> 21<00:01:35.310> good<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.229> like<00:01:38.470> I<00:01:38.710> mean<00:01:39.190> again

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
we have a test log that we have a couple

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.870 
we have a test log that we have a couple
we<00:01:55.210> have<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> couple<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.500> thousand<00:01:57.069> by<00:01:57.310> friends

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
we have a couple of thousand by friends

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.090 
we have a couple of thousand by friends
tested<00:01:58.330> at<00:01:58.420> this<00:01:58.539> point<00:01:58.780> in<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.080> log<00:01:59.259> other

tested at this point in a log other

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.040 
tested at this point in a log other
people's<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.850> all<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.240> ours<00:02:01.569> but<00:02:01.810> all<00:02:01.869> the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
people's in all of ours but all the

versions of ours the old ones the new
ones<00:02:04.270> definitely<00:02:04.840> get<00:02:05.110> from<00:02:05.259> production<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
ones definitely get from production and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.300 
ones definitely get from production and
all<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.030> different<00:02:07.540> tests<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.250> there's<00:02:09.250> a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
all the different tests and there's a

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.949 
all the different tests and there's a

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
lot of money that has to go into that

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.850 
lot of money that has to go into that
you<00:02:11.470> know<00:02:11.590> where<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:13.200> we<00:02:14.200> beg<00:02:14.440> borrow<00:02:14.470> and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
you know where we we beg borrow and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.620 
you know where we we beg borrow and
steal<00:02:15.160> all<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.489> our<00:02:15.670> competitors<00:02:16.120> stuff<00:02:16.420> this

we're<00:02:18.400> always<00:02:18.549> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.850> be<00:02:18.910> better<00:02:19.420> than

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
we're always going to be better than

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.370 
we're always going to be better than
which<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.860> think

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
which I think

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.620
