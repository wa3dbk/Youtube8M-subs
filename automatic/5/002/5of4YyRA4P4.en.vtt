00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.009
 armor perk 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.499

 dig in their insides cocoons 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.659
 It will take a lot and they come across 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.369
 not often so take heart 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.590

 the outcasts will be completely dumbfounded and 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.610
 demoralized and weakened 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.590
 I guarantee also in the trash besides 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.360
 solvent comes across green salt 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.610
 hydrogen peroxide they get us there 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.349
 handy pick up and fold in 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.170
 a backpack so we have in inventory 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.569
 solvent cocoons and also studied 1 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.430
 Perk cutting carcasses click on the cocoon 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.700
 right click and select item 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.180
 cut from the cocoon turns spiderweb 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.010
 thread and less durable getting the thread exactly 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.049
 from durable get the threads we will 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.670
 dangle balls strong not so for 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.870
 subsequent manufacturing of them 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.870
 armored sweater to 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.890
 for crafting one ball of durable not so 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.710
 need again coils of silk thread 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.140
 which often come across in trash and 20 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.960
 durable spider threads as well 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.000
 learned 1 person creating items for 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.250
 order to increase the chance of successful craft 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.650
 Need to acquire skill points branches 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.170
 perks but perks themselves don't study for the time being 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.870
 before the time for example you invested branch 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.700
 points for 4 perk opened only one in 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:37.520
 In this case, the chance of successful crafting from you 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:39.810
 will be higher with the thread figured out 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.160
 go to the thimble scissors and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.080
 needles to find them we need 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.520
 armed with a metal detector which 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.700
 can buy from a repairman 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.230
 or get the quest if washed to 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.300
 use a metal detector 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.880
 you need to open perk detectors and 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.460
 stock up with the same repairman and a half 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.990
 volt batteries and more because 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.670
 that the metal detector lives and how 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.670
 crazy along with the wrapper 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.680
 look for tools tailor will 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.320
 lubich surroundings 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.790
 squared e-10 I advise you to grab with 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.739
 a gun to quickly 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.840
 switch to it from a metal detector 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.960
 and shoot off annoying treshek and 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.760
 spiders along rusty scissors 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.260
 needles and thimbles you will 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.150
 come across other things 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.030
 are involved in various local 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.250
 for example toy soldiers with whom 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.920
 loves to be played lieutenant majors or 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.080
 crosses for collapsible dad as well 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.970
 just unnecessary junk- type trash 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.830
 cans now found thimbles needles 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.870
 and scissors need to be cleaned from 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.720
 rust and for this we need 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.880
 previously found green salt peroxide 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.340
 hydrogen and even cotton fabric 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.590
 which can be exchanged with the buyer Khabar 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.650
 in people whose buildings are rifles on their heads 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.480
 puppies and at the same time buy from the dealer armor 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.580
 at the station last and most important 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.590
 component for crafting our sweater from 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.590
 spiderweb sweater with patterns 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.640
 so all the components are assembled first 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.800
 create a reservation studied knit sweater 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.800
 We look at its characteristics and appearance 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.730
 same armored fit armored 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.400
 next generation sweater namely 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.860
 sweater dog hair and after him 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.590
 boar sweater and so on 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.150
 still he will need experience to open 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.090
 new armor creation perks 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.400
 down to 4 and in every new light 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.250
 previous sweater is used as well 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.630
 pieces of mutants on this I have everything to everyone 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.630
 long and successful crafting
