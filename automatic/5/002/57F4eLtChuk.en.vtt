00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.350
 football is a sport that does not have 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.120
 borders and proof of that is what 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.980
 happened the elections to president in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.070
 egypt where the real players 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.560
 madrid sergio ramos and cristiano ronaldo 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 They received votes from people 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 we are already only two days away from 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.079
 start the soccer world cup the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.239
 most important sporting event for 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.130
 many around the world and in this video 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.470
 I will tell you about impressive data 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.530
 not only of the world but also 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.899
 of football in general today 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.149
 all the elections leave everything in the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.420
 court to be able to attend a cup of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.670
 world but in 1950 the selection of the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.190
 bible rejected the invitation to the world 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 from Brazil this because the fifa does not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 I let him play barefoot as he 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 I used to that country 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 imagine that the arrival at the end of the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.269
 global to the host on his own 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.670
 stadium with more than 100 thousand people in 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.890
 your against and that the cup of the world will 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.470
 delivered in a canteen around the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.930
 stadium to prevent vandalism 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.600
 Believe it or not, the same thing happened to him 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.899
 to a selection 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.030
 brazil-1950 this is perhaps the end of a 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.939
 world most remembered by the famous 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.700
 maracanazo at minute 47 of the first 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.920
 Frank part would overtake the locals 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.960
 on the scoreboard but little was going to last 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.289
 the taste to the cariocas since to the minute 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.039
 66 forward Juan Alberto tie and 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.679
 on the scoreboard 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.479
 minutes later the second one would fall and 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.610
 last so much of the match which 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.399
 coronary for the second time to the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.009
 Uruguayan and although they do not believe it the most 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.649
 impressive is not the victory of 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.899
 Uruguay in the maracana but jules 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.929
 rimet the then president of the fifa 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.420
 delivered the trophy in a canteen 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.429
 world champion Uruguayans as 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.200
 they did not find the necessary order to 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.200
 the award ceremony at the stadium 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.660
 and the bayern of Munich have and never what 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.870
 they will be able to have is the name more 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.879
 long of all and belongs to a club 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.470
 Welsh the name obviously I do not 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.599
 I can pronounce but I'm going to leave it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.830
 here or here with the whole screen is 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.830
 very long may not see me 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.090
 or soccer players and there is a 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.990
 person who achieved these two dreams his 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.270
 first name 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.700
 evo morals the current president of 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.890
 Bolivia which became just barely 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.720
 a few weeks in the new player of the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.330
 sport boys of the first division of 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.280
 Monica the club president assures 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.220
 that the moral evo will carry the number 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.920
 number 10 and that only the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.630
 minimum wage the match of 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.730
 qualifiers for the world cup between 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.140
 Chile and Russia in 1973 is perhaps the most 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.680
 impressive throughout the history of 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.680
 football 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.120
 Chile and Russia played in the repechage 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.640
 to qualify for the german world cup 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.400
 1974 the first leg ended with a 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.099
 tie to 0 which was played in the union 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.900
 Soviet and Chile had practically a 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.970
 ticket within the world round 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.319
 was to be played on November 21 in 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.390
 santiago de chile 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.250
 but the Soviets did not travel because of 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.189
 the political situation of the country 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.680
 South American all believed that Chile 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.019
 I was in the World Cup but they forced the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.629
 Chilean team to come out and score a goal 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.909
 in the empty goal of the Russians a goal 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.680
 that would go down in history because it 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.230
 scored in the only game in 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.889
 World Cup qualifiers played 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.889
 without rivals 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.050

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.450

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.290

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.710

 victory in three cups of the world 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.220
 he almost took the trouble to calculate how much 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.320
 very from the mythical court of the 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.240
 supercampeones for it had to do 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.010
 several calculations besides taking as 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.440
 reference to some people of 1 meter 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.320
 with 70 centimeters of height the data 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.180
 they revealed that the court measures 18 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.980
 kilometers in length and that 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.510
 supercampeones ran at a speed 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.070
 of 150 kilometers per hour good this is 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.750
