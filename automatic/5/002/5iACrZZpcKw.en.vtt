00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
glad that they had an opposite toggle

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.990 
glad that they had an opposite toggle
that<00:01:07.420> because<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.500> was<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:10.030> hard<00:01:10.420> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that because it was so so hard to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.279 
that because it was so so hard to
maneuver<00:01:13.000> around<00:01:13.210> with<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.740> jump<00:01:15.340> button<00:01:16.289> on

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
maneuver around with the jump button on

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.209 
maneuver around with the jump button on
the<00:01:17.590> side<00:01:17.829> which<00:01:18.310> was<00:01:18.880> really<00:01:19.179> really<00:01:19.630> bad<00:01:20.289> so

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219
