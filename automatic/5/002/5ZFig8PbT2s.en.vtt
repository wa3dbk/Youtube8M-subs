all<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> believe<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.620> first<00:00:01.920> thing<00:00:02.159> that

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
all right I believe the first thing that

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.009 
all right I believe the first thing that
I'm<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.580> do<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:04.130> actually<00:00:06.529> cut<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.740> off

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
I'm going to do is actually cut this off

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.039 
I'm going to do is actually cut this off
right<00:00:10.019> here<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:11.389> that's<00:00:12.389> gonna<00:00:12.540> take<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> while

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
right here so that's gonna take a while

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.160 
right here so that's gonna take a while
with<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> hacksaw<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.299> of<00:00:15.299> course<00:00:15.570> once<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.960> get

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
with a hacksaw and of course once I get

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.279 
with a hacksaw and of course once I get
it<00:00:16.880> cut<00:00:17.880> I'll<00:00:18.660> take<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> bench

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
it cut I'll take you to the bench

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.240 
it cut I'll take you to the bench
grinder<00:00:19.820> file<00:00:20.820> off<00:00:21.029> most<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.250> access

file<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:48.440> had<00:00:49.440> originally<00:00:49.649> put<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
file I had originally put this

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
file I had originally put this
electrical<00:00:51.719> tape<00:00:51.930> around<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.350> rod<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.430> this

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
electrical tape around the rod this this

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.500 
electrical tape around the rod this this
particular<00:00:54.840> section<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.469> where<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:56.820> slid<00:00:57.270> into

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
particular section is where it slid into

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.889 
particular section is where it slid into
the<00:00:57.780> ball<00:00:57.930> bearings<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the ball bearings and I had to put that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
the ball bearings and I had to put that
around<00:01:01.050> there<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.500> make<00:01:02.280> sure<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> would

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
around there to make sure that it would

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.030 
around there to make sure that it would
be<00:01:02.969> tight<00:01:03.329> within<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.049> center<00:01:04.559> ring<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
be tight within the center ring of the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.820 
be tight within the center ring of the
bearing<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> rod

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
bearing and you know so that the rod

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.899 
bearing and you know so that the rod
wouldn't<00:01:08.220> flex<00:01:08.970> back<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.420> forth<00:01:10.220> if<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.760> go

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
wouldn't flex back and forth if you go

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.130 
wouldn't flex back and forth if you go
with<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> design<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.930> you'll

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
with a design like I have you'll

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
with a design like I have you'll
probably<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> same<00:01:14.700> thing<00:01:14.970> as

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
probably have to do the same thing as

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.350 
probably have to do the same thing as
well<00:01:21.350> basically<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.470> I've<00:01:22.560> done<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.040> far

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
well basically what I've done so far

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.070 
well basically what I've done so far
with<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> base<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:26.369> determined<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
with with the base is I determined that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.020 
with with the base is I determined that
eight<00:01:28.080> inches<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.850> plenty<00:01:29.850> sufficient

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
eight inches would be plenty sufficient

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
eight inches would be plenty sufficient
to<00:01:30.600> accommodate<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.439> washers<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.540> it's<00:01:33.680> it's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to accommodate the washers and it's it's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.980 
to accommodate the washers and it's it's
about<00:01:34.950> relative<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> size<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
about relative to the size of the the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.100 
about relative to the size of the the
top<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.970> glidecam<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.240> eight<00:01:39.720> inches<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
top of the glidecam so eight inches is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.690 
top of the glidecam so eight inches is
going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.409> sufficient<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:41.369> basically

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
going to be sufficient it's basically

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.899 
going to be sufficient it's basically
four<00:01:42.299> inches<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.990> each<00:01:43.860> side<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.460> where<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
four inches on each side of where the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:02:19.289 
four inches on each side of where the
rod<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.229> through

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.420 

all<00:02:20.299> right<00:02:20.420> here's<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.719> gimbal<00:02:21.349> when<00:02:22.129> I<00:02:22.159> first

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
all right here's the gimbal when I first

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.330 
all right here's the gimbal when I first
put<00:02:22.609> this<00:02:22.700> gimbal<00:02:22.939> together<00:02:23.499> when<00:02:24.499> I<00:02:24.530> very

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
put this gimbal together when I very

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.459 
put this gimbal together when I very
first<00:02:25.430> designed<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.359> I<00:02:26.540> didn't<00:02:27.109> have<00:02:27.230> any<00:02:27.409> of

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
first designed it I didn't have any of

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.170 
first designed it I didn't have any of
this<00:02:27.650> tape<00:02:27.889> here<00:02:28.159> and<00:02:28.340> there's<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.849> little<00:02:29.090> bit

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
this tape here and there's a little bit

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.869 
this tape here and there's a little bit
of<00:02:29.209> tape<00:02:29.480> on<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:29.780> underneath<00:02:30.549> side<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.609> that

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
of tape on the underneath side of that

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.339 
of tape on the underneath side of that
as<00:02:32.030> well<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.480> can<00:02:32.540> still<00:02:32.930> see<00:02:33.109> one<00:02:33.260> of

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
as well and you can still see one of

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.619 
as well and you can still see one of
those<00:02:33.439> bearings<00:02:33.829> is<00:02:34.010> stuck<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.359> I

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
those bearings is stuck to it but I

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.089 
those bearings is stuck to it but I
didn't<00:02:36.019> have<00:02:36.049> any<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.469> tape<00:02:36.650> there<00:02:36.889> and

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
didn't have any of the tape there and

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.190 
didn't have any of the tape there and
when<00:02:37.219> I<00:02:37.250> first<00:02:37.609> put<00:02:37.879> it<00:02:37.969> together<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.540> couldn't

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
when I first put it together I couldn't

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.839 
when I first put it together I couldn't
figure<00:02:39.349> out<00:02:39.500> why<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.129> world<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.549> rod

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
figure out why in the world the rod

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.379 
figure out why in the world the rod
wouldn't<00:02:41.239> spin<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.519> for<00:02:43.519> whatever<00:02:43.790> reasons

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
wouldn't spin and for whatever reasons

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.839 
wouldn't spin and for whatever reasons
it<00:02:45.139> just<00:02:45.379> needed<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.709> little<00:02:45.980> bit<00:02:46.069> more<00:02:46.129> spacing

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
it just needed a little bit more spacing

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.720 
it just needed a little bit more spacing
and<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.689> accomplished<00:02:48.379> that<00:02:48.560> through<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.189> little

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and I accomplished that through a little

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.720 
and I accomplished that through a little
bit<00:02:49.969> of<00:02:50.090> tape<00:02:50.299> on<00:02:50.650> both<00:02:51.650> sides<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.489> think

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
bit of tape on both sides and I think

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.339 
bit of tape on both sides and I think
there's<00:02:52.909> two<00:02:53.120> layers<00:02:53.329> of<00:02:53.659> tape<00:02:53.840> there<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:54.290> I

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
there's two layers of tape there and I

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.409 
there's two layers of tape there and I
just<00:02:54.530> took<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.829> razor<00:02:55.459> blade<00:02:55.669> and<00:02:55.790> cut<00:02:56.000> all<00:02:56.299> the

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
just took a razor blade and cut all the

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.300 
just took a razor blade and cut all the
way<00:02:56.510> around<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.019> but<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:58.129> also<00:02:58.340> helps<00:02:59.620> keep<00:03:00.620> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
way around it but it also helps keep the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.420 
way around it but it also helps keep the
bearings<00:03:01.730> from<00:03:01.939> sliding<00:03:02.569> back<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:02.840> forth

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
bearings from sliding back and forth

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.849 
bearings from sliding back and forth
against<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.519> aluminum<00:03:05.540> I'm<00:03:06.439> just<00:03:06.650> dry

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
against the aluminum I'm just dry

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.059 
against the aluminum I'm just dry
fitting<00:03:07.129> it<00:03:07.340> right<00:03:07.519> now<00:03:08.019> but<00:03:09.019> remember<00:03:09.949> there

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
fitting it right now but remember there

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.580 
fitting it right now but remember there
were<00:03:10.219> two<00:03:10.629> nuts<00:03:11.629> there<00:03:11.930> now<00:03:12.139> there's<00:03:12.319> just<00:03:12.409> one

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
were two nuts there now there's just one

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.709 
were two nuts there now there's just one
because<00:03:13.129> I'm<00:03:13.219> using<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.609> lock<00:03:13.819> nut<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:15.230> let<00:03:16.219> me

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:16.719 
because I'm using a lock nut but let me

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.379 
because I'm using a lock nut but let me
back<00:03:17.719> away<00:03:18.079> here<00:03:18.459> now<00:03:19.459> remember<00:03:19.790> earlier<00:03:20.150> I

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
back away here now remember earlier I

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.740 
back away here now remember earlier I
had<00:03:20.629> some<00:03:21.169> electrical<00:03:21.620> tape<00:03:21.650> around<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.540> rod

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
had some electrical tape around the rod

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.659 
had some electrical tape around the rod
that<00:03:24.470> was<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.919> prevent<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:27.459> I'm<00:03:28.459> gonna

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
that was to prevent this and I'm gonna

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.179 
that was to prevent this and I'm gonna
go<00:03:28.879> ahead<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.150> wrap<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:30.470> rod<00:03:30.650> with<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:30.919> little

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
go ahead and wrap the rod with a little

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.789 
go ahead and wrap the rod with a little
bit<00:03:31.310> more<00:03:31.459> electrical<00:03:31.879> tape<00:03:32.349> all<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.680> way

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
bit more electrical tape all the way

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.670 
bit more electrical tape all the way
down<00:03:34.900> basically<00:03:35.900> about<00:03:36.109> an<00:03:36.259> inch<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.650> half

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
down basically about an inch and a half

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.499 
down basically about an inch and a half
basically<00:03:37.370> about<00:03:37.639> an<00:03:37.759> inch<00:03:37.939> and<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.120> half<00:03:38.180> worth

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:38.509 
basically about an inch and a half worth

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.179 
basically about an inch and a half worth
of<00:03:38.720> electrical<00:03:39.259> tape<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:40.599> cover<00:03:41.599> this<00:03:41.810> entire

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
of electrical tape to cover this entire

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.939 
of electrical tape to cover this entire
section<00:03:43.189> of<00:03:43.280> Rod<00:03:44.199> hey<00:03:45.199> what's<00:03:45.409> up<00:03:45.530> guys<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.919> just

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.879 
real quick and this is it I had to add
more<00:03:51.590> weights<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.370> surprisingly<00:03:52.939> and

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
more weights to it surprisingly and

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.229 
more weights to it surprisingly and
there's<00:03:54.889> a<00:03:54.979> month<00:03:55.340> there's<00:03:55.609> another<00:03:55.790> mod<00:03:56.060> that

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
there's a month there's another mod that

that tomorrow or maybe Monday but I want
to<00:04:02.840> change<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.259> handle<00:04:03.620> up<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.829> little<00:04:04.009> bit

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:04.219 
to change the handle up a little bit

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:06.369 
to change the handle up a little bit
it's<00:04:04.459> kind<00:04:04.909> of<00:04:05.000> uncomfortable<00:04:05.419> to<00:04:05.750> hold<00:04:05.900> as<00:04:06.229> it

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
it's kind of uncomfortable to hold as it

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.559 
it's kind of uncomfortable to hold as it
is<00:04:06.500> now<00:04:06.680> but<00:04:08.469> everything<00:04:09.469> is<00:04:09.590> balanced<00:04:10.569> I'm

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
is now but everything is balanced I'm

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.089 
is now but everything is balanced I'm
not<00:04:11.750> sure<00:04:11.930> if<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.109> can<00:04:12.290> do<00:04:12.409> this<00:04:12.560> well<00:04:12.799> hold<00:04:12.949> it

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
not sure if I can do this well hold it

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.610 
not sure if I can do this well hold it
two<00:04:13.280> cameras<00:04:13.759> but<00:04:15.130> tomorrow<00:04:17.049> I'm<00:04:18.049> gonna<00:04:18.380> try

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
two cameras but tomorrow I'm gonna try

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.830 
two cameras but tomorrow I'm gonna try
and<00:04:18.709> get<00:04:18.799> some<00:04:19.039> test<00:04:19.370> footage<00:04:19.459> for<00:04:19.940> you

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
and get some test footage for you

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.249 
and get some test footage for you
so<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.440> can<00:04:21.680> see<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.449> judge<00:04:23.449> for<00:04:23.690> yourself<00:04:24.020> on

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
so you can see and judge for yourself on

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.920 
so you can see and judge for yourself on
how<00:04:24.800> well<00:04:25.009> it<00:04:25.039> does<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:27.590> think<00:04:28.550> that's<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:29.000> I

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
how well it does and I think that's it I

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.239 
how well it does and I think that's it I
might<00:04:30.409> even<00:04:30.560> put<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.860> little<00:04:31.070> bit

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.249 
might even put a little bit

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.939 
might even put a little bit
of<00:04:31.309> the<00:04:31.839> test<00:04:32.839> footage<00:04:33.139> that<00:04:33.499> I<00:04:33.529> got<00:04:34.149> when<00:04:35.149> the

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
of the test footage that I got when the

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.489 
of the test footage that I got when the
threaded<00:04:36.949> rod<00:04:36.979> was<00:04:37.429> longer<00:04:37.699> than<00:04:37.939> it<00:04:38.089> is<00:04:38.179> now

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.499 
threaded rod was longer than it is now

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:44.859 
threaded rod was longer than it is now
but<00:04:39.499> this<00:04:40.039> is<00:04:40.099> the<00:04:40.329> modified<00:04:41.329> version<00:04:43.629> if<00:04:44.629> I

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:44.869 
but this is the modified version if I

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.589 
but this is the modified version if I
can<00:04:45.049> make<00:04:45.709> one<00:04:45.739> suggestion<00:04:46.489> instead<00:04:47.269> of

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
can make one suggestion instead of

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:53.349 
can make one suggestion instead of
cutting<00:04:47.989> that<00:04:49.149> rod<00:04:50.149> to<00:04:51.049> 12<00:04:51.859> inches<00:04:52.849> I<00:04:53.029> wished<00:04:53.239> I

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:53.359 
cutting that rod to 12 inches I wished I

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.249 
cutting that rod to 12 inches I wished I
would<00:04:53.509> have<00:04:53.539> done<00:04:53.749> it<00:04:53.899> to<00:04:54.079> maybe<00:04:55.149> 16<00:04:56.199> just<00:04:57.199> a

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
would have done it to maybe 16 just a

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.639 
would have done it to maybe 16 just a
little<00:04:57.529> bit<00:04:57.649> longer<00:04:57.859> because<00:04:58.549> these<00:04:58.909> weights

00:04:59.639 --> 00:04:59.649 
little bit longer because these weights

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:01.869 
little bit longer because these weights
do<00:05:00.649> kind<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:00.979> get<00:05:01.099> in<00:05:01.219> the<00:05:01.309> way<00:05:01.339> of<00:05:01.429> your<00:05:01.669> hand

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
do kind of get in the way of your hand

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.789 
do kind of get in the way of your hand
down<00:05:02.059> there<00:05:02.119> that's<00:05:02.599> really<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:03.409> reason<00:05:03.559> why

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:03.799 
down there that's really the reason why

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:06.609 
down there that's really the reason why
I'm<00:05:04.009> gonna<00:05:04.479> modify<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.689> handle<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.199> little<00:05:06.229> bit

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:06.619 
I'm gonna modify the handle a little bit

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:09.850 
I'm gonna modify the handle a little bit
