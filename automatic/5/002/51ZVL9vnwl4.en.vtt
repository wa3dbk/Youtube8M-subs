00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
things will come over the console in

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.610 
things will come over the console in
their<00:02:38.939> same<00:02:39.299> format<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:40.079> what<00:02:40.379> might<00:02:40.590> happen

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
their same format but what might happen

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.069 
their same format but what might happen
instead<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:42.269> might<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.629> option<00:02:43.019> of

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
instead is you might have the option of

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.020 
instead is you might have the option of
being<00:02:43.290> able<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.560> be<00:02:43.680> like<00:02:43.889> okay<00:02:44.189> 4j<00:02:44.579> Studios

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
being able to be like okay 4j Studios

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.699 
being able to be like okay 4j Studios
will<00:02:45.180> be<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.419> pulsating<00:02:45.750> sheep<00:02:46.139> and<00:02:46.319> then

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
will be the pulsating sheep and then

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.099 
will be the pulsating sheep and then
maybe<00:02:46.919> Roger<00:02:47.340> carpenter<00:02:47.969> like<00:02:48.299> carp<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.810> you

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
maybe Roger carpenter like carp and you

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.780 
maybe Roger carpenter like carp and you
know<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.379> rotten<00:02:49.889> ramp<00:02:50.099> Ramsay<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.579> think

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
know with a rotten ramp Ramsay I think

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.280 
know with a rotten ramp Ramsay I think
his<00:02:50.909> name<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.060> they<00:02:51.719> might<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.139> names

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
his name is they might be the names

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.050 
his name is they might be the names
instead<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.859> yet<00:02:53.219> to<00:02:53.250> be<00:02:53.370> seen<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:53.939> they

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
instead it's yet to be seen but they

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.520 
instead it's yet to be seen but they
should<00:02:54.359> have<00:02:54.540> some<00:02:54.870> form<00:02:55.109> for<00:02:55.260> quibbling

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
should have some form for quibbling

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.020 
should have some form for quibbling
because<00:02:55.949> this<00:02:56.099> is<00:02:56.219> one<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.549> best<00:02:56.819> features

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
because this is one of the best features

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.729 
because this is one of the best features
in<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.359> game<00:02:57.510> I'll<00:02:57.689> slow<00:02:57.900> down<00:02:57.930> donkeys<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
in the game I'll slow down donkeys and

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.649 
in the game I'll slow down donkeys and
pulsating<00:02:59.459> sheep<00:02:59.849> they're<00:03:00.030> all<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.239> need<00:03:00.389> so

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
finally how do you get these name tags

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.309 
finally how do you get these name tags
men<00:03:02.909> because<00:03:03.120> they<00:03:03.209> can't<00:03:03.480> be<00:03:03.599> crafted<00:03:04.049> they

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
men because they can't be crafted they

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.929 
men because they can't be crafted they
can<00:03:04.439> be<00:03:04.620> found<00:03:04.739> from<00:03:04.949> two<00:03:05.250> separate<00:03:05.639> sources

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
can be found from two separate sources

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.369 
can be found from two separate sources
so<00:03:06.180> far<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.629> third<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:06.989> will<00:03:07.109> come<00:03:07.260> later

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
so far and a third one will come later

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.800 
so far and a third one will come later
so<00:03:07.769> but<00:03:08.219> they<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.609> only<00:03:08.669> be<00:03:08.909> found<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.359> dungeon

fun<00:03:48.389> thing<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.659> do<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.139> that's<00:03:49.590> what's<00:03:49.799> going

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:50.009 
fun thing to do so that's what's going

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.800 
fun thing to do so that's what's going
on<00:03:50.099> there<00:03:50.250> let's<00:03:50.430> move<00:03:50.609> on<00:03:50.759> to<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.180> lead<00:03:51.479> so

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
on there let's move on to the lead so

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.270 
on there let's move on to the lead so
the<00:03:51.840> leads<00:03:52.079> are<00:03:52.259> simple<00:03:52.560> enough<00:03:52.590> thing<00:03:52.949> you

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
the leads are simple enough thing you

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.589 
the leads are simple enough thing you
probably<00:03:53.459> understand<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.269> use<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:54.479> to

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
probably understand it you can use it to

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.240 
probably understand it you can use it to
tie<00:03:54.780> horses<00:03:55.349> or<00:03:55.560> donkeys<00:03:55.949> or<00:03:56.040> whatever

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.750 
yet so I initially tame this donkey can
see<00:05:15.720> I'm<00:05:15.870> not<00:05:16.050> controlling<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.650> but<00:05:17.040> if<00:05:17.370> you

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
see I'm not controlling it but if you

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.310 
see I'm not controlling it but if you
lose<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.330> lead<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.690> can<00:05:18.840> actually<00:05:18.930> bring<00:05:19.200> it

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
lose the lead you can actually bring it

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.450 
lose the lead you can actually bring it
with<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.560> even<00:05:19.740> though<00:05:19.919> it's<00:05:20.070> not<00:05:20.100> tamed

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
with you even though it's not tamed

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.340 
with you even though it's not tamed
which<00:05:20.669> is<00:05:20.820> quite<00:05:21.000> useful<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.540> finally<00:05:22.169> if

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
which is quite useful and finally if

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.750 
which is quite useful and finally if
you're<00:05:22.530> on<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.680> horse<00:05:22.950> you<00:05:23.130> have<00:05:23.310> got<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.520> tall

to<00:05:27.419> bring<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.630> lead<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.080> can<00:05:28.200> just<00:05:28.230> drag

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
to bring a lead so you can just drag

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.860 
to bring a lead so you can just drag
them<00:05:28.919> through<00:05:28.980> water<00:05:29.280> like<00:05:29.550> so<00:05:29.850> so<00:05:30.300> yeah<00:05:30.690> the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
them through water like so so yeah the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.510 
them through water like so so yeah the
leads<00:05:31.050> are<00:05:31.260> really<00:05:31.500> cool<00:05:31.650> useful<00:05:32.010> thing<00:05:32.340> like

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
