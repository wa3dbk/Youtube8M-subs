 quickly with the video tutorial or that 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.170
 this case we will live in two parts 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.910
 introduction first stanzas equal and 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.860
 the pre-chorus so to speak then they are 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.510
 two nothing more to learn so you're going to 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.280
 link with the first part the first 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.890
 starting the truth that the introduction yes 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.299
 see in the official video they will see that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.650
 juanes or the guitar is this 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.870
 movement not 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.400
 do here take here this be according 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.660
 we are not going to do it, we are going to do it 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.860
 yes but in another way because there is a lot 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.810
 people that the guitar reaches you 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.280
 here and go to battle to put so 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.110
 I do not want to kill them either 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.950
 the introduction first parts of the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:34.199
 next form three more 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:34.199
 [Music] 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.800
 i 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.230
 this introduction and that's going to start the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.120
 first stanzas the song is super 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.580
 easy to touch the trattoria you from 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.620
 touch what would come to be the fourth the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.660
 fifth fourth third fourth fifth and 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.630
 sixth rope properly so that you 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.530
 make a style like that nice rocker is not 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.030
 practically the first part and this is 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.020
 will repeat the whole song that 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.190
 now let's go with what would come to 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.750
 be the precursor that goes after the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.880
 first introduction and first stanzas 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.170
 and in the following way super easy going 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.260
 finishing the first traces will end 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.260
 here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:20.650
 [Music] 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.090
 the choir is going to be the same 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.280
 chords that the introduction I told you 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.600
 then the pre chorus goes again that what 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 I will repeat one more time so that 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.620
 can grab will end the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.560
 first stanza introduction and here they go 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:43.230
 three 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.230
 [Music] 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:03.590
 and that's practically the whole song 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.510
 there is no more to see him they already saw all the 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.860
 chords to super easy to learn already 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.540
 you know you can touch the 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.250
 different ways that I recommend for 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.960
 be the rock style playing the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.870
 first the last four strings this 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.380
 fifth when you expect to give him 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.690
 [Music] 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.670
 one more detail also if it is so 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.820
 It makes them very difficult to put what 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.330
 would it be this one follows this flat 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.600
 here do it this is not this way the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.450
 problem is not going 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.480
 do what we say sound so that you 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.220
 can more or less grab the scheme of 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.990
 leave here not because I know they can 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.240
 many people can stay in this 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.440
 well that has been all for my part in 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.330
