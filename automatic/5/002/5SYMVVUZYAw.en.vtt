00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 After installing an SSD (also known as a solid state drive) into a new notebook or ultrabook, - 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Compared with traditional hard drives, there are many advantages, - 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Such as faster startup time and longer battery life. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 And it is very simple to install, the following is the operating instructions. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 There are some things to keep in mind before you start the installation. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 First of all, if you install a solid state drive in a new computer, it will be easy to install. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Just make sure you have the installation disk that came with your computer. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Otherwise, you will need to back up or clone the hard drive you are using. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 And before upgrading your computer components, it's a good idea to make sure your system BIOS is up to date. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Check the PC manufacturer's website before starting the installation. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Next, keep the work surface clean and allow yourself to touch the unpainted metal surface to ground yourself to prevent static damage to any parts. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Finally, in most cases, you only need to replace the hard drive in your notebook with a simple Phillips head screwdriver. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 But we found these sharp-nosed lice also useful. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 After the computer is turned off, remove the power adapter and battery. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And make sure that the computer releases all remaining power: After removing the battery, press the power button. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Find the location of your hard drive, usually at the bottom of your computer. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 If you can't find it, first check the computer manufacturer's website. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Now, unscrew the cover screw and remove the cover, you can see clearly 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Old hard drive in the computer. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Every system may vary. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Carefully remove the screws and even include the bracket (if you have a bracket like us), keep the hard drive in place. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Disconnect SATA and power connectors or cables, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 It is usually by sliding the hard disk away from the connector. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Then remove the hard drive from the computer and set it aside. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 When installing a new SSD, it is important to connect the SATA and power connectors securely. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 If the stand is used on your old hard drive, reconnect it to the new SSD first. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Slide the SSD into the hard drive bay and the hard drive and the bracket will fit snugly. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And screw it in place, close the cover and install the battery 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Now turn the computer over and turn on the power. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 You will hear an alarm indicating that there is no operating system. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Simply plug in the original installation disk that came with your computer and reboot again to boot from the CD-rom. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Follow the prompts to install the operating system and recover from backup. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 This is done. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
