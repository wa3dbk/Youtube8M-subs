00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.020 
prospect in the caribou and I'm in the
Hickson<00:00:09.240> area<00:00:09.769> I'm<00:00:10.769> sampling<00:00:11.400> off<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> couple

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
Hickson area I'm sampling off a couple

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.160 
Hickson area I'm sampling off a couple
creeks<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.960> run<00:00:13.380> into<00:00:13.740> each<00:00:13.980> other<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:15.170> what

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
creeks that run into each other and what

creeks that run into each other and what
you're<00:00:16.320> finding<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.830> couple<00:00:17.190> modes<00:00:17.430> Gould's

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
you're finding is a couple modes Gould's

finding some flat worn golds and some
coarse<00:00:23.130> gold<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:26.810> nuggety

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
coarse gold and you have some nuggety

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.479 
coarse gold and you have some nuggety
materials<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.830> quartz<00:00:30.859> things<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.070> look<00:00:32.189> for

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
materials and quartz things to look for

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.870 
materials and quartz things to look for
on<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> crete<00:00:33.860> are<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.070> different<00:00:35.460> types<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
on a crete are the different types of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.240 
on a crete are the different types of
gold

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
gold

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.590 
gold
obviously<00:00:38.250> there's<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.760> few<00:00:39.210> different<00:00:39.570> things

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
obviously there's a few different things

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.380 
obviously there's a few different things
happening<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.710> area<00:00:43.789> if<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.149> see

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
happening in this area if you can see

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.279 
happening in this area if you can see
very<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:47.149> when<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.360> flat<00:00:48.600> worn<00:00:48.960> goals

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
very well when you got flat worn goals

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
very well when you got flat worn goals
with<00:00:49.620> coarse<00:00:49.920> golds<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> same<00:00:50.789> area<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
with coarse golds in the same area it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.400 
with coarse golds in the same area it
tells<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> couple<00:00:52.110> different

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
tells you there's a couple different

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.119 
tells you there's a couple different
things<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.960> one's<00:00:54.960> traveled<00:00:55.590> farther

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
things going on one's traveled farther

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
things going on one's traveled farther
than<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.629> ones<00:00:58.020> closer

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
than the other and the other ones closer

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.630 
than the other and the other ones closer
to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> sources<00:01:00.680> things<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.949> keep<00:01:02.100> an<00:01:02.309> eye<00:01:02.430> out

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to the sources things to keep an eye out

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.929 
to the sources things to keep an eye out
for<00:01:03.379> when<00:01:04.379> you're<00:01:04.530> panning<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.189> where<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
for when you're panning is where you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.670 
for when you're panning is where you
find<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> where<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.110> ends<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> far

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
find it and where it ends so far

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
find it and where it ends so far
basically<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.070> machine<00:01:14.280> miner<00:01:14.790> I've

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
basically I'm not a machine miner I've

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.770 
basically I'm not a machine miner I've
been<00:01:15.930> pounding<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.770> sampling<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:18.119> area<00:01:18.479> by

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
been pounding and sampling the area by

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.260 
been pounding and sampling the area by
hand<00:01:20.119> which<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> lot<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.720> hard<00:01:21.840> labour<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:23.270> lot

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
hand which is a lot of hard labour a lot

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.710 
hand which is a lot of hard labour a lot
of<00:01:24.450> work<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:25.290> eventually<00:01:26.180> when<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> guy<00:01:27.450> gets

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of work but eventually when a guy gets

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.190 
of work but eventually when a guy gets
into<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.290> machine<00:01:28.710> operation<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.689> sampling

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
into the machine operation the sampling

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.120 
into the machine operation the sampling
will<00:01:31.380> pay<00:01:31.590> off<00:01:34.009> we<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:37.130> quartz

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
will pay off we also have the quartz

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.280 
will pay off we also have the quartz
Gold's<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.720> how<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.259> can

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
Gold's here you know how well you can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.660 
Gold's here you know how well you can
see<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
see this

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.100 
see this
you<00:01:43.300> can<00:01:43.510> see<00:01:43.720> we<00:01:43.960> have<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:45.840> couple<00:01:46.840> different

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
you can see we have a couple different

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.830 
you can see we have a couple different
kinds<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.890> courts<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:50.680> have<00:01:50.800> a<00:01:50.830> bluey<00:01:51.159> courts

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
kinds of courts you have a bluey courts

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.560 
kinds of courts you have a bluey courts
with<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.869> silver<00:01:53.580> iron<00:01:54.580> pirate<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:55.510> I'm

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
with a silver iron pirate so I'm

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.810 
with a silver iron pirate so I'm
assuming<00:01:55.900> of<00:01:56.530> some<00:01:56.860> nature<00:01:59.310> found<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.610> one

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
assuming of some nature found in one

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:10.670 
assuming of some nature found in one
area<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:06.940> have<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.479> more<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.610> iron

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
area and then we have a more of a iron

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.320 
area and then we have a more of a iron
rusty<00:02:11.680> looking<00:02:12.010> courts<00:02:12.430> as<00:02:12.760> carries<00:02:13.180> golds

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
rusty looking courts as carries golds

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.510 
rusty looking courts as carries golds
but<00:02:16.330> also<00:02:16.450> another<00:02:17.440> thing<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.310> keep

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
but also another thing to do is keep

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.000 
but also another thing to do is keep
track<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.330> courts<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.739> find

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
track of all the courts is that you find

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.030 
track of all the courts is that you find
on<00:02:21.250> your<00:02:21.280> creeks<00:02:22.350> even<00:02:23.350> if<00:02:23.440> they<00:02:23.560> don't<00:02:23.739> carry

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
on your creeks even if they don't carry

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.960 
on your creeks even if they don't carry
gold<00:02:24.310> because<00:02:24.880> gold<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.300> rare<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:27.550> it'll<00:02:27.880> help

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
gold because gold is rare but it'll help

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:38.150 
gold because gold is rare but it'll help
you<00:02:28.180> out<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:29.380> your<00:02:29.590> quest<00:02:29.860> for<00:02:30.160> gold

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.330 

some<00:02:38.820> not<00:02:39.450> bad<00:02:39.690> samples<00:02:40.350> like<00:02:41.130> say<00:02:41.400> box<00:02:42.300> work

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
some not bad samples like say box work

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.730 
some not bad samples like say box work
lots<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.490> fun
