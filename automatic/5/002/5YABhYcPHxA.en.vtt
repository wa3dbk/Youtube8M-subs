and<00:01:39.270> yellow<00:01:39.360> lightning<00:01:40.189> just<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and yellow lightning just like a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.569 
and yellow lightning just like a
previous<00:01:42.180> theory<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.930> had<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:44.100> far<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
previous theory that I had as far as the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.990 
previous theory that I had as far as the
regular<00:01:45.299> lightning<00:01:45.720> goes<00:01:45.930> um<00:01:46.939> originally<00:01:47.939> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
regular lightning goes um originally I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
regular lightning goes um originally I
thought<00:01:48.030> was<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:49.140> reverse<00:01:49.439> slashes<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:50.040> I

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
thought was to two reverse slashes but I

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
thought was to two reverse slashes but I
was<00:01:50.220> taught<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.509> believe

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
was taught about that and I do believe

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.620 
was taught about that and I do believe
Barry<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.470> thick<00:01:52.820> as<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.090> people<00:01:54.390> saying

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
Barry was thick as for the people saying

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.100 
Barry was thick as for the people saying
that<00:01:54.869> ja<00:01:55.799> Barry<00:01:56.610> stag<00:01:57.000> Henry<00:01:57.479> killer<00:01:57.750> just

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that ja Barry stag Henry killer just

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.440 
that ja Barry stag Henry killer just
what<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> hell<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> had<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.299> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
what the hell like I had that's a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.139 
what the hell like I had that's a
crackpot<00:02:00.719> theory<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:02.310> mean<00:02:02.640> entire<00:02:02.880> hearing

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
crackpot theory I mean entire hearing

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.719 
crackpot theory I mean entire hearing
that<00:02:03.360> theory<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.020> rude<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.469> yeah<00:02:05.430> so

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that theory not to be rude but yeah so

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.029 
that theory not to be rude but yeah so
he<00:02:06.450> goes<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> save<00:02:06.990> his<00:02:07.140> mom<00:02:07.350> they're<00:02:07.740> doing

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
he goes to save his mom they're doing

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.400 
he goes to save his mom they're doing
the<00:02:08.129> whole<00:02:08.280> run<00:02:09.000> around<00:02:09.330> he's<00:02:09.780> trying<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> kick

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the whole run around he's trying to kick

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.590 
the whole run around he's trying to kick
zooms<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.950> asking<00:02:11.310> all

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
zooms I asking all

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.980 
zooms I asking all
that<00:02:11.720> but<00:02:12.410> when<00:02:12.560> he<00:02:12.980> his<00:02:13.340> self<00:02:13.670> himself<00:02:14.600> comes

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
that but when he his self himself comes

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.330 
that but when he his self himself comes
downstairs<00:02:15.850> uh<00:02:16.850> he<00:02:17.480> knows<00:02:17.980> or<00:02:18.980> he<00:02:19.130> doesn't

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
downstairs uh he knows or he doesn't

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.100 
downstairs uh he knows or he doesn't
really<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.910> zoom<00:02:20.240> yeah<00:02:20.450> he<00:02:20.630> doesn't<00:02:20.960> really

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
really know zoom yeah he doesn't really

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.900 
really know zoom yeah he doesn't really
know<00:02:21.290> reverse<00:02:21.620> flash<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.340> he<00:02:22.490> doesn't<00:02:22.700> know

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
know reverse flash it so he doesn't know

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.050 
know reverse flash it so he doesn't know
that<00:02:22.970> reverse-flash<00:02:23.600> cannot<00:02:24.410> kill<00:02:24.740> Barry<00:02:25.060> he

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
that reverse-flash cannot kill Barry he

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.330 
that reverse-flash cannot kill Barry he
does<00:02:26.690> not<00:02:26.900> know<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.140> he<00:02:27.350> cannot<00:02:27.620> reverse

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
does not know that he cannot reverse

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.160 
does not know that he cannot reverse
flash<00:02:28.580> cannot<00:02:28.910> kill<00:02:29.120> him<00:02:29.360> because<00:02:30.020> without

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
flash cannot kill him because without

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.200 
flash cannot kill him because without
flash<00:02:30.650> there<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.340> no<00:02:31.520> reverse<00:02:31.820> flash<00:02:32.200> um<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.210> he

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
flash there is no reverse flash um so he

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.170 
flash there is no reverse flash um so he
tried<00:02:35.510> he<00:02:35.720> saves<00:02:35.990> himself<00:02:36.200> he<00:02:36.650> saves<00:02:37.180> himself

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
tried he saves himself he saves himself

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.410 
tried he saves himself he saves himself
I<00:02:38.840> know<00:02:39.830> how<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.100> makes<00:02:40.250> sense<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:41.120> sounds

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
I know how that makes sense that sounds

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.970 
I know how that makes sense that sounds
so<00:02:41.630> singer<00:02:42.020> now<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.380> say<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.590> out<00:02:42.740> loud<00:02:42.800> but

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
so singer now that I say it out loud but

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.670 
so singer now that I say it out loud but
still<00:02:43.430> text<00:02:43.670> probably<00:02:43.910> what<00:02:44.030> happens<00:02:44.360> he<00:02:44.990> well

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
still text probably what happens he well

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.500 
still text probably what happens he well
he<00:02:46.160> thinks<00:02:46.340> he's<00:02:46.550> fast<00:02:46.820> enough<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.330> save

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
he thinks he's fast enough to save

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.090 
he thinks he's fast enough to save
himself<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.080> run<00:02:48.170> back<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.530> when<00:02:48.710> he<00:02:48.830> saves

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
himself and run back so when he saves

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.520 
himself and run back so when he saves

himself and rinse back his mom is dead

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.610 
himself and rinse back his mom is dead
reverse<00:02:52.400> flash<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.940> done<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.360> deed<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
reverse flash is done the deed and the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.660 
reverse flash is done the deed and the
stacks<00:02:54.950> up<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:56.510> most<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:56.990> think<00:02:57.260> or

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
stacks up the most of you think or

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.280 
stacks up the most of you think or
probably<00:02:58.670> think<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.330> know<00:02:59.450> just<00:02:59.750> like<00:02:59.900> time

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
probably think you know just like time

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.440 
probably think you know just like time
travel<00:03:00.500> trying<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.100> save<00:03:01.280> his<00:03:01.430> mom<00:03:01.640> flashpoint

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
travel trying to save his mom flashpoint

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.200 
travel trying to save his mom flashpoint
they<00:03:03.050> cannot<00:03:03.440> do<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.860> yet<00:03:04.130> not<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:05.030> because

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
they cannot do that yet not just because

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.790 
they cannot do that yet not just because
they<00:03:05.510> can't<00:03:05.750> use<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.080> characters<00:03:06.560> but

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
they can't use the characters but

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.550 
they can't use the characters but
because<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.460> like<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.940> finale<00:03:08.660> season

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
because that is like a finale season

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.910 
because that is like a finale season
that's<00:03:10.100> like<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.550> last<00:03:11.450> story<00:03:12.140> arc<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.590> show

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
that's like a last story arc of the show

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
that's like a last story arc of the show
kind<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.910> story<00:03:14.410> because<00:03:15.610> there's<00:03:16.610> not<00:03:16.790> much

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
kind of story because there's not much

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.610 
kind of story because there's not much
you<00:03:16.970> can<00:03:17.180> do<00:03:17.360> after<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.990> resets<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
you can do after that it resets the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.860 
you can do after that it resets the
entire<00:03:18.950> universe<00:03:19.340> everything<00:03:20.060> go<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.540> becomes

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
entire universe everything go it becomes

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.560 
entire universe everything go it becomes
different<00:03:21.460> everything<00:03:22.460> becomes<00:03:22.760> everything

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
different everything becomes everything

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.440 
different everything becomes everything
else<00:03:23.780> it's<00:03:24.230> weird<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:25.220> like<00:03:25.370> how<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:26.270> real

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
else it's weird just like how the real

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.810 
else it's weird just like how the real
flashpoint<00:03:27.020> merged<00:03:27.410> three<00:03:28.220> universes

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
flashpoint merged three universes

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.480 
flashpoint merged three universes
together<00:03:29.320> they<00:03:30.320> really<00:03:30.860> couldn't<00:03:31.070> do<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.250> on

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
together they really couldn't do that on

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.980 
together they really couldn't do that on
the<00:03:31.580> show<00:03:31.730> because<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.150> would<00:03:32.360> involve<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
the show because I would involve the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.180 
the show because I would involve the
entire<00:03:33.110> show<00:03:33.830> restarting<00:03:34.580> so<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.420> last

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
entire show restarting so that is a last

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.420 
entire show restarting so that is a last
season<00:03:37.190> sort<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.910> park<00:03:38.740> now<00:03:39.740> do<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:40.190> hope
