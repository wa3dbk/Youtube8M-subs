00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 you always wonder where has 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.040
 liam neeson actually this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.040
 strange skills acquired 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello my film factory taken 3 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.940
 Comes to the cinemas and Liam Neeson has to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.780
 prove once again that he is the best 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.230
 is 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.060
 in short, a story about it too 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.470
 he is now very well again 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 with his daughter and also with his 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 ex-wife on we have got her playing 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 this yes and this is not more 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 together but they have a good one 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.090
 relationship and suddenly but will 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.590
 bryant is also attached to a murder 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 I want to belong to one person 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 now it does not spoil him very much 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.719
 is close and now he has to prove that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.890
 he of course has nothing to do with what 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.290
 difficult if it seems the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.329
 but the whole world against him is for what he has 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 he had two fists with them 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.289
 can beat a bit like the whole 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.289
 looks like we're separating there 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:00.470
 hey simi nice to see you is me 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.470
 and so it goes well 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.159
 I have the feeling she is as always 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.750
 was that not change 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:42.370
 with 21 23 to a special unit 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.550
 create accomplished 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.230
 explosives experts Tuesday of no 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.990
 discharge papers nothing 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.990
 this guy knows how to invisibly 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 His arm has been bad 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.250
 trust no one 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.200
 I have many things in my life 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.310
 and I was always the one 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 aware of the consequences 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:14.140
 i have to protect my family what 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.430
 You know, I know one of them all 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.709
 love will be dead soon 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.090
 what has priority for you inspector it is 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.590
 My job is to arrest you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.000
 For me, priority is the only one to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.000
 protect me that has remained 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.100
 what you up to 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.040
 I'll make you my hands if you 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.250
 go this way 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.250
 the fbi 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.020
 they will all hunt them 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.740
 you find 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.740
 and stop them 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.510
 good luck 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.150
 when movies the third round goes and 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.980
 actually the first time one 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.840
 movie has been quite similar has that 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.060
 all one before and one disadvantage though 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.040
 I have the same property as you 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.900
 do not expect big surprise 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.630
 But that's exactly what it does not get 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.560
 delivered so is tekken three 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.630
 rock solid action which is really good 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.270
 there have been some nice stagings 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.010
 choreographer and liam neeson is also 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.270
 pretty good actor too men 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.890
 somehow always felt that 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.580
 same plays because she a bit 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.350
 too bad 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.290
 But you definitely play it here 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.730
 more than on a solid level, however, 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.840
 as I already said there you can 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.150
 just now no big surprises 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.030
 more in the story as well as in the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.310
 the rest of the narration await here 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.470
 is just the most blatant type 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.720
 and in some places you think yourself 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.770
 also okay people so the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.420
 be a broker 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.340
 but what is that supposedly for one 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.980
 machine otherwise rather like this 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.270
 a bit cozier acts right 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.860
 It is not exciting but me 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.390
 think action fans have fun that 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.830
 to look and look exactly for that 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.330
 you look at the movie the counters three too 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.920
 if that's too solid now 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.660
 played it is above average 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.180
 cinema entertainment from the one just too 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.800
 Do not expect more than good 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.970
 filmed the whole way, too 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.260
 So you can really work there 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.420
 do not expose anything 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.400
 that fits everything and it all fits so well 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.420
 I can look at me but also 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.190
 no more that here is mine 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.510
 six out of ten points is one 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.370
 above average a key 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.010
 you can give yourself but you realize 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.280
 already that everything does not quite nice 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.380
 sore 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.940
 In addition, the did a few people 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.950
 But it would be quite enough to look at it 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.330
 nice six and ten points is so real 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.610
 All right, but who says now 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.380
 sobol yes alright that's enough for me though 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.730
 not what was actually the most blatant 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.040
 what you saw last year 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.710
 I'll just link that again 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.870
 best movies of the year 2014 and links 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.070
 which has become much funnier 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.720
 is the outback special 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.680
 that links here below right and then 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.140
 I hope to see you soon 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.850
 with a new film criticism here the 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.850
 film factory with me the domnick
