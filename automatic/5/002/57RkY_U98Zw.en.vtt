00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.840
 here we are going to pass the first step 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.000
 so here we are going to take our 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.310
 courage is that we cleaned up before we go 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 we do not peel the ball 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:39.420
 standing and we'll cut in half for the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.629
 we need only one corvette 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.030
 recalled the two parts entirely 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 so here we are projecting his rap and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 now we will go to the dough 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.820
 so here we go the preparation of the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.039
 pac 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:04.229
 so we put the flour broke the slot 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:06.290
 there is one mix is ​​poured the bag of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.290

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 and ended up pouring the water and we 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.190
 now we will pour the zucchini 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.190
 grated directly into the dough 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.460
 so here and then we are the age the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.929
 grated zucchini with the dough 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.710
 so we did not put a lot of water because 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:59.310
 that the big zucchini of the water needs 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.289
 of course the doses then we will add 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.970

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.530
 1 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.310

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.350
 part of our paw we cover with 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.130
 two purposes below this level 21 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.130
 absorbing then we will continue to put 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.180
 our won on it so shared for 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.800
