00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.760
 but I came wanting to see if in 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.510
 one in a big one and I hope it's this 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.000
 year was a stage and for that I come 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.650
 any of the 21 for me is special 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.920
 the case escapes me for an Italian 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.070
 Running the turn is always one thing 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.260
 fantastic and I have also won two stages 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.090
 two years ago for two years ago I 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.309
 feel another person because another rider 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.620
 but here confirm that I can do 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.489
 number like like this for two 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.000
 years again and contribute with the team 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.920
 help 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.540
 is that as a rock that can make a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.540
 good rating was lee 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.060
 if you can win another stage with me with 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.490
 another important team and I think 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.190
 that if I think the team 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.570
 one of the strongest inside the turn 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.660
 talking about the individual capacity of the 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.130
 runners likewise we have the man 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.730
 most important of the turnaround how could 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.880
 make the iron in the bullet but we have 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.980
 runners like beñat like me who can 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.020
 make a great classifies and many 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.300
 runners who can win stages and to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.090
 pop I hope to bring strength and 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.420
 help what can more than good the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.400
 main idea is to finish it but if it is 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.660
 the option of a stage or the mountain 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.810
 we will fight for very very strong fact very 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.720
 solid and very good fellowship a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.430
 greeting for all the people of colombia 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.030
 from here leave everything in the middle of the sea and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.460
 to the year 2013 not that so for me it was 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.580
 a very good year of a victory 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.560
 May day stage rose good 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.010
 historical saving for the same vizcaíno 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.160
 and for me 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.470
 I'm going to tell you, well, we are facing a 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.590
 career for my supervision before 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.840
 I have super motivated and good to see if 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.940
 we can repeat that good year he had 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.470
 two years ago good dreams are free and 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.420
 why 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 what happens you have to dream there is not always 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.340
 dreamed with 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.750
 a great return and good because it does not stop 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.480
 older but good you have to fight and 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.220
 suffer every day we counted this turn with 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 a lot of enthusiasm and I think that a team 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.269
 very combative and I think we 're going to 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.299
 treat the show and entertain 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.489
 all the people to be supporting 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.890
 serious that I wish I could repeat the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.140
 triumph that I believe has been the only 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.989
 professional and good that I have very un 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.340
 nice memory and good I think that 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.170
 They can also collaborate with 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.760
 companions and in the personal case I 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.380
 like to be able to get some stage 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.000
 but the truth that in the end 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.010
 it's a bit to go see a little the second 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.740
 week the week that are the ones 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.910
 really are the kings the getaways to 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.040
 Sometimes they arrive and I would like to take advantage 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.960
 some greetings to all costa rica for 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.940
 all support that they have given me and from here 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.190
 in italy it is to watch the departure of the director 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.380
 already pure vial good personally I hope 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.090
 I hope to give everything what hope 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.090
 I have and I will not have bad luck 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.069
 I hope the expectations come together 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.760
 to be able to give a good level as a team 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:29.140
 good image and if you see some victories 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.540
 Well, welcome, I would settle for 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.170
 result of making a good tournament a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.690
 competitive team would say I 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.270
 we have everything not fast people people 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.400
 like the cat people with the experience and 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.350
 who knows what it is to win here how 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.280
 visconti and as benítez 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.130
 knows what it is to win and do is to go 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.840
 leader and then young people like yesterday 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:00.790
 rubén jesús are people who are being 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.790
 strong that can contribute a lot too 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.340
 and also good 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.260
 I hope to go everything so low 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.390
 budinger your right is casual the truth 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.019
 that we did it with great enthusiasm and what 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.930
 We will give everything to take to Spain yes 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.510
 We will try to be as far ahead 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.820
 possible in these early stages and see 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.120
 how far can we go and if not good 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.820
 so rest and try to catch more than 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.490
 a leak and fight to form a cap and 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.000
 last year I was the first 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.380
 on the turn and well they say that this is more 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.199
 hard of doors but good as I said 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.199
 We will try to fight more badly one day
