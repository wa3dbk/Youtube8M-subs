00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.209
 hello very good to all subscribers 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.539
 of tv strips let's do the unboxing 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:18.070
 of nintendo 2 which is the new laptop 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:20.199
 recently presented to then see 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.630
 and we are going to do it not with the model in 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.279
 white but with the blue and black model 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.650
 are the two versions that will be at 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.520
 sale on October 12 along with pokemon 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.520
 x and with pokemon 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.030
 among all of that is practically the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.250
 same nintendo 3ds console is the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.590
 same family is a cheaper model 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.480
 that comes to play another part of the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.670
 market and that has as peculiarity 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.550
 after that it does not have 3d effect as it says 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.350
 the name and it is also a unique one 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 piece has to thank the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.690
 let's make a teacher this simple 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.520
 console that brings a part of the box 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.410
 with the components and on the other hand the 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.000
 instruction manual these points 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.670
 so that a left also cards 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 of real increased as had the other 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.000
 console 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 two 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.660
 the console has a case of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.050
 pretty thick plastic is not like the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.930
 foamed water cover that moves to 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.820
 three because it does not protect itself 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.980
 same because it has no doubles 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.110
 We need the cover because the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.510
 console and as you can see it is a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.480
 collection only piece pretty pretty 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.910
 thick has an uneven shape is more 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.980
 work and thicker up in the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.840
 back you can only find the 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.550
 two cameras in addition to this strip 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.580
 intermediate that gave it a different tone 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.590
 pretty cool a little Ionic for the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.810
 lateral you have for example here the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.030
 pencil with the sd card and in the part 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.229
 top you have the loading port and the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.229
 port for 3ds cards 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.620
 good as always the most important 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.510
 part ahead as you see the double 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.910
 screen that is also a screen with 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.330
 a plastic separator I remember it up 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.550
 It has 300 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.930
 and the buttons that have been configured 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 a little more towards the center of the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.740
 console so that they are better when playing 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.390
 with the top screen not so down there 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.620
 also compensated like the others 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.330
 portable 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.739
 and of course the camera above starting 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.739
 of personal photos and more 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.270
 as you see very fast very little 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.930
 elements that we teach as usual 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.460
 you will see in which subscribe for future 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.460
