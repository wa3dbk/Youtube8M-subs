00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.639
 now in the retro section we decided 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.900
 go to a location and we're in the museum 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.789
 of antiques at the fair 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.099
 international electronic computing 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.050
 in the city of mexico and we are 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.800
 with this brand portable micro 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.340
 Osbourne who came out in 1981 had a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 5 inch monitor used 64k ram 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.440
 and he had two units 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.070
 storage known 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.070
 floppy drives of 5 a quarter inches and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.480
 well you can see that the keyboard is very 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.910
 similar to a machine write to 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 make a portable mic is gigantic 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.640
 Weighed about 10 kilos and cost almost 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.640
 1800 dollars approximately 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.290
 there's another one that called our song a lot 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.170
 what is this portable neck you can see that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.840
 is much more evolved this went out to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.940
 mid 80's and good what has 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 the great feature is that the monitor 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.470
 you could bend a little the keyboard is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.360
 much bigger is that way it looks more 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 portable but nevertheless good 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 Weighed about 5 kilos, which is quite 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 portable compared to the others and the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 battery lasted 8 hours something curious 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.390
 it is also that it cost about two thousand 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 dollars and unlike the other one 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.190
 I already had some floppies I accepted or read 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.190
 3.5 inch diskette 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.190
 the ram memory of 256 kilobytes and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.960
 also your screen has a resolution 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:59.610
 640 x 200 quite curious to see how 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.040
 is this laptop from that time if it was 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.500
 much smaller 5 kilos images 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.500
 loading 5 kilos in a backpack is viable
