00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.829 
specs are i7 16 gigs of ram 760 m and
yeah<00:00:29.619> a<00:00:29.800> 7200<00:00:30.789> rpm<00:00:31.180> hard<00:00:31.210> drive<00:00:33.420> keep<00:00:34.420> in<00:00:34.570> mind

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
yeah a 7200 rpm hard drive keep in mind

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:38.250 
yeah a 7200 rpm hard drive keep in mind
this<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.559> extreme<00:00:36.129> preset<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.960> this<00:00:38.140> is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
this is the extreme preset so this is

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.009 
this is the extreme preset so this is
like<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.710> max<00:00:38.949> settings<00:00:39.489> pretty<00:00:40.000> much<00:00:40.239> I'm

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
like the max settings pretty much I'm

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.410 
like the max settings pretty much I'm
getting<00:00:41.140> about<00:00:42.329> 10<00:00:43.329> 15<00:00:43.769> 20<00:00:44.769> FPS<00:00:45.280> course<00:00:46.180> this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
getting about 10 15 20 FPS course this

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.200 
getting about 10 15 20 FPS course this
is<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.780> extreme<00:00:47.379> preset<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.430> this<00:00:49.059> is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
is the extreme preset and this is

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.759 
is the extreme preset and this is
rendering<00:00:49.629> using<00:00:50.019> a<00:00:51.510> geforce<00:00:52.510> gtx<00:00:53.050> 760<00:00:53.739> m<00:00:55.769> so

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
rendering using a geforce gtx 760 m so

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.770 
rendering using a geforce gtx 760 m so
long<00:00:56.980> story<00:00:57.219> short<00:00:57.640> this<00:00:57.820> is<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.000> highest<00:00:58.539> end

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
long story short this is the highest end

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.720 
long story short this is the highest end
one<00:00:59.109> basically<00:00:59.829> designed<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.340> push<00:01:00.550> the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
one basically designed to push the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.330 
one basically designed to push the
hardware<00:01:01.239> as<00:01:01.559> far<00:01:02.559> as<00:01:02.890> possible<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:05.340> of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
hardware as far as possible and of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.279 
hardware as far as possible and of
course<00:01:06.729> keep<00:01:07.240> in<00:01:07.360> mind<00:01:07.600> it's<00:01:07.840> running<00:01:08.170> at

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
course keep in mind it's running at

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.859 
course keep in mind it's running at
about<00:01:08.410> 30<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.340> 20<00:01:09.729> FPS<00:01:10.500> 1080p<00:01:11.500> i<00:01:12.009> think<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
about 30 to 20 FPS 1080p i think it's

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.730 
about 30 to 20 FPS 1080p i think it's
basically<00:01:14.759> not<00:01:15.759> too<00:01:16.179> unsurprising<00:01:17.140> for<00:01:17.500> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
basically not too unsurprising for the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
basically not too unsurprising for the
hardware

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.910 

I'm<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.690> run<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.930> test<00:01:22.140> again<00:01:22.350> though

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I'm going to run this test again though

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
I'm going to run this test again though
with<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:24.690> Intel<00:01:25.110> GPU<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.940> show<00:01:27.120> you<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.480> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with the Intel GPU to show you how it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.850 
with the Intel GPU to show you how it
runs<00:01:27.810> differently<00:01:29.330> graphics<00:01:30.330> says<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.860> gain

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
runs differently graphics says to gain

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
runs differently graphics says to gain
about<00:01:32.270> 11<00:01:33.270> frames<00:01:33.600> per<00:01:33.900> second<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.910> not<00:01:36.090> really

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
about 11 frames per second so not really

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
about 11 frames per second so not really
a<00:01:36.390> high<00:01:36.570> frame<00:01:36.930> rate<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:38.010> is<00:01:38.190> what<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
a high frame rate but this is what the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.200 
a high frame rate but this is what the
NVIDIA<00:01:38.790> GPU<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.390> now<00:01:39.480> it<00:01:39.660> jump<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.230> bit<00:01:40.440> but

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
NVIDIA GPU and now it jump up a bit but

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.720 
NVIDIA GPU and now it jump up a bit but
keep<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.390> mind<00:01:42.660> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.730> GTX<00:01:45.480> 760<00:01:46.080> m

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
keep in mind this is this is a GTX 760 m

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.100 
keep in mind this is this is a GTX 760 m
now<00:01:47.730> I'm<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.150> show<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.510> new<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
now I'm going to show you the new the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
now I'm going to show you the new the
Intel<00:01:49.530> GPU<00:01:50.190> afterwards<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.120> this<00:01:51.300> is<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
Intel GPU afterwards now this is a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.110 
Intel GPU afterwards now this is a
laptop<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.860> course<00:01:53.160> it's<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.000> as

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
laptop of course it's not going to be as

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.690 
laptop of course it's not going to be as
good<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.660> desktop<00:01:55.110> GPU<00:01:55.920> due<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.460> fact

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
good as a desktop GPU due to the fact

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.290 
good as a desktop GPU due to the fact
that<00:01:56.880> long<00:01:57.300> story<00:01:57.690> short<00:01:58.400> cooling<00:01:59.400> issues<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
that long story short cooling issues and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.450 
that long story short cooling issues and
voltage<00:02:01.020> issues<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.620> all<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> stuff<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.370> you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
voltage issues and all that stuff as you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.290 
voltage issues and all that stuff as you
can<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:03.350> I'm<00:02:04.350> getting<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.710> 20<00:02:05.340> 21<00:02:05.729> FPS

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
can see I'm getting about 20 21 FPS

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.530 
can see I'm getting about 20 21 FPS

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
how well this laptop fared when it was

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.380 
how well this laptop fared when it was
running<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.950> demo<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:17.550> keep<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.060> mind<00:02:18.090> I'm

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
running the demo now keep in mind I'm

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.280 
running the demo now keep in mind I'm
running<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.170> extreme<00:02:19.980> preset

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
running this with the extreme preset

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.680 
running this with the extreme preset
which<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.980> one<00:02:23.790> that's<00:02:23.970> supposed<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.420> push

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
which is the one that's supposed to push

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.649 
which is the one that's supposed to push
the<00:02:24.900> GPU<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.800> hardware<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.360> most

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.119 

of<00:02:33.959> course<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.379> can<00:02:34.499> even<00:02:34.650> see<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.010> low

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
of course you can even see the low

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.619 
of course you can even see the low
framerate<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.950> because<00:02:38.609> it's<00:02:38.999> that<00:02:39.180> well

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
framerate just because it's that well

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.020 
framerate just because it's that well
but<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:41.040> low<00:02:41.159> framerate<00:02:41.579> on

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
but you can see the low framerate on

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.050 
but you can see the low framerate on
camera<00:02:44.389> so<00:02:45.389> Nvidia<00:02:45.810> Optimus<00:02:46.370> let<00:02:47.370> me<00:02:47.609> choose

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
camera so Nvidia Optimus let me choose

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.770 
camera so Nvidia Optimus let me choose
which<00:02:48.540> GPU<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.349> wanted<00:02:49.859> either<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:51.060> integrated

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
which GPU I wanted either the integrated

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
test the second one because apparently

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.920 
test the second one because apparently
it's<00:03:15.760> buggy<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.480> crashes<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.660> found<00:03:22.660> out

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
it's buggy and crashes but I found out

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.980 
it's buggy and crashes but I found out

this game isn't one of those games such

games that I mean I'm just using Christ

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.360 
games that I mean I'm just using Christ
as<00:04:47.230> an<00:04:47.350> example<00:04:47.890> but<00:04:47.980> here's<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.220> better

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
as an example but here's a better

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.180 
as an example but here's a better
example<00:04:48.730> something<00:04:49.060> like<00:04:49.210> bf4<00:04:49.980> I'm<00:04:50.980> just

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
example something like bf4 I'm just

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.740 
example something like bf4 I'm just
going<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.430> assume<00:04:51.820> you're<00:04:52.090> not<00:04:52.120> using

going to assume you're not using

going to assume you're not using
something<00:04:53.020> like<00:04:53.169> bf4<00:04:54.040> is<00:04:54.520> an<00:04:54.940> example<00:04:55.270> because

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
something like bf4 is an example because

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.620 
something like bf4 is an example because
if<00:04:55.900> you're<00:04:56.050> using<00:04:56.080> bf4<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:57.100> would<00:04:57.280> really<00:04:57.730> be

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
if you're using bf4 that would really be

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.770 
if you're using bf4 that would really be
hard<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:59.050> play<00:04:59.260> on<00:04:59.410> this<00:04:59.500> GPU<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:01.419> fact<00:05:01.630> I

see<00:05:14.060> if<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:15.199> game<00:05:15.590> on<00:05:15.860> an<00:05:15.979> Intel<00:05:16.400> GPU<00:05:17.150> this<00:05:18.139> is

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
see if you game on an Intel GPU this is

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.670 
see if you game on an Intel GPU this is
how<00:05:18.590> many<00:05:19.010> games<00:05:19.430> are<00:05:19.820> going<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.150> look<00:05:20.360> like

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
how many games are going to look like

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.200 
how many games are going to look like
and<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:22.040> why<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:22.280> should<00:05:22.699> never<00:05:23.030> ever

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
and this is why you should never ever

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.710 
and this is why you should never ever
use<00:05:24.400> integrated<00:05:25.400> graphics<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.910> mean<00:05:26.060> see<00:05:26.630> how

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
use integrated graphics I mean see how

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.030 
use integrated graphics I mean see how

better<00:06:29.450> than<00:06:30.410> the<00:06:30.560> Intel<00:06:30.979> GPU<00:06:31.520> which<00:06:31.940> can<00:06:32.240> even

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
better than the Intel GPU which can even

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.529 
better than the Intel GPU which can even
keep<00:06:32.930> up<00:06:33.229> with<00:06:34.160> this<00:06:34.330> game
