actual sport
will<00:02:27.350> be<00:02:27.500> deaf<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:27.920> if<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.070> spawn<00:02:28.400> them<00:02:28.550> as<00:02:28.940> you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
will be deaf so if I spawn them as you

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.940 
will be deaf so if I spawn them as you
can<00:02:29.210> see<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.600> have<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> derp<00:02:30.110> where<00:02:30.830> are<00:02:30.890> you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
can see we have a derp where are you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.520 
can see we have a derp where are you
going<00:02:30.980> mr.<00:02:31.460> derp<00:02:31.730> now<00:02:32.690> then<00:02:32.840> you've<00:02:32.960> downside

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
going mr. derp now then you've downside

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.900 
going mr. derp now then you've downside
to<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.860> if<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.130> have<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.280> spawn<00:02:34.580> egg<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
to this is if you have a spawn egg and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.730 
to this is if you have a spawn egg and
then<00:02:34.970> if<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.210> go<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.390> rename<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.320> believe

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
then if you go to rename it I believe

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.100 
then if you go to rename it I believe
this<00:02:36.950> does<00:02:37.160> not<00:02:37.340> work<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.570> as<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.720> can<00:02:38.840> see

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
this does not work and so as you can see

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.320 
this does not work and so as you can see
the<00:02:39.260> actual<00:02:39.380> crapped<00:02:39.830> out<00:02:40.040> crafting<00:02:40.790> out<00:02:40.970> is

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
the actual crapped out crafting out is

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.950 
the actual crapped out crafting out is
no<00:02:41.630> no<00:02:42.290> nothing<00:02:42.650> here<00:02:42.860> at<00:02:42.890> all<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.460> so<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.750> guess

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
no no nothing here at all and so I guess

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.270 
no no nothing here at all and so I guess
it<00:02:45.170> will<00:02:45.260> take<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> few<00:02:45.620> times<00:02:45.890> especially

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
it will take you a few times especially

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.650 
it will take you a few times especially
if<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.580> want<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> whole<00:02:47.180> list<00:02:47.480> of
