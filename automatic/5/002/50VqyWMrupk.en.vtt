00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.930 
tried doing the same thing before and
didn't<00:02:31.600> work<00:02:31.780> anyway<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.889> that's<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
didn't work anyway so that's the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.120 
didn't work anyway so that's the
building<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.450> do<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:35.319> chuck<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.709> two<00:02:35.920> eggs

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
building you do you chuck the two eggs

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.590 
building you do you chuck the two eggs
in<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.530> chickens<00:02:39.329> now<00:02:40.329> what<00:02:40.510> you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
in and you get chickens now what you

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.890 
in and you get chickens now what you
want<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> do<00:02:40.959> after<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:42.780> probably<00:02:43.780> not

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
want to do after that is probably not

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.180 
want to do after that is probably not
the<00:02:43.959> best<00:02:44.049> idea<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.739> on<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:44.920> sand

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the best idea to do it on the sand

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.580 
the best idea to do it on the sand
because<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.450> know<00:02:46.540> Stan's<00:02:47.049> affected<00:02:47.470> by

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
because you know Stan's affected by

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.300 
because you know Stan's affected by
gravity<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:51.250> take<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.760> down<00:02:51.880> like<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.420> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
gravity but take it down like this and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.309 
gravity but take it down like this and
this<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.370> where<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.030> collect<00:02:55.859> your<00:02:57.989> eggs<00:02:58.989> and

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
this is where you collect your eggs and

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.979 
this is where you collect your eggs and
then<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.430> go<00:03:00.579> up<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.970> place<00:03:01.510> your<00:03:01.810> eggs

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
then you can go up and place your eggs

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.680 
then you can go up and place your eggs
in<00:03:02.260> there<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.069> can<00:03:03.340> keep<00:03:03.700> them<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.150> use

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
in there or you can keep them and use

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.589 
in there or you can keep them and use
them<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.900> cakes<00:03:07.650> now<00:03:08.940> hopefully<00:03:09.940> we'll<00:03:10.480> get

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
them in cakes now hopefully we'll get

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.210 
them in cakes now hopefully we'll get
another<00:03:10.870> egg<00:03:11.079> by<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.290> end<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.739> video<00:03:11.859> but

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
another egg by the end of the video but

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.819 
another egg by the end of the video but
also<00:03:12.489> i'm<00:03:13.060> going<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.329> try<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.630> go<00:03:13.810> mining<00:03:14.169> for

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
also i'm going to try and go mining for

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.250 
also i'm going to try and go mining for
some<00:03:15.340> redstone<00:03:15.630> now<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.660> need<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.930> red<00:03:17.079> stone

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
some redstone now I need the red stone

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.740 
some redstone now I need the red stone
for<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.590> dispensers<00:03:18.340> which<00:03:19.329> I'm<00:03:19.540> going<00:03:19.690> to

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
for the dispensers which I'm going to

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.740 
for the dispensers which I'm going to
have<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.169> the<00:03:20.319> hub<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:21.389> don't<00:03:22.389> know<00:03:22.450> where<00:03:22.630> I'm

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
have in the hub I don't know where I'm

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.819 
have in the hub I don't know where I'm
going<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.989> get<00:03:23.139> the<00:03:23.849> red<00:03:24.849> stoughton<00:03:25.449> frog

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
going to get the red stoughton frog

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.730 
going to get the red stoughton frog
probably<00:03:26.829> deep<00:03:26.979> underground<00:03:27.509> axe

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
probably deep underground axe

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.920 
probably deep underground axe
he's<00:03:29.010> like<00:03:29.190> chicken<00:03:29.760> no<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.330> did<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.870> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
he's like chicken no I did have a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.540 
he's like chicken no I did have a
chicken<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:31.740> I<00:03:31.950> think<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.430> might

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
chicken in there but I think it might

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.570 
chicken in there but I think it might
have<00:03:32.670> died<00:03:32.880> or<00:03:33.860> possibly<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:34.950> disappeared

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
have died or possibly just disappeared

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.840 
have died or possibly just disappeared
if<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.510> go<00:03:36.660> i<00:03:36.690> think<00:03:37.080> it's<00:03:37.200> 32<00:03:37.680> blocks<00:03:37.950> yeah

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
if you go i think it's 32 blocks yeah

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.710 
if you go i think it's 32 blocks yeah
thirty<00:03:39.150> two<00:03:39.360> blocks<00:03:39.630> away<00:03:39.840> from<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:41.720> mobs

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
thirty two blocks away from the mobs

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.560 
thirty two blocks away from the mobs
they<00:03:43.560> vanish<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:47.190> what<00:03:47.400> I'm<00:03:47.520> gonna<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:47.910> I'll

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
they vanish so what I'm gonna do I'll

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.890 
they vanish so what I'm gonna do I'll
come<00:03:48.990> back<00:03:49.340> when<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.400> find<00:03:50.970> an<00:03:51.120> egg<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.660> i'll

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
come back when I find an egg and i'll

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.780 
come back when I find an egg and i'll
try<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.680> show<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.270> how<00:03:54.270> this<00:03:54.450> machine<00:03:55.110> works

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
try to show you how this machine works

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.980 
try to show you how this machine works
because<00:03:56.790> it'd<00:03:57.000> be<00:03:57.150> better<00:03:57.300> if<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.570> saw<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.870> how

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
because it'd be better if you saw it how

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.150 
because it'd be better if you saw it how
it<00:03:58.080> works<00:03:58.230> otherwise<00:03:58.440> you'll<00:03:58.770> be<00:03:58.800> like<00:03:58.950> he's

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
it works otherwise you'll be like he's

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.570 
it works otherwise you'll be like he's
lying<00:03:59.490> he's<00:03:59.850> trolling<00:04:00.180> me<00:04:00.740> so<00:04:01.740> i'll<00:04:02.280> be<00:04:02.400> back<00:04:02.520> a
