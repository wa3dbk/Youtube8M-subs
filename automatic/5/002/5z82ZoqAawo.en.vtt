moving out of time while they travel in
time<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.830> we<00:02:15.040> left<00:02:15.310> those<00:02:15.550> long<00:02:15.910> enough<00:02:16.210> they

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
time if we left those long enough they

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.720 
time if we left those long enough they
would<00:02:16.810> eventually<00:02:16.960> get<00:02:17.320> back<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.950> time<00:02:18.310> but

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
would eventually get back in time but

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.480 
would eventually get back in time but
then<00:02:18.910> they<00:02:19.030> would<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.330> out<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.570> time<00:02:20.050> again<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
then they would be out of time again the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.640 
then they would be out of time again the
only<00:02:21.730> way<00:02:21.880> we<00:02:22.150> can<00:02:22.300> make<00:02:22.570> sure<00:02:22.600> they<00:02:23.020> stay<00:02:23.350> in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
only way we can make sure they stay in

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.160 
only way we can make sure they stay in
time<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:25.120> bring<00:02:25.360> them<00:02:25.510> both<00:02:25.690> up<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
time is to bring them both up to the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.620 
time is to bring them both up to the
same<00:02:26.350> bpm<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.580> if<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.790> want<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:28.210> I<00:02:28.360> can

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
same bpm I can if I want to I can

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.190 
same bpm I can if I want to I can
increase<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.830> BPM<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:31.330> Z's<00:02:31.720> project

increase the BPM of the Z's project
track<00:02:32.440> or<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.740> can<00:02:33.340> decrease<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.450> tottery

going to do for this demonstration I'm
going<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.570> increase<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.440> Z's<00:02:59.709> project<00:03:00.220> use

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
going to increase the Z's project use

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.550 
going to increase the Z's project use
the<00:03:01.180> pitch<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.690> I'm<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.110> move<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
the pitch and I'm going to move the

the pitch and I'm going to move the
pitch<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:03.010> bring<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.670> towards<00:03:04.330> me<00:03:04.650> making

pitch and bring that towards me making

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.390 
pitch and bring that towards me making
note<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.420> BPM<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.770> one<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.100> six

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
note of the BPM it's going to one to six

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.780

point six seven eight nine one two seven
that's<00:03:13.209> too<00:03:13.450> fast<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.989> need<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.320> bring<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> down

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
that's too fast I need to bring it down

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.180 
that's too fast I need to bring it down
to<00:03:15.100> one<00:03:15.640> two<00:03:15.880> six<00:03:18.959> it's<00:03:19.959> now<00:03:20.230> at<00:03:20.410> one<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.830> six

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
to one two six it's now at one to six

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.750 
to one two six it's now at one to six
also<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.360> can<00:03:23.230> see<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:24.010> I've<00:03:24.130> increased<00:03:24.519> the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
also I can see that I've increased the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.870 
also I can see that I've increased the
pitch<00:03:25.030> by<00:03:25.630> zero<00:03:26.200> point<00:03:26.650> eighty<00:03:26.950> percent<00:03:27.640> I'm

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
pitch by zero point eighty percent I'm

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.090 
pitch by zero point eighty percent I'm
now<00:03:28.420> going<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.900> exactly<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.620> same<00:03:29.650> thing

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
now going to do exactly the same thing

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.280 
now going to do exactly the same thing
I'm<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.670> press<00:03:30.910> play<00:03:30.940> on<00:03:31.420> both<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:32.140> them

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
I'm going to press play on both of them

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.650 
I'm going to press play on both of them
at<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.560> same<00:03:32.590> time<00:03:33.010> here<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.310> go<00:03:33.510> volume<00:03:34.510> up

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
at the same time here we go volume up

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:52.220 
at the same time here we go volume up
and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.839 

even<00:03:53.230> with<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.440> small<00:03:53.769> demonstration<00:03:54.580> we

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
even with that small demonstration we

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.880 
even with that small demonstration we
heard<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.690> beats<00:03:55.930> did<00:03:56.230> not<00:03:56.410> go<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.650> of

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
heard that the beats did not go out of

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.610 
heard that the beats did not go out of
time<00:03:57.160> now<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.790> isn't<00:03:58.209> really<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:59.019> simple

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
time now it isn't really that simple

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.970 
time now it isn't really that simple
because<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.220> lot<00:04:00.610> of<00:04:00.640> other<00:04:01.060> kit<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:02.650> as

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
because a lot of other kit is not as

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.899 
because a lot of other kit is not as
good<00:04:03.370> as<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:04.239> CDJ<00:04:04.750> 2000<00:04:05.410> Nexus<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:06.280> will<00:04:06.519> find

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
good as the CDJ 2000 Nexus you will find

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.809 
good as the CDJ 2000 Nexus you will find
with<00:04:07.269> cheaper<00:04:07.840> gear<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.709> beats<00:04:08.950> may<00:04:09.459> slightly

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
with cheaper gear the beats may slightly

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.630 
with cheaper gear the beats may slightly
go<00:04:10.090> off<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.930> BPM<00:04:11.440> readouts<00:04:11.950> need<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.519> be

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
go off and the BPM readouts need to be

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.560 
go off and the BPM readouts need to be
used<00:04:12.879> just<00:04:13.360> as<00:04:13.569> a<00:04:13.959> reference<00:04:14.709> I'm<00:04:14.980> going<00:04:15.879> to<00:04:16.030> do

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
used just as a reference I'm going to do

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.479 
used just as a reference I'm going to do
exactly<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.289> same<00:04:17.470> thing<00:04:17.769> now<00:04:17.979> the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
exactly the same thing now the

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.599 
exactly the same thing now the
difference<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.090> I'm<00:04:19.299> going<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.900> put<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:21.220> pitch

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
difference is I'm going to put the pitch

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.960 
difference is I'm going to put the pitch
back<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> center<00:04:23.050> point<00:04:23.260> on<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:24.580> Z's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
back to the center point on the Z's

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.120 
back to the center point on the Z's
project<00:04:25.479> so<00:04:25.780> we're<00:04:25.930> now<00:04:26.050> back<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.289> one<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.770> five

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
project so we're now back to one to five

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.689 
project so we're now back to one to five
are<00:04:27.630> now<00:04:28.630> going<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.050> reduce<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.070> speed<00:04:30.310> of
