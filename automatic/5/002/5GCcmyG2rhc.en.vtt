00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
at all whatsoever and I've actually

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
at all whatsoever and I've actually
already<00:00:31.410> done<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.769> week<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.309> challenge

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
already done a week of this challenge

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.549 
already done a week of this challenge
myself<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.480> after<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> first<00:00:34.079> week<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
myself but after the first week I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.990 
myself but after the first week I
thought<00:00:34.710> it'd<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.070> fun<00:00:35.460> idea<00:00:35.489> just

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
thought it'd be a really fun idea just

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.940 
thought it'd be a really fun idea just
to<00:00:36.149> get<00:00:36.300> everyone<00:00:36.840> else<00:00:37.050> involved<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.920> I

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
to get everyone else involved so I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
to get everyone else involved so I
thought<00:00:38.219> I'd<00:00:38.399> make<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> blog<00:00:38.850> post<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
thought I'd make a blog post about it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049 
thought I'd make a blog post about it
and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.559> after<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> got<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> quite<00:00:42.000> good

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and then after that I got a quite good

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
and then after that I got a quite good
response<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.020> lot<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> people<00:00:43.440> wanted<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
response and a lot of people wanted to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
response and a lot of people wanted to
do<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:43.980> me<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.430> thought<00:00:44.640> why<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.239> make

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
do it with me so I thought why not make

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
do it with me so I thought why not make
a<00:00:45.570> video<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:46.200> about<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.800> tell<00:00:47.039> everyone

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a video all about it and tell everyone

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
a video all about it and tell everyone
because<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.030> lot<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.570> follow<00:00:48.899> my

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
because a lot of you don't follow my

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
because a lot of you don't follow my
blog<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.530> thought<00:00:49.770> I'd<00:00:49.920> make<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> video<00:00:50.250> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
blog so I thought I'd make a video just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.250 
blog so I thought I'd make a video just
telling<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> challenge<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
telling you about the challenge and so

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
telling you about the challenge and so
then<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.430> well<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.090> we

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
then if you want to do it as well and we

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.700 
then if you want to do it as well and we
can<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.690> together<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.559> give

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
can all do it together and just give

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.229 
can all do it together and just give
each<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:55.920> moral<00:00:56.250> support<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.640> guess<00:00:56.820> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
each other moral support I guess so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.639 
each other moral support I guess so
basically<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.690> haven't<00:00:58.260> been<00:00:58.350> doing<00:00:58.469> anything

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
basically I haven't been doing anything

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.099 
basically I haven't been doing anything
to<00:00:58.920> my<00:00:59.100> hair<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.730> leaving<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> natural<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to my hair and leaving it natural and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
to my hair and leaving it natural and
that<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.070> whole<00:01:02.250> reason<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.760> came

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that is because the whole reason I came

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.490 
that is because the whole reason I came
up<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.300> challenge<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.470> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
up with this challenge was because I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
up with this challenge was because I
wanted<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.420> really<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:06.720> hair<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:06.990> better

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
wanted to really get my hair in better

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.660 
wanted to really get my hair in better
condition<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> lot<00:01:08.460> healthier

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
condition because it's a lot healthier

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.000 
condition because it's a lot healthier
basically<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> second<00:01:10.140> reason<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
basically and then the second reason and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160 
basically and then the second reason and
this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> main<00:01:11.580> reason<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.869> really

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

of<00:01:28.979> concept<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.759> leaving<00:01:29.880> her<00:01:30.150> hair

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of concept with just leaving her hair

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.080 
of concept with just leaving her hair
natural<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> couple<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.500> months<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
natural for a couple of months and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.490 
natural for a couple of months and
within<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.329> space<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:33.840> four<00:01:34.290> months

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
within the space of about four months

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.280 
within the space of about four months
her<00:01:34.890> head<00:01:35.159> grown<00:01:35.549> probably<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.090> six<00:01:36.750> inches

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
her head grown probably about six inches

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.219 
her head grown probably about six inches
it<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.250> crazy<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.659> thought<00:01:40.049> I'd

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it was just crazy so and I thought I'd

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.560 
it was just crazy so and I thought I'd
take<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> baby<00:01:40.680> step<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.329> month

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
take a baby step and just do one month

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.020 
take a baby step and just do one month
of<00:01:42.869> fur<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.189> even<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.579> do<00:01:44.729> one

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
of fur and see if I can even just do one

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.899 
of fur and see if I can even just do one
month<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:45.979> once<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.070> month<00:01:47.340> completed

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
month and then once that month completed

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
month and then once that month completed
just<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.720> how<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.229> hair<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.470> looking<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.979> it
