00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.769
 the igas give in to people do not find any 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.420
 the video so today as wanted 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.860
 by seeing these guys on call of duty 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.120
 ghost so I immediately wanted 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.980
 show so first I want to you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480
 to say that I've changed them since 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.500
 last time since I believe that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.029
 it was late December 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 and so I thought why not 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.330
 wanted to share for that was enormously 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.010
 asked that you do but a new 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.150
 class because people who fall 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.310
 online content often asks me 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.880
 what are your classes and well I 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.920
 will do now 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.380
 so already scared that I'm prestige 10 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180
 soon max level no character 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.250
 is called who means hi in English 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.270
 even or hello like ball vote like 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.430
 you want to interpret but rather 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.079
 so lights up so this one this is the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.399
 class at mile 1 to the mavericks already 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.719
 so the new sniper I made two 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.460
 to the mavericks so class a little 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.320
 little different so the first 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.680
 I use with researchers big capes 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.670
 and I go north so that's cool I 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.910
 want to tell you that I do not have 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.440
 what's it called that I do not have 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.329
 relieved stable since I like 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.809
 I just do not like the normal zoom of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.670
 mahb rich 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.290
 then I play with the paralyzing 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.430
 because it's very very useful in this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.930
 play especially when they play against 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.200
 very hard 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.220
 then I use gilly your bemba radio 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.720
 Okra 10 in France 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.840
 so it's just as much to the left 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.070
 then I use agility I use the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.619
 cough that allows us to aim faster 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.759
 for quick scope m I use silence of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.200
 death is also focus that means ah 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.340
 good this is the asset that allows us that the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 sniper do not go to the balls and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.540
 every time so it's a whole rather 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.799
 useful and then I use I do not know 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.990
 why I went to see justice and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.340
 mayor specialists aulas I mean if 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 sometimes I said support I use 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.380
 assad like the jackets and the oracle so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.430
 it can be quite useful especially as soon as 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.479
 you have big salaries across the way like 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.310
 I often say that political gestures 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.259
 can be helpful but as soon as I counted 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.280
 to saip in front of me I avoid putting the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.259
 ballistic buttocks because I find 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.060
 it is simply anti game 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.590
 so then I'll go to class 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.600
 from these maclas to the mavericks 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.180
 so this time I want what I'm not going 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.380
 better then we'll put it right now 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.020
 with large cape charger had the same 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.119
 assets except that instead of taking 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.680
 dead silence I took to a class 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.880
 in paralyzing tiff because there is 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.799
 a lot of enemies who like to play 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.039
 the pageantry on this game so suddenly 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.110
 when I have a Caribbean class per year 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.300
 then I have a class of his own 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.830
 Silent serves really a very very 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.320
 good sniper silence humans after this 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.520
 patch so frozen in gold at the top that I have 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.290
 all snipers north i want to say it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.340
 so I play with exactly the same 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.920
 dates and where I had it on mac 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.330
 first class to the mavericks so with 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.670
 dead silence and otherwise the docks 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.570
 Strictly his are the same I play 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.550
 always with the same ones who are laughing 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.540
 when you can see the next 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.280
 classified that it has 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.020
 different with each other so this one 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.250
 already he has no silent and I use 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.530
 patience of death because my goal is 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.459
 not to be discreet I use the cough that 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.770
 allow me to be resistant to 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.270
 stun grenades and flash so that 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.709
 can be very very helpful when I say 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.870
 that we pick up ard and that you play 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.880
 ufr then i'm with a class 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.650
 that links all basic to the thermal 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.940
 so with deathly silence because you 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.370
 it allows you to move more 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.510
 gently to 100 without forgiveness that the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.950
 seniors can hear you so that's 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.840
 really a very handy thing about this 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.220
 especially when you know the noise of 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.140
 not on this game that are very very useful 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.250
 when the enemies have helmets then 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.450
 always and even of everything so that's 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.880
 exactly the same class as the others 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.830
 with deathly silence and my last 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.180
 class my favorite class of which besides 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.060
 stayed until the end because there will be 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.230
 a bonus you will cry for me from 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.970
 eat you you're so disgusted 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.510
 back and pure you will see site of 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.150
 what am I talking about 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.610
 So it is a class or so for pid 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.739
 rainbow challenge so links with the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.480
 thermal and loads large capes with 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.530
 the maverick in secondary so less by 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.510
 sow as soon as I go to classes 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.459
 rainbow I started that the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.810
 maverick and then all inks but I 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.830
 prefers to put the links in secondary seen 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.110
 that I prefer to put more things on 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.180
 the links and saw that on maverick I have not 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.040
 all one thing then we all 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.239
 use touques in that allows you 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.400
 to have two snipers and for them 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.660
 exchanges and very quickly then 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.580
 I use the cough that allow you to 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.100
 quick scope and of course the asset 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.269
 king that lets you not that your 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.260
 sniper do not go in h ball and 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.440
 when you do touch so do not 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.430
 not in the sky every time and at 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.040
 volcano that allows you to have two 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.810
 snipers or two years old and then 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.130
 good in this case I have two snipers and 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.290
 then I had to use the bonuses 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.870
 specialists for having reduced because 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.010
 otherwise if you want I can not 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.120
 run as soon as I did a run that 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.290
 takes time targeted so both 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.760
 first who they are pretty galley to 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.230
 do it but then as soon as you have it 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.840
 of hectares and devil it's good all 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.820
 go well then I put to keep 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.900
 his pass then goes on 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.000
 third to all specialists 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.979
 I use touques and against 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.400
 stun grenades and flashes so 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.990
 so much better 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.430
 and then I put assets a 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.009
 little at the ball so I put to 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.800
 what's called the solid aim is going the 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.699
 look no also that allows me to 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.139
 use another asset that me 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.120
 make it easier to resist 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.509
 grenades so it can be very 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.340
 useful 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.500
 I use here it is he who allows me to 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.940
 recover damage faster 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.770
 which ksar generates my health more 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.990
 quickly and determination in case I 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.280
 could even with two snipers so on 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.570
 these are just about every case 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.190
 do not hesitate to stay until the end 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.199
 because you're going to see this bonus that 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.610
 do it really good while waiting for them 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.020
 guys do not hesitate to drop a like a 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.180
 comment it's super fun 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.530
 nesta flat to share the video that can 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.300
 help other people especially when 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.860
 the ghost writer classes is called the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.940
 world so guys were waters 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.940
 alibay everyone
