00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.490 

Thomas<00:00:22.699> was<00:00:23.240> like<00:00:23.539> when<00:00:23.720> he<00:00:23.750> had<00:00:24.080> only<00:00:24.289> had<00:00:24.380> a

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
Thomas was like when he had only had a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.189 
Thomas was like when he had only had a
few<00:00:24.770> kind<00:00:25.070> of<00:00:25.130> stipulations<00:00:25.869> and<00:00:26.869> one<00:00:27.019> of<00:00:27.080> them

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
few kind of stipulations and one of them

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.480 
few kind of stipulations and one of them
was<00:00:27.320> like<00:00:27.439> ghazal<00:00:27.800> has<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.100> fight<00:00:28.250> something

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
was like ghazal has to fight something

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.240 
was like ghazal has to fight something
it<00:00:29.210> had<00:00:29.359> to<00:00:29.449> be<00:00:29.570> multiple<00:00:30.050> creatures<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.800> we

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
it had to be multiple creatures and we

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.920 
it had to be multiple creatures and we
want<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.609> make<00:00:31.760> sure<00:00:31.789> that<00:00:32.239> they<00:00:32.390> worked<00:00:32.660> in

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
want to make sure that they worked in

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.920 
want to make sure that they worked in
tandem<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.129> this<00:00:34.309> ecosystem<00:00:34.879> that<00:00:35.720> this

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
tandem and that this ecosystem that this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.680 
tandem and that this ecosystem that this
sort<00:00:36.199> of<00:00:36.290> relationship<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.699> Godzilla<00:00:38.420> and

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
sort of relationship that Godzilla and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.780 
sort of relationship that Godzilla and
these<00:00:38.960> creatures<00:00:39.199> had<00:00:39.559> was<00:00:39.799> ancient<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.400> then

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
these creatures had was ancient and then

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.299 
these creatures had was ancient and then
we<00:00:41.000> wanted<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.479> design<00:00:41.839> to<00:00:42.620> be<00:00:42.820> different

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.700 

the<00:00:47.940> idea<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.079> kind<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> all

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the idea is that we kind of look to all

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
the idea is that we kind of look to all
the<00:00:49.829> creatures<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> monsters<00:00:51.120> had<00:00:51.239> never

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the creatures and the monsters had never

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.400 
the creatures and the monsters had never
been<00:00:51.480> designed<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> other<00:00:52.110> Godzilla

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
been designed in the other Godzilla

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.470 
been designed in the other Godzilla
movies<00:00:52.769> and<00:00:53.039> try<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> serious

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
movies and try to make a serious

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
movies and try to make a serious
realistic<00:00:55.110> version<00:00:55.290> combine<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:55.980> one

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
realistic version combine them in one

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
realistic version combine them in one
thing<00:01:02.089> very<00:01:03.089> familiar<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> other

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
thing very familiar with the other

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.210 
thing very familiar with the other
creatures<00:01:04.259> from<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> other<00:01:04.589> Godzilla<00:01:04.920> movies

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
creatures from the other Godzilla movies

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.680 
creatures from the other Godzilla movies
and<00:01:05.399> we<00:01:05.460> wanted<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> invent<00:01:05.940> something<00:01:06.240> new

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
and we wanted to invent something new

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.840 
and we wanted to invent something new
for<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> audience<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.100> call<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> Muto's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
for the audience what we call the Muto's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
for the audience what we call the Muto's
which<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.049> mu<00:01:10.229> to4<00:01:11.250> massive

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
which is like mu to4 massive

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.389 
which is like mu to4 massive
unidentified<00:01:12.299> terrestrial<00:01:12.799> organism<00:01:13.799> it's

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
unidentified terrestrial organism it's

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.190 
unidentified terrestrial organism it's
supposed<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.030> UFO<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> monsters

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
supposed to be like the UFO of monsters

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
supposed to be like the UFO of monsters
I<00:01:16.440> think<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.070> you're<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.220> fan<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> old

I think if you're a fan of all the old

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
I think if you're a fan of all the old
creatures<00:01:18.299> from<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> Japanese<00:01:19.320> films<00:01:19.679> then

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
creatures from the Japanese films then

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.410 
creatures from the Japanese films then
you'll<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.070> fan<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.429> these<00:01:20.580> new<00:01:20.910> creatures

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you'll be a fan of these new creatures

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.270 
you'll be a fan of these new creatures
we<00:01:21.869> had<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.289> polar<00:01:22.530> opposite<00:01:22.920> problems

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
we had like the polar opposite problems

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.620 
we had like the polar opposite problems
too<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.729> were<00:01:23.820> designing<00:01:23.940> Godzilla

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
too when we were designing Godzilla

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
too when we were designing Godzilla
in<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.050> Godzilla<00:01:25.500> you've<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.369> these

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
in that Godzilla you've got all these

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
in that Godzilla you've got all these
things<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:26.970> gotta<00:01:27.119> look<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.690> do<00:01:27.869> for

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
things it's gotta look like and do for

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.380 
things it's gotta look like and do for
it<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> feel<00:01:28.679> like<00:01:28.710> Godzilla<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.330> of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it to feel like Godzilla and you kind of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.180 
it to feel like Godzilla and you kind of
like<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> ice<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.140> restrictive<00:01:31.649> and<00:01:32.009> then

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
like that ice is so restrictive and then

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.889 
like that ice is so restrictive and then
suddenly<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.060> okay<00:01:33.330> make<00:01:33.539> any<00:01:33.690> creature

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
suddenly they go okay make any creature

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.740 
suddenly they go okay make any creature
you<00:01:34.020> won<00:01:34.369> anyway<00:01:35.399> Oh<00:01:35.580> be<00:01:36.360> careful<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
you won anyway Oh be careful what you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.680 
you won anyway Oh be careful what you
wish<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.670> there's<00:01:38.670> such<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.940> dramatically

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
wish for there's such a dramatically

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.320 
wish for there's such a dramatically
different<00:01:40.170> form<00:01:41.000> -<00:01:42.000> Godzilla<00:01:44.330> they're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
different form - Godzilla they're

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.120 
different form - Godzilla they're
tapping<00:01:45.720> into<00:01:45.869> something<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:46.679> deep<00:01:46.979> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
tapping into something that's deep in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
tapping into something that's deep in
our<00:01:47.220> DNA<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> reaction<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.450> real<00:01:48.600> animals<00:01:49.020> from

nature<00:01:49.940> Gareth<00:01:50.940> has<00:01:51.090> been<00:01:51.270> working<00:01:51.479> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
nature Gareth has been working for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.959 
nature Gareth has been working for
months<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> exactly

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
months on that to get that exactly

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.910 
months on that to get that exactly
correct<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:54.930> gonna<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
correct and that's gonna have a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.219 
correct and that's gonna have a
different<00:01:56.280> type<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> creature<00:01:57.329> look<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.930> we

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
different type of creature look that we

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.740 
different type of creature look that we
probably<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.710> never<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:59.369> seen<00:01:59.700> before

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
probably have never quite seen before

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.490 
probably have never quite seen before
designing<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> creature<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> lot<00:02:01.320> like

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
designing a creature is a lot like

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.529 
designing a creature is a lot like
evolution<00:02:02.280> itself<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.090> baseline

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
evolution itself you have a baseline

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.929 
evolution itself you have a baseline
creature<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.039> try<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.280> mutate<00:02:05.700> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
creature and then you try and mutate it

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.359 
creature and then you try and mutate it
and<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.750> different<00:02:06.899> things<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and do different things and if that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.949 
and do different things and if that
one's<00:02:08.549> superior<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.360> becomes<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> new

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
one's superior that becomes a new

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.320 
one's superior that becomes a new
baseline
