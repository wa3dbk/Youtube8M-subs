00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
me show you an example I am going to
open<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> phone<00:01:51.119> app<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.720> both<00:01:51.960> devices

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
open up the phone app on both devices

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
open up the phone app on both devices
and<00:01:52.979> I'm<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> close<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:54.810> exactly

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and I'm going to close them at exactly

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.179 
and I'm going to close them at exactly
the<00:01:55.439> same<00:01:55.619> time

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
the same time

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.209 
the same time
and<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:58.590> almost<00:01:58.829> three

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and as you can see it was almost three

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.030 
and as you can see it was almost three
times<00:01:59.549> quicker<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.899> close<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.469> app<00:02:01.680> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
times quicker to and close the app on

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.999 
times quicker to and close the app on
the<00:02:02.310> device<00:02:02.340> running<00:02:03.270> signature<00:02:03.810> mode<00:02:04.020> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the device running signature mode that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.249 
the device running signature mode that
is<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.640> example<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.450> how<00:02:06.509> signature

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
is just one example of how signature

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.199 
is just one example of how signature
mode<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> lot<00:02:08.009> faster<00:02:08.580> than<00:02:08.610> these<00:02:08.879> stock

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
mode is a lot faster than these stock

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.940

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.750 
main advantage of signature mod is since
it<00:03:44.049> is<00:03:44.170> probably<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.680> most<00:03:44.769> popular<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.430> out

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
it is probably the most popular one out

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.660 
it is probably the most popular one out
there<00:03:46.030> there<00:03:46.299> was<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> lot<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.690> community<00:03:47.350> young

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
there there was a lot of community young

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.620 
there there was a lot of community young
support<00:03:48.670> on<00:03:48.940> xda-developers<00:03:49.769> comet<00:03:50.769> cetera

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
support on xda-developers comet cetera

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.720 
support on xda-developers comet cetera
so<00:03:52.630> basically<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.470> conclusion<00:03:54.010> both<00:03:54.430> moms

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
so basically in conclusion both moms

so basically in conclusion both moms
have<00:03:55.000> their<00:03:55.150> pros<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.690> cons<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:57.100> stock
