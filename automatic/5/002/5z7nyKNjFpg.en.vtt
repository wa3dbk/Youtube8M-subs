but<00:00:35.340> anyway<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.760> wanted<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> make<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
but anyway I just wanted to make this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.770 
but anyway I just wanted to make this
video<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:38.040> explain<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.610> how<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> connect<00:00:39.719> your

video to explain you how to connect your

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.130 
video to explain you how to connect your
ps4<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.649> your<00:00:40.800> laptop<00:00:41.010> um<00:00:41.960> you're<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
ps4 to your laptop um you're going to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.840 
ps4 to your laptop um you're going to
need<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.520> one

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
need you're going to have to do this one

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.720 
need you're going to have to do this one
of<00:00:45.149> two<00:00:45.210> ways

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
of two ways

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.770 
of two ways
the<00:00:47.730> first<00:00:48.000> way<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.270> probably<00:00:51.629> know

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the first way is you would probably know

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.310 
the first way is you would probably know
this<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.260> some<00:00:52.559> laptops<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.699> HDMI<00:00:54.629> input

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
this but some laptops do have HDMI input

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.029 
this but some laptops do have HDMI input
which<00:00:56.219> means<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.879> connect<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:57.899> ps4<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
which means you can connect your ps4 to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
which means you can connect your ps4 to
your<00:00:59.190> laptop<00:00:59.399> directly<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.109> will

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
your laptop directly and then it will

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
your laptop directly and then it will
display<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> laptop<00:01:02.039> screen<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
display on the laptop screen that is

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.440 
display on the laptop screen that is
very<00:01:03.329> rare<00:01:03.600> most<00:01:04.350> laptops<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:05.280> HDMI<00:01:05.939> output

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
very rare most laptops have HDMI output

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
very rare most laptops have HDMI output
so<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.500> HDMI<00:01:08.070> port<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.520> your

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
so if you see an HDMI port on your

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.390 
so if you see an HDMI port on your
laptop<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.240> most<00:01:09.479> likely<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.400> displaying

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
laptop it's most likely for displaying

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.660 
laptop it's most likely for displaying
your<00:01:11.760> laptop<00:01:12.270> screen<00:01:12.570> -<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.590> TV<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
your laptop screen - like your TV if you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.969 
your laptop screen - like your TV if you
plug<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.090> ps4<00:01:15.390> into<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.200> laptop<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.860> not

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
plug your ps4 into your laptop it's not

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
plug your ps4 into your laptop it's not
going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> work<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.939> made<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> work<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
going to work it's not made to work that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.570 
going to work it's not made to work that
way<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.220> mostly<00:01:21.119> everybody<00:01:22.400> they<00:01:23.400> will

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
way so for mostly everybody they will

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
way so for mostly everybody they will
have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> capture<00:01:24.659> card<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
have to get a capture card that you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.510 
have to get a capture card that you
connect<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:26.759> laptop<00:01:26.900> via<00:01:27.900> USB<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
connect to your laptop via USB then you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
connect to your laptop via USB then you
connect<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> HDMI<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> capture<00:01:30.990> card

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
connect the HDMI to the capture card

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.080 
connect the HDMI to the capture card
that<00:01:32.220> will<00:01:32.490> allow<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.930> view<00:01:34.829> video<00:01:35.460> or

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that will allow you to a view video or

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
that will allow you to a view video or
didn't<00:01:36.600> put<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.110> ps4<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.860> your<00:01:38.040> laptop

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
didn't put from your ps4 on your laptop

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.670 
didn't put from your ps4 on your laptop
and<00:01:38.820> also<00:01:39.420> record<00:01:42.320> depending<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.470> your

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and also record depending on your

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
and also record depending on your
computer<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.549> how<00:01:44.700> fast<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.270> this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
computer and how fast it is this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.139 
computer and how fast it is this
probably<00:01:46.200> wouldn't<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.680> very<00:01:46.710> good<00:01:47.189> -<00:01:47.820> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
probably wouldn't be very good - you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
probably wouldn't be very good - you
know<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.420> play<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:50.220> you're<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> fast<00:01:50.700> computer

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
know just play if you're a fast computer

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.389 
know just play if you're a fast computer
I'm<00:01:51.240> sure<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.600> fine<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:53.189> really

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I'm sure that's fine but I don't really

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
I'm sure that's fine but I don't really
I<00:01:53.759> wouldn't<00:01:54.240> recommend<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.860> you're

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I wouldn't recommend it so if you're

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.300 
I wouldn't recommend it so if you're
looking<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.490> play<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.930> ps4<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:58.829> laptop

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
looking to play the ps4 on your laptop

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.969 
looking to play the ps4 on your laptop
it's<00:01:59.640> not<00:02:00.000> top-of-the-line<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.350> would

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it's not top-of-the-line I would

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.149 
it's not top-of-the-line I would
probably<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:03.259> forget<00:02:04.259> about<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.100> just

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
probably just forget about it and just

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.660 
probably just forget about it and just
get<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> cheap<00:02:05.850> monitor<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.399> carry

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
get a cheap monitor that you can carry

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.830 
get a cheap monitor that you can carry
