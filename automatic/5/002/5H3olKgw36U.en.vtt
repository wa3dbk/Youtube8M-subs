before<00:01:51.420> Tim<00:01:51.869> shoots<00:01:52.350> off<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.799> cliff<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.250> into

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
before Tim shoots off the cliff and into

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.570 
before Tim shoots off the cliff and into
the<00:01:54.030> air<00:01:54.210> gave<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.140> big<00:01:55.380> juice<00:01:55.740> off<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.220> nose

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
the air gave it a big juice off the nose

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.690 
the air gave it a big juice off the nose
and<00:01:57.049> once<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.200> was<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.470> there<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.920> felt<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.520> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and once I was in there it felt like I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.109 
and once I was in there it felt like I
was<00:01:59.880> there<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.390> long<00:02:00.570> time<00:02:01.220> in<00:02:02.220> risky<00:02:02.759> jumps

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
was there for a long time in risky jumps

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.910 
was there for a long time in risky jumps
like<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.540> there's<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.320> thin<00:02:04.619> line<00:02:04.650> between

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
like this there's a thin line between

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.449 
like this there's a thin line between
greatness<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> disaster<00:02:07.160> it's<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> those

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
greatness and disaster it's one of those

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.630 
greatness and disaster it's one of those
cliffs<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:10.770> were<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> mess<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.370> on

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
cliffs that if you were to mess up on

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.590 
cliffs that if you were to mess up on
getting<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.360> drop<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.980> could<00:02:14.220> be

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
getting to the drop it could be

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.809 
getting to the drop it could be
life-ending<00:02:15.600> too<00:02:16.260> big<00:02:16.620> lift<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.340> couple

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
life-ending too big lift a couple

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.050 
life-ending too big lift a couple
hundred<00:02:18.030> feet<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.989> it's<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.380> do-or-die<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.400> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
