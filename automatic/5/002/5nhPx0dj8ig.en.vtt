00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hey guys so today we're at Woodward west

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.570 
hey guys so today we're at Woodward west
and<00:00:04.650> we're<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.100> teach<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:05.520> to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
and we're going to teach you how to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:15.440 
and we're going to teach you how to
ollie<00:00:05.940> up<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.960> euro<00:00:07.379> gap<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:13.730> euro<00:00:14.730> gap<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.210> called

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
ollie up a euro gap a euro gap is called

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.960 
ollie up a euro gap a euro gap is called
the<00:00:15.540> euro<00:00:15.750> gap<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.680> no<00:00:16.920> idea<00:00:16.970> but

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the euro gap because I have no idea but

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.660 
the euro gap because I have no idea but
basically<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.050> bank<00:00:19.500> ramp<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
basically it's like a bank ramp with a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.630 
basically it's like a bank ramp with a
flat<00:00:21.090> gap<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.439> curb<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.070> some<00:00:23.279> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
flat gap up a curb or some kind of a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.269 
flat gap up a curb or some kind of a
ledge<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.070> good

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
ledge now this is a kind of a good

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.029 
ledge now this is a kind of a good
scenario<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.869> pop<00:00:28.109> up<00:00:28.320> off<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> ramp

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
scenario because you pop up off the ramp

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.620 
scenario because you pop up off the ramp
and<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.789> get<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> land<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.359> something

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and then you get a land on something

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
and then you get a land on something
that<00:00:30.900> goes<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.309> still<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> gap

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that goes up and it's still a gap

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.440 
that goes up and it's still a gap
because<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:34.950> ollie<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.149> land

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
because if you do an ollie and you land

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.569 
because if you do an ollie and you land
there<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.559> fall<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.489> an

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
there then you fall or if you do an

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.000 
there then you fall or if you do an
ollie<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.540> land<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
ollie and you land there you're going to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.790 
ollie and you land there you're going to
fall<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.520> would<00:00:42.000> say<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.420> most<00:00:42.660> common<00:00:42.809> thing

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
fall I would say the most common thing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.650 
fall I would say the most common thing
that<00:00:43.980> goes<00:00:44.129> wrong<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> euro<00:00:44.879> gap<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.300> landing

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that goes wrong in a euro gap is landing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.500 
that goes wrong in a euro gap is landing
like<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:47.280> order<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.670> avoid<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.239> you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like that and in order to avoid that you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
like that and in order to avoid that you
have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> lot<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> speed<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> once<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
have to have a lot of speed so once you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
have to have a lot of speed so once you
really<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> speed

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
really get it all in with a lot of speed

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
really get it all in with a lot of speed
you<00:01:01.079> feel<00:01:01.260> comfortable<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.969> just

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you feel comfortable there it's just

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.080 
you feel comfortable there it's just
really<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.930> much<00:01:04.199> else<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.949> time<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
really not much else you can do time to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:15.560 
really not much else you can do time to
take<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> roll<00:01:07.110> go<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> make<00:01:15.509> sure

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
take it to the roll go so make sure

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
take it to the roll go so make sure
you're<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.200> comfortable<00:01:16.560> again<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you're really comfortable again with a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.130 
you're really comfortable again with a
lot<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.520> speed<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> lot<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> speed<00:01:19.110> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
lot of speed with a lot of speed you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.420 
lot of speed with a lot of speed you
barely<00:01:19.680> need<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> ollie<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.850> even<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.180> Oh

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
barely need to ollie you can even go Oh

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
barely need to ollie you can even go Oh
still<00:01:23.430> make<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.960> once<00:01:25.380> you're

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
still make it and then once you're

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
still make it and then once you're
comfortable<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> can

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
comfortable with that then you can

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.789 
comfortable with that then you can
actually<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> bigger<00:01:28.200> ollie

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
actually do a bigger ollie

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
actually do a bigger ollie
so<00:01:29.070> again<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:30.090> Ollie's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so again you have to have good Ollie's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
so again you have to have good Ollie's
you<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:30.990> always<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.439> speed<00:01:31.740> then

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you have to have always with speed then

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.830 
you have to have always with speed then
the<00:01:32.549> next<00:01:32.790> thing<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> cover<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the next thing I want to cover is a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.469 
the next thing I want to cover is a
point<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.320> timing<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.100> can't<00:01:35.820> only<00:01:36.060> from

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
point of timing you can't only from

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.890 
point of timing you can't only from
there<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.650> can't<00:01:37.860> Ollie<00:01:38.100> from<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
there and you can't Ollie from there you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
there and you can't Ollie from there you
have<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> ollie<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.710> at<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> top<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
have to ollie right at the top of the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.210 
have to ollie right at the top of the
lip<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.470> little<00:01:43.619> bit<00:01:43.860> tricky

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
lip so that can be a little bit tricky

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.859 
lip so that can be a little bit tricky
when<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.670> first<00:01:45.000> starting<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.479> just

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
when you're very first starting out just

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
when you're very first starting out just
to<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.290> point<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.799> timing<00:01:47.220> down<00:01:47.520> just

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
to get that point of timing down just

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
to get that point of timing down just
keep<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.020> mind<00:01:49.380> I'm<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> have

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
keep that in mind I'm not going to have

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.330 
keep that in mind I'm not going to have
you<00:01:50.460> guys<00:01:50.670> look<00:01:51.149> at<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.140> your<00:01:52.950> point<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you guys look at this as your point of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
you guys look at this as your point of
timing<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.909> you're<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> practice

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
timing if you're going to practice

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.929 
timing if you're going to practice
