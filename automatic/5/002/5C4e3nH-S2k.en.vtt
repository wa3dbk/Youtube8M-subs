tile I can see how it looks in place
there<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.239> can<00:02:29.450> rotate<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.020> through<00:02:30.610> to

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
there and I can rotate it through to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.910 
there and I can rotate it through to
whatever<00:02:31.940> orientation<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.989> if<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.860> don't

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
whatever orientation I like if I don't

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.820

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
like a particular tile I just click on

the other one and it will substitute

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.820 

the<00:03:00.909> only<00:03:01.180> basic<00:03:01.599> rule<00:03:01.840> for<00:03:02.200> tile<00:03:02.409> placement

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
the only basic rule for tile placement

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.580 
the only basic rule for tile placement
is<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:04.150> cannot<00:03:04.450> force<00:03:04.870> yourself<00:03:05.379> off

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
is that you cannot force yourself off

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.800 
is that you cannot force yourself off
the<00:03:05.980> side<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.459> map<00:03:06.670> board<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.599> can

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
the side of the map board if you can

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.030 
the side of the map board if you can
avoid<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:09.760> placement<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.510> could<00:03:10.720> not

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
avoid it like this placement I could not

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.160 
avoid it like this placement I could not
place<00:03:12.040> my<00:03:12.730> tile<00:03:13.030> here<00:03:13.390> because<00:03:13.720> i'm<00:03:13.840> going<00:03:14.110> to

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
place my tile here because i'm going to

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.380 
place my tile here because i'm going to
write<00:03:14.500> off<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.709> board

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.150 

there's<00:03:22.050> really<00:03:22.200> no<00:03:22.440> reason<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.130> that

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
there's really no reason to do that

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.780 
there's really no reason to do that
unless<00:03:23.610> I'm<00:03:23.880> really<00:03:24.090> tired<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> game<00:03:24.810> and

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
unless I'm really tired of the game and

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.730 
unless I'm really tired of the game and
the<00:03:26.790> server<00:03:27.030> will<00:03:27.330> only<00:03:27.630> will<00:03:28.230> block<00:03:28.470> me<00:03:28.709> from

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
the server will only will block me from

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:40.600 
the server will only will block me from
doing<00:03:29.220> so

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.330

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
game progresses along and there are

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.580 
game progresses along and there are
fewer<00:03:47.990> and<00:03:48.170> fewer<00:03:48.350> spaces<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:50.240> game<00:03:50.590> pressure

fewer and fewer spaces the game pressure

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.850 
fewer and fewer spaces the game pressure
mounts<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.250> on<00:03:52.460> how<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.880> best<00:03:53.690> stay<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.680> the

mounts to on how to best stay on the
board<00:04:00.970> additionally<00:04:01.970> as<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:03.530> pieces

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
board additionally as the pieces

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.449 
board additionally as the pieces
converge<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:05.480> strategy<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.230> try<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.680> find

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
converge the strategy is to try to find

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.260 
converge the strategy is to try to find
a<00:04:07.640> way<00:04:08.770> to<00:04:09.770> keep<00:04:09.950> your<00:04:10.160> piece<00:04:10.459> on<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.790> board<00:04:11.000> as

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
a way to keep your piece on the board as

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.090 
a way to keep your piece on the board as
well<00:04:11.630> as<00:04:11.780> driving<00:04:12.080> your<00:04:12.320> opponent's<00:04:12.860> piece

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
well as driving your opponent's piece

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:33.210 
well as driving your opponent's piece
off

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.040 

so<00:04:33.820> now<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.210> we're<00:04:34.360> at<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.540> same<00:04:34.750> edge

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
so now that we're at the same edge

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.040 
so now that we're at the same edge
whatever<00:04:35.980> tile<00:04:36.820> my<00:04:37.060> opponent<00:04:37.480> places<00:04:37.870> will

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
whatever tile my opponent places will

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.380 
whatever tile my opponent places will
not<00:04:38.410> only<00:04:38.590> move<00:04:38.860> my<00:04:39.100> piece<00:04:39.370> but<00:04:39.700> also<00:04:39.850> his

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
not only move my piece but also his

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.020 
not only move my piece but also his
piece<00:04:44.040> that's<00:04:45.040> where<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.520> strategy<00:04:46.000> of

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
piece that's where the strategy of

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.450 
piece that's where the strategy of
driving<00:04:46.540> your<00:04:46.660> opponent's<00:04:47.080> pieces<00:04:47.920> on<00:04:48.220> off

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
driving your opponent's pieces on off

00:04:48.460 --> 00:05:27.380 
driving your opponent's pieces on off
the<00:04:49.030> board<00:04:49.270> comes<00:04:49.540> into<00:04:49.810> play

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.110 

ok<00:05:28.260> so<00:05:28.320> this<00:05:28.620> piece<00:05:28.920> will<00:05:29.130> send<00:05:29.610> me<00:05:29.730> off<00:05:29.880> the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
ok so this piece will send me off the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.910 
ok so this piece will send me off the
board<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.480> any<00:05:30.660> number<00:05:31.080> of<00:05:31.110> ways<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.620> can't

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
board and any number of ways so I can't

00:05:31.920 --> 00:06:23.200

place<00:05:32.190> though

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.230 

and<00:06:23.810> it<00:06:23.930> looks<00:06:24.110> like<00:06:24.289> the<00:06:24.770> computer<00:06:25.340> has
