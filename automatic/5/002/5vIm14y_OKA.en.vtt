00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it from scratch where I used to paint on

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.590 
it from scratch where I used to paint on
net<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.659> used<00:01:13.430> pause<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.850> use<00:01:15.299> paper

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and by added like a gradient type of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
and by added like a gradient type of
thing<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.369> ions<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.520> report<00:01:36.119> looks<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
thing and ions will report looks the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510 
thing and ions will report looks the
best<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.290> found<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.070> cool<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
best as I found a really cool way to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.149 
best as I found a really cool way to
make<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.360> instead<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> adding<00:01:40.259> glow<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
make it instead of adding glow and to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.350 
make it instead of adding glow and to
make<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.310> into<00:01:41.610> an<00:01:41.759> iron<00:01:42.000> sword

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
make it into an iron sword

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.080 
make it into an iron sword
so<00:01:43.110> yeah<00:01:43.290> suck<00:01:43.560> her<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.399> plug<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> cut

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
I think but a ghost would mean

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
I think but a ghost would mean
everything<00:01:46.470> looks<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.100> nice<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> I

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
things other than that getting its

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.900 
things other than that getting its
default

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
default

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.979 
default
oh<00:02:48.940> yeah<00:02:49.570> except<00:02:49.840> from<00:02:49.959> soup<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:51.810> still<00:02:52.810> don't

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
oh yeah except from soup I still don't

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.420 
oh yeah except from soup I still don't
even<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.260> who's<00:02:53.440> made<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.800> soup

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
even know who's made this soup

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.180 
even know who's made this soup
but<00:02:54.850> yeah<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> balls<00:02:55.720> are<00:02:55.989> not<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.650> same<00:02:56.860> as<00:02:57.130> a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
but yeah the balls are not the same as a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.210 
but yeah the balls are not the same as a
soup<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.209> guess<00:02:58.420> it's<00:02:58.860> there's<00:02:59.860> not<00:03:00.070> much

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
soup but I guess it's there's not much

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.500 
soup but I guess it's there's not much
difference<00:03:00.430> when<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.120> literally<00:03:01.390> here<00:03:03.510> it's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
difference when you literally here it's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
difference when you literally here it's
actually<00:03:04.630> better<00:03:04.989> because<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.230> can<00:03:05.350> actually

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
actually better because you can actually

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.260 
actually better because you can actually
tell<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.010> cyclic<00:03:06.400> difference<00:03:06.790> from<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.090> size

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
tell the cyclic difference from the size

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.520 
tell the cyclic difference from the size
um<00:03:08.130> I'm<00:03:09.130> going<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.310> show<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.520> that<00:03:09.640> all's<00:03:09.820> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
um I'm going to show you that all's I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.380 
um I'm going to show you that all's I
mean<00:03:11.530> made<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.890> don't<00:03:12.489> usually<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.030> don't<00:03:13.270> make

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
mean made I don't usually I don't make

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.990 
mean made I don't usually I don't make
any<00:03:13.630> blocks<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.040> iron<00:03:15.370> sword<00:03:15.730> is

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
any blocks but the iron sword is

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.550 
any blocks but the iron sword is
different<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.720> think<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:17.050> is<00:03:17.140> actually<00:03:17.260> from

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
different I think this is actually from

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.550 
different I think this is actually from
sapphire<00:03:18.100> 64<00:03:18.760> does<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.510> actually<00:03:19.810> does<00:03:20.080> look<00:03:20.440> a

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
sapphire 64 does it actually does look a

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.140 
sapphire 64 does it actually does look a
little<00:03:20.709> bit<00:03:20.830> like<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.700> year<00:03:24.970> and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
little bit like and a year and

little bit like and a year and
apparently<00:03:25.720> there's<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.610> chef<00:03:27.610> eyes<00:03:27.790> mushrooms

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
apparently there's a chef eyes mushrooms

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.590 
apparently there's a chef eyes mushrooms
from<00:03:29.290> 16<00:03:29.769> by<00:03:29.920> 16<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.880> I'm<00:03:30.970> getting<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.390> there's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
stuff they're here anyways the souls

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.490 
stuff they're here anyways the souls
were<00:03:45.519> made<00:03:45.760> from<00:03:45.910> depot<00:03:46.330> basically<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:48.610> yeah

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
were made from depot basically and yeah

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.620 
were made from depot basically and yeah
guess<00:03:50.500> that's<00:03:50.709> what<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:51.489> think<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.269> souls<00:03:52.480> are

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
guess that's what I think the souls are

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.850 
guess that's what I think the souls are
actually<00:03:52.870> 128<00:03:53.500> 528<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.459> was<00:03:54.940> gonna<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.860> unless

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
actually 128 528 I was gonna and unless

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.060 
actually 128 528 I was gonna and unless
yeah<00:03:57.190> yeah<00:03:57.450> 628<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.870> last<00:03:59.350> time<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.680> made<00:03:59.920> it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
yeah yeah 628 the last time I made it

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.840 
yeah yeah 628 the last time I made it
was<00:04:00.190> 64<00:04:00.610> by<00:04:00.910> 64<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.720> then<00:04:01.870> uh<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.290> wanted<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.980> add

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
was 64 by 64 and then uh I wanted to add

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.150 
was 64 by 64 and then uh I wanted to add
a<00:04:03.910> gradient<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.440> looks<00:04:05.620> like<00:04:05.890> you<00:04:06.040> know

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
a gradient so it looks like you know

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.400 
a gradient so it looks like you know
smooth<00:04:06.549> and<00:04:06.730> glow<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.840> couldn't<00:04:08.080> really<00:04:08.200> do

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
smooth and glow and I couldn't really do

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.380 
smooth and glow and I couldn't really do
that<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:09.519> had<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.739> 228<00:04:12.430> because<00:04:13.329> I

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
that so I had to do it 228 because I

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.199 
that so I had to do it 228 because I
don't<00:04:13.570> really<00:04:13.660> want<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.930> make<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.070> 256<00:04:15.070> by<00:04:15.700> 256

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
don't really want to make it 256 by 256

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.020 
don't really want to make it 256 by 256
because<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.440> literally<00:04:17.769> wasn't<00:04:18.100> needed<00:04:18.579> lake

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
because it literally wasn't needed lake

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.170 
because it literally wasn't needed lake
you<00:04:19.269> know<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:20.100> just<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.340> know<00:04:21.370> make<00:04:21.849> it<00:04:21.880> just

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
you know just just you know make it just

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.710 
you know just just you know make it just
over<00:04:23.460> as

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
over as

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.530 
over as
did<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.110> yes<00:04:26.100> literally<00:04:26.490> no<00:04:26.640> difference<00:04:29.540> so

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
did and yes literally no difference so

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.910 
did and yes literally no difference so
yeah<00:04:30.690> these<00:04:30.990> are<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.320> blocks<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.680> can<00:04:31.740> go

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
yeah these are the blocks you can go

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.270 
yeah these are the blocks you can go
ahead

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
ahead

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.120 
ahead
look<00:04:32.580> at<00:04:32.700> him<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.900> play<00:04:34.320> that's<00:04:34.680> pretty<00:04:34.890> cool

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
look at him and play that's pretty cool

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.430 
look at him and play that's pretty cool
park<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.700> guess<00:04:35.730> I've<00:04:36.630> been<00:04:36.780> using<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.230> and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
park I guess I've been using this and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.500 
park I guess I've been using this and
then<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.740> keep<00:04:38.070> switching<00:04:38.430> this<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.240> graph

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
then I keep switching this is the graph

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.180 
then I keep switching this is the graph
some<00:04:39.690> stuff<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.080> did<00:04:40.320> not<00:04:40.440> make<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.680> blocks<00:04:40.920> as

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
some stuff I did not make the blocks as

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.470 
some stuff I did not make the blocks as
I<00:04:41.310> said<00:04:41.550> but<00:04:42.480> let's<00:04:42.690> see<00:04:42.810> if<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.960> can<00:04:43.140> find<00:04:43.380> a

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
I said but let's see if I can find a

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.080 
I said but let's see if I can find a
song<00:04:45.480> just<00:04:45.900> say<00:04:46.310> see<00:04:47.310> oh<00:04:47.460> yeah<00:04:47.670> let<00:04:48.060> me

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
song just say see oh yeah let me

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.100

actually<00:04:48.210> show<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.660> crits<00:04:48.930> and

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
actually show you the crits and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.860 
actually show you the crits and
particles<00:04:50.100> I'm<00:04:51.090> not<00:04:51.300> even<00:04:51.480> sure<00:04:51.660> if<00:04:51.780> I

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
particles I'm not even sure if I

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.630 
particles I'm not even sure if I
actually<00:04:52.020> add<00:04:52.290> yeah<00:04:52.620> it's<00:04:52.920> a<00:04:53.070> star<00:04:53.370> I'm

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
actually add yeah it's a star I'm

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.850 
actually add yeah it's a star I'm

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
guessing it looks like a star shape but

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.610 
guessing it looks like a star shape but
if<00:04:58.950> we<00:04:59.010> just<00:04:59.100> go<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.280> get<00:04:59.790> the<00:04:59.850> pedo<00:05:00.330> us<00:05:00.620> all
