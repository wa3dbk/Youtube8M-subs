grab each side and pull apart this can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.550 
grab each side and pull apart this can
be<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.770> tough<00:01:08.130> sometimes

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
be a little tough sometimes
now<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:11.100> all<00:01:11.250> brush<00:01:11.490> motors<00:01:11.909> they're

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
now with all brush motors they're

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
now with all brush motors they're
usually<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.930> held<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:13.950> screws<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
usually just held in with two screws and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.850 
usually just held in with two screws and
all<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.689> unscrew<00:01:16.049> those<00:01:16.560> two

all you have to do is unscrew those two

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.969 
all you have to do is unscrew those two
for<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> pinion<00:01:18.420> gear<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> small

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
for the pinion gear if it is small

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
for the pinion gear if it is small
enough<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.340> fit<00:01:20.520> through<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:20.970> hole<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.930> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
enough to fit through that hole when you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
enough to fit through that hole when you
pull<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.549> leave<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
pull it out then you can just leave it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.420 
pull it out then you can just leave it
on<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.150> however<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:25.799> big<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.220> fit

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
on there however if it's too big to fit

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.230 
on there however if it's too big to fit
through<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> hole

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
through the hole

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.640 
through the hole
then<00:01:27.509> you're<00:01:27.689> gonna<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> take<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.380> out

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
then you're gonna have to take it out

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.890 
then you're gonna have to take it out
and<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.040> always<00:01:29.430> held<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.420> one's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

the<00:01:38.280> motor<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.030> should<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.390> able<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.689> slide

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the motor in it should be able to slide

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
the motor in it should be able to slide
right<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.520> remove<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> motor

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
right on out go and remove the motor

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.569

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
finally clean the motor out so now it's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100
