00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
I like now I can use the built-in proxy

there's<00:00:22.890> two<00:00:23.070> things<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:23.880> about

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
there's two things I don't like about

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.939 
there's two things I don't like about
the<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:24.630> they<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.800> there

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the way they do this one is that there

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.880 
the way they do this one is that there
are<00:00:26.070> white<00:00:26.279> spaces<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:27.150> between<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.510> cards<00:00:28.050> so

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
are white spaces in between the cards so

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.169 
are white spaces in between the cards so
when<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.070> print<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.060> either

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
when you print it out you have to either

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.930 
when you print it out you have to either
trim<00:00:30.660> off<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> white<00:00:31.170> space<00:00:31.529> or<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.790> have

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
trim off the white space or just have

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700 
trim off the white space or just have
white<00:00:33.270> edged<00:00:33.510> proxies<00:00:33.930> inside<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.469> card

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
white edged proxies inside of your card

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
white edged proxies inside of your card
sleeves<00:00:35.149> other<00:00:36.149> reason<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.809> this

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
sleeves other reason I don't like this

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.549 
sleeves other reason I don't like this
is<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> print<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.309> printer<00:00:39.559> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
is when I print it out to my printer the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.410 
is when I print it out to my printer the
proxies<00:00:40.950> ended<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> little<00:00:41.340> bit<00:00:41.579> slightly

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
proxies ended up a little bit slightly

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.680 
proxies ended up a little bit slightly
larger<00:00:43.020> than<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> actual<00:00:43.440> cards<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.850> when

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
larger than the actual cards are so when

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.090 
larger than the actual cards are so when
I<00:00:45.750> put<00:00:45.899> them<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> sleeves<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.800> look<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
I put them in the sleeves they look a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760 
I put them in the sleeves they look a
little<00:00:47.219> weird<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.989> adjust<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.469> scale

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
little weird so I can adjust the scale

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.970 
little weird so I can adjust the scale
here<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> print<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> looks<00:00:52.710> right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
here when I print it so it looks right

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
here when I print it so it looks right
but<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.449> actually<00:00:54.780> cuts<00:00:55.050> off

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
but when I do that it actually cuts off

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
but when I do that it actually cuts off
the<00:00:56.250> cards<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.480> look<00:00:57.750> through

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the cards like this so as I look through

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.479 
the cards like this so as I look through
all<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> different<00:00:58.260> pages<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.829> definitely

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
all the different pages I definitely

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.950 
all the different pages I definitely
can't<00:00:59.699> print<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.359> put<00:01:00.600> them<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
can't print this and put them in the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
can't print this and put them in the
sleeves<00:01:01.199> properly<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.879> another

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
sleeves properly so I have another

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
sleeves properly so I have another
method<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.409> MTG

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
about 15 to 20 dollars it's a heck a lot

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.090 
about 15 to 20 dollars it's a heck a lot
easier<00:02:03.270> than<00:02:03.360> using<00:02:03.540> scissors<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.469> save

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
easier than using scissors and just save

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
easier than using scissors and just save
some<00:02:05.280> frustration<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.299> some<00:02:06.540> time<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.930> that
