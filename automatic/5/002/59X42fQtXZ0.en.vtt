00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.390 
might ask why do I get both versions
mainly<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> separate

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.060 
there's the 4000 - day one edition code
right<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.690> course<00:02:52.720> no<00:02:53.230> manual<00:02:53.800> and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
right here and of course no manual and

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.550 
right here and of course no manual and
you<00:02:54.310> got<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.670> Forza<00:02:55.180> 4<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.870> horizon<00:02:56.410> 2

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you got the Forza 4 it's a horizon 2

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.970 
you got the Forza 4 it's a horizon 2
disc<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.720> yeah<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:59.350> is<00:02:59.410> pretty<00:02:59.770> much<00:02:59.860> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
disc so yeah this is pretty much the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.970 
disc so yeah this is pretty much the
unboxing<00:03:00.820> with<00:03:01.060> Force<00:03:01.840> Motors<00:03:02.110> foot<00:03:02.500> not

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
unboxing with Force Motors foot not

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.400 
unboxing with Force Motors foot not
motorsport<00:03:03.490> horizon<00:03:03.940> -<00:03:05.190> pretty<00:03:06.190> much<00:03:06.430> if<00:03:07.410> you

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
motorsport horizon - pretty much if you

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.630 
motorsport horizon - pretty much if you
guys<00:03:08.560> don't<00:03:08.830> know<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.160> difference<00:03:09.550> between

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
guys don't know the difference between

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.400 
guys don't know the difference between
motorsport<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.600> rising<00:03:11.020> pretty<00:03:11.260> much

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
motorsport and rising pretty much

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.490 
motorsport and rising pretty much
motorsport<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.160> pretty<00:03:12.400> much<00:03:12.490> your<00:03:12.640> pure

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
motorsport is pretty much your pure

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.940 
motorsport is pretty much your pure
simulation<00:03:14.500> for<00:03:15.460> Forza<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.890> horizon<00:03:17.890> is

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
simulation for Forza and horizon is

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.640 
simulation for Forza and horizon is
pretty<00:03:18.190> much<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.700> open-world<00:03:19.600> half<00:03:20.380> our

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
pretty much the open-world half our

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.100 
pretty much the open-world half our
kitty<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.220> half<00:03:21.490> simulation<00:03:22.210> kind<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.600> which

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
kitty and half simulation kind of which

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.760 
kitty and half simulation kind of which
I<00:03:23.430> prefer<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.610> lot<00:03:24.970> more<00:03:25.270> because<00:03:25.900> be<00:03:26.500> honest

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
I prefer a lot more because be honest

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.640 
I prefer a lot more because be honest
just<00:03:26.980> racing<00:03:27.460> on<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.910> same<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:28.410> area<00:03:29.410> same

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
just racing on the same like area same

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.050 
just racing on the same like area same
track<00:03:29.920> over<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.370> over<00:03:30.460> gets<00:03:30.700> kind<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.000> boring

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
track over and over gets kind of boring

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.640 
track over and over gets kind of boring
so<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.480> have<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.080> lot<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.320> different

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
so you have like a lot of different

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.500 
so you have like a lot of different
environments<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.250> stuff<00:03:33.490> and<00:03:33.670> open-world<00:03:34.270> so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
environments and stuff and open-world so

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.540 
environments and stuff and open-world so
it<00:03:34.720> might<00:03:34.870> be<00:03:35.020> it's<00:03:35.140> more<00:03:35.320> fun<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.770> it's<00:03:36.040> kind

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
it might be it's more fun and it's kind

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.220 
it might be it's more fun and it's kind
of<00:03:36.580> arcade<00:03:36.970> which<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.270> like<00:03:37.420> more<00:03:37.450> than<00:03:37.840> just

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
of arcade which I like more than just

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.800 
of arcade which I like more than just
pure<00:03:38.920> simulation<00:03:39.490> so<00:03:39.640> yeah<00:03:39.820> this<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.660> in

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
pure simulation so yeah this is in

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.520 
pure simulation so yeah this is in
boxing<00:03:41.200> 4/4<00:03:41.950> arisin<00:03:42.430> -<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:43.750> lot<00:03:44.200> more<00:03:44.350> games

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
boxing 4/4 arisin - a lot more games

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.800 
boxing 4/4 arisin - a lot more games
coming<00:03:44.740> out<00:03:44.980> in<00:03:45.160> October<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:46.060> look<00:03:46.450> forward<00:03:46.690> to

coming out in October so look forward to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.810 
coming out in October so look forward to
those<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.260> boxing<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:47.890> yeah<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.340> I'll<00:03:48.520> talk<00:03:48.790> to
