so<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:01.979> demo<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:03.560> kind<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.740> one<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.640> my

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
so this is a demo of kind of one of my

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.570 
so this is a demo of kind of one of my
crystal<00:00:06.480> clear<00:00:06.690> boards<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.379> made<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.069> using<00:00:08.309> a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
crystal clear boards I made this using a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.379 
crystal clear boards I made this using a
Celestion<00:00:09.740> microscope<00:00:10.740> piece<00:00:11.460> see<00:00:11.820> fencing

everything<00:00:18.660> else<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.080> soon<00:00:19.949> I'll<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.189> posting

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
everything else and soon I'll be posting

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.060 
everything else and soon I'll be posting
exactly<00:00:21.060> how<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> made<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.840> YouTube<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:22.949> it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
exactly how I made it on YouTube but it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.189 
exactly how I made it on YouTube but it
is<00:00:23.220> crystal<00:00:23.850> clear<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.539> straight<00:00:25.080> on

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
is crystal clear you can see straight on

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
is crystal clear you can see straight on
through<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.680> whoa<00:00:26.180> and<00:00:27.949> it<00:00:28.949> works<00:00:29.670> pretty<00:00:29.880> well

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
through it whoa and it works pretty well

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.700 
through it whoa and it works pretty well
I<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.539> actually<00:00:30.689> surprised<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.380> long<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.650> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
I was actually surprised as long as you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.959 
I was actually surprised as long as you
don't<00:00:31.800> use<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> soldering<00:00:32.279> iron<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.759> solder

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
don't use the soldering iron to solder

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.150 
don't use the soldering iron to solder
onto<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.570> say<00:00:33.750> use<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.559> regular<00:00:34.620> heat

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
onto and you say use just regular heat

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.549 
onto and you say use just regular heat
gun<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.969> solder<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> pretty<00:00:36.960> good<00:00:37.200> seems

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
gun it solder is pretty good seems

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.119 
gun it solder is pretty good seems
pretty<00:00:37.770> robust<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.300> clear<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.980> I'm

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
pretty robust and it's clear so I'm

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.410 
pretty robust and it's clear so I'm
going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> hook<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.239> up

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
going to do is I'm going to hook this up

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
going to do is I'm going to hook this up
now<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> simply<00:00:43.950> plug<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.079> OOP<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
now so I simply plug this in OOP this is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.869 
now so I simply plug this in OOP this is
my<00:00:47.570> micro<00:00:48.570> tiny<00:00:49.050> ISP<00:00:49.739> programmer<00:00:50.010> thing<00:00:50.610> it's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
my micro tiny ISP programmer thing it's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.450 
my micro tiny ISP programmer thing it's
basically<00:00:51.510> lady<00:00:51.899> eita<00:00:52.110> design<00:00:52.530> -<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.129> parts

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
basically lady eita design - some parts

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.410 
basically lady eita design - some parts
and<00:00:54.320> super<00:00:55.320> miniaturized<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> have

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and super miniaturized and so all I have

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.330 
and super miniaturized and so all I have
to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.170> AVR<00:00:58.590> code<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to do is I have my AVR code there on the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.689 
to do is I have my AVR code there on the
left<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.629> type<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.989> make<00:01:01.699> goes

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
left and if I just type and make goes

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.910 
left and if I just type and make goes
and<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.390> programs<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.799> it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and it programs it now that it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
and it programs it now that it's
programmed<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.869> neat

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
programmed I actually have this neat

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
programmed I actually have this neat
little<00:01:07.229> touch<00:01:07.680> sensor<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.330> touch<00:01:09.570> on

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
little touch sensor that I can touch on

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
little touch sensor that I can touch on
the<00:01:10.229> backside<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.880> whoa<00:01:12.890> come<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.040> come

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the backside that is whoa come on come

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.910 
the backside that is whoa come on come
on

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.700 

push<00:01:19.520> on<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.759> backside<00:01:19.939> here<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.500> lights

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
push on the backside here and it lights

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.719 
push on the backside here and it lights
up<00:01:23.409> so<00:01:24.409> if<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:24.830> hold<00:01:25.009> it<00:01:25.220> whoa

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.370 

and<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.360> touching<00:01:30.719> it<00:01:30.780> through<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> glass

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and I'm touching it through the glass

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.340 
and I'm touching it through the glass
and<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.979> detecting<00:01:32.490> through<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> glass<00:01:33.350> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and it's detecting through the glass so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160 
and it's detecting through the glass so
I<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> glass<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:36.049> electronics<00:01:37.049> on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I have the glass there electronics on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.249 
I have the glass there electronics on
that<00:01:37.289> side<00:01:37.610> glass<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.939> side<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.539> I<00:01:40.079> just

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that side glass on this side and I just

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.600 
that side glass on this side and I just
think<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.500> makes<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.070> some<00:01:41.280> interesting

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
think this makes for some interesting

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.459 
think this makes for some interesting
user<00:01:42.119> interfaces<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.229> touch

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
user interfaces because you can touch

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.950 
user interfaces because you can touch
glass<00:01:43.950> directly<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.329> print<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> touch

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
glass directly you can print the touch

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
glass directly you can print the touch
sensitive<00:01:46.380> materials<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> back

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
sensitive materials on the back

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
sensitive materials on the back
this<00:01:48.149> has<00:01:48.450> using<00:01:48.929> one<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> dual<00:01:49.409> zone<00:01:49.710> one

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
this has using one of the dual zone one

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.649 
this has using one of the dual zone one
so<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.579> tell<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.479> user

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so you can actually tell where the user

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.690 
so you can actually tell where the user
is<00:01:51.810> clicking<00:01:51.929> between<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.560> two<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.490> way

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
is clicking between the two all the way

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.770 
is clicking between the two all the way
from<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> purply<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.100> blue<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.969> cyan<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
from kind of purply to blue to cyan to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.459 
from kind of purply to blue to cyan to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
green to yellow to red and I don't know

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.870 
green to yellow to red and I don't know
I<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.709> interested<00:02:02.069> in<00:02:02.399> seeing<00:02:02.549> what<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.819> guys

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
I be interested in seeing what you guys

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.990 
I be interested in seeing what you guys
think<00:02:03.270> I'll<00:02:03.569> be<00:02:03.810> posting<00:02:03.990> how<00:02:04.319> to<00:02:04.380> build<00:02:04.679> these

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
think I'll be posting how to build these

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.209 
think I'll be posting how to build these
sometime<00:02:06.000> soon
