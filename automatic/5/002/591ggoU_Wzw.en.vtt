00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
a huge advantage for that turn but I

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.240 
a huge advantage for that turn but I

think a fifth legal good could have

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.120 
think a fifth legal good could have
alleviated<00:06:36.000> that<00:06:36.480> by<00:06:36.780> allocating<00:06:37.320> an<00:06:37.770> extra
