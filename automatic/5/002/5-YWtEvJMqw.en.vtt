00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
while to package up the site you might
remember<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> export<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> theme<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
remember when you export it a theme it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
remember when you export it a theme it
also<00:01:48.420> took<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:48.930> while<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> put

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
also took a little while for it to put

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.710 
also took a little while for it to put
everything<00:01:50.430> together<00:01:50.729> into<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> package<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
everything together into a package and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
everything together into a package and
then<00:01:51.810> download<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> well<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.220> case<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
then download it well in that case you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.999 
then download it well in that case you
were<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.970> downloading<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> design<00:01:55.079> here

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
were just downloading the design here

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.160 
were just downloading the design here
you're<00:01:56.159> downloading<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.790> design<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.509> all

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you're downloading the design and all

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.590 
you're downloading the design and all
the<00:01:58.320> content<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.700> software<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> run<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the content and the software to run it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.880 
the content and the software to run it
so<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> actually<00:02:01.200> takes<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> fair<00:02:01.829> amount

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so it actually takes a fair amount

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.359 
so it actually takes a fair amount
longer<00:02:02.520> I'll<00:02:02.759> save<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.750> my<00:02:03.840> desktop<00:02:04.369> then

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
longer I'll save that to my desktop then

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
longer I'll save that to my desktop then
once<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.790> done<00:02:06.000> you're<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.899> to

once it's done you're going to have to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
once it's done you're going to have to

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
uncompress the file and in fact it goes

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.510 
uncompress the file and in fact it goes
through<00:02:09.750> two<00:02:09.959> levels<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.440> uncompressing<00:02:11.009> you

through two levels of uncompressing you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.700 
through two levels of uncompressing you
open<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:11.970> folders<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.080> forth
