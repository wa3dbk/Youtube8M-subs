00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.830 
a bean soup that's okay but the
important<00:00:24.119> thing<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.330> you'll<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.480> even<00:00:24.750> on

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
important thing in you'll see even on

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.779 
important thing in you'll see even on
this<00:00:24.960> box<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.350> says<00:00:25.380> low<00:00:25.680> sodium<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this box it says low sodium you know a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.160 
this box it says low sodium you know a
lot<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.029> soups<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> tremendous

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
lot of soups that I have a tremendous

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.359 
lot of soups that I have a tremendous
amount<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.439> sodium<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.130> this

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
amount of sodium in them I think this

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.600 
amount of sodium in them I think this
one<00:00:29.490> has<00:00:30.769> twenty<00:00:31.769> percent<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> other

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
one has twenty percent of the other

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
one has twenty percent of the other
container<00:00:32.969> sodium<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.840> 90<00:00:34.170> milligrams

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
container sodium right for 90 milligrams

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
container sodium right for 90 milligrams
so<00:00:34.649> that's<00:00:34.800> quite<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> bit<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.399> sodium<00:00:35.700> as<00:00:35.850> an

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
so that's quite a bit of sodium as an

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.760 
so that's quite a bit of sodium as an
example<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.230> you're<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
example so as you're out there in the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.869 
example so as you're out there in the
