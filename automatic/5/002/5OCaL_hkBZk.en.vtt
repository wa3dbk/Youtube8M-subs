LC one but they all run on the same sort
of<00:00:13.939> theory<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:14.709> they've<00:00:15.709> got<00:00:15.920> two<00:00:16.129> grounds

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
of theory and they've got two grounds

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.300

signal<00:00:19.760> it's<00:00:20.300> important<00:00:20.780> to<00:00:20.840> take<00:00:21.050> them<00:00:21.260> back

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
signal it's important to take them back

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.800 
signal it's important to take them back
individually<00:00:22.340> exactly<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.789> same<00:00:23.000> as<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.300> ECU

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
individually exactly the same as the ECU

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.220 
individually exactly the same as the ECU
waring<00:00:24.310> take<00:00:25.310> them<00:00:25.460> back<00:00:25.610> individually<00:00:26.449> so

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
waring take them back individually so

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.529 
waring take them back individually so
we've<00:00:27.410> got<00:00:27.560> signal<00:00:27.949> ground<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.240> heat

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
we've got signal ground and and the heat

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.750 
we've got signal ground and and the heat
of<00:00:29.690> ground<00:00:29.960> taking<00:00:30.380> both<00:00:30.590> back<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.220> same

something don't have a green wire and
they<00:01:02.959> only<00:01:03.109> have<00:01:03.309> avoided<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.400> blue<00:01:04.640> or<00:01:05.269> they

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
they only have avoided a blue or they

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.539 
they only have avoided a blue or they

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.150 
have a blue and half green a cutting
them<00:01:07.640> neighbor<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.960> too<00:01:09.200> was<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:09.920> mind

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
them neighbor this too was in mind

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.830 
them neighbor this too was in mind
someone<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.640> have<00:01:10.760> one<00:01:10.940> signal<00:01:11.390> wire<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:11.810> I

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
someone you have one signal wire but I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.050 
someone you have one signal wire but I
got<00:01:12.050> two<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.530> think<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:13.550> got<00:01:13.820> one<00:01:13.940> the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
got two I think on the I got one the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.360 
got two I think on the I got one the
other<00:01:14.120> side<00:01:14.420> not<00:01:14.600> only<00:01:14.660> got<00:01:14.930> one<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.620> then<00:01:16.250> the

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
other side not only got one and then the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.490 
other side not only got one and then the
output<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:17.090> on<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.600> yellow<00:01:17.840> wire<00:01:18.110> of<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
output is on the yellow wire of the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.340 
output is on the yellow wire of the
universe<00:01:19.270> egg<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:20.570> one<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.930> on<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.110> yellow

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
universe egg but one is on the yellow

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.340 
universe egg but one is on the yellow
wire<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.860> then<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.180> goes<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.990> pink

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
wire and then that goes to the pink

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.340 
wire and then that goes to the pink
purple<00:01:25.420> color<00:01:26.420> what<00:01:26.630> call<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.900> pink<00:01:27.110> we'll

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
purple color what call it pink we'll

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.440 
purple color what call it pink we'll
call<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.620> back<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.340> on<00:01:28.610> my<00:01:28.850> warring<00:01:29.240> loom

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
call it back to the on my warring loom

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.750 
call it back to the on my warring loom

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
for the mega squirt that's the signal

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.090 
for the mega squirt that's the signal
back<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.150> mega<00:01:32.360> squirt<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.870> tell<00:01:33.050> it<00:01:33.170> what

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
back to the mega squirt to tell it what

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.700 
back to the mega squirt to tell it what
the<00:01:34.280> voltage<00:01:35.030> output<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.810> off<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.260> wideband

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the voltage output is off the wideband

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.080 
the voltage output is off the wideband
lambda<00:01:37.280> sensor<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:39.190> I've<00:01:40.190> also<00:01:40.370> using<00:01:41.000> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
lambda sensor and I've also using the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.320 
lambda sensor and I've also using the
brown<00:01:41.500> output<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.680> bank<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.090> goes

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
brown output to bank to and that goes

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.460 
brown output to bank to and that goes
off<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:46.120> an<00:01:47.120> F<00:01:47.300> our<00:01:47.540> gauge<00:01:47.840> I've<00:01:48.110> got<00:01:48.290> on

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
off to and an F our gauge I've got on

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.550 
off to and an F our gauge I've got on
the<00:01:48.620> dashboard<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.310> then<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.630> red<00:01:50.840> wire<00:01:50.870> on

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the dashboard and then the red wire on

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.850 
the dashboard and then the red wire on
the<00:01:51.890> end<00:01:53.800> of<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:54.950> lambda<00:01:55.400> is<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.760> power

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
the end of it lambda is the power

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.460 
the end of it lambda is the power
because<00:01:58.090> it's<00:01:59.090> up<00:01:59.330> seeing<00:01:59.630> this<00:01:59.780> like<00:01:59.990> yes<00:02:00.230> red

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
because it's up seeing this like yes red

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.510 
because it's up seeing this like yes red
and<00:02:00.680> I've<00:02:01.580> got<00:02:01.909> 12<00:02:02.150> volt<00:02:02.330> feed<00:02:02.570> then<00:02:03.050> what<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.520> do

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
and I've got 12 volt feed then what I do

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.030 
and I've got 12 volt feed then what I do
that<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:05.570> like<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.780> switch<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.290> queen<00:02:06.590> feed

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
that is I like to switch a queen feed

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.240 
that is I like to switch a queen feed
through<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.790> relay<00:02:08.239> since<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:09.560> 12<00:02:09.860> volt<00:02:10.069> feed

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
through a relay since the 12 volt feed

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.819 
through a relay since the 12 volt feed
from<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.610> will<00:02:10.849> come<00:02:11.120> from<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:12.110> battery<00:02:12.590> bar

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
from this will come from the battery bar

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.920 
from this will come from the battery bar
and<00:02:13.159> relay<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.549> the<00:02:13.790> relay<00:02:14.120> switched<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.659> when

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
and relay so the relay switched on when
