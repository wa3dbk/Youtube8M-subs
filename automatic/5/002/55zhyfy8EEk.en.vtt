 Cooking video today had it very bad 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.140
 much sense to go shopping and watched 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.099
 baking so I'm going with you today 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.980
 to do 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.259
 A very familiar cool look we looked at 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.610
 today namely marble cake bake briefly 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.590
 make the men i got you but 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.510
 a few ingredients needed this is what they are 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.949
 I must all start here 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.529
 left with the granulated sugar 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.210
 when we need self-rising flour 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.420
 unsalted butter 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 use a few eggs and pure cocoa powder 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.859
 preferably for this cake up for this 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.380
 cake of unsweetened cocoa powder is then 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.760
 chocolate tastes good piece all something 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.230
 to how many present are in below 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.940
 the description 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.920
 I'm going to start beating creamy 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.379
 the butter and the sugar i'm going soon 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 mix my stand for use but you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.879
 can of course also do it by hand 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 then it's just a little bit more work 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 just put all the butter in the bowl 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.770
 really worry before the butter runs out 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.690
 room temperature then the being mix only 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.090
 but better and with the butter is allowed 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.940
 all granulated sugar 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.219
 and I mix this until a light 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.080
 creamy mixture has become it is the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.030
 intention with the butter sugar mixture 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960
 pretty light yellow looks like this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 colored 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.280
 a super creamy meanwhile to the eggs 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 by adding and I just go now 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.119
 continue by hand and i add one before 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.119
 one way 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.259
 I first create this through it well 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.400
 until it is well mixed before me 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.400
 next y you add 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.990
 these steps just repeat until you 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.610
 all your eggs have been in the herd 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.259
 butter and sugar and the eggs are good 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.630
 with the per municipality as you see it is 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.009
 really nice to be liquid batter 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.659
 I like the same with the cake 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.130
 to give a small vanilla flavor 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.720
 so I'm going to add a little vanilla 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.030
 add flavor 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.290
 this just in the supermarket co i 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.290
 use about a teaspoon 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.680
 I also stir this through 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.550
 fine so like and equal manner euros 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.110
 this time to allow the self-rising flour 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.380
 and I just do that in one 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.759
 times using the pancake maker 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.210
 I turn this into a smooth one 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.210
 cake batter 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.360
 m deep is then save escape so not yet 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.250
 ready you could already do this in the baking tin 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.530
 pour and bake the cake with you 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.819
 just a neutral family looked but go 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.690
 of course a marbe looked at and 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.180
 for that we also have 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.200
 chocolate batter that is super 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.110
 simple 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.850
 I create about a third of it 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.590
 what we have made in cake batter 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.590
 another could do a little more 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.660
 draws when batter briefly 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.680
 then I add the cocoa powder to this 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.080
 and those ships here just as well 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.970
 through it until it is one in count 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.950
 chocolate batter has become this is 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.630
 perfect 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.250
 continue my drawing well this week 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.290
 greased with a little oil in life 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.019
 with a sheet of baking paper so that city ​​looked 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.850
 easy to remove is i add 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.019
 first my chocolate batter tool i find 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.470
 because it itself is the best if 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.560
 chocolate stroke at the bottom of the cake 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.570
 and vanilla cake batter is on top 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.590
 is that please wait because it 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.120
 chocolate was very bad 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.940
 she needs a different spatula 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 to finish the batter 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.989
 scraping 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.579
 quickly and and distribute this chocolate batter 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.920
 we naturally over the bottom of the tick 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:28.660
 for so and then ignore the vanilla cake 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.640
 batter over it and you will see that one 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.459
 easier because it is one 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 slightly thinner cake batter 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.350
 and now we are going to bake the cake I have the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.820
 oven preheated at 150 degrees Celsius 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.160
 I think I slide in the middle of the oven 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.410
 and expect to watched about an hour 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.630
 need an hour and a quarter its 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.760
 to be careful 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.829
 test whether the details you can do by 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.980
 to poke a skewer this one comes 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.930
 clean out the cake is eyeing good 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.670
 it's all ready and I already have it 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.460
 let something cool so now it's time 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.010
 to cut 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.960
 deepak just a bread knife and me 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.820
 just start cutting to one side 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.390
 I am very curious how it will look 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.390
 looks inside 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.480
 all right 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.390
 kinderdam base 10 very beautiful that is 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.190
 become 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.620
 city all marble person but that 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.540
 I actually think there is this way 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.290
 I think he's actually the most beautiful but 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.660
 look two up close relationship 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.090
 when you say perfect vanilla and chocolate 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.040
 and at play i did its pretty cool 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.700
 without becoming dry 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.560
 so we are going to taste and like you 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.310

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.230
 vanilla layer very nice of each other 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.580
