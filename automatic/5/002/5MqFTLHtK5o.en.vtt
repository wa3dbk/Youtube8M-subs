00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.020 
I did this not without ulterior motive
see<00:01:22.740> how<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> thought<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.369> might<00:01:23.549> happen<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
see how I thought what might happen is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.520 
see how I thought what might happen is
that<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> owners<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.810> Teenage<00:01:25.140> Mutant<00:01:25.500> Ninja

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that the owners of Teenage Mutant Ninja

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
that the owners of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Wi-Fi<00:01:26.159> might<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.119> we've<00:01:27.330> changed<00:01:27.630> ours

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
Wi-Fi might see that we've changed ours

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.410 
Wi-Fi might see that we've changed ours
to<00:01:28.350> Mighty<00:01:28.560> Morphin<00:01:28.740> Power<00:01:28.979> Wi-Fi<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> think

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
to Mighty Morphin Power Wi-Fi and think

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
to Mighty Morphin Power Wi-Fi and think
it's<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.710> might<00:01:31.920> change<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> name

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it's on and they might change the name

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.039 
it's on and they might change the name
of<00:01:32.610> their<00:01:32.790> Wi-Fi<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> something<00:01:33.570> else<00:01:33.659> based

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
of their Wi-Fi to something else based

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
of their Wi-Fi to something else based
on<00:01:34.229> another<00:01:34.500> childhood<00:01:34.799> franchise<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
on another childhood franchise and then

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.149 
on another childhood franchise and then
we<00:01:35.880> change<00:01:36.270> ours<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.110> change<00:01:37.500> their<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
we change ours and they change their and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.399 
we change ours and they change their and
so<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
so on and so on and so on and so on and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.929 
so on and so on and so on and so on and
closer<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.860> closer<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> camera<00:01:41.610> like
