00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
concerned these strings just work really

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
concerned these strings just work really
well<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.350> whole<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.009> feels

really brilliant you've got a 5-way
pickup<00:01:32.369> slipped<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.150> she's<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.600> good<00:01:33.780> tone

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
pickup slipped up she's really good tone

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.429 
pickup slipped up she's really good tone
and<00:01:34.350> volume<00:01:35.150> just<00:01:36.150> whole<00:01:36.479> thing<00:01:36.720> feels<00:01:37.079> really

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and volume just whole thing feels really

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.890 
and volume just whole thing feels really
brilliant<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:39.320> didn't<00:01:40.320> mean<00:01:40.740> to
