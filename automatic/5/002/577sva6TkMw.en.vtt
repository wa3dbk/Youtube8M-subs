minor triad which you have to kind of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.060 
minor triad which you have to kind of
play<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:36.990> little<00:02:37.200> bit<00:02:37.380> differently<00:02:37.740> than<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
play a little bit differently than the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.400 
play a little bit differently than the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
this because it spans a little bit more

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.360

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
kind of take up you know some space and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.520 
kind of take up you know some space and
make<00:02:47.880> things<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.300> think<00:02:48.360> more<00:02:48.810> positional<00:02:49.380> like

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530

you<00:02:49.680> would<00:02:49.800> normally<00:02:50.130> have<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.170> here<00:02:52.170> we're

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
you would normally have so here we're

yeah so and that's what we get per

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
octave there and then the whole thing

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.979 
octave there and then the whole thing
repeats<00:03:16.860> um<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:18.239> run<00:03:18.420> through<00:03:18.599> all<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.770 
repeats um you run through all of the
prior<00:03:19.200> chords<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.250> second<00:03:20.790> end<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.480> is

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
prior chords the second end to this is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.990 
prior chords the second end to this is
actually<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.650> D<00:03:22.829> minor<00:03:23.099> but<00:03:23.430> without<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
actually the D minor but without the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.420 
actually the D minor but without the
octave<00:03:24.540> repeats<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:25.890> into<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.220> lower

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
octave repeats and going into the lower

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.369 
octave repeats and going into the lower
octave<00:03:26.819> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> seventh<00:03:27.569> string<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.110> then<00:03:28.260> we

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
octave on the seventh string so then we

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.910 
octave on the seventh string so then we
get<00:03:28.530> this

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
get this

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:40.420
