00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.069
 hello tufo here several 24 in the video of 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.370
 today panasonic has sent us these 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.260
 hearing aids that are basic that 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.440
 they have to do an analysis 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.390
 basic as they were already in this channel and 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.550
 well here we have the box but the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.440
 let's uncover, let's see what they bring 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.529
 these panasonic rp ht 161 that are 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.220
 Stereo hearing aids have a system of 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.950
 extra low supposedly and it's for 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.329
 listen more than all digital audio the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.790
 part of top we have the same 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.090
 information this part next to it the same 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.610
 and on the other side the same 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.700
 if we go back here we have the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 multi- language specifications 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.120
 then it comes with the 30 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.980
 millimeters of most of the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.340
 hearing aids has an impedance of 32 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.559
 sensibilities 98 decibels 1000 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.190
 mega watts I think this has a weight 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.950
 of 160 grams and 130 without cable the cable 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.450
 is 2 meters on a 3.5-inch plug 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.040
 millimeters 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.380
 avoid putting on helmets 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.050
 the helmets when driving walk in 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 bicycle what we already know and 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.900
 well let's uncover what 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.580
 to see what this product brings 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.229
 complicated here to cover it but it pleases 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.470
 where am i 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.440
 where does this leave from here 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.440
 and we have the end already here the box 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.170
 another box and inside the box where 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.830
 are the hearing aids 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.830
 obviously they come very well packaged 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.270
 well packed in bubble liner 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.930
 and we have the last ones here we are going to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.930
 remove the sachet 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.730
 and here we have the panasonic of 71 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.760
 61 and you can see 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.500
 has a very wide helmets that are 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.980
 these are pretty fat lr the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.069
 headband here has a hole and both 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.640
 meters of cable with 3.5 connector 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.640
 millimeters 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.200
 that we all obviously know here 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.849
 the additionally adjustable 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.370
 it is not mobile, in some cases it would not be 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.879
 as fixed I could say I and the two 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.319
 meters of cable and good ya obviously 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:16.189
 had approved them and as for the sound 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.750
 it's totally digital that is if 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:23.460
 they want to listen to music 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.750
 for trips or things like that with a good low 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.580
 that is to say what they are have their 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 mobile devices alone are not 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.140
 I recommend you recommend others that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.110
 even have a microphone in case 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.230
 a call because these although 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.820
 says there that they have extra low does not 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.340
 the bass sounds the highs sound good 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.890
 and it has good audio clarity but the 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.030
 low falls short 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.030
 let's say I put some songs 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.590
 they are quite balanced in audio but 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.570
 the bass was never heard that to me is 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.300
 a problem for some of you such 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.150
 Not once but if you are going to be with 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.370
 the computer one of the great ones that 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.510
 they have several the entrance is back and 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.740
 they have a cable that will serve them because 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.480
 when one does not connect with a computer 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.620
 it's like different it's a bit 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.060
 different 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.160
 and then in a computer it is known that the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.079
 audio quality is different then 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.100
 then it will be much more useful for 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.100
 you think me 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.260
 the flexibility is quite broad 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.260
 because we can see 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.610
 quite broad good I risk to 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.560
 make him more here we have to like the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.900
 horn but here it's stiff and the 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.700
 comfortable pads and if it's enough 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.700
 as the truth I put them 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.940
 and it's quite comfortable has an insulation 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.490
 sound not very loud but it isolates a 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.060
 little because of what we do of the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.730
 foam but if you get to isolate a little 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.660
 the noise from the foam and here in the 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.330
 hollow we fit perfectly lahore to 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.630
 approximately obviously it will touch us 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.940
 extend it and also because that's the way 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.800
 not even in my head fits then 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.860
 Well for you to know that here 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.030
 reinforced with the reinforced here the 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.919
 connector with the headphones and the cable and 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.670
 good since they said they were extra 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:31.790
 low to compare them with the extra low 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.540
 average of are and what are 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.760
 two 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.080
 mdr 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.970
 xb 450 a but then you get the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.420
 analysis but here if we look at the 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.430
 specifications tells us that it's kind 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.510
 dynamic closed has 30 millimeters 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.870
 it also has a thousand megawatts again 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:59.010
 impedance to 24 homes 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:02.790
 165 grams in the cable the cable is 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.730
 approximately 12 meters and the mimicry the 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.670
 4-wire conduit in metal 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.340
 to serve with apple and may not 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.830
 these have here for microphone to 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.010
 function and to change the songs and 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.510
 Well, do not enter, we'll do the 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.540
 respective analysis for the time being we're going 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.030
 with these and good are some hearing aids 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.740
 for people who just need 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.970
 listen to music and to those who love 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.680
 put shaft as per dj the whole sheath already 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.840
 does not recommend it also these 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.009
 hearing aids are themselves lower class because 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:42.089
 at their price here in Colombia were 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:45.210
 40 thousand pesos if in 40 thousand pesos 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:47.309
 these cost 100 thousand pesos then 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.289
 because the difference already becomes greater 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:51.599
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:54.340
 analysis remember see I'll see if they 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:59.440
 I leave here on the screen 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:03.550
 where is here on this side one half the 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.490
 analysis of the mdl xb 450 of sony many 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.150
 thanks for the video subscribe and good 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.150
 he left us
