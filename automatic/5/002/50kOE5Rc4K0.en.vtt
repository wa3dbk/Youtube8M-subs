in a position where my whole body is is

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.250 
in a position where my whole body is is

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
ready to press I'm tight chicken I can

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.350 
ready to press I'm tight chicken I can
support<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.770> lot<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.950> weight<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> that's<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
support a lot of weight so that's the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.199 
support a lot of weight so that's the
that's<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> basic<00:02:40.170> setup<00:02:40.820> let's<00:02:41.820> go<00:02:42.000> into

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
that's the basic setup let's go into

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.080 
that's the basic setup let's go into
kind<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.450> back<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> mechanics<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.440> benching

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
kind of back to a mechanics of benching

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.670 
kind of back to a mechanics of benching
so<00:02:45.090> once<00:02:45.209> you've<00:02:45.300> got<00:02:45.420> all<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.470> want<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
so once you've got all that you want to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.220 
so once you've got all that you want to
lower<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.980> bar<00:02:47.450> not<00:02:48.450> too<00:02:48.660> high<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.050> chest

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
lower the bar not too high in your chest

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.479 
lower the bar not too high in your chest
that's<00:02:49.560> going<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.890> pretty<00:02:50.070> hard<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.370> your

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
that's going to be pretty hard on your

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.580 
that's going to be pretty hard on your
shoulders<00:02:50.850> instead<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.080> want<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.260> touch<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
shoulders instead you want to touch the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.100 
shoulders instead you want to touch the
bar<00:02:52.739> just<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.340> base<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.550> your<00:02:53.760> sternum<00:02:54.110> so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
bar just to the base of your sternum so

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.150 
bar just to the base of your sternum so
when<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> lower<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.620> bar<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.890> should<00:02:56.010> come

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
when you lower the bar it should come

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.699 
when you lower the bar it should come
down<00:02:56.570> right<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:57.930> that's<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.470> open

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
down right in here that's going to open

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.130 
down right in here that's going to open
up<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.010> chest<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.300> your<00:03:00.510> shoulders<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.019> your

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
pecs kind of stretch out in a you know

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.530 
pecs kind of stretch out in a you know
strong<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.200> also<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.560> safe<00:03:04.769> way<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.540> it's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
strong but also in a safe way and it's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.520
