00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
see we're running low on food at the

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.130 
see we're running low on food at the
moment<00:01:23.960> but<00:01:25.179> we<00:01:26.179> should<00:01:26.420> have<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:26.899> built

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
moment but we should have that built

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.499 
moment but we should have that built
shortly<00:01:27.530> when<00:01:28.429> my<00:01:28.580> builders<00:01:28.940> get<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.390> here

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
shortly when my builders get to it here

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.109 
shortly when my builders get to it here
they<00:01:29.630> go<00:01:29.799> so<00:01:30.799> this<00:01:30.950> will<00:01:31.039> be<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.399> gatherers<00:01:31.940> Hut

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
five children children can no progress

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.320 
five children children can no progress
through<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.649> students<00:01:58.099> and<00:01:58.190> adults<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.209> they

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
through to students and adults and they

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330 
through to students and adults and they
can<00:01:59.479> go<00:01:59.599> straight<00:01:59.810> from<00:01:59.989> child<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.739> adult<00:02:00.950> and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
can go straight from child to adult and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.889 
can go straight from child to adult and
what<00:02:01.879> apparently<00:02:02.239> not<00:02:02.360> as<00:02:02.450> good<00:02:02.660> if<00:02:02.780> they've

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
what apparently not as good if they've

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.870 
what apparently not as good if they've
not<00:02:03.050> been<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.200> student<00:02:03.649> so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
not been a student so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.120 
not been a student so
if<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.329> set<00:02:05.600> this<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:06.079> work

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.950 

so<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.850> really<00:02:12.000> hard<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.330> tell<00:02:12.570> if<00:02:12.780> that's

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
so it's really hard to tell if that's

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.790 
so it's really hard to tell if that's
enabled<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:13.680> disabled<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.710> should<00:02:16.710> have

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
enabled or disabled and should have

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.330 
enabled or disabled and should have
really<00:02:17.240> probably<00:02:18.290> our<00:02:19.290> work<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.770> disabled<00:02:20.280> at

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
really probably our work is disabled at

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.040 
really probably our work is disabled at
this<00:02:20.460> location<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.180> means<00:02:21.510> work<00:02:21.900> is

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
this location so that means work is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.930 
this location so that means work is
enabled<00:02:22.490> right<00:02:23.490> okay<00:02:24.020> now<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.080> understand<00:02:25.940> we

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
enabled right okay now we understand we

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.840 
enabled right okay now we understand we
should<00:02:27.120> definitely<00:02:27.300> start<00:02:27.630> doing<00:02:27.870> tutorials

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
should definitely start doing tutorials

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.050 
should definitely start doing tutorials
okay<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.020> they're<00:02:31.230> often<00:02:31.530> going<00:02:31.710> I

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
okay so that they're often going I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.350 
okay so that they're often going I
presume<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.180> means<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.480> cold<00:02:33.960> if<00:02:35.360> that's

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
presume this means that cold if that's

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.830 
presume this means that cold if that's
all<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:37.370> anyway<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:39.150> late<00:02:39.330> autumn<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
all that anyway so what late autumn the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.330 
all that anyway so what late autumn the
snow<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.500> settling<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:44.070> not<00:02:44.190> looking

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
snow is settling in and it's not looking

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.400 
snow is settling in and it's not looking
good<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:44.640> my<00:02:44.820> villages<00:02:45.090> if<00:02:45.420> they're<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:46.170> can't

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
good for my villages if they're we can't

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.720 
good for my villages if they're we can't
build<00:02:46.680> up<00:02:46.860> these<00:02:46.980> food<00:02:47.250> stocks<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.580> we've<00:02:50.580> run

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
build up these food stocks and we've run

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.850 
build up these food stocks and we've run
out<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.880> potatoes<00:02:51.420> which<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:51.750> started<00:02:52.080> with

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
out of potatoes which we started with

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.120 
out of potatoes which we started with
so<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.550> am<00:02:54.730> hoping

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.130 

food<00:02:59.730> stocks<00:03:00.030> will<00:03:00.210> start<00:03:00.420> rolling<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.870> pretty

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140

sustainable so I'll be planting trees
and<00:03:22.380> gathering<00:03:22.680> trees<00:03:22.950> obviously<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.820> will

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
and gathering trees obviously that will

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.780 
and gathering trees obviously that will
take<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> few<00:03:24.270> years<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.540> set<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.460> any<00:03:26.460> fish

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
take a few years to set up and any fish

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.200 
take a few years to set up and any fish
coming<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.180> hopefully<00:03:27.390> down<00:03:28.170> on<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.410> docks

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
coming in hopefully down on the docks

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.550 
coming in hopefully down on the docks
yeah<00:03:30.210> I<00:03:30.240> think<00:03:31.250> settling<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.340> fine<00:03:33.380> once<00:03:34.380> this

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
yeah I think settling in fine once this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.280 
yeah I think settling in fine once this
is<00:03:34.740> finished<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:35.280> we<00:03:35.460> can<00:03:35.840> focus<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:37.140> getting

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.870 
is finished here we can focus on getting
firewood<00:03:40.070> just<00:03:41.070> hoping<00:03:41.280> they<00:03:41.400> can<00:03:41.520> finish<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
firewood just hoping they can finish the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.010 
firewood just hoping they can finish the
building<00:03:42.180> as<00:03:42.300> quick<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.570> they<00:03:42.660> can<00:03:42.870> before

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
building as quick as they can before

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
again this is prioritize this area I

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.000 
again this is prioritize this area I
like<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:48.050> you<00:03:48.140> can<00:03:48.260> priorities<00:03:48.650> building

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
like that you can priorities building

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.040 
like that you can priorities building
because<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:49.280> really<00:03:49.540> hard<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.840> some

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
because it's really hard in some

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.190 
because it's really hard in some
civilization<00:03:51.770> games<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.730> really<00:03:53.090> am<00:03:53.270> focus

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
civilization games to really am focus

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.170 
civilization games to really am focus
down<00:03:54.440> on<00:03:54.950> what<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.370> want<00:03:55.550> your<00:03:55.670> citizens<00:03:56.030> to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
down on what you want your citizens to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.600 
down on what you want your citizens to
do<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.680> as<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:57.830> can<00:03:57.920> see<00:03:58.070> they've<00:03:58.220> all<00:03:58.310> kind<00:03:58.520> of

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
do so as you can see they've all kind of

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.300 
do so as you can see they've all kind of
rushed<00:03:58.820> over<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.210> really<00:03:59.960> am<00:04:00.260> starting<00:04:01.160> to

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
rushed over and really am starting to

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.530 
rushed over and really am starting to
get<00:04:01.430> their<00:04:01.610> sort<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.880> knife<00:04:02.030> or<00:04:02.240> percent

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
get their sort of knife or percent

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.970 
get their sort of knife or percent
complete<00:04:02.870> now<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.550> there<00:04:04.550> we<00:04:04.640> go<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:06.260> we'll

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
complete now and there we go so we'll

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.040 
complete now and there we go so we'll
just<00:04:07.130> have<00:04:07.250> one<00:04:07.430> guy<00:04:07.580> working<00:04:07.760> here<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.360> think

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
just have one guy working here I think

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.110 
just have one guy working here I think
we<00:04:09.110> can<00:04:09.230> enable<00:04:09.530> will<00:04:09.620> go<00:04:09.740> anyway<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.250> then

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
we can enable will go anyway and then

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.360 
we can enable will go anyway and then
he'll<00:04:11.630> get<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.930> making<00:04:12.110> some<00:04:12.350> firewood<00:04:12.860> which

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
he'll get to making some firewood which

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.860 
he'll get to making some firewood which
should<00:04:13.550> get<00:04:13.700> through<00:04:14.000> because<00:04:14.510> we're<00:04:14.720> already

everything<00:04:26.419> we<00:04:26.600> can<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.840> survive<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.380> first

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
everything we can to survive the first

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.320 
everything we can to survive the first
we<00:04:27.680> could<00:04:27.830> look<00:04:27.919> about<00:04:28.160> plenty<00:04:28.730> of<00:04:28.880> food<00:04:29.030> come

we could look about plenty of food come

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.170 
we could look about plenty of food come
in<00:04:29.450> their<00:04:29.630> fish<00:04:29.900> onions<00:04:30.470> mushrooms<00:04:30.860> berries

roots<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:32.990> I'm<00:04:33.470> feeling<00:04:33.740> pretty<00:04:33.890> confident

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
roots so I'm feeling pretty confident

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.180 
roots so I'm feeling pretty confident

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
know I've seen plenty of places where

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.200 
know I've seen plenty of places where
people<00:05:13.080> just<00:05:13.650> fall<00:05:14.550> apart<00:05:14.730> their

so<00:05:42.660> we<00:05:42.750> might<00:05:42.900> have<00:05:42.990> stored<00:05:43.230> firewood<00:05:43.850> okay

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
I think we can afford to and shut this

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.540 
I think we can afford to and shut this
down<00:06:01.450> for<00:06:01.750> now

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550

you can follow them around so this is

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.680 
you can follow them around so this is
nourison<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:31.789> Builder<00:06:32.090> and<00:06:32.210> he's<00:06:32.389> picking<00:06:32.600> up

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
nourison the Builder and he's picking up

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.850 
nourison the Builder and he's picking up
resources<00:06:32.990> and<00:06:34.900> so<00:06:35.900> you<00:06:35.960> kind<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.229> have<00:06:36.289> the

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
resources and so you kind of have the

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.080 
resources and so you kind of have the
gatherers<00:06:37.280> or<00:06:37.460> just<00:06:37.639> go<00:06:37.699> and<00:06:37.789> collect<00:06:37.940> the

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
gatherers or just go and collect the

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.450 
gatherers or just go and collect the
resources<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:39.080> then<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:39.620> builders<00:06:40.039> all<00:06:40.190> kind

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
resources and then the builders all kind

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.300
