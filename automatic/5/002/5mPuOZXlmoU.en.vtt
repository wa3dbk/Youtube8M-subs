time<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.809> Evo<00:00:43.050> takes<00:00:43.350> quite<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> long<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.160> to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
time the Evo takes quite a long time to

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.619 
time the Evo takes quite a long time to
start<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:44.910> opinion<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.360> let's<00:00:45.510> see

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
start up in my opinion so let's see

start up in my opinion so let's see
which<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.079> starts<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.469> faster<00:00:46.860> I'm

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
which one of these starts up faster I'm

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.510 
which one of these starts up faster I'm
gonna<00:00:47.730> pick<00:00:47.910> them<00:00:48.030> both<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.600> kind<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
gonna pick them both up and just kind of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:01.520

town<00:00:50.520> three<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.660> three<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> they're<00:00:58.649> off

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.569 

now<00:01:02.530> one<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.859> I<00:01:02.890> said<00:01:03.160> one<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.430> things

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579

that<00:01:03.699> I<00:01:03.730> have<00:01:03.910> noticed<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.479> Evo<00:01:04.780> does<00:01:05.049> take

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that I have noticed is the Evo does take

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.800 
that I have noticed is the Evo does take
quite<00:01:06.400> some<00:01:06.580> time<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.790> turn<00:01:06.970> on<00:01:07.060> in<00:01:07.150> my<00:01:07.270> opinion

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
quite some time to turn on in my opinion

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.320 
quite some time to turn on in my opinion
it'll<00:01:08.259> get<00:01:08.409> by<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:08.619> menu<00:01:09.280> once<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.119> does

it'll get by this menu once it does

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.899 
it'll get by this menu once it does
it'll<00:01:10.690> sit<00:01:10.869> on<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.080> 4G<00:01:11.440> logo<00:01:11.830> for<00:01:12.369> Sprint<00:01:12.729> for

it'll sit on the 4G logo for Sprint for
quite<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.540> long<00:01:13.720> time<00:01:14.009> galaxy<00:01:15.009> s<00:01:15.130> in<00:01:15.220> started

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.779 
quite a long time galaxy s in started
showing<00:01:15.580> its<00:01:15.820> nice<00:01:15.970> little<00:01:16.240> animation<00:01:16.360> video

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.830 

looks<00:01:21.789> like<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.000> Galaxy<00:01:22.299> S<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.509> gonna<00:01:22.630> pull

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
looks like the Galaxy S is gonna pull

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.980 
looks like the Galaxy S is gonna pull
ahead<00:01:22.930> by<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.229> far<00:01:23.649> margin<00:01:24.479> now<00:01:25.479> this<00:01:25.659> may<00:01:25.869> have

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
ahead by a far margin now this may have

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.149 
ahead by a far margin now this may have
something<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.350> do<00:01:26.470> with<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> fact<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.039> know

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
something to do with the fact you know

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.130 
something to do with the fact you know
the<00:01:27.369> hummingbird<00:01:28.000> processor<00:01:28.600> versus<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
the hummingbird processor versus the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.560 
the hummingbird processor versus the
Snapdragon<00:01:29.770> processor<00:01:30.369> but<00:01:31.180> also<00:01:31.360> does<00:01:31.539> have

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
Snapdragon processor but also does have

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.600 
Snapdragon processor but also does have
to<00:01:31.690> be<00:01:31.840> part<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.799> bloatware<00:01:33.039> that<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.369> Evo

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
to be part of the bloatware that the Evo

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.160 
to be part of the bloatware that the Evo
has<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.819> start<00:01:34.060> up<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.360> know<00:01:34.479> being<00:01:34.720> on<00:01:34.810> Sprint

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
has to start up you know being on Sprint

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.540 
has to start up you know being on Sprint
has<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.440> load<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.649> Sprint<00:01:35.920> navigation<00:01:36.460> the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
has to load the Sprint navigation the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.300 
has to load the Sprint navigation the
Sprint<00:01:36.819> TV<00:01:37.149> all<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.050> fun<00:01:38.229> stuff<00:01:38.409> whereas<00:01:39.039> the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
Sprint TV all that fun stuff whereas the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.040 
Sprint TV all that fun stuff whereas the
galaxy<00:01:39.759> s<00:01:39.909> technically<00:01:40.420> does<00:01:40.539> not<00:01:40.659> have<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.899> do

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
galaxy s technically does not have to do

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.570 
galaxy s technically does not have to do
that<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.500> galaxy<00:01:41.860> s<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.130> now<00:01:42.280> fully

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
that so the galaxy s is now fully

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.169 
that so the galaxy s is now fully
working<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.440> see<00:01:44.649> here<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.670> Evo<00:01:45.940> is

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
working and you see here and the Evo is

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.840 
working and you see here and the Evo is
still<00:01:46.539> waiting<00:01:47.159> we're<00:01:48.159> still<00:01:48.369> on<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.610> white

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
still waiting we're still on the white

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.149 
still waiting we're still on the white
splash<00:01:49.300> screen<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:50.380> that's<00:01:50.470> not<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> good<00:01:50.920> sign

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
splash screen so that's not a good sign

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.039 
splash screen so that's not a good sign
that's<00:01:51.399> exciting<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.479> know<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.750> Evo

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
that's exciting that you know the Evo

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.590 
that's exciting that you know the Evo
the<00:01:53.530> Snapdragon<00:01:54.130> may<00:01:54.220> not<00:01:54.369> perform<00:01:54.520> as<00:01:54.940> well

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
the Snapdragon may not perform as well

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.059 
the Snapdragon may not perform as well
as<00:01:55.869> we<00:01:55.990> thought<00:01:56.200> at<00:01:56.409> least<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:56.770> startup

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
as we thought at least on the startup

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.660 
as we thought at least on the startup
process<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.640> now<00:01:57.759> it's<00:01:57.909> starting<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.330> go<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
process so now it's starting to go and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.969 
process so now it's starting to go and
again<00:02:01.299> it's<00:02:01.450> gonna<00:02:01.569> sit<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.899> 4G<00:02:02.200> logo<00:02:02.500> for

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
again it's gonna sit in the 4G logo for

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
again it's gonna sit in the 4G logo for
a<00:02:03.039> little<00:02:03.280> bit

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
a little bit

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.899 
a little bit
alright<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.469> Evo<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:05.890> finally<00:02:06.340> booted<00:02:06.789> up

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
alright and the Evo is finally booted up

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.569 
alright and the Evo is finally booted up
it's<00:02:07.149> still<00:02:07.299> initializing<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:08.049> SD<00:02:08.380> card<00:02:08.619> as

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
it's still initializing the SD card as

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.310 
it's still initializing the SD card as
you<00:02:09.729> can<00:02:09.850> see<00:02:09.970> here<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.239> Mario<00:02:10.899> background

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
you can see here the Mario background

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.390 
you can see here the Mario background
it's<00:02:11.410> currently<00:02:11.680> frozen<00:02:12.100> while<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.310> is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
it's currently frozen while it is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.520 
it's currently frozen while it is
initializing<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:13.060> card<00:02:13.329> but<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.780> would<00:02:14.290> say

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
initializing that card but I would say

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.170 
initializing that card but I would say
the<00:02:14.680> Galaxy<00:02:15.130> beat<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.459> by<00:02:15.579> about<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.850> minute

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the Galaxy beat it by about a minute

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.050 
the Galaxy beat it by about a minute
minute<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.480> half<00:02:16.769> that's<00:02:17.769> pretty<00:02:17.980> bad<00:02:18.130> on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
minute and a half that's pretty bad on

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.940 
minute and a half that's pretty bad on
the<00:02:19.180> Evo<00:02:19.420> side<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.109> would<00:02:20.680> say<00:02:20.799> in<00:02:20.890> that

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
the Evo side so I would say in that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.620 
the Evo side so I would say in that
sense<00:02:21.310> hummingbird<00:02:21.760> definitely<00:02:22.180> shows<00:02:22.390> off

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
sense hummingbird definitely shows off

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.210 
sense hummingbird definitely shows off
and<00:02:22.810> once<00:02:22.959> again<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.320> blow<00:02:23.500> wear<00:02:23.680> from<00:02:23.859> Sprint

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
and once again the blow wear from Sprint

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.220 
and once again the blow wear from Sprint
could<00:02:24.459> have<00:02:24.609> a<00:02:24.640> lot<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.000> do<00:02:25.120> with<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.450> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
could have a lot to do with that it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.750 
could have a lot to do with that it
could<00:02:26.350> also<00:02:26.470> be<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.709> fact<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.130> sense<00:02:27.489> has<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
could also be the fact that sense has to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.000 
could also be the fact that sense has to
love<00:02:28.060> HTC<00:02:28.780> Sense<00:02:29.049> which<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.530> skin<00:02:29.829> for

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
love HTC Sense which is a skin for

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.640 
love HTC Sense which is a skin for
Android<00:02:30.430> granted<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> Galaxy<00:02:32.019> S<00:02:32.140> does<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.620> a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
Android granted the Galaxy S does have a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.410 
Android granted the Galaxy S does have a
skin<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> injury<00:02:33.519> as<00:02:33.579> well<00:02:33.670> from<00:02:33.880> Samsung

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
skin on the injury as well from Samsung

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.610 
skin on the injury as well from Samsung
but<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.720> does<00:02:34.900> seem<00:02:35.049> like<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.410> little

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
but it does seem like it's a little

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.229 
but it does seem like it's a little
lighter<00:02:35.829> so<00:02:36.489> that<00:02:36.579> could<00:02:36.700> have<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.850> lot<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.090> do

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
lighter so that could have a lot to do

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:37.940 
lighter so that could have a lot to do
with<00:02:37.359> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
with it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.080 
with it
alright<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.160> next<00:02:39.190> text<00:02:39.640> we're<00:02:39.760> gonna<00:02:39.880> run

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
alright so the next text we're gonna run

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.729 
alright so the next text we're gonna run
is<00:02:40.180> going<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.390> be<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.750> browser<00:02:40.989> comparison

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
is going to be just a browser comparison

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.830 
is going to be just a browser comparison
we're<00:02:42.489> gonna<00:02:42.579> go<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.850> your<00:02:42.910> pocket<00:02:43.329> now<00:02:43.420> calm

we're gonna go to your pocket now calm
on<00:02:44.530> both<00:02:44.709> Lee's<00:02:44.890> at<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> same<00:02:45.220> time<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:46.180> I'm

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
on both Lee's at the same time so I'm

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.340 
on both Lee's at the same time so I'm
gonna<00:02:46.390> do<00:02:46.540> here<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:46.750> I'm<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.019> start<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
gonna do here is I'm going to start the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.120 
gonna do here is I'm going to start the
browser<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:50.079> this<00:02:50.170> one<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.500> for<00:02:50.709> some<00:02:50.859> reason

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
browser and this one is for some reason

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.520 
browser and this one is for some reason
in<00:02:51.220> landscape<00:02:51.640> mode<00:02:54.720> now<00:02:55.720> they<00:02:55.840> should<00:02:56.049> be<00:02:56.230> in

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
in landscape mode now they should be in

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.120 
in landscape mode now they should be in
my<00:02:56.650> recent<00:02:57.040> history

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.070 

all<00:03:01.730> right<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.390> now<00:03:02.480> what<00:03:02.570> we're<00:03:02.690> gonna<00:03:02.780> do<00:03:02.960> is

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
all right so now what we're gonna do is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.270 
all right so now what we're gonna do is
gonna<00:03:03.200> start<00:03:03.350> both<00:03:03.530> days<00:03:03.650> at<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.800> same<00:03:03.920> exact

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
gonna start both days at the same exact

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.740 
gonna start both days at the same exact
time<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.580> we'll<00:03:04.700> see<00:03:04.910> which<00:03:05.090> one<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.480> faster

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
time and we'll see which one is faster

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:14.080 
time and we'll see which one is faster
so<00:03:11.020> pretty<00:03:12.020> close<00:03:12.230> I'd<00:03:12.440> say<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:13.400> based<00:03:13.940> on

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
so pretty close I'd say this based on

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.790 
so pretty close I'd say this based on
the<00:03:14.210> status<00:03:14.600> bars<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.990> Evo<00:03:15.200> was<00:03:15.320> winning<00:03:15.650> but

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
the status bars the Evo was winning but

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.860 
the status bars the Evo was winning but
that<00:03:15.950> doesn't<00:03:16.220> always<00:03:16.340> mean<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.700> all<00:03:17.540> right<00:03:17.660> so

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
that doesn't always mean it all right so

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.560 
that doesn't always mean it all right so
the<00:03:17.960> Evo<00:03:18.230> did<00:03:18.440> load<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.860> faster<00:03:19.450> mind<00:03:20.450> you

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
the Evo did load that faster mind you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.230 
the Evo did load that faster mind you
the<00:03:20.660> Evo<00:03:20.930> also<00:03:21.260> did<00:03:21.410> load<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.680> flash<00:03:22.240> now

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
the Evo also did load the flash now

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.550 
the Evo also did load the flash now
technically<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.810> Evo<00:03:23.990> was<00:03:24.050> still<00:03:24.230> loading<00:03:24.500> a

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
technically the Evo was still loading a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.990 
technically the Evo was still loading a
loader<00:03:24.740> a<00:03:24.800> few<00:03:24.980> extra<00:03:25.220> things<00:03:25.460> passed<00:03:25.730> there

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
loader a few extra things passed there

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.810 
loader a few extra things passed there
so<00:03:26.510> all<00:03:27.170> in<00:03:27.470> all<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.920> galaxy<00:03:28.400> did<00:03:28.610> load<00:03:28.790> a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
so all in all the galaxy did load a

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.430 
so all in all the galaxy did load a
little<00:03:29.270> faster<00:03:29.630> because<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.930> Evo<00:03:30.110> had<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> load

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
little faster because the Evo had a load

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.200
