00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Well, this part here is how I said it. 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.569
 before it's time to make a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.450
 Little song, quick to us. 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.769
 learn to play basic education and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.519
 people have to have an understanding of the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.110
 hands 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.660
 We'll use both hands to play. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.270
 the guitar in your right hand to play the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.660
 rhythm to play within time is the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.670
 people basically use four fingers 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 thumb that we identify as p 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.250
 the indicator that before identifying 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.059
 how is the medium I decide the longest 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 that we identify as m and the ring 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 that we identify as the then 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.360
 basically two lines to that night 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.680
 four fingers of some 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.739
 sometimes uses but not beginner 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.039
 processing and 6 4 on the other hand 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.129
 left 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.620
 he uses to type the houses the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.719
 notes inside the houses right and the people 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.989
 basically identifies not only the courts 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.989
 here the big toe here are only colleagues to support 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:13.619
 11 23 we'll make this harmony 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.509
 that I will pass on to you because 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.110
 harmony with what I had to do chords 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.840
 that we can use two or more notes 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.840
 exchanged at the same time is here 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.700
 the finger 3 in the third house of the fifth quota 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.560
 2 the second fret of the fourth string 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.440
 you play from there and the button 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.770
 from the fifth rope down 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.640
 can play everything at the same time 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 this is the first note the second note 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.040
 You take your finger three from here from the third 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.120
 farmhouse door touches the bord lael 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 rope on court 5 remains with d2 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:03.330
 in the second house of the fourth string and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:08.820
 so the third note you pass the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:13.560
 Low staff in the first house 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.340
 second rope 2 the second house of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.340
 third rope 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.220
 and the fourth and last note 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.400
 Chord is the fourth and last, wake up well. 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.810
 be clear that you use the money 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:34.730
 3 now the rod sun m Bourdon 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.610
 d minimize the basket rope in the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.740
 third house and you only make the note here 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:49.990
 but she was 73 and only plays the three 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.990
 strings the first strings are not loose 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.850
 So this is the third cut it's good to 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.850
 harmony it all stays like this 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.670
 only this is now how our study is 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.670
 fundamental that we have 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.770
 understanding of the present time subway use 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.500
 So what's the best way to mark the 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:27.900
 your time does not mark within a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.850
 four times that of the 34 compass 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.420
 you can see on the internet you can see 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.550
 on the phone, anyway, there's a subway there. 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.130
 and right here is killing 60 beats 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.660
 with the level slow to do within the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.570
 four rings we make a rope 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.880
 so I need to see cdc there 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.220
 within four strokes every four 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:57.320
 Doors we make a rope is very 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.320
 let's go there 34 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.960
 So this is the first song for us. 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.670
 training is going on there marks the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.320
 subway will not do the note goes 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.900
 adding touches with your fingers or 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.370
 slowly points you will see that 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.850
 traveling in the music that will already have 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.670
 first experience with a harmony is 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.700
 training takes us cool and I 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.190
 I hope it has been this class. 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.540
 liked saves in stock at canteen rate 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.690
 but it was because the world watched 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.630
