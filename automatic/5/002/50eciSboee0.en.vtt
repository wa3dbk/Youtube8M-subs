check out my website to see how to make
a<00:00:13.230> frog<00:00:13.500> base<00:00:13.710> okay<00:00:14.550> so<00:00:14.610> start<00:00:15.120> by<00:00:15.180> folding<00:00:15.540> up

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
a frog base okay so start by folding up

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.470 
a frog base okay so start by folding up
one<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.170> these<00:00:16.260> triangular<00:00:16.859> tabs<00:00:17.240> this<00:00:18.240> will

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
one of these triangular tabs this will

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.670 
one of these triangular tabs this will
become<00:00:18.750> our<00:00:18.900> cockpit<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.670> open<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> flap<00:00:21.150> up

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
become our cockpit now open this flap up

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.300 
become our cockpit now open this flap up
from<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> bottom

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
from the bottom

a flap this makes an inside reverse fold
pull<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> leg<00:00:29.940> down<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> sticks<00:00:31.050> out

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
pull the leg down so that it sticks out

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.220 
pull the leg down so that it sticks out
like<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.710> then<00:00:32.070> crease<00:00:32.520> hard<00:00:33.050> do<00:00:34.050> this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
like so then crease hard do this

like so then crease hard do this
procedure<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.039> three<00:00:35.280> other<00:00:35.399> legs

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:35.729 
procedure with the three other legs

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:56.810 
procedure with the three other legs
these<00:00:36.449> will<00:00:36.659> be<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:36.809> wings

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.330 

all<00:00:57.820> right<00:00:58.480> now<00:00:58.660> with<00:00:58.870> four<00:00:59.170> wings<00:00:59.410> open<00:01:00.220> up

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
all right now with four wings open up

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.870 
all right now with four wings open up
this<00:01:00.520> flap<00:01:01.740> the<00:01:02.740> wing<00:01:02.950> we<00:01:03.100> just<00:01:03.340> made<00:01:03.520> is<00:01:03.730> going

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
this flap the wing we just made is going

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.210 
this flap the wing we just made is going
to<00:01:04.000> fold<00:01:04.210> down<00:01:04.330> that's<00:01:05.199> okay<00:01:05.590> we're<00:01:06.040> going<00:01:06.130> to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
to fold down that's okay we're going to

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.130 
to fold down that's okay we're going to
fold<00:01:06.430> these<00:01:06.640> flaps<00:01:06.700> in<00:01:07.330> towards<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:07.930> middle

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
fold these flaps in towards the middle

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.530 
fold these flaps in towards the middle
the<00:01:08.980> bottom<00:01:09.310> edge<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.640> flap<00:01:10.000> should<00:01:10.270> align

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
the bottom edge of the flap should align

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:25.240 
the bottom edge of the flap should align
with<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.990> crease<00:01:11.350> as<00:01:11.560> we<00:01:11.710> fold<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.130> in

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.040 

once<00:01:26.250> you've<00:01:26.430> got<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.670> folded<00:01:27.300> close<00:01:27.870> the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
once you've got that folded close the

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.540 
once you've got that folded close the
flap<00:01:28.290> again<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.980> wings<00:01:29.160> should<00:01:29.340> pop

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
flap again and the wings should pop

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.620 
flap again and the wings should pop
right<00:01:29.580> back<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:30.000> place<00:01:32.030> do<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.240> procedure

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
right back into place do this procedure

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:47.750 
right back into place do this procedure
with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> three<00:01:34.320> other<00:01:34.470> flaps

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.970 

and<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:49.050> it's<00:01:49.230> really<00:01:49.410> starting<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.860> look

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
and now it's really starting to look

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.400 
and now it's really starting to look
like<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.370> x-ray<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> where<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.200> pretty

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
like an x-ray this is where I got pretty

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.210 
like an x-ray this is where I got pretty
excited<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> first<00:01:53.280> time<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> made<00:01:53.730> one

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
excited the first time I made one

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.190 
excited the first time I made one
okay<00:01:56.220> now<00:01:56.490> fold<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.030> wings<00:01:57.330> up<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.900> flatten

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
okay now fold these wings up and flatten

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.260 
okay now fold these wings up and flatten
them<00:01:58.380> out

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.719 

we're<00:02:02.200> gonna<00:02:02.320> fold<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.770> edges<00:02:03.159> in<00:02:03.310> towards

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
we're gonna fold the edges in towards

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.980 
we're gonna fold the edges in towards
the<00:02:03.820> middle<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.390> will<00:02:04.570> make<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.810> wings

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
the middle this will make the wings

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:23.980 
the middle this will make the wings
thinner<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.619> both<00:02:08.800> sides<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.310> course

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.420 

when<00:02:24.990> you're<00:02:25.140> done<00:02:25.350> fold<00:02:25.770> everything<00:02:26.070> back

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
when you're done fold everything back

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.050 
when you're done fold everything back
down<00:02:26.510> increase

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.459 

now<00:02:35.060> flip<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.629> over<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.290> two

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
now flip it over and do the two

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:47.199 
now flip it over and do the two
remaining<00:02:36.829> wings

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.699 

now<00:02:48.209> here<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:48.629> gonna<00:02:48.810> deviate<00:02:49.379> from<00:02:49.409> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
now here I'm gonna deviate from the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.380 
now here I'm gonna deviate from the
instructions<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:50.909> bit<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.360> need

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
instructions just a little bit we need

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.140 
instructions just a little bit we need
to<00:02:51.540> fold<00:02:51.810> these<00:02:52.019> tabs<00:02:52.409> in<00:02:52.709> open<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.610> flap<00:02:53.909> and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
to fold these tabs in open the flap and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.930 
to fold these tabs in open the flap and
you<00:02:54.209> can<00:02:54.360> fold<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.720> tap<00:02:54.900> down<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:56.459> diagram

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
you can fold the tap down the diagram

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.270 
you can fold the tap down the diagram
says<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.420> fold<00:02:57.629> them<00:02:57.810> all<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.170> way<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.319> but<00:02:59.250> I

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
says to fold them all the way in but I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.100 
says to fold them all the way in but I
like<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.670> fold<00:02:59.849> these<00:03:00.000> tabs<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.629> side<00:03:00.840> only

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
like to fold these tabs on the side only

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.030 
like to fold these tabs on the side only
half<00:03:01.440> way<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.159> do<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.299> for<00:03:03.510> two<00:03:03.660> reasons

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
half way in I do that for two reasons

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.800 
half way in I do that for two reasons
one<00:03:05.040> they<00:03:05.459> kind<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.760> look<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:05.940> thrusters<00:03:06.569> and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
one they kind of look like thrusters and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.199 
one they kind of look like thrusters and
two<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:08.040> gives<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.340> something<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.730> hold<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.180> to

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
two it gives you something to hold on to

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.760 
two it gives you something to hold on to
while<00:03:09.599> you're<00:03:09.720> showing<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.200> off

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.580 

and<00:03:17.340> we'll<00:03:18.300> fold<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:18.720> last<00:03:19.050> tab<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and we'll fold this last tab on the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.240 
and we'll fold this last tab on the
bottom<00:03:19.740> completely<00:03:20.460> out<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.820> way<00:03:25.250> now

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
bottom completely out of the way now

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.700 
bottom completely out of the way now
we're<00:03:26.430> going<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.580> make<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.910> lasers<00:03:27.710> we're

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
we're going to make the lasers we're

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.500 
we're going to make the lasers we're
going<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.890> inside<00:03:29.310> reverse<00:03:29.340> fold<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.150> tips<00:03:30.390> of

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
going to inside reverse fold the tips of

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.870 
going to inside reverse fold the tips of
the<00:03:30.630> wings<00:03:30.710> this<00:03:31.710> is<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.040> same<00:03:32.250> technique<00:03:32.670> we

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the wings this is the same technique we

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.970 
the wings this is the same technique we
use<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.090> make<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> wings<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.290> smaller<00:03:34.620> and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
use to make the wings just smaller and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.920 
use to make the wings just smaller and
it's<00:03:35.670> similar<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.030> making<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.570> head<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.840> an

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
it's similar to making the head of an

00:03:36.930 --> 00:04:06.100 
it's similar to making the head of an
origami<00:03:37.320> crane

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.570 

okay<00:04:07.110> all<00:04:07.440> these<00:04:07.680> lasers<00:04:08.069> are<00:04:08.250> pointing

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
okay all these lasers are pointing

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.820 
okay all these lasers are pointing
backward<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.180> that's<00:04:10.050> not<00:04:10.290> going<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.500> help<00:04:10.620> us

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
backward and that's not going to help us

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.980 
backward and that's not going to help us
defeat<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.190> Emperor<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:12.390> we've<00:04:12.540> got<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> little

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
defeat the Emperor so we've got a little

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.050 
defeat the Emperor so we've got a little
more<00:04:13.140> work<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.500> do

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
more work to do

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.129 
more work to do
push<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.240> indentation<00:04:15.690> here<00:04:16.200> flat<00:04:17.959> fold<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
push this indentation here flat fold the

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.690 
push this indentation here flat fold the
tip<00:04:19.350> back<00:04:19.590> towards<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.130> front<00:04:20.160> of<00:04:20.579> the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
tip back towards the front of the

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.450 
tip back towards the front of the
fighter<00:04:24.290> then<00:04:25.290> squash<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.889> edges<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.340> the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
fighter then squash the edges of the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:36.010 
fighter then squash the edges of the
paper<00:04:26.639> over<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.270> crease<00:04:27.690> heart

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.390 

do<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.169> same<00:04:37.349> thing<00:04:37.680> with<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.039> three<00:04:38.250> other

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
do the same thing with the three other

00:04:38.400 --> 00:05:08.620 
do the same thing with the three other
lasers

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.750 

now<00:05:09.350> you're<00:05:09.530> pretty<00:05:09.680> much<00:05:09.890> done<00:05:10.190> but<00:05:10.580> there's

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
now you're pretty much done but there's

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.230 
now you're pretty much done but there's
one<00:05:10.910> other<00:05:10.970> optional<00:05:11.780> step<00:05:12.080> you<00:05:13.030> can<00:05:14.030> slide

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
one other optional step you can slide

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.090 
one other optional step you can slide
your<00:05:14.420> finger<00:05:14.720> under<00:05:14.960> this<00:05:15.110> tab<00:05:15.410> that's<00:05:15.920> the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
your finger under this tab that's the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.180 
your finger under this tab that's the
cockpit<00:05:16.580> pop<00:05:17.240> it<00:05:17.390> up<00:05:17.510> a<00:05:17.540> bit<00:05:17.660> this<00:05:18.650> works<00:05:18.920> best

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
cockpit pop it up a bit this works best

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.730 
cockpit pop it up a bit this works best
with<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.460> crisp<00:05:19.820> paper<00:05:20.150> not<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:21.320> great<00:05:21.560> with

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
with a crisp paper not so great with

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.560 
with a crisp paper not so great with
this<00:05:21.890> cloth<00:05:22.220> base<00:05:22.520> paper<00:05:22.790> our<00:05:23.030> music<00:05:25.570> and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
this cloth base paper our music and

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.330 
this cloth base paper our music and
there<00:05:27.230> you<00:05:27.350> go<00:05:27.500> now<00:05:28.220> go<00:05:28.580> save<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.910> galaxy
