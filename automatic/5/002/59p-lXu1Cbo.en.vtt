back<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> think<00:01:41.750> what

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
back this way you know I think what

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.840 
back this way you know I think what
we're<00:01:42.930> doing<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> we're<00:01:43.619> celebrating<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
we're doing is we're celebrating the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.350 
we're doing is we're celebrating the
gift<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.570> Jesus<00:01:45.990> was<00:01:46.439> into<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.460> world<00:01:47.700> now

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
gift that Jesus was into this world now

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
gift that Jesus was into this world now
December<00:01:48.930> 25th<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.500> probably<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> day<00:01:50.579> he

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
December 25th is probably not the day he

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.950 
December 25th is probably not the day he
was<00:01:50.820> born<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.329> no<00:01:51.420> evidence<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
was born on we have no evidence that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.240 
was born on we have no evidence that
that<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> day<00:01:52.409> some<00:01:52.619> people<00:01:52.829> argue<00:01:53.220> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that was the day some people argue that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.609 
that was the day some people argue that
it<00:01:53.640> couldn't<00:01:53.939> been<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.210> time<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.750> in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it couldn't been that time because in

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.319 
it couldn't been that time because in
that<00:01:55.890> part<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> world<00:01:56.520> shepherds<00:01:57.240> were

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that part of the world shepherds were

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
that part of the world shepherds were
not<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.899> fields<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.439> night<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:59.040> their

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
not in the fields at night with their

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.380 
not in the fields at night with their
sheep<00:01:59.490> because<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> was<00:01:59.880> too<00:02:00.030> cold

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
sheep because it was too cold

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
sheep because it was too cold
others<00:02:00.960> might<00:02:01.110> argue<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> little

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
others might argue with that a little

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
others might argue with that a little
bit<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.299> were<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.750> year<00:02:03.990> long

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
bit that they were there all year long

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.870 
bit that they were there all year long
but<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:04.979> doesn't<00:02:05.189> matter<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.700> say

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
but it really doesn't matter I will say

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280 
but it really doesn't matter I will say
this<00:02:06.060> there's<00:02:06.360> some<00:02:06.479> things<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.140> we've

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
this there's some things that that we've

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.839 
this there's some things that that we've
brought<00:02:07.530> into<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:07.979> belief<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> West

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
brought into our belief in the West

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.600 
brought into our belief in the West
about<00:02:09.209> Christmas<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.289> probably<00:02:10.679> don't

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
about Christmas but probably don't

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.190 
about Christmas but probably don't
belong<00:02:11.849> there<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.480> how<00:02:12.660> many<00:02:12.720> wise<00:02:13.170> men

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
belong there like like how many wise men

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.920 
belong there like like how many wise men
visited

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
visited

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.170 
visited
Jesus<00:02:14.319> on<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.650> night<00:02:14.829> that<00:02:14.859> he<00:02:15.219> was<00:02:15.400> born<00:02:15.579> well

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
Jesus on the night that he was born well

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.729 
Jesus on the night that he was born well
all<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.719> little<00:02:16.930> things<00:02:16.959> outside<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.469> church

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
all the little things outside the church

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.530 
all the little things outside the church
always<00:02:18.040> have<00:02:18.159> three<00:02:18.430> wise<00:02:18.640> men<00:02:18.879> right<00:02:19.239> front

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
always have three wise men right front

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.640 
always have three wise men right front
so<00:02:19.750> there's<00:02:19.930> two<00:02:20.019> questions<00:02:20.200> with<00:02:20.530> that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
so there's two questions with that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.979 
so there's two questions with that
because<00:02:20.909> we<00:02:21.909> know<00:02:22.180> about<00:02:22.269> three<00:02:22.540> gifts<00:02:22.750> that

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
because we know about three gifts that

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.390 
because we know about three gifts that
were<00:02:23.079> brought<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.620> doesn't<00:02:23.920> say<00:02:24.159> that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
were brought but that doesn't say that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.099 
were brought but that doesn't say that
there<00:02:24.579> were<00:02:24.700> three<00:02:24.930> wisemen<00:02:25.930> that's

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
there were three wisemen that's

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.140 
there were three wisemen that's
tradition<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:27.069> also<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.700> clear<00:02:27.969> in<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
tradition that also is clear in the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.369 
tradition that also is clear in the
scriptures<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.629> whenever<00:02:28.750> they<00:02:28.989> showed<00:02:29.230> up

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
scriptures that whenever they showed up

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.229 
scriptures that whenever they showed up
whether<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.650> was<00:02:29.739> three<00:02:30.280> or<00:02:30.459> thirteen<00:02:30.879> or<00:02:31.060> two

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
whether it was three or thirteen or two

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.599 
whether it was three or thirteen or two
is<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:32.319> wasn't<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.799> night<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.159> Jesus<00:02:33.310> was

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
is it wasn't the night that Jesus was

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.339 
is it wasn't the night that Jesus was
born<00:02:33.639> it<00:02:34.299> was<00:02:34.450> maybe<00:02:34.629> as<00:02:34.780> much<00:02:34.930> as<00:02:34.989> two<00:02:35.230> years

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
born it was maybe as much as two years

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.410 
born it was maybe as much as two years
later<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:36.370> make<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.579> lot<00:02:36.760> about<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.030> Christmas

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
later we make a lot about the Christmas

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.589 
later we make a lot about the Christmas
star<00:02:37.689> and<00:02:38.700> probably<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> Christmas<00:02:40.180> star<00:02:40.359> was

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
star and probably the Christmas star was

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.429 
star and probably the Christmas star was
not<00:02:40.750> even<00:02:41.409> an<00:02:41.650> astronomical<00:02:42.519> event<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:44.319> was

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
not even an astronomical event it was

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.899 
not even an astronomical event it was
maybe<00:02:44.739> even<00:02:44.889> the<00:02:44.950> Shekinah<00:02:45.310> glory<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.730> God

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
maybe even the Shekinah glory of God

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.270 
maybe even the Shekinah glory of God
because<00:02:46.329> it<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.689> appeared<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.590> moved<00:02:47.950> and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
because it it appeared and it moved and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.240 
because it it appeared and it moved and
it<00:02:48.370> led<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.389> Shepherd's<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.169> so<00:02:50.620> some<00:02:51.220> people

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
it led the Shepherd's and so some people

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.369 
it led the Shepherd's and so some people
would<00:02:51.519> make<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.639> good<00:02:52.000> argument<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.599> think<00:02:52.629> that

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
would make a good argument I think that

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.869 
would make a good argument I think that
it<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.739> exact<00:02:54.069> same<00:02:54.099> presence<00:02:54.669> of<00:02:54.730> God

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
it was the exact same presence of God

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.759 
it was the exact same presence of God
that<00:02:55.060> led<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.299> Israelites<00:02:55.780> through<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
that led the Israelites through the

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.970 
that led the Israelites through the
wilderness<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:58.540> night<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.109> in<00:02:59.409> the<00:02:59.530> form<00:02:59.859> of<00:02:59.889> a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
wilderness at night and in the form of a

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.699 
wilderness at night and in the form of a
pillar<00:03:00.219> of<00:03:00.310> fire<00:03:00.609> so<00:03:01.019> whatever<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.319> some<00:03:02.620> of

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
pillar of fire so whatever it is some of

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.979 
pillar of fire so whatever it is some of
the<00:03:02.769> traditions<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.519> we<00:03:03.639> have<00:03:03.969> even<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
the traditions that we have even the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.030 
the traditions that we have even the
fact<00:03:05.169> that<00:03:05.290> Jesus<00:03:05.590> was<00:03:05.680> laid<00:03:05.799> in<00:03:05.859> a<00:03:06.010> manger

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
fact that Jesus was laid in a manger

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.920 
fact that Jesus was laid in a manger
that<00:03:06.489> doesn't<00:03:06.879> mean<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.329> he<00:03:07.419> was<00:03:07.540> out<00:03:07.689> there

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
that doesn't mean that he was out there

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.349 
that doesn't mean that he was out there
in<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.139> back<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.590> stable<00:03:09.370> okay<00:03:09.909> it<00:03:10.150> means

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
in the back and a stable okay it means

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.209
