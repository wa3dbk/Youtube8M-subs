00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.530 
stop here leaving a hole about this size
about<00:01:36.780> three<00:01:37.229> inches<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.910> we<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.240> turn

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
about three inches so that we can turn

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.969 
about three inches so that we can turn
it<00:01:41.300> okay<00:01:42.300> now<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.500> ahead<00:01:43.830> and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.020 
on the side I'm just going to cut my
threads<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.960> we'll<00:02:04.200> turn<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.970> pocket<00:02:06.840> piece

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030

right to oh I forgot one thing first you

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.039 
right to oh I forgot one thing first you
need<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.000> clip<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.260> corners<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> pocket

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
need to clip the corners of the pocket

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.650 
need to clip the corners of the pocket
like<00:02:16.049> this<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.760> won't<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.480> much

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
like this so that you won't have so much

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.660 
like this so that you won't have so much
bulk<00:02:19.080> inside<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.980> want<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.340> very

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
bulk inside then you want to be very

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.990 
bulk inside then you want to be very
careful<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.900> clip<00:02:22.200> closely<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.640> cut

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
careful to clip closely but not to cut

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.949 
careful to clip closely but not to cut
the<00:02:24.840> threads

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
the threads

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.140 
the threads
clipping<00:02:27.959> fairly<00:02:28.560> closely<00:02:28.920> as<00:02:29.519> close<00:02:29.820> as<00:02:30.000> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
clipping fairly closely as close as you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.509 
clipping fairly closely as close as you
can<00:02:30.239> get<00:02:30.450> without<00:02:30.630> cutting<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.830> threads<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
can get without cutting the threads and

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.050 
can get without cutting the threads and
you're<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:34.100> 45<00:02:35.100> degree<00:02:35.280> angle<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.850> guess
