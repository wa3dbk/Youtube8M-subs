00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
okay what I want to do is work on basic

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.639 
okay what I want to do is work on basic

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
drawing with shapes get the idea of a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.950 
drawing with shapes get the idea of a

stroke Phil how fills merge the sizes of

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.049 
stroke Phil how fills merge the sizes of
a<00:00:13.139> shape-changing<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.099> sizes<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:14.969> of

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
a shape-changing the sizes and some of

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.540 
a shape-changing the sizes and some of
the<00:00:15.120> basic<00:00:15.540> tools<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.320> doing<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.400> we'll

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the basic tools for doing that and we'll

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.460 
the basic tools for doing that and we'll
draw<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:18.029> happy<00:00:18.390> face<00:00:18.600> using<00:00:19.199> some

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
draw a little happy face using some

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
draw a little happy face using some
basic<00:00:19.500> shapes<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.550> an<00:00:20.640> idea<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.060> how<00:00:21.300> that

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
basic shapes to get an idea for how that

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.450 
basic shapes to get an idea for how that
works<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.529> us<00:00:22.619> comfortable<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.220> flash

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
works and get us comfortable with flash

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.429 
works and get us comfortable with flash
so<00:00:24.449> let's<00:00:24.570> start<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.140> brand<00:00:25.350> new

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
so let's start off with a brand new

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.819 
so let's start off with a brand new
document<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:30.150> i'll<00:00:30.720> save<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:33.440> name<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.739> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
document and i'll save it name here it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.369 
document and i'll save it name here it
can<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.040> anything<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:39.200> because<00:00:40.200> this

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
can be anything you like because this

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.530 
can be anything you like because this
are<00:00:40.530> staged<00:00:40.800> areas<00:00:41.309> where<00:00:41.550> items<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.390> go

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
are staged areas where items will go

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
are staged areas where items will go
that<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:42.989> put<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.370> our<00:00:44.489> case

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that we put on it like and in our case

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.250 
that we put on it like and in our case
we're<00:00:44.850> gonna<00:00:44.940> use<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.239> drawing<00:00:45.809> objects

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
we're gonna use some drawing objects

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.069 
we're gonna use some drawing objects
that<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.590> flash<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.539> they<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.809> layers

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that are in flash and they go on layers

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
that are in flash and they go on layers
and<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.100> call<00:00:50.250> keyframes<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and on what we call keyframes in this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.580 
and on what we call keyframes in this
case<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.840> much<00:00:51.960> choice<00:00:52.260> there's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
case we have not much choice there's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.279 
case we have not much choice there's
only<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.980> keyframe<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.030> layer<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.600> these

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
only one keyframe and one layer so these

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.660 
only one keyframe and one layer so these
are<00:00:55.440> were<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> items<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:56.070> we'll<00:00:56.250> learn<00:00:56.399> more

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
are were the items go we'll learn more

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.900 
are were the items go we'll learn more
about<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.000> timeline<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.660> another<00:00:57.960> segment

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
about the timeline in another segment

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.189 
about the timeline in another segment
over<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> properties<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> item

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
over here is the properties for the item

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.720 
over here is the properties for the item
we<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.350> selected<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.609> have

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
we have selected so right now we have

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
we have selected so right now we have
the<00:01:02.820> actual<00:01:03.480> document<00:01:04.199> selected<00:01:04.680> document

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the actual document selected document

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.510 
the actual document selected document
properties<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> focus<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.920> some

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
properties and we want to focus on some

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.870 
properties and we want to focus on some
drawing<00:01:08.970> objects<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.630> flash<00:01:10.439> will<00:01:10.680> draw<00:01:10.920> for

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
drawing objects so flash will draw for

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.960 
drawing objects so flash will draw for
you<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.210> vector<00:01:12.600> drawing<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> vectors

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
you with vector drawing the vectors

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.340 
you with vector drawing the vectors
basically<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.060> drawn<00:01:15.270> by<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.540> player<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
basically are drawn by the player the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.580 
basically are drawn by the player the
flash<00:01:16.560> player<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.340> downloaded<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
flash player when are downloaded to the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
flash player when are downloaded to the
user's<00:01:19.590> machine<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.400> they're<00:01:20.549> actually<00:01:20.880> drawn

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
user's machine so they're actually drawn

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.380 
user's machine so they're actually drawn
by<00:01:21.540> flash<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.770> they're<00:01:23.460> resizable<00:01:24.210> they're

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
by flash and they're resizable they're

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.420 
by flash and they're resizable they're
very<00:01:24.659> lightweight<00:01:26.000> unlike<00:01:27.000> bitmaps<00:01:27.540> which

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
very lightweight unlike bitmaps which

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.880 
very lightweight unlike bitmaps which
require<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.000> pixels<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.720> each<00:01:30.930> coordinate

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
require the pixels for each coordinate

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.090 
require the pixels for each coordinate
to<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.130> sent<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> we're<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> learn

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
to be sent down so we're going to learn

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620 
to be sent down so we're going to learn
a<00:01:35.430> little<00:01:35.640> bit<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> different<00:01:36.420> tools

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
a little bit about the different tools

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
a little bit about the different tools
one<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.170> them<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.740> work<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.310> shape

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
one of them that will work with as shape

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.450 
one of them that will work with as shape
tools<00:01:38.939> which<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.229> rectangle<00:01:40.860> tool<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
tools which are the rectangle tool and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.639 
tools which are the rectangle tool and
and<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.380> then<00:01:43.470> there's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and you can see it here and then there's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.319 
and you can see it here and then there's
another<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.040> called<00:01:44.220> The<00:01:44.369> Oval<00:01:44.670> told<00:01:44.939> me<00:01:45.090> some

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
another one called The Oval told me some

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.719 
another one called The Oval told me some
varieties<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.140> those<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.430> spend<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
varieties of those and we can spend a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.929 
varieties of those and we can spend a
lot<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> time<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> basics

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
lot of time but we want to do the basics

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.100 
lot of time but we want to do the basics
and<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> select<00:01:51.299> these<00:01:51.509> tools<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> get

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and when you select these tools you get

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.380 
and when you select these tools you get
properties<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.799> them<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.180> work

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
properties for them that you can work

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
properties for them that you can work
with<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.840> key<00:01:55.140> thing<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.680> understand

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
with now the key thing to understand

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.490 
with now the key thing to understand
just<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> confuse<00:01:57.270> people<00:01:57.750> quite<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> bit<00:01:58.409> when

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
just to confuse people quite a bit when

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
just to confuse people quite a bit when
they<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.710> started<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.310> flash<00:01:59.579> is<00:02:00.180> there

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
they get started with flash is there

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
they get started with flash is there
with<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> shape<00:02:00.810> tools<00:02:01.110> there's<00:02:01.409> two<00:02:01.710> modes

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
with the shape tools there's two modes

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.370 
with the shape tools there's two modes
it's<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.329> mode<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.840> off<00:02:04.110> it's

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's actually one mode on and off it's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.020 
it's actually one mode on and off it's
called<00:02:04.590> object<00:02:04.829> drawing<00:02:05.310> mode<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
called object drawing mode so at the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.540 
called object drawing mode so at the
bottom<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.780> bar<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.310> some<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
bottom of this bar actually see some of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.660 
bottom of this bar actually see some of
the<00:02:08.670> dividers<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.349> modifiers<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.340> will

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the dividers we have modifiers that will

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.780 
the dividers we have modifiers that will
change<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
change the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.959 
change the
pending<00:02:13.209> on<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.930> tool<00:02:14.829> you<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.340> hand<00:02:15.579> so

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
pending on the tool you have in hand so

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.809 
pending on the tool you have in hand so
if<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.120> go<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.299> line<00:02:16.659> tool<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.530> they<00:02:18.189> seem<00:02:18.430> we

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
if I go to line tool and they seem we

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.429 
if I go to line tool and they seem we
seem<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.120> have<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.329> same<00:02:19.359> amount<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.900> fires<00:02:20.170> if

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
seem to have the same amount of fires if

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.009 
seem to have the same amount of fires if
I<00:02:20.530> go<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.010> fill<00:02:21.489> tool<00:02:21.819> same<00:02:22.689> amount<00:02:22.959> of

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
I go to the fill tool same amount of

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.869 
I go to the fill tool same amount of
fires<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.409> I<00:02:23.500> go<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.799> pen<00:02:24.069> tool<00:02:24.099> pencil

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
fires if I go to the pen tool pencil

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.949 
fires if I go to the pen tool pencil
tool<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.930> get<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> different<00:02:26.439> modifier<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.480> most

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
tool we get a different modifier so most

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.619 
tool we get a different modifier so most
of<00:02:29.170> them<00:02:29.319> many<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.859> them<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.629> object

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
of them many of them have the object

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.190 
of them many of them have the object
drawing<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.109> that's<00:02:32.290> either<00:02:32.409> on<00:02:32.739> or<00:02:32.769> off<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
drawing so that's either on or off and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.929 
drawing so that's either on or off and
so<00:02:35.439> right<00:02:35.590> now<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:35.950> off<00:02:36.159> and<00:02:36.519> then<00:02:36.670> when<00:02:36.819> it's

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
so right now it's off and then when it's

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.250 
so right now it's off and then when it's
depressed<00:02:37.329> it's<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.689> so<00:02:37.870> we<00:02:37.959> want<00:02:38.109> to<00:02:38.170> work

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
depressed it's on so we want to work

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.839 
depressed it's on so we want to work
with<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.590> off<00:02:38.799> because<00:02:39.250> that's<00:02:39.519> what<00:02:39.639> we<00:02:39.700> want

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
with it off because that's what we want

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.699 
with it off because that's what we want
to<00:02:39.909> learn<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:40.599> learn<00:02:40.689> about<00:02:40.870> drawing<00:02:41.409> in

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
to learn we learn about drawing in

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.259 
to learn we learn about drawing in
what's<00:02:42.639> native<00:02:43.980> vectors<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.310> shapes<00:02:45.970> and

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
what's native vectors and shapes and

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.369 
what's native vectors and shapes and
fills<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:48.549> i'm<00:02:48.909> going<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.180> pick<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.540> Oval<00:02:49.870> tool

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.740 

so<00:02:53.379> we<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.620> make<00:02:53.739> kind<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.129> a<00:02:54.220> face<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.909> so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
so we can make kind of a face and so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.780 
so we can make kind of a face and so
with<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.079> Oval<00:02:56.349> tool<00:02:56.379> we<00:02:56.739> draw<00:02:57.010> both<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.489> stroke

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
with the Oval tool we draw both a stroke

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.420 
with the Oval tool we draw both a stroke
and<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.510> fill<00:02:58.900> at<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.169> same<00:02:59.409> time<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.280> might

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
and a fill at the same time you might

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.330 
and a fill at the same time you might
not<00:03:00.609> seem<00:03:00.849> so<00:03:01.810> obvious<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.409> seems<00:03:02.439> it<00:03:03.159> should

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
not seem so obvious it seems it should

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.179 
not seem so obvious it seems it should
work<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.730> way<00:03:03.849> and<00:03:04.319> we'll<00:03:05.319> see<00:03:05.500> why<00:03:05.680> not<00:03:05.859> and

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
work that way and we'll see why not and

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.530 
work that way and we'll see why not and
i'm<00:03:06.250> going<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.489> change<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:06.909> stroke<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:08.109> 12<00:03:09.540> so

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
i'm going to change the stroke to 12 so

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.970 
i'm going to change the stroke to 12 so
the<00:03:10.629> stroke<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.989> actually<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.439> line<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.889> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
the stroke is actually the line on the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.949 
the stroke is actually the line on the
outside<00:03:12.370> edge<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:13.030> color<00:03:13.299> will<00:03:13.510> pick<00:03:13.750> is

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
outside edge and the color will pick is

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.059 
outside edge and the color will pick is
a<00:03:13.989> screen<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:15.430> already<00:03:15.639> selected<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:17.069> over

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
a screen it's already selected so over

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.710 
a screen it's already selected so over
on<00:03:18.159> my<00:03:18.310> stage<00:03:18.669> i'm<00:03:19.329> going<00:03:19.449> to<00:03:19.540> do<00:03:19.599> this

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
on my stage i'm going to do this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.629 
on my stage i'm going to do this
somewhere<00:03:20.109> on<00:03:20.229> the<00:03:20.349> top<00:03:20.590> left<00:03:20.859> corner<00:03:20.979> doesn't

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
somewhere on the top left corner doesn't

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.860 
somewhere on the top left corner doesn't
really<00:03:21.760> matter<00:03:22.000> we'll<00:03:22.269> move<00:03:22.419> it<00:03:22.599> up<00:03:22.690> there

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
really matter we'll move it up there

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.300 
really matter we'll move it up there
eventually<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.349> i'll<00:03:23.680> hold<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.919> shift<00:03:24.159> key

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
eventually and i'll hold the shift key

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.030 
eventually and i'll hold the shift key
down<00:03:24.430> when<00:03:24.849> you<00:03:24.940> do<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.209> shift<00:03:25.449> key<00:03:25.629> down<00:03:26.040> you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
down when you do the shift key down you

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920 
down when you do the shift key down you
get<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.250> perfect<00:03:27.669> you<00:03:27.970> get<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.150> constrained<00:03:28.690> mode

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
get a perfect you get a constrained mode

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.390 
get a perfect you get a constrained mode
which<00:03:29.139> in<00:03:29.319> this<00:03:29.409> case<00:03:29.470> gives<00:03:29.979> us<00:03:30.099> a<00:03:30.129> perfect

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
which in this case gives us a perfect

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.879 
which in this case gives us a perfect
circle<00:03:30.930> I'll<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.049> this<00:03:32.169> again<00:03:32.470> with<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.680> shift

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
circle I'll do this again with the shift

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.830 
circle I'll do this again with the shift
key<00:03:33.069> not<00:03:33.579> depressed<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.359> you<00:03:34.419> can<00:03:34.569> see<00:03:34.750> you

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
key not depressed and you can see you

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.569 
key not depressed and you can see you
can<00:03:34.989> get<00:03:35.139> different<00:03:35.760> types<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.940> ovals<00:03:37.359> shapes

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
can get different types of ovals shapes

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.280 
can get different types of ovals shapes
undo<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.729> last<00:03:39.909> two<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.870> my<00:03:43.989> first

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
undo the last two and this is my first

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.979 
undo the last two and this is my first
one<00:03:44.560> here<00:03:44.829> now<00:03:45.010> I'm<00:03:45.069> going<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.280> select<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
one here now I'm going to select it and

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.780 
one here now I'm going to select it and
what<00:03:47.349> I'll<00:03:47.440> do<00:03:47.590> first<00:03:47.859> is<00:03:48.069> zoom<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.489> on<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
what I'll do first is zoom in on the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.149 
what I'll do first is zoom in on the
stage<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:51.909> then<00:03:52.199> I<00:03:53.199> can<00:03:53.349> get<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.590> hand<00:03:53.859> tool

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
stage and then I can get the hand tool

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.259 
stage and then I can get the hand tool
which<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.459> over<00:03:54.790> here<00:03:54.849> on<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.060> toolbar

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
which is over here on the toolbar

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.780 
which is over here on the toolbar
anytime<00:03:55.900> by<00:03:56.139> holding<00:03:56.439> this<00:03:56.560> space<00:03:57.280> bar<00:03:57.549> down

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
anytime by holding this space bar down

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.939 
anytime by holding this space bar down
and<00:03:58.060> let's<00:03:58.569> drag<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.959> stage<00:03:59.229> down<00:03:59.560> here<00:03:59.769> so<00:03:59.859> we

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
and let's drag the stage down here so we

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.699 
and let's drag the stage down here so we
can<00:04:00.040> see<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.930> I'll<00:04:01.930> go<00:04:02.049> back<00:04:02.169> to<00:04:02.500> the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
can see it and I'll go back to the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.839 
can see it and I'll go back to the
selection<00:04:03.040> tool<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:05.370> you'll<00:04:06.370> see<00:04:06.609> we<00:04:06.729> can

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
selection tool and you'll see we can

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.390 
selection tool and you'll see we can
select<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.449> fill<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:09.060> stroke<00:04:10.229> separately

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
select a fill and the stroke separately

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.240 
select a fill and the stroke separately
if<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.519> select<00:04:12.729> the<00:04:13.000> fill<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.269> drag<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:15.069> can

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
if I select the fill and drag it you can

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.860 
if I select the fill and drag it you can
see<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.639> it's<00:04:15.790> separating<00:04:16.299> from<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.479> stroke

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
see that it's separating from the stroke

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.890 
see that it's separating from the stroke
and<00:04:17.139> actually<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.500> can<00:04:17.620> see<00:04:17.799> maybe<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:19.180> after

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
and actually you can see maybe the after

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.899 
and actually you can see maybe the after
effect<00:04:20.259> or<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.680> afterimage<00:04:21.459> of<00:04:21.579> where<00:04:21.789> it

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
effect or the afterimage of where it

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.719 
effect or the afterimage of where it
used<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.210> be<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:23.110> see<00:04:23.320> somewhat<00:04:23.770> covered<00:04:24.460> by

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
used to be you see somewhat covered by

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.960 
used to be you see somewhat covered by
the<00:04:24.789> stroke<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.419> so

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
the stroke and so

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.990 
the stroke and so
what<00:04:26.120> not<00:04:26.300> covered<00:04:26.660> by<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.870> stroke<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.850> use

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
what not covered by the stroke and use

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.380 
what not covered by the stroke and use
undo<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.450> put<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.780> back<00:04:30.940> do<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.030> same<00:04:32.210> thing

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
undo to put that back do the same thing

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.000 
undo to put that back do the same thing
with<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.540> stroke<00:04:32.870> or<00:04:32.990> click<00:04:33.200> once<00:04:33.440> on<00:04:33.620> it<00:04:33.830> and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
with a stroke or click once on it and

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.590 
with a stroke or click once on it and
drag<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.460> again<00:04:34.880> look<00:04:35.030> at<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.240> after<00:04:35.360> image

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
drag that again look at the after image

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.240 
drag that again look at the after image
you<00:04:35.810> can<00:04:35.900> see<00:04:35.960> how<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.230> strokes<00:04:36.620> work<00:04:36.920> they

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
you can see how the strokes work they

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.030 
you can see how the strokes work they
partly<00:04:38.090> cover<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.570> fill<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.140> partly<00:04:39.920> are

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
partly cover the fill and partly are

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.200 
partly cover the fill and partly are
outside<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.580> fill<00:04:40.790> area<00:04:41.000> for<00:04:41.360> shapes<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:44.120> we

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
outside the fill area for shapes and we

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.940 
outside the fill area for shapes and we
can<00:04:44.330> draw<00:04:44.600> on<00:04:44.630> these<00:04:44.990> separately<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:45.800> the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
can draw on these separately but the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.710 
can draw on these separately but the
shape<00:04:46.160> tool<00:04:46.400> allows<00:04:47.060> us<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.390> draw<00:04:47.570> them

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
shape tool allows us to draw them

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.020 
shape tool allows us to draw them
together<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.380> save<00:04:49.040> us<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.220> hard<00:04:49.700> work<00:04:49.910> of

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
together and save us the hard work of

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.780 
together and save us the hard work of
getting<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.390> perfect<00:04:50.990> circle<00:04:51.430> we<00:04:52.430> also<00:04:52.640> have

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
getting a perfect circle we also have

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.850 
getting a perfect circle we also have
drawn<00:04:53.480> without<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:54.140> fill<00:04:54.350> or<00:04:54.620> drawing

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
drawn without the fill or drawing

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.220 
drawn without the fill or drawing
without<00:04:55.010> this<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:56.270> stroke<00:04:56.570> it's<00:04:57.020> another

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
without this to stroke it's another

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.470 
without this to stroke it's another
alternative<00:04:58.100> I<00:04:58.220> want<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.460> undo<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.090> put<00:04:59.360> them

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
alternative I want to undo that put them

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.310 
alternative I want to undo that put them
back<00:04:59.600> together<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.640> I'm<00:05:01.640> going<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.820> select

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
back together and I'm going to select

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.280 
back together and I'm going to select
the<00:05:03.320> Oval<00:05:03.650> tool<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:04.220> just<00:05:04.870> show<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:06.170> if

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
the Oval tool and just show you that if

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.120 
the Oval tool and just show you that if
I<00:05:06.350> wanted<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.650> draw<00:05:06.890> a<00:05:07.810> fill<00:05:08.810> with<00:05:09.200> a<00:05:09.230> oval

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
I wanted to draw a fill with a oval

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.310 
I wanted to draw a fill with a oval
without<00:05:10.400> a<00:05:10.430> stroke<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.450> would<00:05:11.660> select<00:05:12.200> the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
without a stroke I would select the

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.810 
without a stroke I would select the
stroke<00:05:12.590> color<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.190> up<00:05:13.280> here<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.610> top

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
stroke color and up here in the top

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.540 
stroke color and up here in the top
right<00:05:14.600> corner<00:05:14.870> you<00:05:15.140> just<00:05:15.320> turn<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.770> off<00:05:15.890> with

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
right corner you just turn it off with

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.120 
right corner you just turn it off with
this<00:05:16.670> icon<00:05:16.880> here<00:05:17.120> which<00:05:17.450> says<00:05:17.750> no<00:05:17.930> color<00:05:18.260> all

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
this icon here which says no color all

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.080 
this icon here which says no color all
right<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:19.370> we<00:05:19.430> don't<00:05:19.580> really<00:05:19.669> want<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:19.910> do<00:05:20.060> that

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
right so we don't really want to do that

and I'm just going to select the
selection<00:05:27.590> tool<00:05:28.660> we<00:05:29.660> have<00:05:29.690> various<00:05:30.650> ways<00:05:30.890> of

that<00:05:33.980> are<00:05:34.100> drawn<00:05:34.370> in<00:05:34.730> some<00:05:35.540> what<00:05:35.630> we<00:05:35.720> call

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
that are drawn in some what we call

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.600 
that are drawn in some what we call
merge<00:05:36.290> mode<00:05:36.650> some<00:05:36.919> people<00:05:37.160> call<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:37.370> merge

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
merge mode some people call it merge

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.080 
merge mode some people call it merge
mode<00:05:37.880> but<00:05:38.180> with<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:39.470> object<00:05:39.950> mode<00:05:40.160> off<00:05:40.370> we

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.940 
mode but with the the object mode off we
can<00:05:41.300> use<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.840> selection<00:05:42.140> tool<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.500> actually

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
can use the selection tool and actually
