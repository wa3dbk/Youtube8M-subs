00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.330
 I invite you to subscribe to this channel 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.189
 It called flirtatious mint today 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.169
 let's make a super easy craft 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.360
 for the return to classes and it's a 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.290
 cartridge for pencils and does not have 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.760
 sewing 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.190
 for this we are going to need the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.020
 following items a piece of cloth 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.150
 that they have to recycle or to 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.960
 reuse some old shirt what 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.090
 it is more or less is 18 x 25 a 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.659
 Zipper that comes out to the color of the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.000
 fabric another two pieces of fabric to 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.489
 the corners of the holster is a 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.409
 purple to cross with the zipper a 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.100
 recyclable cardboard roll these are from 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.229
 the kitchen napkins a pen 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.510
 Hot or cold silicone and scissors 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.720
 then let's start let's take 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.549
 then our cardboard roll and what 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.170
 let's cut it in half I'm going to 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.170
 help with a rule 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.930
 we take the scissors and cut it 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.160
 now let's take our zipper and 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.280
 we are going to stick to the tube of the next 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.280
 shape 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.150
 if necessary we cut these excesses 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.160
 Now let's take the two pieces that 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.900
 they go in these corners and let's draw 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.200
 the circle that we form 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.209
 Now what we are going to do is cut the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.709
 circle but leaving more or less a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.709
 centimeter on the sides 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.310
 already having this so let's make some 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.269
 small cuts that remain to the line 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.269
 of the circle 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.260
 as we have our carton roll and 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.260
 let's put silicone all over the edge 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.510
 and we stick it on the cloth 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.230
 and the tabs we're hitting too 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.230
 towards the cardboard 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.670
 ah 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.650
 now let's take our snippet of 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.840
 fabric and with the cardboard already stuck with the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.490
 parts of here more let's double the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.120
 edge of the fabric and we're going to stick it with 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.120
 the silicone 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.790
 Now we are going to stick the whole cloth to 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.790
 edge of the corners 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.230
 ah 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.620
 we stick the fabric to the zipper of the 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.620
 carrying the zipper 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.890
 and now to paste this order what we're going 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.800
 to do is take the measure to paste the 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.800
 zipper edge 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.380
 and that's how our holster is 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.240
