00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.400
 and that word comes from 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.160
 and that word is enough note in what it says of the spiritual man's 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.509
 verse 15 l 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.399
 the spiritual man in growing 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.759
 junceda all things can evaluate all things discern 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.039
 through the spirit of God and the word of God 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.140
 in contrast to the natural man 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.800
 who is the natural man verse 14 says the natural man does not 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.759
 accept and understand the things of the spirit is talking about the non the 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.180
 man who does not know god the man who has not been transformed by power 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.440
 the spirit of god the man who is inconvenient however the man 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.770
 spiritual 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.700
 potentially each one of us as presidents can judge assess and 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.740
 understand the things that have to do with the spiritual life 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.540
 based on knowledge and obedience 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.730
 to the word of God 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.760
 and there it is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.010
 the plague 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.120
 know the word of God 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.100
 understand it and obey impotence we can 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.879
 know the will of God 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.639
 why 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.050
 how is this possible he kept saying he does it clear 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.420
 says pablo 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.640
 that we 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.730
 we have the mind of who 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.870
 Christ 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.520
 who dwells in us the holy spirit Christ through his spirit 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.240
 dwells in us 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 the mind of Christ is our 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 there is some insufficiency in the mind of Christ 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.100
 that would be lasting 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.159
 colossians the three clearly tells us that in Christ are hidden how many 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.160
 treasures of knowledge and wisdom all the treasures of knowledge and the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.260
 wisdom 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.530
 is limited christ absolutely not 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.400
 and the apostle Paul tells us that we have the mind of cristina 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.350
 mines when we study and read the word of God the holy spirit we 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.990
 helps understand the word of God 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.310
 because the mind of Christ is in us 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.600
 Of course that demands demand disciplines 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.370
 exercise 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.040
 demand dedication commitment but impotence we have the mind of Christ and 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.079
 we can understand and evaluate all things 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.139
 that have to do with the tremendous spirit statement 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.879
 incredible statement 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.269
 you feel limited 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.609
 copper courage 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.669
 the mind of Christ is in you 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.669
 the holy spirit is in you 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 you can not understand and evaluate always when you know 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.180
 I searched and obeyed the word of God everything we need 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.369
 for any situation or problem 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.809
 it's found 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:34.959
 in his word 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.069
 also the bible helps us 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.479
 giving us spiritual power 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:44.019
 in frames chapter 12 verse 24 do not have what to look for what the lord 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.829
 Jesus Christ makes a tremendous affirmation listen 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.689
 this is not the reason 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.549
 why this is wrong is talking the Pharisees that you do not understand 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.120
 the writers or do not know and the writers 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.799
 and the power of God 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.919
 what it says that Christ today 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.969
 the Lord tells us to know the scriptures 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.469
 is to know 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.639
 was to experience the power of God 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.109
 the equivalence that this and in it is passed 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.430
 know the scriptures to know 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.100
 the power
