00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
straight fists again D one two three

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.220 
straight fists again D one two three
four<00:03:20.120> five<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> fifth<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.230> from<00:03:21.409> D<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:23.230> DNA

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
four five a fifth up from D is a DNA

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.190 
four five a fifth up from D is a DNA
together<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.940> then<00:03:25.940> when<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:26.690> left<00:03:26.870> hand<00:03:27.079> is

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
together and then when the left hand is

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.660 
together and then when the left hand is
going<00:03:27.319> to<00:03:27.379> when<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.769> base<00:03:28.159> notes<00:03:28.370> gonna<00:03:28.519> move

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
going to when the base notes gonna move

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.059 
going to when the base notes gonna move
up<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:29.000> scale<00:03:29.239> two<00:03:29.480> notes<00:03:29.720> your<00:03:30.379> fifth<00:03:30.739> moves

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
up to scale two notes your fifth moves

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.860 
up to scale two notes your fifth moves
up<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.610> nose<00:03:31.760> as<00:03:31.940> well<00:03:31.970> they<00:03:32.390> move<00:03:32.599> they're

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
up to nose as well they move they're

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.800 
up to nose as well they move they're
moving<00:03:33.110> in<00:03:33.200> parallel<00:03:33.500> motion<00:03:34.069> which<00:03:34.340> means

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
moving in parallel motion which means

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.819 
moving in parallel motion which means
although<00:03:35.810> they're<00:03:35.989> not<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.319> same<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.739> there

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
although they're not the same that there

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.350 
although they're not the same that there
aren't<00:03:36.980> two<00:03:37.220> different<00:03:37.549> notes<00:03:37.700> they<00:03:37.909> fit<00:03:38.209> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
aren't two different notes they fit the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.210 
aren't two different notes they fit the
part<00:03:38.659> but<00:03:39.200> they're<00:03:39.409> moving<00:03:39.560> in<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.980> same

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
part but they're moving in the same

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.089 
part but they're moving in the same
direction<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:41.599> same<00:03:41.930> number<00:03:42.379> of<00:03:42.410> key<00:03:42.739> same

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
direction the same number of key same

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.319 
direction the same number of key same
number<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.370> notes<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:44.060> they're<00:03:44.209> moving

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
number of notes so they're moving

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.500 
number of notes so they're moving
parallel<00:03:44.750> with<00:03:45.260> each<00:03:45.290> other<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:47.090> once<00:03:47.329> we<00:03:47.420> get

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
parallel with each other so once we get

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.360 
parallel with each other so once we get
to<00:03:47.569> this<00:03:47.690> D<00:03:47.900> everything<00:03:48.590> moving<00:03:48.769> up<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.099> fifth

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
to this D everything moving up a fifth

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.920 
to this D everything moving up a fifth
so<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.760> can<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:50.000> move<00:03:50.150> everything<00:03:50.329> over<00:03:50.599> one

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
so you can just move everything over one

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.770 
so you can just move everything over one
white<00:03:51.109> key<00:03:51.349> right<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.489> e<00:03:52.519> now<00:03:52.879> we<00:03:53.450> got<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.690> go

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
white key right to e now we got to go

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.800 
white key right to e now we got to go
one<00:03:53.959> more<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.290> F<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:55.760> left<00:03:55.940> end<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.329> your

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
one more to F and the left end the your

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.569 
one more to F and the left end the your
fifth<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.440> moving<00:03:57.769> up<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.099> exact<00:03:58.459> same

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
fifth is moving up the exact same

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.390 
fifth is moving up the exact same
intervals<00:03:59.390> as<00:03:59.510> well<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.099> then<00:04:01.099> when<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.280> hit

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
intervals as well and then when you hit

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.460 
intervals as well and then when you hit
this<00:04:01.519> passing<00:04:01.970> note<00:04:02.120> hit<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.780> G<00:04:02.959> by<00:04:03.109> itself

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
this passing note hit the G by itself

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.830 
this passing note hit the G by itself
we're<00:04:04.430> back<00:04:04.609> to<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.849> beginning<00:04:04.940> okay<00:04:05.599> let's
