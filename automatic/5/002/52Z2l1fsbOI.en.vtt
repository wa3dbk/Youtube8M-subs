water and oil mix as you can see it's
separated<00:02:27.090> water<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.810> oil<00:02:28.050> does<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.920> make

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
separated water and oil does not make

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.480 
separated water and oil does not make
food<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.690> there<00:02:30.960> its<00:02:31.140> water<00:02:31.470> basically<00:02:32.070> and

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.170 
right around the middle hair you know
and<00:05:18.690> they're<00:05:18.930> like<00:05:18.960> wavy<00:05:19.890> but<00:05:20.160> it's<00:05:20.970> still

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
and they're like wavy but it's still

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.200 
and they're like wavy but it's still
like<00:05:21.360> really<00:05:21.870> frizzy<00:05:22.200> and<00:05:22.669> i've<00:05:23.669> always

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
like really frizzy and i've always

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.210 
like really frizzy and i've always
wondered<00:05:24.479> like<00:05:24.750> what<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.350> hell<00:05:25.530> was<00:05:25.740> that

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.930 

so<00:05:29.220> if<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.790> guys<00:05:30.000> know<00:05:30.510> if<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.979> can<00:05:32.220> tell<00:05:32.610> me

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
so if you guys know if you can tell me

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.600 
so if you guys know if you can tell me
what<00:05:33.210> it<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.710> then<00:05:34.710> that<00:05:34.740> would<00:05:35.190> help<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.580> lot

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
what it is then that would help a lot

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.600 
what it is then that would help a lot
and<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.479> do<00:05:36.780> not<00:05:37.080> put<00:05:37.350> heat<00:05:37.650> in<00:05:37.800> my<00:05:37.979> hair

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
and I do not put heat in my hair

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.380 
and I do not put heat in my hair
so<00:05:38.850> heat<00:05:39.750> damages<00:05:40.320> out<00:05:40.650> it's<00:05:41.310> not<00:05:41.669> heat<00:05:41.910> damage

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
so heat damages out it's not heat damage

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.790 
so heat damages out it's not heat damage
that's<00:05:42.660> out<00:05:42.870> of<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.229> question<00:05:43.380> completely

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
that's out of the question completely

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.280 
that's out of the question completely
but<00:05:44.729> my<00:05:44.850> hair<00:05:45.000> always<00:05:45.240> did<00:05:45.690> this<00:05:45.840> like<00:05:46.110> I

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
but my hair always did this like I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.940 
but my hair always did this like I
transitioned<00:05:47.040> for<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.790> year<00:05:48.630> about<00:05:49.169> just<00:05:49.620> about

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
washed it this side has been like a

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.570 
washed it this side has been like a
frizz

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
frizz

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.400

transitioned<00:06:29.190> for<00:06:29.370> so<00:06:29.550> long<00:06:29.699> and<00:06:29.940> it's<00:06:30.330> been

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
transitioned for so long and it's been

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.170 
transitioned for so long and it's been
so<00:06:30.900> long<00:06:31.199> and<00:06:31.410> it's<00:06:31.770> growing<00:06:32.099> out<00:06:32.490> the<00:06:32.789> same

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
so long and it's growing out the same

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.260 
so long and it's growing out the same
exact<00:06:33.840> way<00:06:34.319> like<00:06:34.650> out<00:06:35.190> of<00:06:35.490> my<00:06:35.699> roots<00:06:35.970> I'm

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
exact way like out of my roots I'm

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.520 
exact way like out of my roots I'm
starting<00:06:36.569> to<00:06:36.599> believe<00:06:36.840> that<00:06:37.169> this<00:06:37.319> is<00:06:37.500> just

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
starting to believe that this is just

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.070 
starting to believe that this is just
how<00:06:37.770> my<00:06:38.220> hair<00:06:38.520> grows<00:06:38.870> which<00:06:39.870> is<00:06:40.080> weird<00:06:40.440> because

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
how my hair grows which is weird because

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.420 
how my hair grows which is weird because
it's<00:06:43.699> just<00:06:44.699> phrased<00:06:45.470> I<00:06:46.470> know<00:06:46.830> I<00:06:46.919> keep<00:06:47.130> saying

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
it's just phrased I know I keep saying

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.610 
it's just phrased I know I keep saying
the<00:06:47.580> same<00:06:47.610> thing<00:06:48.060> but<00:06:48.270> it<00:06:48.419> really<00:06:48.599> baffles<00:06:49.289> me

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
the same thing but it really baffles me

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.430 
the same thing but it really baffles me
like<00:06:50.009> I<00:06:50.340> really<00:06:51.090> don't<00:06:51.270> understand<00:06:52.199> you<00:06:52.380> know

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
like I really don't understand you know

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.129 
like I really don't understand you know
what's<00:06:52.710> going<00:06:52.979> on<00:06:53.069> with<00:06:53.250> this<00:06:53.430> patch<00:06:53.639> but<00:06:54.150> here

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
what's going on with this patch but here

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.430 
what's going on with this patch but here
it<00:06:55.259> is<00:06:55.410> this<00:06:56.280> is<00:06:56.580> what<00:06:57.210> it<00:06:57.330> looks<00:06:57.569> like<00:06:57.660> after

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
it is this is what it looks like after

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.430 
it is this is what it looks like after
it's<00:06:58.740> washed<00:06:59.280> or<00:07:00.030> after<00:07:00.930> it's<00:07:01.139> deep

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
it's washed or after it's deep

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.350 
it's washed or after it's deep
conditioned<00:07:02.220> and<00:07:02.400> deep<00:07:02.580> conditioning<00:07:03.150> is<00:07:03.330> not

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
conditioned and deep conditioning is not

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.180 
conditioned and deep conditioning is not
something<00:07:03.930> that<00:07:04.080> I<00:07:04.110> do<00:07:04.229> very<00:07:04.819> very<00:07:05.819> often<00:07:06.150> so

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
something that I do very very often so

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.589 
something that I do very very often so
when<00:07:08.190> I<00:07:08.250> do<00:07:08.370> have<00:07:08.520> time<00:07:09.000> to<00:07:09.210> deep<00:07:09.360> condition

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
when I do have time to deep condition

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:14.839 
when I do have time to deep condition
it's<00:07:10.319> like<00:07:10.530> a<00:07:10.560> god<00:07:10.889> set<00:07:12.349> so<00:07:13.349> I<00:07:13.889> may<00:07:14.580> make

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:14.849 
it's like a god set so I may make

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:17.420 
it's like a god set so I may make
another<00:07:15.180> part<00:07:15.539> to<00:07:15.599> this<00:07:15.750> video<00:07:16.289> maybe<00:07:16.919> maybe

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
another part to this video maybe maybe

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.140 
another part to this video maybe maybe
now<00:07:17.610> I<00:07:17.639> will<00:07:17.759> see<00:07:18.270> how<00:07:18.539> I'm<00:07:18.720> feeling<00:07:19.250> I<00:07:20.250> think

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
now I will see how I'm feeling I think

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.140 
now I will see how I'm feeling I think
I'm<00:07:21.300> gonna<00:07:21.479> just<00:07:21.840> twist<00:07:22.349> my<00:07:22.650> hair<00:07:22.949> up<00:07:23.190> and<00:07:23.490> I<00:07:24.090> do

I'm gonna just twist my hair up and I do

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.330 
I'm gonna just twist my hair up and I do
have<00:07:24.509> a<00:07:24.539> cuticle<00:07:24.960> steamer<00:07:25.500> so<00:07:25.919> I<00:07:25.949> might<00:07:26.310> just

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
have a cuticle steamer so I might just

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.520 
have a cuticle steamer so I might just
theme<00:07:26.880> after<00:07:27.479> the<00:07:28.229> words<00:07:28.440> after<00:07:28.919> I<00:07:29.220> twist<00:07:29.610> it

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.530 
theme after the words after I twist it
