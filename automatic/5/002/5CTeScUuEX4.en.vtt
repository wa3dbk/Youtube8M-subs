remover<00:01:16.590> work<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.860> out<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:20.140> putting

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
remover work that out so I'm putting

00:01:20.380 --> 00:02:01.100

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.710 

and<00:02:01.650> it's<00:02:01.830> okay<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.370> gets<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.940> UM

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.609 

on<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.470> rap<00:02:06.680> it's<00:02:07.520> okay<00:02:08.229> not<00:02:09.229> going<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.470> hurt

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
on the rap it's okay not going to hurt

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.140 
on the rap it's okay not going to hurt
it<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:09.950> mean<00:02:10.820> I'm<00:02:10.880> not<00:02:11.030> using<00:02:11.210> this<00:02:11.420> rap<00:02:13.150> over

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150

it I mean I'm not using this rap over
again<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:18.230> reason<00:02:18.380> why<00:02:18.590> I'm<00:02:18.680> overlapping

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
again so the reason why I'm overlapping

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.660 
again so the reason why I'm overlapping
this<00:02:19.580> flu<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.950> because<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.100> is<00:02:22.250> what's<00:02:22.490> going

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
