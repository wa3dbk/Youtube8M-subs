00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:18.500
 so these are the ones and I give them the 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:21.020
 welcome to me that I bring you a video 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 collaborative with some facebook girls 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.250
 it's a group called new 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.990
 youtubers generation in the Box 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.369
 information will be all the links 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.019
 to the channels of the girls that are 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.930
 participating so that you can 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.360
 move to this collaboration consists of 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.879
 get inspired or recreate a makeup 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.280
 some famous singer and in my case 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.110
 I chose the singer belinda I hope that 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.750
 they like it very much and I leave them with the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.850
 tutorial ok well let's start with 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.100
 the eyebrows after having combed them 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.280
 little I'm going to do a little delineated 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.469
 thicker than normally 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.190
 used because in this look belinda brings 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.739
 very thick and very populated eyebrows 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.820
 with a dark brown shade and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.479
 Brown 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.240
 I'm going to start filling in the outline 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.620
 what I just did to achieve the effect 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.620
 that she brings in her eyebrows 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 it does not have very well defined eyebrows 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.850
 but rather like a little 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.690
 disheveled so I'll try to 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.100
 give this look to my eyebrows with this 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.600
 brush and now I will move to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.479
 outline a little bit more my nose 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.660
 because she has it very very small 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.000
 then I will try to outline the 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.540
 to make it a little smaller 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.540
 visually 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.120
 but I 'm going to make sure to blur 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.520
 well so you do not notice those 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.100
 now we go with the face in the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.350
 photography does not show a very contour 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.750
 marked then I nothing else I'm going to 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.850
 contribute a bit of outline in this 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.190
 part of here to give dimension to my 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.620
 face and now I'm going to apply primer in 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.490
 all the almond in my eyelid and is 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.490
 using a gray shadow or rather 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.780
 gray coffee you are already in all the almond 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.810
 of my eyelid and then with a shadow 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.450
 brown a little darker I'm going to 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.420
 Apply only on the corner of the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.090
 eye 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.090
 to give it a little more depth 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.730
 let's blur very well and now I'm going to 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.490
 give light to the brow bone applying 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.490
 a shadow in vanilla color 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.750
 now I will use this white pencil 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.390
 of the tango brand and I'm going to apply it 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.900
 right on the eyelid water line 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.120
 bottom with this down of the brand 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.670
 jordan I'm going to do a very delineated 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.160
 thin but this time I'm not going to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.800
 take out tail I'm just going to delineate 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.200
 eyes and I will not get to Asia in 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.300
 tear 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.569
 I will be applying false eyelashes 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.160
 and then mascara she brings 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.810
 very abundant eyelashes and very 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.390
 long then I think these are 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.480
 perfect and now I'm going to apply a 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.970
 little bit of blush in orange 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 and a little illuminator only in 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.310
 key points like the nose the bow of 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.170
 cupid's chin and just above 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.170
 the cheekbones and the forehead 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.420
 now let's move on to the interesting thing about this 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:49.659
 Make your lips as you could see 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.930
 the eyes are very very natural but the 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.810
 lips bring a very red color on 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.599
 so I'm going to outline my lips with 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.079
 a unit pencil and then I'm going to 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.540
 fill with this beautiful lipstick 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.689
 in red is the number 12 of the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.090
 mini 3 brand and I'm going to make sure that 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.090
 have a perfect finish 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.090
 when I use red lipstick I like it and 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.000
 perfect the finish very well is 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.310
 why for any imperfection 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.970
 with a little concealer and a brush 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.390
 synthetic I'm delineating perfectly 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.290
 so they look very, very bad states and 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.290
 perfect 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.720
 it is important to blur this very well 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.870
 line and then the stamp with the powder 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.870
 translucent or with compact powder 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.850
 and good my girls this is the result 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.380
 of the makeup I hope you liked it 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.380
 lots of kisses 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.610
 lighting girls the truth is that it has 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.620
 been very days 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.110
 and I could not get better 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.090
 lighting in fact I think that right now 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.370
 making it a bit better but the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.310
 shadows do not convince me much that's why 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.469
 that it is from where you are changing but 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.300
 I really hope you liked it 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.090

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.219
