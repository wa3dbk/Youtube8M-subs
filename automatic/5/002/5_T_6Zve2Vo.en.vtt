 Hey guys, with this video here, I 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.929
 will I doing concerning to the album 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.460
 How did you promise in the video? 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.990
 previous 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.130
 I was doing another video that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.440
 You had to make a match. 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.310
 configuration only I found that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.130
 I was a little ugly when it started 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.320
 launch system co 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.150
 Why vote using another method 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.940
 maybe it's like this method half a fool 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.829
 So, but I thought I thought it was cool. 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:44.640
 guys in case if you are a system 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.750
 that you will always use the case here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.410
 I use more windows 8 in case you can 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:59.100
 to use more there in everything that happens and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.890
 enter the bios here in the city of butte 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 I 'll do it in case here today is the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.750
 directed by the hd where it is and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 here the announcement 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.270
 windows 8 in case you have windows 8 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.530
 Have you been a priority to hd? 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.299

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.440
 x 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.520
 I think in this case it has already been started 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.070
 directly the system that you 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.230
 selected the so there and will be much more 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.830

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.610
