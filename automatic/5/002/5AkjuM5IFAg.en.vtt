simultaneously<00:02:12.300> via<00:02:12.750> bluetooth<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:14.190> have

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
simultaneously via bluetooth so we have

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.550 
simultaneously via bluetooth so we have
a<00:02:14.340> completely<00:02:14.700> wireless<00:02:15.300> solution<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.410> your

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
a completely wireless solution for your

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.410 
a completely wireless solution for your
system<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.760> don't<00:02:17.790> even<00:02:18.000> want<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
system if you don't even want to have a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.199 
system if you don't even want to have a
radio<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.930> your<00:02:19.050> car<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.220> do<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.580> this

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
radio in your car we can do that this

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.780 
radio in your car we can do that this
becomes<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.780> source<00:02:22.020> unit<00:02:22.410> or<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.610> want

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
becomes your source unit or if you want

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.400 
becomes your source unit or if you want
to<00:02:23.849> integrate<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.930> your<00:02:25.170> factory

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
to integrate this with your factory

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.530 
to integrate this with your factory
system<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.459> do<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.700> too<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.420> will

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
system we can do that too this will

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.869 
system we can do that too this will
simply<00:02:27.900> switch<00:02:28.140> between<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.650> two<00:02:28.730> all<00:02:29.730> we

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
simply switch between the two all we

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.869 
simply switch between the two all we
have<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.599> IQR<00:02:31.290> C<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.280> allows<00:02:32.610> us<00:02:32.640> to

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
have here is the IQR C this allows us to

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.509 
have here is the IQR C this allows us to
control<00:02:33.090> one<00:02:33.629> or<00:02:33.870> two<00:02:34.379> subwoofer<00:02:35.040> amplifiers

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
control one or two subwoofer amplifiers

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.180 
control one or two subwoofer amplifiers
simultaneously<00:02:36.480> now<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.410> not<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:38.010> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
simultaneously now this is not just a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.430 
simultaneously now this is not just a
bass<00:02:38.489> knob<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.569> an<00:02:39.690> intelligent<00:02:40.319> way<00:02:40.410> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
bass knob this is an intelligent way to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.199 
bass knob this is an intelligent way to
control<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> subwoofers<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.489> your<00:02:41.760> system

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
control the subwoofers in your system

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.930 
control the subwoofers in your system
not<00:02:42.870> only<00:02:42.900> does<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.349> do<00:02:43.560> level<00:02:43.890> control<00:02:44.310> but<00:02:44.879> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
not only does it do level control but it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.180 
not only does it do level control but it
also<00:02:45.090> allows<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.720> set<00:02:46.050> boost<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.160> can

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
also allows you to set boost you can

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.890 
also allows you to set boost you can
actually<00:02:47.730> choose<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.090> frequency<00:02:48.510> at<00:02:48.840> which

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
actually choose the frequency at which

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.930 
actually choose the frequency at which
you're<00:02:49.200> boosting<00:02:49.440> your<00:02:49.709> bass<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.370> then

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you're boosting your bass and then

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940 
you're boosting your bass and then
you've<00:02:51.120> got<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.540> bandwidth<00:02:52.050> control<00:02:52.530> which<00:02:52.800> is

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
you've got a bandwidth control which is

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.979 
you've got a bandwidth control which is
like<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.129> cue<00:02:53.459> factor<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.569> want<00:02:54.780> P

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
like a cue factor so if you want P

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.410 
like a cue factor so if you want P
keynote<00:02:55.500> bass<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:56.160> can<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.489> that<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.209> want

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
keynote bass we can do that if you want

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.390 
keynote bass we can do that if you want
smooth<00:02:57.720> transitions<00:02:58.409> between<00:02:58.470> sub<00:02:59.010> bass<00:02:59.190> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
smooth transitions between sub bass and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.910 
smooth transitions between sub bass and
mid<00:02:59.519> bass<00:02:59.670> we<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.360> do<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.629> too<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:01.409> from<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
mid bass we can do that too all from the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.129 
mid bass we can do that too all from the
knob
