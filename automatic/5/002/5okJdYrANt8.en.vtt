00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050 

I<00:00:00.089> was<00:00:00.359> asked<00:00:00.690> by<00:00:00.870> one<00:00:01.319> of<00:00:01.560> my<00:00:01.680> subscribers<00:00:02.060> how

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
I was asked by one of my subscribers how

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.760 
I was asked by one of my subscribers how
to<00:00:03.120> measure<00:00:04.040> chain<00:00:05.040> we're<00:00:05.779> using<00:00:06.779> method

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
to measure chain we're using method

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.950 
to measure chain we're using method
other<00:00:07.980> than<00:00:08.099> using<00:00:08.550> like<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.030> little<00:00:09.719> gauge

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
other than using like the little gauge

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.230 
other than using like the little gauge
now<00:00:10.769> my<00:00:10.920> personal<00:00:11.070> preference<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.759> using<00:00:12.090> like

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
now my personal preference is using like

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.600 
now my personal preference is using like
the<00:00:12.360> little<00:00:12.540> gauge<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.740> one's<00:00:13.920> by<00:00:14.099> part<00:00:14.370> tool

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
the little gauge this one's by part tool

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.840 
the little gauge this one's by part tool
it's<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> cc<00:00:15.269> 3<00:00:15.599> there's<00:00:15.960> also<00:00:16.289> CC<00:00:16.710> 3.2<00:00:17.580> which<00:00:17.699> is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
it's a cc 3 there's also CC 3.2 which is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.689 
it's a cc 3 there's also CC 3.2 which is
a<00:00:17.880> little<00:00:18.029> bit<00:00:18.150> longer<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.619> easy<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a little bit longer and it's so easy you

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.269 
a little bit longer and it's so easy you
just<00:00:21.060> put<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.930> there<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.380> drop<00:00:22.800> down<00:00:23.010> if

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
just put one in there you drop down if

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.769 
just put one in there you drop down if
it<00:00:23.400> drops<00:00:23.670> down<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.890> 0.75<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.099> means<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.490> a

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
it drops down the 0.75 that means it's a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.750 
it drops down the 0.75 that means it's a
3/4<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> %<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.400> drops<00:00:29.640> down

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
3/4 or a % of where if that drops down

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.260 
3/4 or a % of where if that drops down
and<00:00:30.679> you<00:00:31.679> drop<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> other<00:00:32.279> way<00:00:32.489> then

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and you drop it down the other way then

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.639 
and you drop it down the other way then
that<00:00:33.420> means<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.920> 1%<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.100> where<00:00:36.500> in<00:00:37.500> either

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that means it's 1% of where in either

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.889 
that means it's 1% of where in either
case<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.340> drops<00:00:38.610> down<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
case if that drops down you want to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.880 
case if that drops down you want to
replace<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> chain<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.960> 1%<00:00:42.960> drops<00:00:43.620> down

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
replace the chain if you 1% drops down

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
replace the chain if you 1% drops down
then<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.390> chain<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.020> worn<00:00:46.260> probably

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
then the chain is really worn probably

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.850 
then the chain is really worn probably
want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> replace<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:48.230> freewheel<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
want to replace the freewheel and the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.920 
want to replace the freewheel and the
chain<00:00:50.250> rings<00:00:50.570> but<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> show<00:00:51.870> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
chain rings but I'm going to show you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.799 
chain rings but I'm going to show you
how<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> measure<00:00:52.890> chain<00:00:53.850> wear<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.550> ruler

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
how to measure chain wear with a ruler

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
how to measure chain wear with a ruler
they<00:00:58.739> call<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> chain<00:00:59.340> stretch<00:00:59.640> but<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> chain

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
they call it chain stretch but the chain

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
they call it chain stretch but the chain
really<00:01:00.510> doesn't<00:01:00.899> stretch<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:02.129> happens<00:01:02.520> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
really doesn't stretch what happens is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
really doesn't stretch what happens is
the<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.390> rivets<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:03.989> pins<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the little rivets or pins and the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.219 
the little rivets or pins and the
bushings<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.700> they're<00:01:05.880> inside<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.900> worn

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
bushings that they're inside get worn

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.660 
bushings that they're inside get worn
when<00:01:07.920> they're<00:01:08.100> brand<00:01:08.369> new

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
when they're brand new

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
when they're brand new
you<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> bushing<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you have the bushing and you have the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
you have the bushing and you have the
pin<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.100> nice<00:01:11.280> tight<00:01:11.549> fit<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.750> pin

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
pin it's a nice tight fit but as the pin

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.450 
pin it's a nice tight fit but as the pin
gets<00:01:13.110> worn<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> inside<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> bushing

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
gets worn and the inside of the bushing

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
gets worn and the inside of the bushing
gets<00:01:14.670> worn<00:01:14.970> also<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.350> gets<00:01:16.439> pulled<00:01:16.710> up

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
gets worn also now it gets pulled up

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
gets worn also now it gets pulled up
against<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> edge<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.900> in

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
against the edge and so you have that in

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.310 
against the edge and so you have that in
each<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.220> links<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.869> little

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
each of the little links that the little

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
each of the little links that the little
pan<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.710> pulling<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.340> side<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
pan is pulling to the one side of a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
pan is pulling to the one side of a
larger<00:01:24.630> hole<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.920> chain<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.220> appears

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
larger hole and the chain just appears

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.510 
larger hole and the chain just appears
to<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:26.909> longer<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> ruler<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.430> ahead

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to get longer with a ruler if I go ahead

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.499 
to get longer with a ruler if I go ahead
and<00:01:29.880> put<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.720> beginning<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.369> ruler<00:01:32.549> right

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and put the beginning of the ruler right

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.240 
and put the beginning of the ruler right
on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.079> center<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.710> pin<00:01:34.979> every<00:01:35.970> pin<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.570> be

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
on the center of pin every pin should be

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.120 
on the center of pin every pin should be
about<00:01:38.250> 1/2<00:01:38.880> inch<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.200> should<00:01:40.409> lie<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.950> all

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
about 1/2 inch so they should lie up all

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880 
about 1/2 inch so they should lie up all
the<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> 12<00:01:42.210> inch<00:01:42.390> mark<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.860> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the way down to the 12 inch mark so I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
the way down to the 12 inch mark so I
line<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> start<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> ruler<00:01:45.119> right<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
line up the start of the ruler right the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.560 
line up the start of the ruler right the
center<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> pins<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
center of one of the pins over here and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.999 
center of one of the pins over here and
then<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> gets<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> 12<00:01:49.470> inch<00:01:49.680> mark

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
then when it gets to the 12 inch mark

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.670 
then when it gets to the 12 inch mark
down<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:51.990> about

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
down there you can see it's right about

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.679 
down there you can see it's right about
the<00:01:52.829> center<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.430> pin<00:01:53.640> there<00:01:53.970> that's

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the center of the pin there that's

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.959 
the center of the pin there that's
because<00:01:54.840> there's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> brand<00:01:55.439> new<00:01:55.590> chain<00:01:56.100> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
because there's a brand new chain so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.749 
because there's a brand new chain so
there's<00:01:57.750> nowhere<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:59.490> let<00:01:59.670> me

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
there's nowhere on it at all now let me

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
there's nowhere on it at all now let me
go<00:01:59.880> ahead<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.119> show<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.780> chain<00:02:01.170> that's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
go ahead and show you a chain that's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.429 
go ahead and show you a chain that's
actually<00:02:02.100> worn<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.719> first<00:02:04.020> I'll<00:02:04.170> show<00:02:04.200> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
actually worn so first I'll show you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.249 
actually worn so first I'll show you
what<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> gauge<00:02:04.950> here's<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> gauge<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.140> go

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
what the gauge here's the gauge and I go

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.260 
what the gauge here's the gauge and I go
down<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.190> drops<00:02:08.459> right<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.970> that's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
down and then that drops right in that's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.089 
down and then that drops right in that's
the<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:10.440> point<00:02:11.160> oh<00:02:11.310> that's<00:02:11.690> one

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
the one point oh that's one

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.670 
the one point oh that's one
percent<00:02:13.670> where<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:14.629> that<00:02:14.659> just<00:02:15.439> drops

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
percent where and that just drops

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.350 
percent where and that just drops
through<00:02:15.890> right<00:02:16.099> nice<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.400> easy<00:02:16.670> there's<00:02:17.180> not

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
through right nice and easy there's not

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.839 
through right nice and easy there's not
even<00:02:17.390> any<00:02:17.769> resistance<00:02:18.769> down<00:02:19.069> there<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.670> also

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
even any resistance down there and also

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.020 
even any resistance down there and also
you<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.659> go<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.319> check<00:02:22.099> further

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
you can go in and and check further

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.110 
you can go in and and check further
links<00:02:23.629> and<00:02:24.099> see<00:02:25.099> if<00:02:25.250> any<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.489> like<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.849> like

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
links and see if any of like that like

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.410 
links and see if any of like that like
that<00:02:26.299> but<00:02:26.480> they're<00:02:26.659> all<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:27.560> chain<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.280> just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
that but they're all this chain is just

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.500 
that but they're all this chain is just
worn<00:02:29.420> let<00:02:30.349> me<00:02:30.440> show<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.890> ruler<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.450> I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
worn let me show you what the ruler so I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.089 
worn let me show you what the ruler so I
line<00:02:32.720> up<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> beginning<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.319> ruler<00:02:33.530> right

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
line up the beginning of the ruler right

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.940 
line up the beginning of the ruler right
to<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.340> center<00:02:34.579> of<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.730> pin<00:02:34.909> over<00:02:35.120> here<00:02:35.950> okay

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
to the center of the pin over here okay

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
to the center of the pin over here okay
so<00:02:36.980> here's<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> other<00:02:37.489> end<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.940> ruler<00:02:38.180> as

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
so here's the other end of the ruler as

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.339 
so here's the other end of the ruler as
you<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.810> see<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.920> pin<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.670> well<00:02:41.090> past<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:42.049> 12

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
you can see the pin is well past the 12

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.920 
you can see the pin is well past the 12
inch<00:02:42.560> mark<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.250> what<00:02:44.030> we're<00:02:44.150> looking<00:02:44.450> at<00:02:44.599> is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
inch mark and what we're looking at is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.149 
inch mark and what we're looking at is
the<00:02:45.409> center<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.159> the<00:02:46.370> pin<00:02:47.079> if<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.620> center<00:02:49.040> of

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
the center of the pin if the center of

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.619 
the center of the pin if the center of
the<00:02:49.280> pin<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:51.129> like<00:02:52.129> a<00:02:52.159> less<00:02:52.639> than<00:02:52.670> 1/16<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.510> an

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
the pin is like a less than 1/16 of an

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.190 
the pin is like a less than 1/16 of an
inch<00:02:54.010> past<00:02:55.010> 12<00:02:55.430> inch<00:02:55.579> mark<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.450> okay<00:02:56.810> go

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
inch past 12 inch mark and it's okay go

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.690 
inch past 12 inch mark and it's okay go
you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.530> ahead<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.799> continue<00:02:58.129> using<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
you can go ahead and continue using the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.140 
you can go ahead and continue using the
chain<00:02:59.150> if<00:02:59.359> it's<00:03:00.340> over<00:03:01.340> sixteenth<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.909> an<00:03:02.030> inch

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
chain if it's over sixteenth of an inch

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.149 
chain if it's over sixteenth of an inch
then<00:03:03.019> you'll<00:03:03.170> want<00:03:03.349> to<00:03:03.379> go<00:03:03.500> ahead<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.829> replace

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
then you'll want to go ahead and replace

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.990 
then you'll want to go ahead and replace
the<00:03:04.190> end<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:05.060> chain<00:03:05.530> if<00:03:06.530> if<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.489> over<00:03:07.790> an

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
the end the chain if if it's over an

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.339 
the end the chain if if it's over an
eighth<00:03:08.329> of<00:03:08.510> an<00:03:08.629> inch<00:03:08.780> past<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.040> 12<00:03:11.000> inch<00:03:11.930> mark

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
eighth of an inch past the 12 inch mark

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.170 
eighth of an inch past the 12 inch mark
and<00:03:12.560> again<00:03:13.010> we're<00:03:13.250> talking<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.639> center<00:03:14.060> of

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
and again we're talking to the center of

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.660 
and again we're talking to the center of
the<00:03:14.269> pin<00:03:14.510> then<00:03:15.500> at<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.799> point<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.310> chain<00:03:16.519> is

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the pin then at that point the chain is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.580 
the pin then at that point the chain is
extremely<00:03:17.209> worn<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:17.989> probably<00:03:18.349> want<00:03:18.560> to

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
extremely worn and you probably want to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.879 
extremely worn and you probably want to
want<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.980> hit<00:03:19.129> replace<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:20.389> chain<00:03:21.349> rings<00:03:21.590> and

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
want to hit replace the chain rings and

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.000 
want to hit replace the chain rings and
the<00:03:22.099> freewheel<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.900> chain<00:03:24.230> here<00:03:24.799> is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
the freewheel and this chain here is

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.650 
the freewheel and this chain here is
extremely<00:03:25.579> worn<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.090> I'm<00:03:26.150> probably<00:03:26.389> going<00:03:26.599> to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
extremely worn so I'm probably going to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.680 
extremely worn so I'm probably going to
replace<00:03:26.959> everything<00:03:28.030> anyway<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.090> that's<00:03:29.329> how

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
replace everything anyway so that's how

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.650 
replace everything anyway so that's how
you<00:03:29.750> measure<00:03:30.260> chain<00:03:31.220> wear<00:03:31.549> with<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.150> ruler<00:03:32.389> I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
you measure chain wear with a ruler I

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.190 
you measure chain wear with a ruler I
hope<00:03:33.079> this<00:03:33.199> helps<00:03:33.590> Thanks
