sup everyone welcome to your fourth
tutorial<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.689> flash<00:00:04.250> today<00:00:05.250> we're<00:00:05.460> going<00:00:05.580> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
tutorial and flash today we're going to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.890 
tutorial and flash today we're going to
be<00:00:05.759> creating<00:00:06.000> our<00:00:06.420> first<00:00:06.810> actual<00:00:07.140> animation

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
be creating our first actual animation

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.620 
be creating our first actual animation
so<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.130> be<00:00:11.130> able<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.400> animate<00:00:11.790> our<00:00:11.910> image<00:00:12.420> we

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
so to be able to animate our image we

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.870 
so to be able to animate our image we
first<00:00:12.900> need<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.170> understand<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.580> thing

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
first need to understand this thing

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.019 
first need to understand this thing
called<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.269> timeline<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.250> timeline<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
called the timeline and the timeline is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.330 
called the timeline and the timeline is
made<00:00:18.359> up<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:19.230> bunch<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.619> these<00:00:19.740> tiny<00:00:20.220> little

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
made up of a bunch of these tiny little

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.509 
made up of a bunch of these tiny little
rectangles<00:00:21.240> each<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> them<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.949> called<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
rectangles each one of them is called a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.620 
rectangles each one of them is called a
frame<00:00:24.710> now<00:00:25.710> while<00:00:25.890> each<00:00:26.070> frame<00:00:26.510> represents<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
frame now while each frame represents is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830 
frame now while each frame represents is
a<00:00:27.660> slightly<00:00:28.170> different<00:00:28.619> image<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.570> then<00:00:30.570> when

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
a slightly different image and then when

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.260 
a slightly different image and then when
you<00:00:30.960> play<00:00:31.260> each<00:00:31.529> frame<00:00:31.949> after<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.640> another<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
you play each frame after one another it

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.080 
you play each frame after one another it
creates<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.840> image<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.500> an<00:00:35.190> animation<00:00:35.640> or

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
creates the image of an animation or

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930 
creates the image of an animation or
movement<00:00:36.980> now<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.219> two<00:00:38.340> different

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
movement now there are two different

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.770 
movement now there are two different
types<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.300> frames<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:40.070> keyframe<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.780> key

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
types of frames a keyframe and key

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
types of frames a keyframe and key
frames<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.379> any<00:00:43.890> frame<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.910> draw

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
frames are any frame that you can draw

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.290 
frames are any frame that you can draw
in<00:00:46.039> or<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.879> regular<00:00:48.289> blank<00:00:49.289> frames<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.300> what

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
in or just regular blank frames and what

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.850 
in or just regular blank frames and what
these<00:00:51.480> blank<00:00:51.780> frames<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.620> just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
these blank frames are or just

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.110 
these blank frames are or just
placeholders<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:54.600> flash<00:00:54.960> uses<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.739> fill

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
placeholders that flash uses to fill

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
placeholders that flash uses to fill
automatically<00:00:57.120> based<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.350> key

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
automatically based on what your key

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.080 
automatically based on what your key
frames<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.379> draw<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.129> key<00:01:02.399> frames<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
frames are so you draw in key frames and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
frames are so you draw in key frames and
flash<00:01:03.449> uses<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:05.070> blank<00:01:05.400> frames

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
flash uses the blank frames

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.980 
flash uses the blank frames
automatically<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.810> fill<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:08.450> now<00:01:09.450> here's<00:01:09.869> how

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
automatically to fill in now here's how

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.070 
automatically to fill in now here's how
you<00:01:10.140> make<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.439> keyframe<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.510> tell<00:01:12.780> if

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you make a keyframe and you can tell if

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
you make a keyframe and you can tell if
one<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.500> frames<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> keyframe<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
one your frames is a keyframe because it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
one your frames is a keyframe because it
has<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.900> circle<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.009> means

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
has a little circle in it this means

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.910 
has a little circle in it this means
keyframe<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.960> doesn't<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> circle

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
keyframe if it doesn't have a circle

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.719 
keyframe if it doesn't have a circle
it's<00:01:20.159> called<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> regular<00:01:21.180> frame<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it's called just a regular frame so to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.770 
it's called just a regular frame so to
make<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.150> keyframe<00:01:24.720> click<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.560> any<00:01:25.770> frame<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
make a keyframe click on any frame and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.830 
make a keyframe click on any frame and
right<00:01:27.780> click<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.369> type<00:01:29.369> insert<00:01:29.970> keyframe

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
right click it and type insert keyframe

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.010 
right click it and type insert keyframe
on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.350> drop<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:31.650> list<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> click<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
on the drop down list so click that and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.140 
on the drop down list so click that and
now<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.610> frame<00:01:35.880> has<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
now you can see that your frame has a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.640 
now you can see that your frame has a
circle<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> once<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.840> keyframe<00:01:40.229> we

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
circle in it so once it's a keyframe we

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.969 
circle in it so once it's a keyframe we
can<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.009> draw<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> stage<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.860> ahead

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
can now draw on the stage so go ahead

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.280 
can now draw on the stage so go ahead
and<00:01:44.159> pick<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> shape<00:01:44.939> I'll<00:01:45.149> pick<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> rectangle

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and pick a shape I'll pick the rectangle

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.170 
and pick a shape I'll pick the rectangle
and<00:01:46.439> draw<00:01:47.310> any<00:01:47.610> image<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.970> now

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and draw any image as you can see we now

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480 
and draw any image as you can see we now
have<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> shape<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.049> our<00:01:52.229> key<00:01:52.470> frame<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
have a shape in our key frame this is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.040 
have a shape in our key frame this is
going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:54.000> our<00:01:54.240> first<00:01:54.630> frame

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
going to be our first frame

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.250 
going to be our first frame
now<00:01:58.370> go<00:01:59.370> ahead<00:01:59.520> to<00:02:00.030> another<00:02:00.390> section<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
now go ahead to another section on the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.880 
now go ahead to another section on the
timeline<00:02:01.760> say<00:02:02.760> go<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> 10<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> enter<00:02:04.380> another

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
timeline say go to 10 and enter another

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.669 
timeline say go to 10 and enter another
keyframe<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.160> our<00:02:08.280> tenth<00:02:08.670> frame

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
keyframe so now this is our tenth frame

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.470 
keyframe so now this is our tenth frame
and<00:02:10.679> since<00:02:10.920> we're<00:02:11.160> making<00:02:11.490> an<00:02:11.820> image<00:02:12.240> to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and since we're making an image to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.520 
and since we're making an image to
change<00:02:12.510> from<00:02:13.260> one<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.860> 10<00:02:14.270> we<00:02:15.270> want<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.660> move<00:02:16.260> it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
change from one to 10 we want to move it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.740 
change from one to 10 we want to move it
slightly<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.550> show<00:02:18.150> check<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:20.940> here's

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
slightly to show check so now here's

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.190 
slightly to show check so now here's
image<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.760> keyframe<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.209> here's<00:02:25.080> our

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
image one in keyframe one and here's our

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.240 
image one in keyframe one and here's our
image<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.800> keyframe<00:02:26.310> 10<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:28.320> now<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:28.980> go

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
image in keyframe 10 so now if we go

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.750 
image in keyframe 10 so now if we go
ahead<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.000> play<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:30.959> image<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.670> do

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
ahead and play this image and you can do

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.680 
ahead and play this image and you can do
this<00:02:32.910> two<00:02:33.180> way<00:02:33.480> two<00:02:33.900> ways<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.770> control<00:02:35.540> down<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
this two way two ways go control down to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.040 
this two way two ways go control down to
play<00:02:36.959> or<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.580> faster<00:02:38.580> way<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> simply<00:02:39.660> press

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
play or a faster way is a simply press

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.720 
play or a faster way is a simply press
Enter<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.000> go<00:02:42.150> ahead<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:43.040> see<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.520> our

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
Enter you can go ahead and see that our

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.449 
Enter you can go ahead and see that our
image<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.300> kind<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.660> hopping<00:02:46.170> from<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:46.980> side

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
image is kind of hopping from one side

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.640 
image is kind of hopping from one side
to<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.120> next<00:02:49.370> now<00:02:50.480> there's<00:02:51.480> two<00:02:51.780> ways<00:02:52.080> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
to the next now there's two ways that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.000 
to the next now there's two ways that
you<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:53.010> animate<00:02:53.520> your<00:02:53.760> image<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:55.350> first<00:02:55.680> way

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you can animate your image the first way

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.250 
you can animate your image the first way
is<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.060> frame<00:02:57.540> by<00:02:57.570> frame<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.140> instance

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
is do it frame by frame so for instance

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.820 
is do it frame by frame so for instance
you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.160> go<00:03:02.370> click<00:03:02.790> right<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.709> then<00:03:04.709> you

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
you can go click right here and then you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.880 
you can go click right here and then you
can<00:03:04.980> Millie<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> next<00:03:06.299> frame

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
can Millie and then on the next frame

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.610 
can Millie and then on the next frame
you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:07.920> more<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:09.030> next<00:03:09.750> frame<00:03:09.989> little<00:03:10.440> more

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
you can more on next frame little more

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.080 
you can more on next frame little more
or<00:03:11.209> there's<00:03:12.209> easier<00:03:12.720> way<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:14.430> easier<00:03:14.850> way

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
or there's easier way and the easier way

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.259 
or there's easier way and the easier way
is<00:03:15.330> called<00:03:15.750> tweening<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.910> what<00:03:17.910> tweening

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
is called tweening and what tweening

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.750 
is called tweening and what tweening
does<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.870> tell<00:03:19.140> flash<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.739> automatically<00:03:20.370> fill

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
does is tell flash to automatically fill

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.009 
does is tell flash to automatically fill
in<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.120> blanks<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:22.019> create<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> motion<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
in the blanks to create a motion and

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.830 
in the blanks to create a motion and
there<00:03:25.019> are<00:03:25.140> two<00:03:25.380> types<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.160> tweens<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.880> shape

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
there are two types of tweens a shape

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.710 
there are two types of tweens a shape
tween<00:03:28.100> which<00:03:29.100> lets<00:03:29.459> you

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
tween which lets you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.790 
tween which lets you
between<00:03:31.520> objects<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.730> are<00:03:32.910> edible<00:03:33.060> or<00:03:33.800> also

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
between objects that are edible or also

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.280 
between objects that are edible or also
change<00:03:35.400> objects<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.030> are<00:03:36.150> shapes<00:03:36.450> or<00:03:36.690> motion

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
change objects that are shapes or motion

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.100 
change objects that are shapes or motion
tweens<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.640> anytime<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.300> don't<00:03:39.540> want<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.840> tween

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
tweens so anytime you don't want a tween

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.600 
tweens so anytime you don't want a tween
in<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.380> straight<00:03:40.680> line<00:03:40.710> you<00:03:41.190> want<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.460> pick<00:03:41.580> a

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
in a straight line you want to pick a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.030 
in a straight line you want to pick a
motion<00:03:42.060> tween<00:03:42.180> but<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.320> now<00:03:43.350> we'll<00:03:43.800> use<00:03:44.010> a

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
motion tween but for now we'll use a

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.790 
motion tween but for now we'll use a
shape<00:03:44.490> tween<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.120> here's<00:03:45.960> how<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.200> create<00:03:46.740> a

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
shape tween and here's how you create a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.390 
shape tween and here's how you create a
shape<00:03:47.040> tween<00:03:48.050> click<00:03:49.050> anywhere<00:03:49.530> between<00:03:49.950> your

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
shape tween click anywhere between your

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.470 
shape tween click anywhere between your
two<00:03:50.670> keyframes<00:03:51.660> on<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.650> timeline<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.480> go

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
two keyframes on the timeline and go

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.170 
two keyframes on the timeline and go
down<00:03:54.720> here<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.700> tween<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.000> press<00:03:57.830> shape<00:03:58.830> as

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
down here to tween and press shape as

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.150 
down here to tween and press shape as
you<00:04:00.180> can<00:04:00.510> see<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:00.960> now<00:04:01.140> have<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> green<00:04:01.830> arrow

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
you can see we now have a green arrow

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.610 
you can see we now have a green arrow
pointing<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.270> first<00:04:03.540> keyframe<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
pointing to the first keyframe the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.420 
pointing to the first keyframe the
second<00:04:05.040> keyframe<00:04:05.660> this<00:04:06.660> tells<00:04:06.990> flesh

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
second keyframe this tells flesh

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.210 
second keyframe this tells flesh
automatically<00:04:08.430> create<00:04:09.090> frames<00:04:09.890> so<00:04:10.890> we<00:04:11.040> can

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
automatically create frames so we can

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.090 
automatically create frames so we can
animate<00:04:11.700> our<00:04:12.050> objects<00:04:13.050> from<00:04:13.440> keyframe<00:04:13.920> the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
animate our objects from keyframe the

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.710 
animate our objects from keyframe the
keyframe<00:04:15.350> now<00:04:16.350> as<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.790> when<00:04:18.180> we<00:04:18.299> test<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
keyframe now as you see when we test the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.790 
keyframe now as you see when we test the
movie<00:04:19.370> flash<00:04:20.370> automatically<00:04:21.359> created<00:04:21.989> frames

to<00:04:23.280> fill<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:23.850> blanks<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:25.169> create<00:04:25.560> the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
to fill in the blanks to create the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.860 
to fill in the blanks to create the
effect<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.640> emotion<00:04:27.390> in<00:04:27.570> our<00:04:28.260> image<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:29.870> you

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
effect of emotion in our image and you

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.100 
effect of emotion in our image and you
can<00:04:30.900> also<00:04:31.290> do<00:04:31.980> this<00:04:32.190> when<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.000> don't<00:04:33.840> want<00:04:34.020> to

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
can also do this when you don't want to

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.050 
can also do this when you don't want to
use<00:04:34.230> a<00:04:34.260> shame<00:04:34.650> same<00:04:35.130> image<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.760> want<00:04:35.970> a

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.990 
frames and then let's go ahead and
insert<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.169> keyframe<00:04:55.560> by<00:04:56.130> right-clicking<00:04:56.729> and

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
insert a keyframe by right-clicking and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.219 
insert a keyframe by right-clicking and
insert<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.840> keyframe<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.680> frame<00:04:59.370> number<00:04:59.760> one

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
insert a keyframe and frame number one

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.760 
insert a keyframe and frame number one
now<00:05:01.229> let's<00:05:01.500> create<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.890> basic<00:05:02.220> shape<00:05:02.640> sure<00:05:02.850> and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
now let's create a basic shape sure and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.409 
now let's create a basic shape sure and
then<00:05:04.770> let's<00:05:05.040> go<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.310> another<00:05:05.490> frame<00:05:06.090> later

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
then let's go to another frame later

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.540 
then let's go to another frame later
down<00:05:06.720> on<00:05:06.960> our<00:05:07.110> timeline<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.800> insert<00:05:08.280> another

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
down on our timeline and insert another

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.469 
down on our timeline and insert another
keyframe<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.479> we<00:05:09.600> can<00:05:09.750> draw<00:05:10.020> in<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:11.479> but

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
keyframe so we can draw in it but

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.990 
keyframe so we can draw in it but
instead<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.229> square<00:05:13.620> we<00:05:14.160> want<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.550> make<00:05:14.729> this

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
instead of a square we want to make this

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.470 
instead of a square we want to make this
one<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.479> circle

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
one a circle

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.180 
one a circle
I<00:05:18.310> gmail<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.460> circle<00:05:20.030> in<00:05:20.180> frame<00:05:20.900> 20<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:21.500> a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
I gmail a circle in frame 20 and a

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.720 
I gmail a circle in frame 20 and a
square<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.880> frame<00:05:23.300> one<00:05:23.920> now<00:05:24.920> if<00:05:25.220> we<00:05:25.250> apply<00:05:25.700> a

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
square and frame one now if we apply a

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.540 
square and frame one now if we apply a
shape<00:05:26.090> tween<00:05:26.300> look<00:05:27.080> what<00:05:27.290> happens<00:05:29.530> flash

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
shape tween look what happens flash

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.000 
shape tween look what happens flash
automatically<00:05:31.550> tweens<00:05:32.030> your<00:05:32.210> object<00:05:33.010> to

morph into the shape of the latter

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.480 
morph into the shape of the latter
object<00:05:36.680> or<00:05:37.160> later<00:05:37.460> one<00:05:37.730> as<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:39.830> can<00:05:39.920> see<00:05:40.160> flash

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490

automatically<00:05:41.360> created<00:05:41.930> frames<00:05:42.350> in<00:05:42.650> the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
automatically created frames in the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.570 
automatically created frames in the
middle<00:05:43.750> which<00:05:44.750> allows<00:05:45.290> you<00:05:45.530> not<00:05:45.890> having<00:05:46.250> to

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
middle which allows you not having to

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.040 
middle which allows you not having to
create<00:05:47.090> key<00:05:47.930> frame<00:05:48.260> frame<00:05:48.860> by<00:05:49.220> frame<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:50.050> this

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
create key frame frame by frame and this

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.130 
create key frame frame by frame and this
is<00:05:51.320> how<00:05:51.530> you<00:05:51.560> use<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:52.340> shape<00:05:52.580> tween<00:05:52.880> to<00:05:53.630> move<00:05:53.870> a

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
is how you use the shape tween to move a

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.250 
is how you use the shape tween to move a
single<00:05:54.560> object<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:55.460> another<00:05:55.490> place<00:05:56.120> or<00:05:56.870> to

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
single object to another place or to

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.790 
single object to another place or to
morph<00:05:57.530> and<00:05:57.770> objects<00:05:58.340> into<00:05:58.640> another<00:05:58.940> one<00:05:59.180> and

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
morph and objects into another one and

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.070 
morph and objects into another one and
these<00:06:00.800> are<00:06:00.860> some<00:06:01.280> pretty<00:06:01.520> basic<00:06:02.270> tweens<00:06:02.810> that

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
these are some pretty basic tweens that

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.410 
these are some pretty basic tweens that
you<00:06:03.170> can<00:06:03.320> use<00:06:03.560> to<00:06:03.800> animate<00:06:04.250> your<00:06:04.760> animation

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
you can use to animate your animation

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.630 
you can use to animate your animation
and<00:06:06.290> then<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.710> next<00:06:06.740> subject<00:06:07.220> will<00:06:07.520> be
