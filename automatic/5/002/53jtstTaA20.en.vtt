00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.740 

basically<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.340> decided<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> get<00:00:18.240> tree<00:00:18.510> bugs

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
basically we decided to get tree bugs

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.290 
basically we decided to get tree bugs
because<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.680> had<00:00:19.950> a<00:00:19.980> few<00:00:20.220> visitors<00:00:20.700> come<00:00:21.119> up

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
because we had a few visitors come up

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.440 
because we had a few visitors come up
and<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:22.350> lot<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> them<00:00:23.010> were<00:00:23.130> asking<00:00:23.610> where<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
and a lot of them were asking where the

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.140 
and a lot of them were asking where the
toilets<00:00:24.869> were<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.800> basically<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.880> thought

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
toilets were so basically we thought

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.630 
toilets were so basically we thought
we'd<00:00:27.630> go<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.990> find<00:00:28.260> someone<00:00:28.770> who<00:00:28.950> could<00:00:29.160> come

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we'd go and find someone who could come

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.820 
we'd go and find someone who could come
in<00:00:29.790> and<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> tree<00:00:30.660> bug<00:00:30.869> course<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.619> found

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
in and do a tree bug course and we found

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.040 
in and do a tree bug course and we found
a<00:00:32.190> guy<00:00:32.460> called<00:00:32.879> Jerry<00:00:33.750> bog<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:35.930> sit<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
a guy called Jerry bog that sit on the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.360 
a guy called Jerry bog that sit on the
toilet<00:00:37.470> seat<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.970> there's<00:00:39.470> tissue<00:00:40.470> that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
toilet seat and then there's tissue that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.130 
toilet seat and then there's tissue that
you<00:00:41.550> would<00:00:41.699> obviously<00:00:42.300> use<00:00:42.570> after<00:00:43.020> you've

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you would obviously use after you've

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.410 
you would obviously use after you've
gone<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> toilet<00:00:43.970> everything<00:00:44.970> goes<00:00:45.150> down

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
gone to the toilet everything goes down

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
gone to the toilet everything goes down
into<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.840> base<00:00:46.160> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> toilet<00:00:48.559> we<00:00:49.559> decided

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
into the base of the toilet we decided

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.060 
into the base of the toilet we decided
to<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.280> them<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.880> area<00:00:51.290> because<00:00:52.290> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to put them in this area because it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.030 
to put them in this area because it's
mainly<00:00:53.820> seen<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> main<00:00:54.600> camping<00:00:55.020> site<00:00:55.290> it's

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
mainly seen as a main camping site it's

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.280 
mainly seen as a main camping site it's
very<00:00:56.280> clear<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> everyone<00:00:57.450> could<00:00:57.719> actually

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
very clear and everyone could actually

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.250 
very clear and everyone could actually
locate<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> toilets<00:00:59.700> when<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.570> came<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
locate the toilets when they came in to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
locate the toilets when they came in to
nature's<00:01:02.070> playground<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.820> had<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> wonder

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
nature's playground and had a wonder

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.540 
nature's playground and had a wonder
because<00:01:03.719> they're<00:01:03.930> quite<00:01:04.170> visual<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.920> can

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
because they're quite visual and you can

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.330 
because they're quite visual and you can
see<00:01:05.759> them<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.570> pathway<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:07.200> well<00:01:07.440> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
see them from the pathway as well and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.460 
see them from the pathway as well and
this<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.000> Hough<00:01:09.330> who<00:01:09.690> is<00:01:09.930> our<00:01:10.110> woodland

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this is Hough who is our woodland

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.050 
this is Hough who is our woodland
manager<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.009> he<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.250> part<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.670> team<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
manager and he was part of the team that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.889 
manager and he was part of the team that
actually<00:01:12.149> built<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:13.110> tree<00:01:13.590> bogs

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
actually built the tree bogs

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.570 
actually built the tree bogs
okay<00:01:15.899> so<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.200> run<00:01:16.740> over<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> basic

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
okay so just run over the basic

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.199 
okay so just run over the basic
construction<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:19.100> for<00:01:20.100> large<00:01:20.670> hornbeam

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
construction it's for large hornbeam

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:23.270 
construction it's for large hornbeam
poles<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.840> main<00:01:22.350> main<00:01:22.649> structure<00:01:23.160> then

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
poles for the main main structure then

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
poles for the main main structure then
we've<00:01:23.369> built<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.610> platform<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.119> top<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.600> then

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
we've built the platform on top and then

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.139 
we've built the platform on top and then
the<00:01:25.259> main<00:01:25.440> sort<00:01:25.800> of<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.250> main<00:01:26.399> workings<00:01:26.940> not

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
the main sort of the main workings not

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.609 
the main sort of the main workings not
as<00:01:27.390> much<00:01:27.539> in<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> workings<00:01:28.319> is<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
as much in the way of workings is the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.760 
as much in the way of workings is the
wire<00:01:29.459> basket<00:01:30.119> filled<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.569> straw<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
wire basket filled with straw and that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.460 
wire basket filled with straw and that
allows<00:01:32.069> the<00:01:32.940> moisture<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.959> whipped<00:01:34.200> away

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
allows the moisture to be whipped away

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.919 
allows the moisture to be whipped away
from<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> waste<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.330> it's<00:01:36.630> quite<00:01:36.780> open

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
from the waste you know it's quite open

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.300 
from the waste you know it's quite open
so<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.319> get<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.619> airflow<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.069> there's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so you get a lot of airflow so there's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.779 
so you get a lot of airflow so there's
no<00:01:38.429> smell<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.679> thing<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.009> missing<00:01:41.610> we

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
no smell the one thing we are missing we

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.980 
no smell the one thing we are missing we
need<00:01:41.819> to<00:01:42.000> put<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:43.490> ring<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.990> willows

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
need to put in is a ring of willows

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
need to put in is a ring of willows
around<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.500> back<00:01:46.679> and<00:01:46.890> again<00:01:47.039> that<00:01:47.250> will<00:01:47.340> sort

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
around the back and again that will sort

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.699 
around the back and again that will sort
of<00:01:47.580> wick<00:01:47.759> away<00:01:48.030> more<00:01:48.240> moisture<00:01:48.869> we've<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.530> tea

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
of wick away more moisture we've got tea

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.130 
of wick away more moisture we've got tea
tree<00:01:49.950> bogs<00:01:50.599> this<00:01:51.599> is<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.929> that<00:01:52.020> we're

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
tree bogs this is the one that we're

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
tree bogs this is the one that we're
using<00:01:52.349> at<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> moment<00:01:52.679> when<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.580> gets

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
using at the moment when this one gets

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
using at the moment when this one gets
full<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.330> then<00:01:54.450> move<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.289> to<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.470> second

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
full we can then move on to the second

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.210 
full we can then move on to the second
one

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
one

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.100 
one
yeah<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.610> lost<00:01:56.789> about<00:01:56.910> two<00:01:57.179> years<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.780> then

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
yeah they lost about two years and then

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
yeah they lost about two years and then
you'd<00:01:58.229> need<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.560> build<00:01:59.220> another<00:01:59.459> tree<00:01:59.700> Bob

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
you'd need to build another tree Bob

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.729 
you'd need to build another tree Bob
reusable<00:02:00.390> oh<00:02:00.599> yeah<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:00.959> your<00:02:01.080> timber<00:02:01.349> cladding

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
reusable oh yeah or your timber cladding

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.680 
reusable oh yeah or your timber cladding
and<00:02:02.030> yeah<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.330> let<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.599> kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> return<00:02:05.690> this

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
and yeah just let it kind of return this

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.410 
and yeah just let it kind of return this
is<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.959> sawdust<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.709> every<00:02:08.310> hour<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:09.119> two

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
is the sawdust and every hour or two

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.750 
is the sawdust and every hour or two
someone<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.200> come<00:02:10.380> round<00:02:10.619> once<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.430> toilets

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
someone will come round once the toilets

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760 
someone will come round once the toilets
have<00:02:11.880> been<00:02:12.060> used<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.870> will<00:02:13.050> place<00:02:13.319> about

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
have been used and we will place about

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.449 
have been used and we will place about
two<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.430> three<00:02:15.319> handfuls<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.680> sawdust<00:02:17.160> down

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
two to three handfuls of sawdust down

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.960 
two to three handfuls of sawdust down
the<00:02:17.790> toilet<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:19.160> basically<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.400> helps<00:02:20.760> with

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
the toilet and basically that helps with

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.890 
the toilet and basically that helps with
the<00:02:22.280> breakdown<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.969> deposits<00:02:24.689> that's

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the breakdown of the deposits that's

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.160 
the breakdown of the deposits that's
down<00:02:25.439> inside<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.069> base<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.579> toilet<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
down inside the base of the toilet and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.430 
down inside the base of the toilet and
one<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
one of the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440 
one of the
people<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.890> came<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.160> helped<00:02:30.790> us<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.300> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
people that came and helped us to do the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.300 
people that came and helped us to do the
course<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.440> things<00:02:32.620> he<00:02:32.770> left<00:02:32.920> us<00:02:33.130> with

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
course one of the things he left us with

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.980 
course one of the things he left us with
was<00:02:33.550> this<00:02:33.730> little<00:02:34.030> saying<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.720> scoop

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
was this little saying a little scoop

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.740 
was this little saying a little scoop
for<00:02:35.200> every<00:02:35.560> other<00:02:35.710> poop<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.760> basically<00:02:37.360> that's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
for every other poop so basically that's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.080 
for every other poop so basically that's
why<00:02:38.020> we<00:02:38.380> go<00:02:38.590> around<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:39.190> put<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.340> sawdust<00:02:39.850> in

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
why we go around and put the sawdust in

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.030 
why we go around and put the sawdust in
the<00:02:40.240> actual<00:02:40.540> toilets<00:02:40.960> because<00:02:41.350> especially<00:02:41.830> if

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
the actual toilets because especially if

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.590 
the actual toilets because especially if
there's<00:02:42.220> children<00:02:42.460> they<00:02:42.940> might<00:02:43.090> get<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.390> bit

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
there's children they might get a bit

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.420 
there's children they might get a bit
excited<00:02:43.660> about<00:02:44.260> having<00:02:44.590> lots<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.890> sawdust<00:02:45.310> and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
excited about having lots of sawdust and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.130 
excited about having lots of sawdust and
try<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.700> pour<00:02:45.880> all<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.180> sawdust<00:02:46.600> down<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:47.050> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
try and pour all the sawdust down in the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.230 
try and pour all the sawdust down in the
toilet<00:02:47.290> which<00:02:48.220> means<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.790> doesn't<00:02:48.940> work

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
toilet which means that it doesn't work

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.660 
toilet which means that it doesn't work
as<00:02:49.450> well<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.860> means<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.220> their<00:02:51.400> base

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
as well and it means that their base

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.460 
as well and it means that their base
actually<00:02:52.120> gets<00:02:52.270> filled<00:02:52.510> up<00:02:52.660> rather<00:02:53.350> quickly

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
actually gets filled up rather quickly

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.670 
actually gets filled up rather quickly
so<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.180> said<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.630> little<00:02:55.930> scoop<00:02:56.200> for<00:02:56.440> every

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
so like I said a little scoop for every

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.490 
so like I said a little scoop for every
other<00:02:56.800> poop<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:58.330> also<00:02:58.510> helps<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.110> stop<00:02:59.470> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
other poop it also helps to stop the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.250 
other poop it also helps to stop the
smell<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.130> because<00:03:00.550> there's<00:03:00.820> air<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.540> lot<00:03:02.200> of

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
smell and because there's air a lot of

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.250 
smell and because there's air a lot of
air<00:03:02.530> goes<00:03:02.830> through<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.370> hay<00:03:03.580> base<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.810> stops

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
air goes through the hay base it stops

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.810 
air goes through the hay base it stops
the<00:03:05.410> smell<00:03:05.680> from<00:03:05.830> coming<00:03:06.220> through<00:03:06.490> and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
the smell from coming through and

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.010 
the smell from coming through and
because<00:03:07.300> there's<00:03:07.540> quite<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> lot<00:03:07.930> of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
because there's quite a lot of

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.620 
because there's quite a lot of
ventilation<00:03:08.350> within<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.250> actual<00:03:09.670> toilet<00:03:10.270> so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
ventilation within the actual toilet so

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.850 
ventilation within the actual toilet so
you<00:03:10.720> don't<00:03:10.900> smell<00:03:11.140> anything<00:03:11.410> at<00:03:11.680> all

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
you don't smell anything at all

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.590 
you don't smell anything at all
otherwise<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.820> wouldn't<00:03:13.060> be<00:03:13.120> able<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.390> stand

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
otherwise I wouldn't be able to stand

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.690 
otherwise I wouldn't be able to stand
here<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.520> we<00:03:15.760> built<00:03:15.970> two<00:03:16.840> tree<00:03:17.080> bogs<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:18.550> the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
here so we built two tree bogs in the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.940 
here so we built two tree bogs in the
course<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.060> weekend<00:03:19.450> two<00:03:19.750> days<00:03:19.960> with<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.740> team
