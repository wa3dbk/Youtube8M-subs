00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
then may remember that I originally

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.260 
then may remember that I originally
wasn't<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:58.680> keen<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.100> Equestria<00:00:59.850> ghosts<00:01:00.059> but

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
wasn't very keen on Equestria ghosts but

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
wasn't very keen on Equestria ghosts but
gradually<00:01:00.750> became<00:01:01.109> more<00:01:01.410> warm<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.920> idea

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
gradually became more warm to the idea

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
gradually became more warm to the idea
as<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.640> saw<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.090> trailers<00:01:03.539> until<00:01:03.840> eventually

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
as I saw more trailers until eventually

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
as I saw more trailers until eventually
I<00:01:04.830> saw<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> whole<00:01:05.489> movie<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.939> reached<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I saw the whole movie and reached the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
I saw the whole movie and reached the
conclusion<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.740> fact<00:01:08.030> fantastic

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
conclusion that it was in fact fantastic

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
conclusion that it was in fact fantastic
and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.659> seems<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> same<00:01:10.350> thing<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and it seems that the same thing is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
and it seems that the same thing is
likely<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.130> happen<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.820> rainbow<00:01:12.270> rocks

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
likely to happen here with rainbow rocks

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.929 
likely to happen here with rainbow rocks
as<00:01:12.840> much<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> enjoyed<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.220> first<00:01:14.430> movie<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
as much as I enjoyed the first movie I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
as much as I enjoyed the first movie I
first<00:01:15.360> felt<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> rainbow<00:01:16.020> rocks<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.619> just

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
first felt that rainbow rocks would just

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.429 
first felt that rainbow rocks would just
be<00:01:17.009> some<00:01:17.310> unnecessary<00:01:17.659> sequel<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.290> I've

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
be some unnecessary sequel but as I've

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
be some unnecessary sequel but as I've
seen<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.130> more<00:01:20.310> trailers<00:01:20.759> in

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
seen more and more trailers in

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.640 
seen more and more trailers in
promotional<00:01:21.479> material<00:01:22.049> I've<00:01:22.259> now<00:01:22.439> become

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
promotional material I've now become

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
promotional material I've now become
very<00:01:23.189> excited<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> movie<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.600> was

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
very excited for the movie I was

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
very excited for the movie I was
originally<00:01:25.259> planning<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.710> making<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.189> video

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
originally planning on making this video

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490 
originally planning on making this video
the<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:26.970> way<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> did<00:01:27.330> my<00:01:27.659> very<00:01:27.720> first<00:01:28.259> one

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the same way I did my very first one

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
the same way I did my very first one
where<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.950> split<00:01:29.310> things<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:30.150> things<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
where I split things up into things and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.060 
where I split things up into things and
the<00:01:30.840> trailers<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.259> would<00:01:31.619> make<00:01:31.770> me<00:01:31.920> think

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the trailers that would make me think

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
the trailers that would make me think
that<00:01:32.250> rainbow<00:01:32.490> rocks<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.420> movie

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that rainbow rocks would be a good movie

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.660 
that rainbow rocks would be a good movie
and<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.500> things<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.860> made<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and the things that made me think it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
and the things that made me think it
will<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> bad<00:01:36.240> movie<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> realized<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
will be a bad movie but I realized that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
will be a bad movie but I realized that
wouldn't<00:01:38.040> work<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.850> list<00:01:39.090> were<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
wouldn't work because the list were the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
wouldn't work because the list were the
former<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:40.140> take<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.560> an<00:01:40.680> entire<00:01:40.770> video<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
former would take up an entire video and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
former would take up an entire video and
the<00:01:41.970> list<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> latter<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:43.049> empty

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the list for the latter was empty

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
the list for the latter was empty
honestly<00:01:44.189> all<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.670> various<00:01:45.060> trailers<00:01:45.479> and

sneak peeks have given me nothing but a
good<00:01:47.700> feeling<00:01:48.149> about<00:01:48.240> rainbow<00:01:48.780> rocks<00:01:49.049> even<00:01:49.649> if

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
good feeling about rainbow rocks even if

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
good feeling about rainbow rocks even if
the<00:01:50.070> full<00:01:50.280> movie<00:01:50.640> turns<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.149> only<00:01:51.329> half<00:01:51.780> as

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the full movie turns out only half as

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.630 
the full movie turns out only half as
good<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.470> these<00:01:52.680> trailers<00:01:53.130> would<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.340> me

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
good as these trailers would have me

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.969 
good as these trailers would have me
believe<00:01:53.670> I'd<00:01:54.570> still<00:01:54.960> consider<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> huge

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
believe I'd still consider it a huge

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.859 
believe I'd still consider it a huge
improvement<00:01:56.310> over<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:56.969> movie<00:01:57.659> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
thoughts on the movie are hard to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 
thoughts on the movie are hard to
summarize<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.700> recommend

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
summarize so it actually just recommend

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.210 
summarize so it actually just recommend
you<00:02:09.360> go<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.660> watch<00:02:09.840> my<00:02:10.080> old<00:02:10.259> video<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you go and watch my old video on it that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.369 
you go and watch my old video on it that
is<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.819> stomach<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.480> awful<00:02:12.900> quality

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
is if you can stomach the awful quality

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.110 
is if you can stomach the awful quality
of<00:02:13.470> my<00:02:13.590> videos

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
of my videos

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.300 
of my videos
back<00:02:14.299> then<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:15.200> while<00:02:15.470> conceptually<00:02:16.069> I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
back then so while conceptually I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.190 
back then so while conceptually I
thought<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.819> first<00:02:17.060> Equestria<00:02:17.569> girls<00:02:17.810> rocked

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
thought the first Equestria girls rocked

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.289 
thought the first Equestria girls rocked
I<00:02:18.530> still<00:02:18.950> have<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.220> admit<00:02:19.549> that<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:19.940> number

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
I still have to admit that on a number

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.630 
I still have to admit that on a number
of<00:02:20.330> more<00:02:20.690> concrete<00:02:21.260> aspects<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.129> movie<00:02:22.400> fell

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
of more concrete aspects the movie fell

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.089 
of more concrete aspects the movie fell
short<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.599> for<00:02:23.780> rainbow<00:02:24.110> rocks<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.620> concept

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
short but for rainbow rocks the concept

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.190 
short but for rainbow rocks the concept
is<00:02:25.280> still<00:02:25.519> there<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.209> way<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.360> see<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:27.049> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
is still there the way I see it if the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.780 
is still there the way I see it if the
first<00:02:27.409> movie<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.220> killed<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.670> high

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
