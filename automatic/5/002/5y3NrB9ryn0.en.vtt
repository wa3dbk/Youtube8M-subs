00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.770
 so uv so same thing I did 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.850
 a video on it so do not hesitate 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.340
 go look at it and we will show 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 quickly the bases of agreement so we're going 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.929
 add for example a cylinder 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 we will get in edge fashion we will 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.900
 select this one as this is going 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.430
 have them control marc deal 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.230
 simon so I ai shown 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.900
 previously on a video his eyes so 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.000
 I'm not mistaken quickly to one of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.220
 looting so then we'll get in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.289
 vertex mode to select 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.130
 all the ways will add to send 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.480
 these one will make a map 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.550
 we unfolded our our super cylinders 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 super super fast if I do 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.289
 control r here I have control them 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.140
 I make a maxim I put myself in mode 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.649
 face I do humans and there for example 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.420
 see if he even a island mode 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.670
 he cut me off so that's it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 rather nice after we have several modes 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.369
 we have a smart uv project here we have a light 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.479
 mapaq sakho is not I like to use 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.760
 ah yes okay I see what it's like to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.049
 what does it serve follow assets quad so the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.490
 active fola quad and I will show you 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.430
 you will see if rather friendly 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.880
 so we'll put ourselves in sight of casting on 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 will do something 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.149
 nathan full places little too much one 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.760
 at 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.950
 ok so here if we select the whole 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.520
 we booed made smart uv project 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.660
 we have something like this is page and we 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.430
 will do control them we will do 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.670
 clearsteam so now I have more than 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.260
 sim 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.020
 so what am I going to do if I'm going 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.700
 do I put in edge I'm going to do that 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.060
 I do and I go in support in 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.510
 select one like this here ok I 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.190
 will do against the g do marc simon 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.810
 game even in face mode selects everything 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.560
 I do where I make a map 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.270
 so we have that it's nice but it's 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.310
 not clean by me personally I 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.470
 do not find that frankly clean so we 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.090
 has a small technique that allows in 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.830
 vertex mode we will select its 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:13.060
 business w halling on x w halling on x 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.580
 w halling on yw aligns on y same game 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.030
 two-sided month I'm doing this here I'm doing 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.010
 had and I do follow assets quad and ottoman 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.130
 here and there we have an impeccable thing 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.050
 complexion 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.970
 we do not necessarily need malka charm 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.960
 here and there I really have something 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.700
 flawless it's cool so here we are 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.700
 have a little menu with ew see where 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.370
 they will have double stein stein onyx and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.230
 one is there so we have the elements of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.720
 how to say in uv we have this pack 6 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.970
 this is basically a lucie that allows 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.629
 do a lot of things live and black from 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.640
 to make pine 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.879
 so the pine know what and put it in 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.030
 vertex mode has passed like this 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.280
 selected be the select ones 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.000
 we are going to do p they are red 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.790
 now they are pine so if i check 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.100
 the avesnois I will select is paid 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.370
 there and I'm going to do I sent that which 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.370
 will do me 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.740
 so it's good for a lot of things 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.090
 straighten a wick that is already they 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.640
 have already twisted and but name I'm doing 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.320
 that I'm doing p I'm going to rage see 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.720
 it will allow me to straighten a little 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.750
 a little bit of everything then I can 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.370
 do w to link on x for example so 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.770
 by cons there a me I think he 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:36.050
 must be disabled this time so for 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:39.380
 w alinghi x and then it works so 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.970
 so fucking so the options of 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.380
 selection are the same as on the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.980
 others probably use them 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.070
 tools 1 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.350
 how to say fashion tools etc 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.660
 so if I blame the avesnois ben I 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.940
 do this I put them up, see, it's finally okay 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.680
 short when you have a subject you want to 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.160
 forms and to recover something 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.810
 from relatively clean the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.630
 the pine is rather practical he slams 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.240
 it's pretty cool I can put some 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.240
 thereof which ap slap g 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.479
 pg 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.130
 you see the principle what's that 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.930
 it's an effect it's a bit like pop 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.560
 is on photoshop it's pretty cool 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.539
 so after we have plenty of options we have the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.560
 pack island and hop there by cons 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.410
 I should not have done it on that 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.340
 I'm going to slap 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.289
 I want diapers and avesnois pu 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.470
 to do pack island here it is going to make me 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.780
 a general pack of my stuff we can 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.810
 to export the uv so logical 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.930
 we can make alignments of the snap of the 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.100
 proportionality thing so 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.520
 proportional here mountain in town 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.900
 active and we'll do I sent with 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.110
 the wheel of the mouse we go the 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.960
 decrease so there by cons I have the 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.669
 class it worked had my series 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:07.060
 is activated but I work all styles and 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:09.090
 so here we are that the options of this 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.220
 worship to smooth a little bit of it 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.039
 we can do we redo the ass to get out 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.169
 we made to stop b normally 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.860
 to remove all have that is where we go 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.990
 smooth a little bit of it 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.900
 really to show you what then 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.310
 it's the tools of lying blender 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.120
 are rather simple 1 c1 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.070
 when you have a 1-1 wick for example 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.800
 we will make a 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.260
 add a sphere we will put ourselves in 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.770
 edge mode you're just going 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.170
 select the edge d on which 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.180
 you want to add a sim max 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.150
 then to do that more, for example 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.490
 against Marc Simon will go into 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.820
 mode face we will take a step and we will 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.890
 make a law I'm wrong or a lamp 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.160
 and here we unfolded our elements 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.140
 that's all it's that simple 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.180
 that then I refer you to my 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.900
 video on the uv to see all this 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.690
 in more detail 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.820
 so again I have a lot of 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.490
 put the link of course but that's 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.560
 as simple as that we have 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.330
 menus slap and one last thing that 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.580
 I did not show it's this mode so 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.680
 in body son mode if for example if I 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.200
 do it so I'll go out of the mode more 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.390
 I make a gift clal benefits of this mode 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:32.010
 if it's to see the dates the 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.180
 points selected what yes slap and that 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.910
 it's pretty cool we can do against 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.310
 the more we can rage we go 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:44.760
 disable with at the proportional says 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.180
 no so I have here is what we can 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.470
 make 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.850
 control is against it works 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.390
 not here by cons it works here on 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.470
 do l see I'm doing a TV game 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.860
 select I do l 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.840
 I do a small rotation 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.169
 here we can do rotations in 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.719
 function of the increments so if i do 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:06.469
 is rejected control see it's going 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:08.539
 activate increments and more 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:09.169
 is below rotation at least 40 - 90 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:13.370
 95 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.780
 here it is rather nice we also have 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:19.580
 can do a spin imagine let's 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:22.280
 wants everything everything is correctly 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.139
 compared to this point so we can 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.080
 put it in relation to the pivot and so 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:33.319
 if I do that's it I can do I have 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.610
 then s like this here we can 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.409
 select the elements here well 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.479
 heard here it's proportional and dignified 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:40.909
 pivot there is uv 7 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.800
 if we have more than one, and that's 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:44.449
 can open create a new texture 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.819
 we will not have to do open 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.349
 new new case there we create a texture 

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:49.610
 but it will be for the painting part 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:51.860
 dracula thereafter 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:55.069
 finally, that's what it's as simple as 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.050
 that for uv and not much there is 

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:57.889
 not much to know and I have not 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.360
 found from lack 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:00.770
 there are add-on that allow you 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.050
 to add two elements in addition to 

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.789
 tools and more so do not hesitate to 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.440
 look for it but basic for uv 

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:08.930
 be that simple we select 

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.860
 we are showing in europe 

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.860
 There you go
