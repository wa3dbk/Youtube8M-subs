00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.019
 and how long had it not been for that 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.119
 more or less combination 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.029
 to be another day a minute after 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:29.419
 many years talking to Pope will greet 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:32.570
 mario lacava boxers we really go 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:35.540
 to be also challenged me all but is 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.950
 well this I know that it is for good and if it is 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.559
 logical this environment I do not fit any 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.340
 doubt you are willing stowage unload 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.370
 he is accompanied by my family in 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.960
 my son's wife this one we have already decided 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.500
 that we have decided to face together this 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.500
 new road 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.840
 for this I married competition after 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.760
 of for the world title so this 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.020
 We are also going to walk together 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.390
 a way of sacrifice 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.700
 This is very hard and it is also hard for 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.390
 your partner not because he has to accompany 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.950
 in everything there are a lot of obligations 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.219
 that you can not leave aside 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.230
 deprivations that have to happen the same 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.060
 same as you 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.550
 that we already had where deprivation 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.980
 My fault is also going to have it this time 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.640
 for that space for something cuter and 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.670
 what are you planning to do 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.880
 good in this return to boxing in the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.700
 sporting part we have first done 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.530
 some medical checkups I'm 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.650
 perfectly well in my physical state 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.320
 you just have to wait how he answers me in 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.050
 the physicist after so many years of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.090
 inactivity after so many years of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.190
 away from the sport but I think with a 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.960
 small effort on my part I will be 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.090
 all right 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.330
 surely the first moment the first 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.040
 turn time is the hardest if yes 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.399
 apart are many years are almost 78 years 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.989
 that here 7 years that I do not do anything 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.579
 this is going to be hard but the first 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.629
 days are the most problematic because you 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:21.060
 it hurts everything you have to kill yourself but to you it is 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.370
 so confident that this change is pointing 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.959
 again that what seems to me everything 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.609
 easy pitfalls 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.150
 maybe it's not like that they do not make us anything 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:33.269
 easy but if so confident witt in 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.799
 how much time do you think if everything is fine and 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.810
 pass all the exams that you can 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:42.590
 return to a ring 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.590
 I'm going through and we're barbarous if we do not 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.200
 Rompo destroyed the program that we 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.720
 looming so that the seer who 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.450
 we complete all the studies now 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.790
 just missing 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.480
 happiness with potatoes and we are really 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.000
 as for the first boxing level for 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.300
 understand it 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.660
 it's also very of a world title not 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.660
 We'll see that
