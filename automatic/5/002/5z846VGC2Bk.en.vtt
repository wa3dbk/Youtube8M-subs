 a small cemetery yes and 600 meters 660 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.729
 meters we looked at the cards 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.680
 so on the Internet cards, he looked 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.540

 trying to show call like 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
 strongly approximated to 660 3 meters to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.479

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:40.560
 worth doing this store you can see 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:41.750
 put three four-record holder 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.869
 the store 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.360
 Here is such a good effort that he does not 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.420
 afraid of drought rain I was not already 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.729
 more than a week weather is 22 degrees 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.360
 roughly worth every day well really 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.630
 at night plus 10 not more 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.590
 cool at night but taken by day nice 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.109
 I will say this particular university to give 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.440
 a little about mixed and red-hot it is not 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:12.930
 Only there is no such thing, but so what if 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.430
 as you know there are 2 like buckwheat yes 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.090
 that is, there is generally wool 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.580
 concreteness 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.830
 Well, here it looks, she is white, all 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.379
 it characterizes what he collects 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:34.739
 cornflower pollen is not small but i 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:36.989
 on the goal audible shana to be heard here 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.940
 such is the beauty of course 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.299
 only claim our identity 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.299
 poll 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.110
 up to 15 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:12.060
 keeps i want to say so we 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:15.389
 walked looked our I think that 600 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.959
 meters this is not the distance man and 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.849
 type nectar and come back here so 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.500
 I think that with cornflower we still will 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.810
 normal food gathering too we will 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.650
