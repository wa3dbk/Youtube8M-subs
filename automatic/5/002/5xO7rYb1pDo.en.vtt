quarts<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:40.889> water<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.400> did<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.150> know<00:02:42.329> how<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
quarts of water I did not know how to

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.470 
quarts of water I did not know how to
measure<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.170> port<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> filled<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.450> 5<00:02:45.450> quart

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
measure to port so I filled a 5 quart

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.349 
measure to port so I filled a 5 quart

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
pot halfway up the formula is actually

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.960 
pot halfway up the formula is actually
one<00:02:49.109> quart<00:02:49.439> part<00:02:49.829> solids<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.579> one<00:02:50.730> part

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
one quart part solids to one part

tips from Julius kitchen or something
like<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.609> like<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> really<00:02:56.909> tiny<00:02:57.180> book

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
like that it's like a really tiny book

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.940 
like that it's like a really tiny book
it's<00:02:57.569> red<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:58.049> fabulous<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.560> read<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.829> whole

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
it's red it's fabulous I read the whole

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.409 
it's red it's fabulous I read the whole
thing<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.219> one<00:02:59.250> sitting<00:02:59.400> at<00:02:59.730> barnes<00:02:59.939> noble<00:03:00.269> it

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
thing in one sitting at barnes noble it

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.959 
thing in one sitting at barnes noble it
says<00:03:01.079> six<00:03:01.439> cups<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.919> solids<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.430> six<00:03:02.639> cups<00:03:02.849> of

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
says six cups of solids to six cups of

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.349 
says six cups of solids to six cups of
liquid<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.689> can<00:03:04.200> deduce<00:03:04.530> from<00:03:04.889> that<00:03:05.359> that

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
liquid so I can deduce from that that

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.020 
liquid so I can deduce from that that
it's<00:03:06.569> one<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.079> one<00:03:07.109> water<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.950> solids<00:03:08.310> my

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
it's one to one water to solids my

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.569 
it's one to one water to solids my
potatoes<00:03:09.480> are<00:03:09.510> falling<00:03:09.870> apart<00:03:10.459> it's<00:03:11.459> been

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
potatoes are falling apart it's been

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.990 
potatoes are falling apart it's been
like<00:03:11.730> 20<00:03:11.909> minutes<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.989> know<00:03:13.829> Julia<00:03:14.310> said<00:03:14.519> 40<00:03:14.849> but

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
like 20 minutes I know Julia said 40 but

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.509 
like 20 minutes I know Julia said 40 but
I'm<00:03:15.090> using<00:03:15.269> very<00:03:15.689> little<00:03:15.780> potato<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.590> turn<00:03:17.310> down

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
I'm using very little potato I turn down

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.729 
I'm using very little potato I turn down
the<00:03:17.639> heat<00:03:17.849> just<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.239> little<00:03:18.569> so<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.409> this

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
the heat just a little so that this

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.689 
the heat just a little so that this
wouldn't<00:03:19.919> kill<00:03:20.489> me<00:03:20.699> and<00:03:21.690> let's<00:03:21.900> stick<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.139> in

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
wouldn't kill me and let's stick it in

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:27.349 
wouldn't kill me and let's stick it in
and<00:03:23.750> buzz<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.609> now<00:03:26.609> going<00:03:27.000> back<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.329> that

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
and buzz it now going back to that

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.439 
and buzz it now going back to that
formula<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.260> was<00:03:28.440> talking<00:03:28.829> about<00:03:28.889> before<00:03:29.449> so

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
formula I was talking about before so

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.309 
formula I was talking about before so
it's<00:03:31.489> one<00:03:32.489> part<00:03:32.790> solids<00:03:33.479> to<00:03:33.629> one<00:03:33.780> part<00:03:33.989> liquid

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
it's one part solids to one part liquid

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.979 
it's one part solids to one part liquid
so<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.560> use<00:03:34.709> three<00:03:34.979> cups<00:03:35.659> solids<00:03:36.659> to<00:03:36.840> three

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
so I use three cups solids to three

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.949 
so I use three cups solids to three
parts<00:03:37.290> water<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.799> then<00:03:38.489> it's<00:03:38.639> three

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
parts water and then it's three

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.580 
parts water and then it's three
tablespoons<00:03:40.159> per<00:03:41.159> cup<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.790> water<00:03:42.419> or<00:03:42.930> solids

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
tablespoons per cup of water or solids

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.830 
tablespoons per cup of water or solids
is<00:03:43.829> one<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.189> one<00:03:44.280> whatever<00:03:44.759> so<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.659> means

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
is one to one whatever so that means

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.240 
is one to one whatever so that means
three<00:03:46.489> tablespoons<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.790> heavy<00:03:48.090> cream<00:03:48.209> oh

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
three tablespoons of heavy cream oh

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.589 
three tablespoons of heavy cream oh
