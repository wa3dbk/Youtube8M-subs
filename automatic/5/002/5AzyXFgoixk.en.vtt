00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

hi<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.780> its<00:00:01.500> ratchet<00:00:01.650> five<00:00:01.949> and<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.429> is

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hi guys its ratchet five and this is

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.840 
hi guys its ratchet five and this is
part<00:00:02.820> 30<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.480> think

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
part 30 I think

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.750 
part 30 I think
9:38<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.390> can't<00:00:07.049> remember<00:00:07.259> anyway<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.400> this

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
9:38 I can't remember anyway and this

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.700 
9:38 I can't remember anyway and this
part<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.120> are<00:00:09.150> going<00:00:09.269> into<00:00:09.719> rocket<00:00:10.380> which<00:00:10.679> is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
part we are going into rocket which is

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.900 
part we are going into rocket which is
the<00:00:10.950> first<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:15.800> jetpack<00:00:16.800> levels<00:00:17.279> only<00:00:17.460> if

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
the first of the jetpack levels only if

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.390 
the first of the jetpack levels only if
you<00:00:18.060> want<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.300> commit<00:00:19.050> suicide<00:00:19.109> there<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.680> kind

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
you want to commit suicide there I kind

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.939 
you want to commit suicide there I kind
of<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:20.850> randomly<00:00:21.150> sometimes

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
of do that just randomly sometimes

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.550 
of do that just randomly sometimes
anyway<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.180> levels<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.810> has<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.289> no

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
anyway so this levels it has like no

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.150 
anyway so this levels it has like no
gravity

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
gravity

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.200 
gravity
it<00:00:26.250> sounds<00:00:26.490> would<00:00:26.580> guarantee<00:00:26.730> there's<00:00:27.119> no

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
it sounds would guarantee there's no

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.400 
it sounds would guarantee there's no
gravity<00:00:27.539> these<00:00:28.439> kinds<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.279> levels<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.640> me<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
gravity these kinds of levels on me and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
gravity these kinds of levels on me and
you<00:00:31.410> use<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> jetpack<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:33.840> pretty

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you use a jetpack so I think I'm pretty

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.979 
you use a jetpack so I think I'm pretty
sure<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:35.030> apart<00:00:36.030> from<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.360> pole<00:00:36.570> levels

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
sure this is apart from the pole levels

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
sure this is apart from the pole levels
is<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.140> only<00:00:37.380> level<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.770> crash<00:00:37.950> -<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.399> uses

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
is the only level and crash - that uses

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.889 
is the only level and crash - that uses
a<00:00:39.120> different<00:00:39.540> kind<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.820> vehicle<00:00:41.820> -<00:00:42.510> just

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
a different kind of a vehicle - just

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.639 
a different kind of a vehicle - just
walking<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.940> well<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.480> happens<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> lot<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
walking and well this happens a lot you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.029 
walking and well this happens a lot you
get<00:00:46.800> stuck<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.410> hard<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.920> out

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
get stuck and it's very hard to get out

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.510 
get stuck and it's very hard to get out
of<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:50.940> hate<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:52.289> jetpack<00:00:53.250> levels

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
of it I really hate the jetpack levels

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
of it I really hate the jetpack levels
for<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.760> reason<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:55.140> think<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.620> gonna

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
for this reason and I think I'm gonna

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
for this reason and I think I'm gonna
have<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> restart<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.699> yeah<00:00:57.510> that's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
have to restart it because yeah that's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
have to restart it because yeah that's
just<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.260> happens<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.809> that's<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.520> don't

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
just it happens a lot and that's I don't

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.090 
just it happens a lot and that's I don't
think<00:01:02.699> Naughty<00:01:02.850> Dog<00:01:03.409> really<00:01:04.409> perfected<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
think Naughty Dog really perfected the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.899 
think Naughty Dog really perfected the
physics<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.439> jetpack<00:01:07.439> level<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.070> yeah

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
physics for this jetpack level but yeah

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.539 
physics for this jetpack level but yeah
oh<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.409> too<00:01:10.500> bad<00:01:10.830> put<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
oh well that that's just too bad put a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.260 
oh well that that's just too bad put a
little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:11.939> put<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
little bit put up with it now this is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.039 
little bit put up with it now this is
probably<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:17.520> easiest<00:01:17.759> level<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> warp

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
probably the easiest level in the warp

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
probably the easiest level in the warp
room<00:01:19.229> except<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.740> maybe<00:01:19.890> night<00:01:20.130> flight

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
room except for maybe night flight

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.850 
room except for maybe night flight
I<00:01:21.659> fought<00:01:22.170> enough<00:01:22.350> where<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.680> gonna<00:01:22.770> be

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
I fought enough where I was gonna be

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.179 
I fought enough where I was gonna be
harnessed<00:01:23.369> dodging<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.330> anger<00:01:24.930> said<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
harnessed dodging my anger said but I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
harnessed dodging my anger said but I
actually<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.939> handed<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> do

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
actually just handed to go back and do

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
actually just handed to go back and do
it<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.770> forgot<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> save

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it just then because I forgot to save

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.789 
it just then because I forgot to save
after<00:01:29.729> last<00:01:29.909> part<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.290> incredibly

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
after last part and it was incredibly

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.920 
after last part and it was incredibly
easy<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.189> could<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.490> cut<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.329> time<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.840> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
easy I could have cut the time that I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.460 
easy I could have cut the time that I
did<00:01:35.119> about<00:01:36.119> probably<00:01:36.570> about<00:01:36.689> 4<00:01:36.930> minutes<00:01:37.200> away

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
did about probably about 4 minutes away

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.280 
did about probably about 4 minutes away
I<00:01:37.560> practiced

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
I practiced

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.580 
I practiced
but<00:01:39.560> yeah<00:01:40.690> anyway<00:01:41.690> sometimes<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.440> doesn't

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
but yeah anyway sometimes it doesn't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.460 
but yeah anyway sometimes it doesn't
this<00:01:42.950> level<00:01:43.460> doesn't<00:01:43.670> make<00:01:43.790> sound<00:01:47.140> il-12<00:01:48.140> turn

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
this level doesn't make sound il-12 turn

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.170 
this level doesn't make sound il-12 turn
around<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.490> wanted<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:49.820> turn<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.120> around

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
around and I wanted to turn it around

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.470 
around and I wanted to turn it around
now<00:01:50.740> l1<00:01:51.740> turns<00:01:51.920> around<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.850> want<00:01:53.120> turns

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
now l1 turns around and I want turns

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.560 
now l1 turns around and I want turns
back<00:01:54.380> forwards<00:01:54.980> again<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:56.180> controls<00:01:56.480> are

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
back forwards again and the controls are

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.360 
back forwards again and the controls are
inverted<00:01:56.660> which<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.200> kind<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:57.920> weird<00:01:58.070> as<00:01:58.190> well

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
inverted which is kind of weird as well

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.090 
inverted which is kind of weird as well
so<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:59.510> really<00:02:00.140> need<00:02:00.290> time<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.830> get<00:02:00.920> use<00:02:01.070> of

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
so you really need time to get use of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.590 
so you really need time to get use of
these<00:02:01.370> controls<00:02:01.760> if<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.060> don't<00:02:02.180> play<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:02.390> in

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
these controls if you don't play this in

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.300 
these controls if you don't play this in
the<00:02:02.630> wild<00:02:02.900> then<00:02:03.700> you'll<00:02:04.700> have<00:02:04.820> problems<00:02:06.310> but

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
the wild then you'll have problems but

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.969 
the wild then you'll have problems but
yes<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.090> have<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.420> for<00:02:09.050> me<00:02:09.200> it's<00:02:09.530> probably

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
yes if you have it for me it's probably

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.870 
yes if you have it for me it's probably
the<00:02:10.040> easiest<00:02:10.070> in<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.990> if<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.260> wor<00:02:12.470> for

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the easiest in the in the if it wor for

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.700 
the easiest in the in the if it wor for
maybe<00:02:13.880> like<00:02:14.630> five<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.110> believe<00:02:15.260> might<00:02:15.620> be

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
maybe like five I believe might be

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.490 
maybe like five I believe might be
easier<00:02:15.920> as<00:02:16.010> I've<00:02:16.130> talked<00:02:16.370> about<00:02:17.050> anyway<00:02:18.110> also

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
easier as I've talked about anyway also

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.320 
easier as I've talked about anyway also
this<00:02:18.710> level<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.220> has<00:02:19.370> really<00:02:19.700> awesome<00:02:19.910> music

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330

this level it has really awesome music
it's<00:02:20.480> probably<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> best<00:02:21.500> music<00:02:22.490> out<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.760> any

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's probably the best music out of any

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.530 
it's probably the best music out of any
crash<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.810> level<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.290> my<00:02:24.890> opinion<00:02:25.250> these<00:02:26.060> TTS

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
crash to level in my opinion these TTS

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.820 
crash to level in my opinion these TTS
you<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.840> touch<00:02:26.990> them<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:27.530> pull

level I think my fire has the best music
out<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.920> any<00:02:34.100> crash<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.490> level<00:02:35.380> dodge<00:02:36.380> the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
out of any crash to level dodge the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.440 
out of any crash to level dodge the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.090 
one of a courtesan stage as you can see
that<00:05:29.180> ends<00:05:29.720> everywhere<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.950> same

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100

that ends everywhere and the same
henchman<00:05:31.490> as<00:05:31.730> in<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.360> lab<00:05:32.680> it's<00:05:33.680> not<00:05:33.890> one<00:05:34.010> of

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
henchman as in the lab it's not one of

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.610 
henchman as in the lab it's not one of
quarters<00:05:34.490> places<00:05:35.090> unlike<00:05:35.570> night<00:05:35.930> fight<00:05:36.320> which

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
quarters places unlike night fight which

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.530 
quarters places unlike night fight which
I've<00:05:36.770> been<00:05:36.800> talking<00:05:37.160> about<00:05:37.190> for<00:05:37.340> ages<00:05:38.330> that<00:05:38.480> is

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
I've been talking about for ages that is

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.790 
I've been talking about for ages that is
not<00:05:38.930> one<00:05:39.290> of<00:05:39.320> Cortex's<00:05:39.800> place<00:05:40.010> while<00:05:40.310> this<00:05:40.460> is

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
not one of Cortex's place while this is

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.380 
not one of Cortex's place while this is
so<00:05:42.800> yeah<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:44.320> then<00:05:45.320> we<00:05:45.500> are<00:05:45.650> done<00:05:46.150> now<00:05:47.150> this<00:05:47.300> is

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
probably core to the space station

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.450 
probably core to the space station
except<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.570> know<00:05:50.780> we<00:05:50.930> can<00:05:51.050> we<00:05:51.230> can<00:05:51.380> we<00:05:52.160> can<00:05:52.190> hop
