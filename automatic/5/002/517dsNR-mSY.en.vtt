00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.590
 boys but price is it for you too 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 nice to just use double digits 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.050
 win well it is now full one 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.740
 objective what you are trying to achieve 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.710
 against the amateur clubs but goes in particular 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.480
 to the game group we were from the beginning 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.179
 sharp 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.519
 so many goals were scored first 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.749
 for that matter stole okay which 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.949
 assignment you know 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.929
 given prior to this 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.149
 contest 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.560
 we trained a little and a 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.660
 last week already today 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.210
 this morning and then try to get out 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.879
 but yes it is of course whole 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.519
 otherwise you just stand against it 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.050
 or club plays the buildup we have with 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.179
 especially trained in one goes today anyway 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.519
 very easy so yes they are not 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.839
 good measuring point today we have done 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.019
 we had to do that 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.129
 we exchange sets with 600 m2 as 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.719
 They also have a couple made so 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.160
 that is good for you 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.199
 also personally note that it 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.399
 not to vibrate 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.430
 of course but there are full guidance 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.530
 busy we have to get fit and then i said 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.000
 the most important thing and you do that for this 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.330
 type of competitions at the highest pace 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.620
 Ligety long play and participate 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.870
 then yes any good 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.280
 I let myself be told that I am late 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.600
 You have also been difficult at times 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.670
 being an amateur club is now one of these 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.170
 in case you are staying now 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.880
 for training camp in ermelo 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.000
 how do you like the preparations so far 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.040
 yours yes well 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.600
 I 'm glad we are complete this 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.750
 Everyone is back from vacation this week 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.110
 and have the group complete together 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.360
 that is certainly important for us 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.430
 yes and monos is fine with this weather 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.500
 good field 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.890
 hotel so good and yes you have no more 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.990
 required 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.840
 the tap workouts two weeks nice 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.030
 to Italy 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.409
 yes, that is all mass BMI for that matter 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.659
 traveling anyway on Monday and 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.609
 friday how do you say match and 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.259
 that is ultimately what it is all about 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.869
 here we have to lay the foundations a lot 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.020
 can work and so I though we say 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.789
 are finally complete and italy I said 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.770
 more the game we play there 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.509
 Wednesday is sure of days 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.310
 of course also a lot to do around one 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.819
 possibly new stadium how much you that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.819
 as a player 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.900
 yes we get it but according to 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.400
 it also await we can no longer 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.450
 to do 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.980
 of course very different than for the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.260
 people for the club who use it continuously 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.360
 be busy where your players are there 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.230
 prepare us for the season and we 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 hear what happens
