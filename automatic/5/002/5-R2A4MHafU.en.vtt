to that of the actual ipad and has some
rather<00:00:50.850> nice<00:00:51.239> design<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.020> Apple<00:00:52.350> were<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
rather nice design and if Apple were to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.860 
rather nice design and if Apple were to
make<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.250> look<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:54.210> these<00:00:54.420> pictures

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

look<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.289> show<00:00:55.559> around<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.280> want

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
look which will show around here I want

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.529 
look which will show around here I want
it<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.270> had<00:00:57.629> argue<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:59.000> but<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.270> just

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it and had argue one bit but it's just

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.490 
it and had argue one bit but it's just
pretty<00:01:00.809> obvious<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.309> an<00:01:02.670> iPad

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
pretty obvious that it is not an iPad

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.719 
pretty obvious that it is not an iPad
number<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.830> Apple<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:05.489> never

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
number one because Apple would never

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
number one because Apple would never

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
possible way they would leak this thing

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.420 
possible way they would leak this thing
there<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.200> doubt<00:01:28.409> any<00:01:28.740> employees

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
would have access kind of stuff and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
would have access kind of stuff and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
similar to that of iOS but I really

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.100 
similar to that of iOS but I really
can't<00:01:57.570> say<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> iOS<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> there's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
can't say that it is iOS and there's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.569 
can't say that it is iOS and there's
only<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.590> thing<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.890> actually<00:02:02.130> helped<00:02:02.490> me

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
only one thing that actually helped me

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.980 
only one thing that actually helped me
tell<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> zoom

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
right now on through the picture and you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.029 
right now on through the picture and you
can<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.210> safari<00:02:06.899> app<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
can see that safari app that's kind of a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.029 
can see that safari app that's kind of a
squarish<00:02:08.550> book<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.560> safaris<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.739> squared

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
squarish book and safaris not squared

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.120 
squarish book and safaris not squared
it's<00:02:11.459> round<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.470> round<00:02:13.650> kompis

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
it's round as the little round kompis

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.250 
it's round as the little round kompis
things<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.610> could<00:02:14.849> just<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.239> could<00:02:15.660> tell<00:02:15.840> just

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
things so I could just I could tell just

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.350 
things so I could just I could tell just
by<00:02:16.410> looking<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.040> that's<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.790> apple

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
by looking at that that's not the apple

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.660 
by looking at that that's not the apple
logo<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> Safari<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.610> know

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
logo for that for the Safari and I know

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.550 
logo for that for the Safari and I know
that<00:02:20.910> sounds<00:02:21.209> kind<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.510> weird<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:21.810> pretty

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that sounds kind of weird but pretty

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.930 
that sounds kind of weird but pretty
sure<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> logos<00:02:23.489> like<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.790> just

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
sure it's not the logos like you just

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.330 
sure it's not the logos like you just
tell<00:02:24.180> take<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.170> look<00:02:25.319> at<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.530> icons<00:02:26.010> there<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
tell take a look at the icons there you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.729 
tell take a look at the icons there you
can<00:02:26.459> really<00:02:26.640> tell<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:26.970> though<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.930> iOS<00:02:28.440> or

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
can really tell that though the iOS or

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.220 
can really tell that though the iOS or
not<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.220> out<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.580> OS<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.390> running<00:02:30.599> on<00:02:30.810> or

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
not be out the OS that is running on or

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.890 
not be out the OS that is running on or
it's<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.640> some<00:02:32.730> kind<00:02:32.849> of<00:02:32.940> display<00:02:33.540> thing

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it's not just some kind of display thing

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.780 
it's not just some kind of display thing
and<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.349> functioning<00:02:35.130> it's<00:02:35.280> very

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and it's actually functioning it's very

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.840 
and it's actually functioning it's very
similar<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.940> iOS<00:02:39.569> i<00:02:40.260> would<00:02:41.160> say<00:02:41.370> it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
similar to that of to iOS i would say it

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.120 
similar to that of to iOS i would say it
could<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.180> nucleus<00:02:42.780> rtos<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.920> you're<00:02:44.010> not

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
could be nucleus rtos and you're not

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.710 
could be nucleus rtos and you're not
familiar<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.120> mock<00:02:45.390> version

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
familiar with that it's a mock version

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.870 
familiar with that it's a mock version
of<00:02:46.140> iOS<00:02:46.380> which<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.950> actually<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.580> phone

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
of iOS which I actually have on a phone

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.120 
of iOS which I actually have on a phone
here<00:02:48.269> but<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.140> don't<00:02:49.319> have<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:49.920> I'm<00:02:49.980> not

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
here but I don't have it on so I'm not

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.250 
here but I don't have it on so I'm not
gonna<00:02:50.250> show<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.489> but<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.510> little<00:02:51.690> close

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
gonna show you but it's a little close

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.680 
gonna show you but it's a little close
to<00:02:52.319> iOS<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.250> newquay<00:02:53.610> nucleus<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.510> I'm<00:02:54.569> not

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
to iOS to be newquay nucleus so I'm not

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.660 
to iOS to be newquay nucleus so I'm not
sure<00:02:54.750> what<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.470> operating<00:02:56.010> system<00:02:56.310> running

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
sure what the operating system running

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.580 
sure what the operating system running
it<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.690> definitely<00:02:57.870> not<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.410> of
