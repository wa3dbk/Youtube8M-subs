 named frost is one of 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.459
 the most powerful weapons offered 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:07.370
 in the global arms market 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.329
 state company Ukrspecexport 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:11.859
 tank is responsible for the next 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:13.700
 improvements in particular 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.940
 new form of a rolled tower slim

 1200 horsepower engines 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.990
 so instead of a thousand strong engine 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.060
 thermal sight 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.340
 as well as a number of other systems with high quality 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.020

 key feature of the tank 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850
 is the presence of high strength 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.450
 guided weapons 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.320

 440 liters more fuel 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.519
 is in the fuel tanks we dropped 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.360
 on the shelves, the fuel range is 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.960
