00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.930
 today's turn is a way to pull 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 your loss apart from stretching do not lose 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 speed and even win 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 this turn consists of a set of weights 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.050
 Put the weight inside first 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.090
 to then be able to lift the exterior and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.290
 change it when we support is inside 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 finally takes the interior to look for a 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 more stable position a pretty bug 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.040
 common when crossing place the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.660
 tip of the stone from the front to the outside 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.700
 we have to try to make this one 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.690
 inward in the sense to which 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.690
 we want to go 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.040
 you do not have to cross a meter the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.570
 legs just remove a little bit what 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.700
 which is important at the time of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.590
 take out the back foot is to look for a 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.080
 good stability base especially at 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.220
 beginning then we will be reducing 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.020
 this turn as we have told you 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420
 principles can serve even for 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.580
 boost by force with the foot 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.080
 to the outside and gaining speed the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.820
 curve or we can even get to do 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.880
 strength with the outside and then with the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.590
 inside to gain much more speed 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.270
 the way to learn this turn is very 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.640
 easy first learn to cross once 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.280
 rest stabilized then you go back to 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.799
 cross as you notice with more 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.509
 trust you are linking first two and 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.750
 then three or four and then all the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.750
 curve 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 Y 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.140
 one of the restrictions that will help you 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.360
 to take more ease is to enter the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.610
 bend very slowly and try to catch the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.610
 speed in the curve with the fist 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.110
 like skating is a very exercise 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.090
 rhythmic you can use this exercise 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.900
 to break make your more dynamic 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.900
 skating prisca 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.760
 you can also use it in uploads 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.889
 to unload the muscles a little 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.879
 force first one side rest the other 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.879
 and then force it
