00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
imagine you're just walking along and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
imagine you're just walking along and
you<00:01:54.180> find<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.539> few<00:01:54.750> pack<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.110> creepers<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.619> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you find a few pack of creepers but you

you find a few pack of creepers but you
don't<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.399> okay<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.909> we're

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
don't really see them okay so we're

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.020 
don't really see them okay so we're
going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.810> into<00:01:58.049> game<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.380> zero<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.030> then

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
going to go into game with zero and then

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.370 
going to go into game with zero and then
BOOM<00:02:00.240> okay<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.600> we've<00:02:00.719> got<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> couple<00:02:00.990> creepers

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
BOOM okay so we've got a couple creepers

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.690 
BOOM okay so we've got a couple creepers
on<00:02:01.500> us<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.039> pretty<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.549> this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
on us right so pretty much what this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
on us right so pretty much what this
does<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.390> will<00:02:03.539> follow<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.170> right<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
does is they will follow you right and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
then well it might not work with a few

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.090 
then well it might not work with a few
creepers<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.479> let's<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.719> try<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.859> really
