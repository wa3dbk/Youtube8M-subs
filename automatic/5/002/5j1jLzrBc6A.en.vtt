00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
a simple wave like this it would look

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.490 
a simple wave like this it would look
good<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.350> really

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
good but it would be really really

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.530 
good but it would be really really
simple<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.790> too<00:01:48.000> drastic

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

you're damaging your hair you're
breaking<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.159> I<00:03:59.909> mean<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.629> takes<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.930> lot<00:04:01.080> of

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
breaking it and I mean it takes a lot of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.600 
breaking it and I mean it takes a lot of
conditioning<00:04:01.650> treatments<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.189> just<00:04:02.370> try<00:04:02.519> and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
conditioning treatments to just try and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.280 
conditioning treatments to just try and
get<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.790> back<00:04:02.819> that's<00:04:03.659> kind<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.049> reason

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
get it back that's kind of the reason

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.610 
get it back that's kind of the reason
why<00:04:04.379> I<00:04:04.409> never<00:04:04.650> highlighted<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.459> or<00:04:06.620> bleached

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
why I never highlighted it or bleached

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.559
