00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.210
 [Music] 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.510
 it moves quite easily 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.070
 the terminal comes standard as it was 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.269
 showing folder to take from google 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.090
 place the whole camera 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.880
 chrome in the typical options of 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.160
 the team you see 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.739
 tabs from above 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.970
 typical top organization of android 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.000
 lollipop 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.510
 let's see the camera what options we 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.510
 they offer us 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.780
 the camera that can be an hour of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.650
 handle it 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.650
 adjustments and 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.270
 is on the left side of the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.270
 terminal screen 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.799
 here we have the option of automatic hdr 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.440
 activated the theme of 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.930
 focus 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.570
 let's run away I understand it and 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.620
 select the video format that is 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.660
 HP 720 can also be in slow motion 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.070
 the panoramic function this is a 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.870
 timer that when deactivating 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.550
 effectively when you turn off the mode 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.350
 panoramic we can have the 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.630
 the active timer 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.310
 does not have many options but you have to 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.680
 remember that it is a phone that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.500
 only worth 129 euros and that as 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.330
 we said it's going to cost and it comes with 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.110
 Android Olympus has a 4.5 screen 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.880
 inch 5 megapixel camera battery 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.880
 of 2,390 milliamps and a processor 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:23.750
 quad-core that works at 1.2 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.610
 on the other side is these bands that 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.670
 they have sides 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.740
 let's decorate the terminal 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.540
 here you see them are different colors 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.310
 they have even left us a good one that 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.160
 it's a little more to protect a little more 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.610
 of the team are not a remover is not beige 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.750
 withdrawing retires as 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.570
 the fence say of the team this leaves 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.240
 the view the microsd slot and the zone 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.830
 the sim remember that it is a team that 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.140
 has 8 gigas of memory that can be 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.300
 further expand with the micro sd that 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.600
 we have here and that is the time that weighs 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.920
 only 145 grams and that has a giga of 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.610
 ram then as you see you take any 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.940
 support this is any tool 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.960
 any casing of this decoration network 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.270
 you put the lines and they should be 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.920
 easy 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:24.680
 and the truth is that you can not 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.550
 just sucked do it here 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.270
 the team completely record men 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.150
 [Music] 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:38.730
 it's good to the new 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:42.210
 I hold my hands and then have here 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.370
 this little small recess 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.540
 where there is supposed to be this activity for 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.540
 were hospitals 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.500
 droplets and place we are going to put this 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.950
 another that is like more 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.620
 This is more resistant 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.690
 this would be a bit more anti shock in 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.240
 that can be said in some way is 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.240
 a little more on the outside 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.610
 a little 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:24.750
 much more protected with a case 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.360
 Well, it's a bit bad 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.890
 throughout the length of the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.990
 it's a little 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.990
 [Music] 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:41.460
 very interesting because it has an edge of 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.490
 the screen above the profile of the 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.860
 matter with which is the team fell 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.939
 Well, it's easy that he does not suffer much 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.729
 suffer much the screen of hands 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:53.639
 visual or motorola vance something very 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.789
 simple very easy with what to decorate the 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.379
 team and that we really believe that you 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.009
 allows the phone inside that does not 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:04.789
 It has a very high price if you have a 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.789
 high customization
