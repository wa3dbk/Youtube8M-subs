00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.370
 well they must have the ipod connected to

 application let's go down 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.829
 to minimize the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.060
 the iTunes as you are downloading the 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.950
 download is very fast is not very 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 complicated once it has already

 open the application 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.799
 you do not know what always happens 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.110
 and things that should not happen when 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.550

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.130
 continue there is no problem with this 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.860
 good is a very peculiar language in 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.340
 states in the us and in mexico is very 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.340
 continued 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.540

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.330
 let's click 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.020
 the weird things that appear here 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.610
 up that would be like continuing here we 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.500
 it's going to look like where you're going to record 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.660
 application and this is where they are going to 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.610

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.410
 please 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.210
 and that of generating itself as it is once again 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.910
 is already downloading what is the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.210
 application finish 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.100

 we will allow 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.200
 and very well believe us speak to us rather 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.300
 as if it were a time page d 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.239
 and we will have to download the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.440
 games here as you see appears the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.569
 forest asked for more than one battery 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.440
 acribille is plants against zombies 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.879
 big south bay city ​​after review of 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.910
 these two games that I found 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:55.650
 great the truth this mode of combat 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.650
 4 not very well recommended but in short 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.130
 let's download one that does not weigh much 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.629
 and that it be cost 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.360
 well here I show you that down here 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.700
 there appears to be power and as I tell you a 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.620
 once we connect our ipod 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.580
 will appear here 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.610
 this selected that is already connected 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.280
 let's download this 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.690

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.280
 type this 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.710
 the famous running game but 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.820
 Disney movie version of 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.820
 brave as the application appears 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.010
 what images it brings and others to download 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.409
 we click on the red button 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.989
 and here we will see the beginning of the 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:49.129
 download as you see I just downloaded 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:53.120
 the metal slug 3 very beautiful game produced 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.939
 depends on tastes 10 and 0 percent says 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.000
 what is the tempo the run but iphone 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.530
 ipad here should tell you of the version of 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.840
 brave 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.079
 let's go with 1 percent let's wait 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.079
 a little 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.670
 yes 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.160
 well I want to kill time 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.060
 I want to show you that many of you 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.370
 will know how the new itunes is not the ones 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.000
 had brought the truth to take a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.000
 excuse 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:33.460
 we will stay here that this will be 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.460
 not 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.940
 and the songs that we have in the 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.200
 except that it is responded very 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.060
 lovely 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.880
 you have to be recognizing our ipod 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.129
 let's see how to talk 3 percent 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.429
 it can not be 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:54.179
 well this is going to depend I imagine that 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:58.169
 as always depends on the mode and I think 

00:04:54.179 --> 00:05:01.729
 a little of this application does not 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.729
 I already have what language it will be 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.080
 but it's very strange the truth we're going to 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.820
 see that other games have got what 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.260
 those fans services when they could 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.750
 download free is time to 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.500
 download it maghreb plants against 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.850
 zombies 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.850
 let's see us 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.870
 a short Paris are the things they 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.810
 teach 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.080
 very good against this game I think that 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.610
 there is in the family his father according to fifa 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.610
 13 to be written space 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.189
 to continue to continue is the same 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.050
 application that we just downloaded 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:46.629
 let's see how those are going to see how 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.629
 those downloads go 8% 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.249
 good not to do is a little long the 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.409
 video I think we cut here 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:06:01.679
 and we continue when it is already reaching a 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.679
 89% ok
