simply put a card in my camera tell it

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.179

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
where you've tweaked them it might be a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.580 
where you've tweaked them it might be a
good<00:02:39.070> idea<00:02:39.130> because<00:02:40.200> once<00:02:41.200> you've<00:02:41.350> started

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
good idea because once you've started

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.050 
good idea because once you've started
tweaking<00:02:42.100> them<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.340> may<00:02:42.490> want<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.760> give<00:02:42.910> them

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
tweaking them you may want to give them

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.640 
tweaking them you may want to give them
a<00:02:43.150> name<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.840> know<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.260> what<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.470> do

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
a name that you know this is what I do

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.340 
a name that you know this is what I do
under<00:02:45.370> certain<00:02:45.520> circumstances<00:02:46.510> now<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.050> can

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
under certain circumstances now you can

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.720 
under certain circumstances now you can
do<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:47.890> leave<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.520> know<00:02:48.700> that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
do it and just leave it and know that

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.270 
do it and just leave it and know that
Vivid<00:02:49.330> has<00:02:49.570> been<00:02:49.780> tweaked<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.260> little<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.770> in

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
Vivid has been tweaked a little and in

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.450 
Vivid has been tweaked a little and in
fact<00:02:51.580> even<00:02:52.210> in<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> standard<00:02:53.080> setting<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.800> have

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
fact even in the standard setting I have

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.620 
fact even in the standard setting I have
mine<00:02:54.810> set<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.520> slightly<00:02:57.520> sharper<00:02:58.120> than<00:02:58.240> normal

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
mine set to slightly sharper than normal

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.570 
mine set to slightly sharper than normal
because<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.900> find<00:02:59.230> I'm<00:02:59.410> always<00:02:59.650> having<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.280> do<00:03:00.550> a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
because I find I'm always having to do a

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.180 
because I find I'm always having to do a
little<00:03:00.970> bit<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.240> sharpening<00:03:01.800> because<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
little bit of sharpening because the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.950 
little bit of sharpening because the
low-pass<00:03:03.730> filter<00:03:04.210> in<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.420> camera<00:03:04.780> has<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
low-pass filter in the camera has a

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.650 
low-pass filter in the camera has a
softening<00:03:05.590> effect<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.730> I've<00:03:07.090> actually<00:03:07.330> gone

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
softening effect so I've actually gone

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.930 
softening effect so I've actually gone
into<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.320> standard<00:03:08.890> setting<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.460> brought<00:03:09.760> my

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
into the standard setting and brought my

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.930 
into the standard setting and brought my
sharpness<00:03:10.480> up<00:03:10.630> an<00:03:10.870> extra<00:03:11.200> notch<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.860> didn't<00:03:12.820> go

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
sharpness up an extra notch I didn't go

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.790 
sharpness up an extra notch I didn't go
ahead<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.420> rename<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.230> because<00:03:14.590> I've

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
ahead and rename that because I've

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.960 
ahead and rename that because I've
already<00:03:15.100> known<00:03:15.280> I've<00:03:15.459> done<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.820> that's

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
already known I've done it and that's

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.610 
already known I've done it and that's
the<00:03:16.090> only<00:03:16.300> change<00:03:16.600> I<00:03:16.780> made<00:03:16.989> but<00:03:17.320> thanks<00:03:17.590> for

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620

the only change I made but thanks for
bringing<00:03:17.800> that<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.160> because<00:03:18.280> yes<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.790> can

we're<00:03:32.020> back<00:03:32.410> again<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:33.190> oh<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.959> amount<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
we're back again to oh the amount of the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.070 
we're back again to oh the amount of the
amount<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.400> information<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.660> camera<00:03:38.020> is

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
amount of information that the camera is

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.440 
amount of information that the camera is
capturing<00:03:38.370> again<00:03:39.370> if<00:03:39.459> I'm<00:03:39.610> only<00:03:39.790> shooting<00:03:40.150> for

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
capturing again if I'm only shooting for

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.720 
capturing again if I'm only shooting for
web-based<00:03:40.690> type<00:03:41.260> stuff<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.890> later<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.610> I'm

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
web-based type stuff and later on I'm

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.540 
web-based type stuff and later on I'm
going<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.000> convert<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.630> srgb<00:03:44.350> anyway<00:03:44.800> I'm<00:03:45.250> just

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
going to convert to srgb anyway I'm just

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.300 
going to convert to srgb anyway I'm just
going<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.730> let<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.000> camera<00:03:46.330> stay<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.600> srgb<00:03:47.470> for

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
going to let the camera stay in srgb for

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.120 
going to let the camera stay in srgb for
my<00:03:48.489> purposes<00:03:49.090> again<00:03:49.450> I'm<00:03:49.660> outputting

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
my purposes again I'm outputting

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.350 
my purposes again I'm outputting
outputting<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.160> print<00:03:51.580> more<00:03:51.850> often<00:03:52.150> than<00:03:52.330> not

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
outputting to print more often than not

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.979 
outputting to print more often than not
so<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.930> set<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.560> Adobe<00:03:54.220> RGB<00:03:54.660> that's<00:03:55.660> just

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
so I set it to Adobe RGB that's just

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.160 
so I set it to Adobe RGB that's just
simply<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.350> greater<00:03:56.920> color<00:03:57.340> space<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.330> nuances

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
simply a greater color space so nuances

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.500 
simply a greater color space so nuances
between<00:03:59.380> colors<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.610> gradations<00:04:01.420> from

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
between colors that the gradations from

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.290 
between colors that the gradations from
tonality<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:03.070> just<00:04:03.400> much<00:04:03.610> more<00:04:03.640> accurate

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
tonality it's just much more accurate

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.190 
tonality it's just much more accurate
you're<00:04:04.420> going<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.600> find<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.900> don't<00:04:05.050> have

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
you're going to find you don't have

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.070 
you're going to find you don't have
blocked<00:04:05.530> up<00:04:05.769> colors<00:04:06.190> again<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.989> a

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
blocked up colors again just the just a

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.110 
blocked up colors again just the just a
general<00:04:08.380> principle<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.790> can<00:04:09.910> always

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
general principle of you can always

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.820 
general principle of you can always
start<00:04:10.330> with<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.510> lot<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:10.959> work<00:04:11.560> your<00:04:11.680> way<00:04:11.800> down

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
start with a lot and work your way down

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.090 
start with a lot and work your way down
to<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.550> smaller<00:04:12.910> file<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.769> can't<00:04:14.950> start

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
to a smaller file but you can't start

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.410 
to a smaller file but you can't start
with<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.340> smaller<00:04:15.580> file<00:04:15.910> and

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
with that smaller file and

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.750 
with that smaller file and
work<00:04:16.510> your<00:04:16.630> way<00:04:16.720> back<00:04:16.900> absolutely<00:04:18.370> great

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
work your way back absolutely great

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.130 
work your way back absolutely great
analogy<00:04:19.240> that's<00:04:19.540> so<00:04:19.690> true

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
analogy that's so true

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.110 
analogy that's so true
okay<00:04:21.070> now<00:04:21.220> active<00:04:21.790> d-lighting<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:24.120> we've

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
okay now active d-lighting that is we've

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.550 
okay now active d-lighting that is we've
talked<00:04:25.360> about<00:04:25.540> how<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.870> camera<00:04:26.350> has<00:04:26.530> a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
talked about how the camera has a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.860 
talked about how the camera has a
limited<00:04:27.630> capability<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:29.010> capturing<00:04:30.870> tonal

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
limited capability of capturing tonal

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.900 
limited capability of capturing tonal
range<00:04:32.110> or<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.920> tonal<00:04:33.520> range

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
range or a tonal range

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.540 
range or a tonal range
so<00:04:34.060> basically<00:04:34.920> cameras<00:04:35.920> can<00:04:36.070> capture<00:04:36.100> about

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
so basically cameras can capture about

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.000 
so basically cameras can capture about
five<00:04:36.910> stops<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.570> light<00:04:37.810> which<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.680> wife

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
five stops of light which is wife

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.130 
five stops of light which is wife
traditionally<00:04:39.970> photographers<00:04:40.630> always<00:04:40.960> shot

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
traditionally photographers always shot

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.230 
traditionally photographers always shot
sunrises<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:41.830> sunsets<00:04:42.010> because<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.880> Sun<00:04:43.090> was

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
sunrises and sunsets because the Sun was

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.750 
sunrises and sunsets because the Sun was
low<00:04:43.480> in<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.780> sky<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.920> light<00:04:45.100> falling<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.700> the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
low in the sky the light falling on the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.960 
low in the sky the light falling on the
subject<00:04:45.910> was<00:04:46.510> very<00:04:46.750> even<00:04:47.350> was<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.220> sunrises

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
subject was very even was the sunrises

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.400 
subject was very even was the sunrises
and<00:04:49.000> we<00:04:49.210> get<00:04:49.330> more<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.660> more<00:04:49.720> contrast

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
and we get more and more contrast

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.520 
and we get more and more contrast
something<00:04:50.890> has<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.250> give<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.820> oftentimes<00:04:52.630> you

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
something has to give and oftentimes you

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.750 
something has to give and oftentimes you
know<00:04:53.620> we're<00:04:53.740> going<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:53.890> have<00:04:54.100> either<00:04:54.250> really

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
know we're going to have either really

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.060 
know we're going to have either really
really<00:04:55.120> dark<00:04:55.300> blacks<00:04:55.690> or<00:04:56.050> over<00:04:56.560> blown<00:04:56.830> out

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
really dark blacks or over blown out

if<00:04:59.650> you<00:05:00.040> have<00:05:00.250> that<00:05:00.490> turned<00:05:00.760> on<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.930> camera<00:05:02.200> is

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
if you have that turned on the camera is

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.590 
if you have that turned on the camera is
going<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:02.920> automatically<00:05:03.850> try<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.390> make<00:05:04.570> it

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
going to automatically try and make it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.630 
going to automatically try and make it
so<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:04.990> they<00:05:05.290> have<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.950> have<00:05:06.100> kind<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.550> a

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
so that they have you have kind of a

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.580 
so that they have you have kind of a
compressed<00:05:07.180> tonal<00:05:07.630> range<00:05:07.840> if<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.140> will<00:05:08.320> so

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
compressed tonal range if you will so

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.320 
compressed tonal range if you will so
that<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:08.860> all<00:05:09.040> fits<00:05:09.070> within<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.760> frame<00:05:10.060> and

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
that it all fits within the frame and

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.940 
that it all fits within the frame and
once<00:05:10.960> you're<00:05:11.140> in<00:05:11.290> there<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.770> the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
once you're in there you have the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.770 
once you're in there you have the
ability<00:05:12.340> of<00:05:12.430> setting<00:05:12.850> it<00:05:12.940> anywhere<00:05:13.300> from<00:05:13.480> low

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
ability of setting it anywhere from low

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.200 
ability of setting it anywhere from low

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
to high or automatically letting the

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.710 
to high or automatically letting the
camera<00:05:16.480> decide<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.710> it's<00:05:17.950> just<00:05:18.190> a<00:05:18.310> way<00:05:18.490> of

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
camera decide so it's just a way of

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.620 
camera decide so it's just a way of
in-camera<00:05:19.830> increasing<00:05:20.830> your<00:05:20.950> tonal<00:05:21.370> range

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
in-camera increasing your tonal range

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.390 
in-camera increasing your tonal range
again<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:22.900> have<00:05:23.200> other<00:05:23.440> ways<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.890> doing<00:05:24.040> that

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
again I have other ways of doing that

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.390 
again I have other ways of doing that
myself<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:26.410> tend<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.800> do<00:05:26.950> that<00:05:27.130> type<00:05:27.370> of

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
myself so and I tend to do that type of

different so like right now we both have
24<00:06:28.420> 70s<00:06:28.840> on<00:06:28.930> here<00:06:29.140> we<00:06:29.230> might

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
24 70s on here we might

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.070 
24 70s on here we might
be<00:06:29.560> set<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:30.070> you<00:06:30.520> know<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.670> normal<00:06:30.880> setting<00:06:31.330> but

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
be set to you know a normal setting but

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.480 
be set to you know a normal setting but
then<00:06:32.200> we<00:06:32.320> put<00:06:32.470> a<00:06:32.500> different<00:06:32.710> lens<00:06:32.980> on<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:33.370> it

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
then we put a different lens on and it

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.030 
then we put a different lens on and it
has<00:06:33.610> more<00:06:33.790> vignetting<00:06:34.530> so<00:06:35.530> we<00:06:35.650> adjust<00:06:35.980> for

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
has more vignetting so we adjust for

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.290 
has more vignetting so we adjust for
that<00:06:36.130> and<00:06:36.370> then<00:06:36.490> switch<00:06:36.700> back<00:06:36.730> to<00:06:36.970> this<00:06:37.090> later

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
that and then switch back to this later

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.170 
that and then switch back to this later
it's<00:06:37.780> going<00:06:37.960> to<00:06:38.020> mess<00:06:38.350> with<00:06:38.590> the<00:06:39.400> right

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
it's going to mess with the right

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.910 
it's going to mess with the right
they'll<00:06:40.360> have<00:06:40.540> the<00:06:40.690> opposite<00:06:41.170> effect<00:06:41.290> so

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
they'll have the opposite effect so

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.950 
they'll have the opposite effect so
definitely<00:06:42.610> when<00:06:42.820> you<00:06:42.970> make<00:06:43.180> these<00:06:43.390> conscious

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
definitely when you make these conscious

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.960

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
little mental low so you go back later

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.460 
little mental low so you go back later
and<00:06:47.920> take<00:06:48.700> them<00:06:48.910> out<00:06:49.090> as<00:06:49.450> not<00:06:50.110> when<00:06:50.350> they're

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
and take them out as not when they're

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.470 
and take them out as not when they're
not<00:06:50.620> needed<00:06:50.830> I<00:06:51.220> think<00:06:51.850> though<00:06:51.970> if<00:06:52.150> you<00:06:52.240> shoot

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
not needed I think though if you shoot

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.430 
not needed I think though if you shoot
in<00:06:52.690> raw<00:06:53.020> and<00:06:53.410> then<00:06:53.620> take<00:06:54.070> the<00:06:54.250> raw<00:06:54.400> image<00:06:54.700> into

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
in raw and then take the raw image into

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.490 
in raw and then take the raw image into
Nikon<00:06:56.440> cat<00:06:56.770> capture<00:06:57.400> and<00:06:57.520> x2<00:06:57.840> then<00:06:58.840> there's<00:06:59.380> a

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
Nikon cat capture and x2 then there's a

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.800 
Nikon cat capture and x2 then there's a
setting<00:07:00.010> in<00:07:00.100> there<00:07:00.190> that<00:07:00.370> you<00:07:00.460> can<00:07:00.780> sort<00:07:01.780> of

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
setting in there that you can sort of

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.080 
setting in there that you can sort of
adjust<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.350> vignette<00:07:02.650> control<00:07:02.980> yes<00:07:03.220> yes<00:07:03.820> I

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.090 
adjust the vignette control yes yes I

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.180 
adjust the vignette control yes yes I
think<00:07:04.300> I<00:07:04.600> think<00:07:04.960> you're<00:07:05.080> absolutely<00:07:05.440> right<00:07:05.800> so

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
think I think you're absolutely right so

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.130 
think I think you're absolutely right so
again<00:07:06.370> another<00:07:06.880> great<00:07:07.150> reason<00:07:07.480> for<00:07:07.690> shooting

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.140 
again another great reason for shooting
