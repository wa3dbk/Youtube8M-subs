00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
before I get it started

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.250 
before I get it started
I'll<00:02:43.220> show<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.640> sound<00:02:43.910> system<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:45.080> has

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
I'll show you this sound system this has

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.060 
I'll show you this sound system this has
been<00:02:45.440> built<00:02:46.160> up<00:02:46.370> over<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.700> years<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.920> got

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
been built up over the years but you got

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.030 
been built up over the years but you got
some<00:02:49.250> tower<00:02:49.430> speakers<00:02:50.000> here<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.780> fired<00:02:51.739> both

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
some tower speakers here that fired both

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.770 
some tower speakers here that fired both
directions<00:02:52.370> both<00:02:53.030> forward<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.830> aft<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:55.790> you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
directions both forward and aft so you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.640 
directions both forward and aft so you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
here that power is the four factory

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.860 
here that power is the four factory
speakers<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.120> for<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.330> folks<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.750> the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
boat there's two up here and then

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.620 
boat there's two up here and then
there's<00:03:15.650> two<00:03:16.550> in<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.730> back<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.970> big<00:03:20.390> dog

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
here powers the tower speakers so you

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.690 
here powers the tower speakers so you
can<00:03:24.470> imagine<00:03:24.680> they<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:25.250> crank<00:03:25.490> out<00:03:25.640> some

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
can imagine they can crank out some

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.430 
can imagine they can crank out some
volume<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:27.650> amp<00:03:28.100> here<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:28.990> mounted<00:03:29.990> to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
volume and this amp here is mounted to

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.880 
volume and this amp here is mounted to
twelve<00:03:30.680> inch<00:03:30.920> sub<00:03:31.250> in<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.930> compartment<00:03:33.500> here

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
twelve inch sub in the compartment here

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.500 
twelve inch sub in the compartment here
so<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:35.360> boat<00:03:35.600> has<00:03:35.780> dual<00:03:36.140> batteries<00:03:36.850> -<00:03:37.850> Optima

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510
