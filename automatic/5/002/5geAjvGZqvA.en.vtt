00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.410
 Do it with a Chinese blog that matches 2 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.160
 To influence 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.249
 Yes, I am a member of Android 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:14.379
 What 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.430
 Overall customization is perfect 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.630
 It is Hiroshi Mori 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.989
 The theme is that 1.2 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.009
 I'm sure I will switch to the UK 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.159
 Yeah 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.159
 First round in the shell 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.949
 It is introduction of foreign student 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.239
 Yes, it's right now, even now, even in blogs 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.760
 Colm Online has an app called apple 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.740
 We introduced cold storage 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 Country is this launcher pro 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.700
 Lol 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.480
 It was very customizable but it was 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 Entry area after the air 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.580
 This is the time of nm free kick movement 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.960
 It is also this poison 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.260
 Control something 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.910
 Although it was a country of about 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.340
 Another high 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.340
 What is it? In the sense of being genuine 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.590
 Though it was not 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.350
 geometric- 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.280
 Is that icon 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 You can walk with ipodtouch with this minter board 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.370
 It's such a customization 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.880
 I could do it 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.920
 It is a dream 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.400
 Borland Chai 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.360
 If you use the failure 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.600
 1.2 this 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.260
 Junior root student 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.190
 Control the movement of these themes 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.780
 It will be a good idea 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.430
 Eh, right? 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.859
 I have control of hp 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.680
 For example 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.930
 I was able to mu, but I'm aiming for this one piece 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.940
 is not it 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.940
 If you make it a theme like this 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.780
 Overall 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.450
 Changing to a constant with the theme of One Piece 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.290
 This horse background can be compared with metalwork contrast 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.790
 Emoto can do various things in fine setting though 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.359
 It looks like every day for reference 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:13.639
 For example 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.639
 If it is 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:24.119
 Yeah icon and small movement mind time clean management rong comprehensive 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.099
 In 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.449
 It can be changed 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:31.359
 Finally this service launcher ex 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.179
 If you are using numbers 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.430
 It is a break of three laughs 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.019
 In Japan, in the same sense as softening ipodtouch from ltte 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.099
 It is finally good that I can control 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.200
 I am a little moved by the fact that I found an app 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.519
 As we did, we introduced hand 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.239
 It's a game game, but I'm doing this for a while now 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.359
 Of course the pay of the neta 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.159
 Many themes 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.729
 There are a lot of free basics 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.449
 If you're eating, you're going to pull something you like 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.929
 I think it would be fine if you could 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.889
 However personally I like a nice ball Oita Wallpaper 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.659
 Video live 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.589
 I used alcohol 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.939
 It was good because we introduced that many things in this blog 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.939
 I think you should try it 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.499
 I feel that the wallpaper is good 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.159
 By the way 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.969
 More ready for strong android 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.329
 It seems to be one tree of android million yen 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.469
 I wonder if it works 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.549
 This beta version of youtube 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.849
 In this or some other Kuroda 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.439
 If you say only during air and globalization 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.839
 Because I think I can do it 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.569
 If you are interested in it, say 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.249
 We follow our blog 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.339
 If you can 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.449
 It may be fun 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.209
 Today is 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.829
 android 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.239
 2.2 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.519
 Hicky intention 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.199
 It is not 4 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.569
 But to 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.339
 Can be customized 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.479
 Glory lunch school 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.370
 gx 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 I was invited to the argument 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.520
 Here we ended once
