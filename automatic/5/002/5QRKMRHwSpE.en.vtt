something<00:03:39.870> close<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.290> that

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
something close to that

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.290 
something close to that
and<00:03:40.770> there's<00:03:41.070> expansion<00:03:41.640> about<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.150> down

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
and there's expansion about to go down

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.480 
and there's expansion about to go down
for<00:03:42.480> Hyuk<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> definitely<00:03:44.460> a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
for Hyuk so this is a definitely a

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.480 
for Hyuk so this is a definitely a
divergent<00:03:45.210> series<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.780> built<00:03:45.960> here<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.950> he

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
divergent series of built here and he

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
divergent series of built here and he
looks<00:03:47.850> like<00:03:47.940> he's<00:03:48.090> gonna<00:03:48.150> be<00:03:48.270> mining

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
looks like he's gonna be mining

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.970 
looks like he's gonna be mining
something<00:03:48.750> yes<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.020> little<00:03:49.470> bit<00:03:49.650> confusing

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
something yes a little bit confusing

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.370 
something yes a little bit confusing
there<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.580> started<00:03:50.910> mining<00:03:51.090> his<00:03:51.180> gas

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
there it's just started mining his gas

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.630 
there it's just started mining his gas
meanwhile<00:03:52.380> 815<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.040> gonna<00:03:53.190> be<00:03:53.280> able<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.460> gold

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
meanwhile 815 is gonna be able to gold

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.430 
meanwhile 815 is gonna be able to gold

layer right away after the pool is done
and<00:03:55.680> right<00:03:56.280> away<00:03:56.460> afterwards<00:03:56.760> get<00:03:57.390> his

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
and right away afterwards get his

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.680 
and right away afterwards get his
speedlings<00:03:58.740> out<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.390> interesting<00:04:00.390> enough

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
speedlings out so interesting enough

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.710 
speedlings out so interesting enough
he's<00:04:00.930> actually<00:04:01.290> building<00:04:01.560> drones<00:04:01.800> they're

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
he's actually building drones they're

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.790 
he's actually building drones they're
interesting<00:04:03.720> he<00:04:04.170> might<00:04:04.290> have<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.560> build<00:04:04.680> a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
interesting he might have to build a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.770 
interesting he might have to build a
sunken<00:04:05.160> colony<00:04:05.550> then<00:04:05.700> because<00:04:06.060> if<00:04:06.450> he<00:04:06.690> oak

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
sunken colony then because if he oak

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.480 
sunken colony then because if he oak
finds<00:04:06.990> out<00:04:07.200> he's<00:04:07.410> gonna<00:04:07.590> start<00:04:08.130> building<00:04:08.220> some

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
finds out he's gonna start building some

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.460 
finds out he's gonna start building some
wings<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.940> start<00:04:09.330> moving<00:04:09.450> over<00:04:09.780> there<00:04:09.959> maybe

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
wings and start moving over there maybe

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.020 
wings and start moving over there maybe
hyouka<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:10.920> gonna<00:04:11.070> be<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.459> little<00:04:11.730> bit<00:04:11.910> more

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
hyouka is gonna be a little bit more

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.730 
hyouka is gonna be a little bit more
defensive<00:04:12.270> thinking<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.930> with<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.380> earlier

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
him yet so I am a crack

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.180 
him yet so I am a crack
we're<00:04:21.930> seeing<00:04:22.169> yeah<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.620> are<00:04:22.740> seeing<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.010> creep

we're seeing yeah we are seeing a creep

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.430 
we're seeing yeah we are seeing a creep
colony<00:04:23.550> though<00:04:23.669> just<00:04:24.210> in<00:04:24.360> case

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
colony though just in case

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.890 
colony though just in case
well<00:04:26.440> he<00:04:26.680> has<00:04:26.889> not<00:04:27.070> scouted<00:04:27.430> him<00:04:27.460> rather<00:04:27.900> 815

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
well he has not scouted him rather 815

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.050 
well he has not scouted him rather 815
has<00:04:29.020> scouted<00:04:29.350> Hyuk<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:29.919> 815<00:04:30.490> knows<00:04:30.699> there<00:04:30.880> was

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
has scouted Hyuk so 815 knows there was

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.080 
has scouted Hyuk so 815 knows there was
a<00:04:31.120> 12<00:04:31.449> hole<00:04:31.630> but<00:04:32.289> he<00:04:32.500> 15<00:04:33.100> decided<00:04:33.490> just<00:04:33.520> focus

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
a 12 hole but he 15 decided just focus

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.550 
a 12 hole but he 15 decided just focus
on<00:04:34.210> drones<00:04:34.449> that's<00:04:34.750> gonna<00:04:34.900> help<00:04:35.050> him<00:04:35.229> get<00:04:35.410> his

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
on drones that's gonna help him get his

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.340 
on drones that's gonna help him get his
second<00:04:36.340> hatch<00:04:36.490> out<00:04:36.699> which<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.060> assume<00:04:37.389> will<00:04:38.320> be

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
second hatch out which I assume will be

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.870 
second hatch out which I assume will be
made<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.070> main<00:04:39.220> there<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.639> second

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
made in the main there is the second

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.830 
made in the main there is the second
hatch<00:04:40.060> what's<00:04:40.240> gonna<00:04:40.330> help<00:04:40.449> him<00:04:40.600> get<00:04:40.720> that

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
hatch what's gonna help him get that

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.719 
hatch what's gonna help him get that
very<00:04:41.139> quickly<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.740> therefore<00:04:42.610> he's<00:04:42.699> not

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
very quickly and that therefore he's not

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.580 
very quickly and that therefore he's not
gonna<00:04:42.970> be<00:04:43.150> behind<00:04:43.419> an<00:04:43.750> economy<00:04:44.199> for<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.410> long

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
gonna be behind an economy for a long

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.150 
gonna be behind an economy for a long
time

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
time

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.680 
time
of<00:04:45.340> course<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.940> moment<00:04:46.300> when<00:04:46.389> he<00:04:46.449> starts

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
of course the moment when he starts

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.830 
of course the moment when he starts
getting<00:04:46.750> behind<00:04:47.139> is<00:04:47.380> if<00:04:47.740> Hyuk<00:04:48.070> survives<00:04:48.840> past

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
getting behind is if Hyuk survives past

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.270 
getting behind is if Hyuk survives past
muta<00:04:50.139> list<00:04:50.320> for<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> little<00:04:50.830> while<00:04:50.979> and<00:04:51.190> then

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
muta list for a little while and then

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.820 
muta list for a little while and then
gets<00:04:51.639> his<00:04:51.940> second<00:04:52.300> gas<00:04:52.419> up<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.840> is<00:04:52.990> when<00:04:53.139> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
gets his second gas up that is when the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.980 
gets his second gas up that is when the
tides<00:04:54.100> of<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.639> gas<00:04:55.030> war<00:04:55.360> is<00:04:55.509> gonna<00:04:55.660> start

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
tides of the gas war is gonna start

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.550 
tides of the gas war is gonna start
changing<00:04:56.979> here<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:58.270> Hyuk<00:04:58.570> spots<00:04:59.139> a<00:04:59.259> sunken

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
changing here so Hyuk spots a sunken

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.170 
changing here so Hyuk spots a sunken
colony<00:04:59.919> we'll<00:05:00.070> see<00:05:00.220> if<00:05:00.310> your<00:05:00.490> panic<00:05:00.880> Sal<00:05:01.030> ittle

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
panic here one of the best ways is to

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.320 
panic here one of the best ways is to
get<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.560> lot<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:05.949> zerglings<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.610> make<00:05:07.210> an

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
get a lot of zerglings and make an

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.719 
get a lot of zerglings and make an
ill-timed<00:05:07.840> zergling<00:05:08.770> attack<00:05:09.039> and<00:05:09.639> it

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
ill-timed zergling attack and it

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.909 
ill-timed zergling attack and it
sometimes<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.240> works<00:05:10.419> but<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:11.289> know<00:05:11.380> usually

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
sometimes it works but you know usually

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.999 
sometimes it works but you know usually
that<00:05:11.949> is<00:05:12.250> what<00:05:12.729> what<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.419> player<00:05:13.990> who's<00:05:14.289> gone

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
that is what what the player who's gone

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.040 
that is what what the player who's gone
for<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.250> earlier<00:05:15.520> tech<00:05:15.820> expects<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.539> most<00:05:16.780> is

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
for the earlier tech expects the most is

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.800 
for the earlier tech expects the most is
that<00:05:17.470> big<00:05:18.009> zergling<00:05:18.490> attack<00:05:18.729> and<00:05:19.060> with

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
that big zergling attack and with

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.020 
that big zergling attack and with
modern-day<00:05:20.530> drone<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.099> zergling<00:05:21.430> micro<00:05:21.759> it

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
modern-day drone and zergling micro it

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.070 
modern-day drone and zergling micro it
is<00:05:22.180> very<00:05:22.419> hard<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.690> pull<00:05:22.900> off

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
is very hard to pull off

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.050 
is very hard to pull off
so<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:24.190> stalking<00:05:24.400> colonies<00:05:24.789> actually

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
so that stalking colonies actually

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.110 
so that stalking colonies actually
placed<00:05:25.270> an<00:05:25.449> interesting<00:05:26.020> position<00:05:26.199> there

gotten<00:05:42.729> this<00:05:42.820> wall<00:05:43.030> I<00:05:43.240> guess<00:05:43.419> what<00:05:43.840> is<00:05:44.229> this

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
gotten this wall I guess what is this

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.290 
gotten this wall I guess what is this
does<00:05:44.740> is<00:05:44.949> makes<00:05:45.159> it<00:05:45.250> son<00:05:45.460> colony<00:05:45.789> very<00:05:46.090> very

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
does is makes it son colony very very

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.089 
does is makes it son colony very very
difficult<00:05:46.449> to<00:05:46.750> surround<00:05:47.020> but<00:05:47.590> he<00:05:47.740> looks<00:05:48.039> like

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
difficult to surround but he looks like

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:49.439 
difficult to surround but he looks like
he<00:05:48.340> is<00:05:48.430> gonna<00:05:48.550> be<00:05:48.669> going<00:05:48.849> for<00:05:48.909> a<00:05:49.060> lot<00:05:49.360> of

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
he is gonna be going for a lot of

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.670 
he is gonna be going for a lot of
zerglings<00:05:49.690> so<00:05:49.960> we'll<00:05:50.139> see<00:05:50.289> if<00:05:50.349> he<00:05:50.380> manages

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
zerglings so we'll see if he manages

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.100 
zerglings so we'll see if he manages
that<00:05:50.770> break<00:05:50.949> this<00:05:51.159> on<00:05:52.060> their<00:05:52.180> handle<00:05:52.510> like<00:05:52.990> I

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
that break this on their handle like I

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.360 
that break this on their handle like I
was<00:05:53.229> saying<00:05:53.440> it's<00:05:53.590> not<00:05:53.740> a<00:05:53.770> great<00:05:53.979> position<00:05:54.130> for

for protecting your drones because I

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.249 
for protecting your drones because I

think at least that top drone is gonna
be<00:05:59.320> vulnerable<00:05:59.500> there<00:05:59.800> we<00:05:59.889> go<00:05:59.979> we<00:06:00.159> see<00:06:00.190> him

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
be vulnerable there we go we see him

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.189 
be vulnerable there we go we see him
being<00:06:00.820> vulnerable<00:06:01.090> there<00:06:01.419> and<00:06:01.599> he<00:06:01.870> might<00:06:02.080> be

probably had been practicing the same

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.320 
probably had been practicing the same
build<00:06:53.349> because<00:06:53.529> they<00:06:53.770> did<00:06:53.889> the<00:06:53.979> same<00:06:54.129> thing

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
build because they did the same thing

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.610 
build because they did the same thing
going<00:06:55.330> for<00:06:55.509> that<00:06:55.569> early<00:06:55.870> gas<00:06:56.050> and<00:06:56.379> then

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
going for that early gas and then

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.790 
going for that early gas and then

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
forcing Hyuk to go for a couple of sport

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.110 
forcing Hyuk to go for a couple of sport
colonies<00:07:00.099> so<00:07:00.249> he<00:07:00.430> did<00:07:00.639> have<00:07:00.759> to<00:07:00.909> get<00:07:01.029> those

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
colonies so he did have to get those

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.309 
colonies so he did have to get those
sport<00:07:01.360> colonies<00:07:01.659> after<00:07:01.930> all<00:07:02.050> that's<00:07:02.139> gonna

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
sport colonies after all that's gonna

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.529 
sport colonies after all that's gonna
hurt<00:07:02.529> his<00:07:02.650> economy<00:07:03.009> a<00:07:03.129> lot<00:07:03.460> just<00:07:04.150> like<00:07:04.300> I<00:07:04.389> did

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
hurt his economy a lot just like I did

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.959 
hurt his economy a lot just like I did
in<00:07:04.599> that<00:07:04.629> other<00:07:04.960> night<00:07:05.169> it<00:07:06.009> allowed<00:07:06.370> luxury

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
in that other night it allowed luxury

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.339 
in that other night it allowed luxury
actually<00:07:07.240> got<00:07:07.419> a<00:07:07.449> third<00:07:07.659> hatch<00:07:07.840> up<00:07:08.080> pretty

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.349 
actually got a third hatch up pretty

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:11.550 
actually got a third hatch up pretty
safely<00:07:08.830> so<00:07:09.550> we'll<00:07:10.090> see<00:07:10.240> if<00:07:10.449> 815<00:07:11.199> does<00:07:11.409> that

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
safely so we'll see if 815 does that

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.929 
safely so we'll see if 815 does that
also<00:07:11.740> I<00:07:11.919> mean<00:07:12.099> given<00:07:12.400> the<00:07:12.460> way<00:07:12.580> that<00:07:12.729> they're

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:12.939 
also I mean given the way that they're

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.529 
also I mean given the way that they're
they've<00:07:13.360> been<00:07:13.479> playing<00:07:13.719> so<00:07:13.900> far<00:07:14.110> the
