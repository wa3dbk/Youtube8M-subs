which<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.670> inflated<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.450> we'll<00:00:45.600> get

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
which I know is inflated but we'll get

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
which I know is inflated but we'll get
to<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> parts<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.559> minute<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:47.670> one

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to the parts in a minute so that's one

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.360 
to the parts in a minute so that's one
hundred<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.120> sixty<00:00:48.420> dollars<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.690> EFC<00:00:49.370> let's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
hundred and sixty dollars for EFC let's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.279 
hundred and sixty dollars for EFC let's
say<00:00:50.579> these<00:00:50.730> wiring<00:00:51.120> harnesses<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.719> another<00:00:51.930> 30

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
say these wiring harnesses or another 30

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.590 
say these wiring harnesses or another 30
so<00:00:52.699> $190<00:00:54.110> 390<00:00:55.110> -<00:00:55.440> 190<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.160> $200<00:00:57.120> roughly

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
so $190 390 - 190 we got $200 roughly

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
so $190 390 - 190 we got $200 roughly
for<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> frame<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.980> frame<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> stamped

for the frame and this frame is stamped
aluminum<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.870> superlight<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:02.969> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
aluminum it's superlight so you know I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.920 
aluminum it's superlight so you know I
don't<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.290> $200<00:01:04.290> 225<00:01:05.159> maybe<00:01:05.580> 250<00:01:06.060> wherever
