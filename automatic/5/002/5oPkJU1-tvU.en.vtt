00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.490
 and so for all day to find us 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.849
 for a small video with rabies 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 so this would be for a tutorial on 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.219
 how to have age of empires iii with a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.350
 Mast gives French finally gives 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.720
 I therefore find in and I go elsewhere 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.140
 three in French with all the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 extensions but hey that's next 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.539
 so for that it would take utorrent 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.460
 and bundles that instruments the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.719
 description and so that's when 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.020
 you will have downloaded so edge a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.050
 lessor on a torrent site that I 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.399
 will also put in the industry it will take 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.270
 go to your files that you want 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.680
 vt was looking so good it's not here 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.949
 normally there was so there will be 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.629
 a small icon with a disk that will make 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:06.100
 it will be like what you can use 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:08.200
 bullets / on this icon and 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.140
 so a small a little icon without 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:17.020
 end nikon daemon tools rapeseed and so 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.899
 so you can so you should you 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.299
 have to put your files here I know 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.860
 more where they are but once you 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.759
 the must have it needs the church is in 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.759
 actually went in drag 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:43.000
 normally I would have to find the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:47.069
 best 3 files so this is it 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.330
 file therefore has them as here are the 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.229
 files with her and with the little 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.509
 school demon days 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.119
 I had just dragged them into this 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.679
 part there so you'll have them here and 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.840
 then either go back up or 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.830
 do this and choose directly or via 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.289
 the file like that I 'm already trying 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.030
 so actually it represents the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.239
 three installation cd of the game after that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.420
 depends on the level of the cd that end of the game 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.790
 you also want after for objects 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.719
 different cd 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:28.439
 2 3 so here in this case had to jaffna 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:29.790
 r3 and there are three and ben here is the 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.829
 first cd so for installation 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.239
 after you it is as if you ask 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.819
 actually change your cd 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.590
 computer convince the cd 1 2 and 3 to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.390
 follow except that you have there in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 made 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.170
 and once you have them you have 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.760
 do all this so it's a chain and 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 of basic installations of the jump 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:54.260
 else you yes so on your desk 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.879
 here and for me it works fine 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:04.680
 and so it's embarrassing too because I want 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:07.560
 do it so I had a little problem 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.569
 so I'm with windows 7 I have a 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.909
 compatibility problem with the game 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.760
 who told me that the game was not 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.409
 not compatible with my version of 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.409
 windows so 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.620
 so I had the problem of 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.930
 compatibility with with south mount 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.000
 issued in executing the program of 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.900
 normal compatibility the game does not 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.530
 did not work that made them 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.930
 were incompatible 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.930
 just right click on the game 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.090
 ownership and compatibility and it takes 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.160
 check this box to choose them after 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.440
 your easter service and we feel this 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.310
 that you want the options behind one 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.960
 I did not touch 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.310
 it works very well so here you are 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.480
 see, I'm behind who 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.480
 works very well 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.970
 the beginning of the game you normal it starts 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.760
 with a little bit otherwise I'm me 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.030
 repressed I'm not in full screen 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.310
 I'm actually no I'm not confined 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.080
 Sort me I do not care screen with 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.400
 maximum resolutions it works very 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.680
 well 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.110
 so here you have poorly tutorial mode 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.600
 the tutorial a multiplayer player and 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.780
 tools so here we are 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.790
 you will have version 1.0 of what I 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.960
 gave you then download a 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.840
 patch that I also put in the 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.930
 description it's the same principle that in 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.730
 this no no no strong just the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.580
 download the run it tells you to 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.140
 someone will tell you that your game 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.710
 will mine will play so the version this is 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.120
 the campaign 14 for now and so this 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.860
 will be for multiplayer if not for a 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.180
 player like you ready for them 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.550
 extensions I have not downloaded them 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.090
 less boring I made standards 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.460
 three normal with 500 extensions 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.530
 I can put them people do not see 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.430
 utility for now so we're 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.430
 now in my file 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.870
 which is actually here in the file 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.040
 here I am the two of the others 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.850
 extensions so that's the principle of 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.639
 the church is it is useless so I 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.290
 become dynasty and their chief fief 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.760
 good after for years there are the problems 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.200
 with the other two extensions this I do not 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.990
 do not know for now dear young people I 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.169
 did not touch it 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.180
 so here we are going to end this 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:48.520
 little tutorial on questions of 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:54.040
 problems comment ceret 2 solve 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:57.270
