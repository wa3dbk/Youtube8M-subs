35 millimeter rangefinder got it out of
Swami<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:07.259> about<00:00:07.470> 20<00:00:07.799> bucks<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.250> great<00:00:08.580> camera

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
it is a 45 millimeter f1 plenty so

really sharp pictures here's the flash
sync<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.550> those<00:00:24.300> numbers<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.779> actually<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
sync and those numbers is actually the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.480 
sync and those numbers is actually the
depth<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> field<00:00:25.769> calculator<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.310> kind<00:00:26.460> of

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
depth of field calculator it's kind of

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.890 
depth of field calculator it's kind of
an<00:00:26.640> old-school<00:00:26.849> way<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.240> calculating<00:00:27.630> depth

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
an old-school way of calculating depth

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.710 
an old-school way of calculating depth
of<00:00:28.050> field<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.650> you're<00:00:29.130> gonna<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.720> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
of field and you're gonna see the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.290 
of field and you're gonna see the
numbers<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> ring<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.710> how<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.730> what's<00:00:33.180> in

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
numbers on the ring is how is what's in

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
numbers on the ring is how is what's in
focus<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.350> numbers<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.890> left<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.460> so

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
focus and the numbers on that left is so

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.350 
focus and the numbers on that left is so
if<00:00:36.149> you're<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.390> f/4<00:00:37.879> whatever's<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> ring

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
if you're at f/4 whatever's on the ring

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569 
if you're at f/4 whatever's on the ring
is<00:00:39.540> gonna<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.050> focus<00:00:40.260> between<00:00:40.860> those<00:00:41.340> two

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is gonna be in focus between those two

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
is gonna be in focus between those two
fours<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.750> pretty<00:00:42.840> old-school<00:00:43.140> never

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
fours so it's pretty old-school never

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.430 
fours so it's pretty old-school never
seen<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> before<00:00:44.600> don't<00:00:45.600> use<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> too<00:00:46.050> much<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
seen it before don't use it too much I

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380 
seen it before don't use it too much I
just<00:00:46.469> usually<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.489> look<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> range<00:00:48.180> mine

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
just usually just look at the range mine

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.139 
just usually just look at the range mine
and<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.539> what's<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.780> focus<00:00:49.789> here<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.969> where

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and see what's in focus here is where

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.069 
and see what's in focus here is where
you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.360> set<00:00:51.510> your<00:00:51.600> aperture<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.020> shutter

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you can set your aperture and shutter

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
you can set your aperture and shutter
speed<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:53.160> thing<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.460> playing<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.910> the

speed this thing I'm playing with on the
right<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> self

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
right right now that's actually a self

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
right right now that's actually a self
timer<00:00:56.000> I<00:00:57.000> didn't<00:00:57.690> use<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.190> overview

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
timer I didn't use it in this overview

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
timer I didn't use it in this overview
because<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.149> film<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.780> don't<00:01:01.050> want

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to waste a shot on this also the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
to waste a shot on this also the
apertures<00:01:05.100> go<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.519> 1/8<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.330> 16<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.990> then

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
apertures go from 1/8 to 16 and then

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
apertures go from 1/8 to 16 and then
also<00:01:07.290> has<00:01:07.470> an<00:01:07.560> auto<00:01:07.710> mode<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.060> don't<00:01:09.330> use

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

also has an auto mode but I don't use
auto<00:01:09.840> mode<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.200> these<00:01:10.320> type<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.500> cameras<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
auto mode on these type of cameras I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.350 
auto mode on these type of cameras I
usually<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.430> shoot<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.850> manual<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
usually just shoot them in manual and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.649 
usually just shoot them in manual and
talk<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:12.810> bout<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.080> later<00:01:14.450> I'm<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
talk a little bout that later I'm the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.969 
talk a little bout that later I'm the
bottom<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> camera<00:01:16.320> you're<00:01:16.560> gonna<00:01:16.650> find

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
bottom of the camera you're gonna find

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
bottom of the camera you're gonna find
that<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.430> where<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> set<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.270> si<00:01:18.689> or

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that that's where you set your a si or

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
that that's where you set your a si or
film<00:01:19.080> speed<00:01:19.580> also<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> focus<00:01:21.299> mechanism

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
film speed also is the focus mechanism

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
film speed also is the focus mechanism
and<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> gorgeous

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and you can see this is a gorgeous

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
and you can see this is a gorgeous
camera<00:01:23.460> overall<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.570> smooth

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
camera overall and just really smooth

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.770 
camera overall and just really smooth
it's<00:01:25.830> gonna<00:01:25.920> last<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.400> while<00:01:26.580> they<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.600> built

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it's gonna last a while they just built

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.240 
it's gonna last a while they just built
really<00:01:27.900> well<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.390> here's<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> viewfinder

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
really well and here's the viewfinder

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.899 
really well and here's the viewfinder
rangefinders<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> totally<00:01:32.850> different

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
rangefinders is just a totally different

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
rangefinders is just a totally different
experience<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:33.780> first<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.229> really

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
experience this is my first one really

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
experience this is my first one really
like<00:01:35.310> shooting<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.329> how

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
like shooting with it really like how

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
like shooting with it really like how
it's<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.350> different<00:01:37.619> than<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.520> an

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it's just different than what you get an

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.510 
it's just different than what you get an
SLR<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.210> anything<00:01:39.450> else<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> bottom

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
SLR or anything else so on the bottom

SLR or anything else so on the bottom
here's<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> battery<00:01:42.090> check<00:01:42.299> mechanism<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
