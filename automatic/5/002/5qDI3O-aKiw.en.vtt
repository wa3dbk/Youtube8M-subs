00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.339
 831 the captain of the British navy 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 James Clark Rose was the first to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.480
 determine the position of the north pole 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
 magnetic in northern Canada from 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.320
 then the magnetic pole has 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.269
 displaced incredibly 2000 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.100
 kilometers the new calculations 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.789
 show that now it moves between 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.519
 55 and 60 kilometers a year and if nothing 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.420
 change you will reach iberia around the year 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.420
 2040 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.050
 the magnetic pole is in fact the axis of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.050
 our Earth 's magnetic field 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.579
 at 3000 km under our feet the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.949
 Earth core formed by metals 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.600
 liquids and the core iron generates 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.600
 an invisible magnetic field 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.930
 although few people are aware of their 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.460
 existence this magnetic field has 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.490
 a great importance in our life 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.490
 daily 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.640
 the clearest proof of its existence 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.240
 can be found in the regions 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 polar of the planet the auroras 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.290
 are formed when particles of origin 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.369
 solar are trapped in the shield 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.369
 magnetic of our planet 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.950
 the shield that surrounds the earth by way of 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.460
 protective bubble reaches a height of 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.350
 tens of thousands of kilometers 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.150
 it protects us from lethal particles 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.409
 coming from outer space and 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.409
 even from our own sun 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.820
 the sun produces a constant current 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.799
 of radiation that would wreak havoc on the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.290
 land if we were not protected by 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.600
 our natural shield yes in the field 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.090
 magnetic the terrestrial atmosphere such and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.490
 as we know it would disappear and with 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.380
 she any way of life the earth 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.539
 I would be as dead as Mars or the moon 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.690
 none of which has a field 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.690
 magnetic
