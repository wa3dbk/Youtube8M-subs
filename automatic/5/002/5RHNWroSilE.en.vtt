00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.590
 powerful to parry cocks q2 I cheated 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.010
 in short, only to introduce you to them 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.480
 episode of the road in this case 50k 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.180
 I tell you guys from the institute 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.270
 decided to split this broken 50k into 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.950
 two parts for these two simple reasons 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.630
 first to put a little more video 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.270
 here to try to stay even a little 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.730
 more active is the second reason is precisely 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.619
 because otherwise I don't say that it would be 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.110
 become too long but six minutes or 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.059
 seven minutes continued to watch the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.730
 buying inter seems a little boring to me 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.800
 however boys have left with 5000 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.450
 6000 forecast I don't remember first thing 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.220
 what i have done is that convenient like 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.630
 always to buy a nice kiefer 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.100
 later I also took a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.920
 silver goalkeeper player 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.739
 dell'anderlecht own sow and then 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.530
 however now of course you know 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.360
 see if you also hear that then 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.190
 that I will buy I will sell you will see in the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.110
 background and so much of what I would like to talk about 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.730
 first of all I wanted to thank you for the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.719
 I like it neither in the other episode 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.549
 in the fixed road to 35k episode 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.100
 reached have surpassed the great i 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.189
 300 we are at 306 considering great e 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.899
 then for the 3,200 17 members then boys 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.200
 then this is it 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:23.539
 and then I wanted to thank marco si 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.179
 blue super sic 58 but so 58 why 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.389
 because he and helped me helped me 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.009
 he just made this transaction 

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:32.810
 however what we did this 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.060
 in this episode it is not that they are 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.710
 set right 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.869
 we tried to vary the most 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.909
 possible and initially with the players 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.970
 gold then we switched to silver leather 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.610
 a little ambiguous thank you first of all 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.990
 I also wanted to tell you that if you like them 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.210
 these videos of the complementary mi 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.220
 I recommend you put a nice like 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.229
 commented and this because because I no longer 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.729
 I like it the more I feel like it 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.840
 to get them out of the video of 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.820
 second channel with a frequency 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.490
 greater then precisely seeing more vi 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.009
 like it makes me powerfully more pleasure is 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.259
 so let yourself taste it well 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.360
 subsequently in vivo the geese ask 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.670
 if in this channel you only wanted to see 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.830
 buying or selling, or even why 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.239
 precisely of cola he understood well puts us 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.819
 little or not depends on the days but 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.799
 precisely if you want to see even a few 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.720
 other video I recommend you write in 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.910
 comments such as what already with remains 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.290
 then seeing them guys another thing I wanted 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.569
 speak for a moment takes advantage of the opportunity to 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.569
 talk about the price collapse market 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.220
 because I saw a few people up 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.739
 youtube that he explained comes to but 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.120
 for me he was wrong because then 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.070
 first I tell you that the collapse 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.109
 there will be prices but when there has been 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.820
 he was not tied to the week 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.530
 the team decided what you were 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.180
 this week he was tied to the team 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.980
 of the week says precisely state 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.840
 the one with christian orlando second in 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.569
 many oven said the collapse 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.140
 price has already started a kind stuff 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.030
 but the Mayans 9 silve boys I can 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.340
 ensure rest has a lot of conditioning 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.690
 however, I will talk about the collapse that exists 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.100
 been this week has nothing to do with it 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.319
 nothing with the season team 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.489
 maybe it centers on the video that 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.060
 they told you to sell 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.770
 all however certainly not 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.660
 decided it had nothing to do with the team alone 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.340
 of the week is now not that the prices 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.349
 they will get up great but for me 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 now this thing still needs to be seen 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.270
 these two weeks get up a pole 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.430
 already noted there is to say this however not 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.930
 wait until the only big increase 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.180
 which I just wanted to say that 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.160
 what there has been in these days not 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.110
 is absolutely tied to the shooting decided 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.810
 anyway guys here the video is already 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.610
 to finish I will get about 15,000 credits e 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.440
 so it was a very quick thing 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.660
 however of the players from the center 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.209
 most used are in nestor pisano 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.390
 cameroon and schmeichel now I don't know how 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.370
 let's say in denmark 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.380
 I don't know how to say it, I think it's not 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.180
 only the language of Denmark too 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.100
 they seem saved in an interaction with 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.720
 milk with boys said this axis ii 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.860
 you will be telling you ball power on 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.860
 mayor immediately bubble
