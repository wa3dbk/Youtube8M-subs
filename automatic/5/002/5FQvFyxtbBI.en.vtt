and<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.390> found<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.990> quite<00:01:28.080> easy<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and I really I found it quite easy to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.929 
and I really I found it quite easy to
learn<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:28.950> once<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.640> start

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
learn I think once you kind of get start

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.499 
learn I think once you kind of get start
it's<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> intuitive<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> signs<00:01:33.299> make

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's kind of intuitive the signs make

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.640 
it's kind of intuitive the signs make
sense<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> boys<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.290> saying<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
sense with the boys you're saying so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.260 
sense with the boys you're saying so
