good place to find powder the skills you
need<00:00:52.220> are<00:00:52.640> a<00:00:52.699> combination<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.570> ability<00:00:53.720> to

write bumps and ride powder I'd highly

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.210 
write bumps and ride powder I'd highly
recommend<00:00:56.750> staying<00:00:57.379> out<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.710> trees<00:00:57.949> until

recommend staying out of the trees until

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.070 
recommend staying out of the trees until
you've<00:00:58.460> had<00:00:58.519> a<00:00:58.580> chance<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:59.210> explore<00:00:59.600> those<00:00:59.809> two

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
you've had a chance to explore those two

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:08.020 
you've had a chance to explore those two
areas<00:01:00.470> of<00:01:00.500> shredding<00:01:03.520> writing<00:01:04.520> trees<00:01:06.369> if<00:01:07.369> the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
areas of shredding writing trees if the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.940 
areas of shredding writing trees if the
snow<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.270> deep<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.869> trees<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:09.770> want

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
snow is deep in the trees then you want

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.230 
snow is deep in the trees then you want
to<00:01:10.039> write<00:01:10.220> in<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.430> more<00:01:10.460> of<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.880> straight<00:01:11.210> line

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
to write in a more of a straight line

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.960 
to write in a more of a straight line
with<00:01:12.200> light<00:01:12.470> turns<00:01:12.800> just<00:01:13.190> leaning<00:01:13.490> from<00:01:13.729> side

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970

with light turns just leaning from side
to<00:01:14.000> side<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.320> keep<00:01:15.500> your<00:01:15.680> speed<00:01:16.130> and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
to side so you can keep your speed and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.609 
to side so you can keep your speed and
momentum<00:01:16.420> rather<00:01:17.420> than<00:01:17.570> constantly<00:01:18.050> trying

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
momentum rather than constantly trying

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.580 
momentum rather than constantly trying
to<00:01:18.770> slow<00:01:18.920> yourself<00:01:19.039> down<00:01:19.280> if<00:01:20.259> you<00:01:21.259> start<00:01:21.500> to

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
to slow yourself down if you start to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.630 
to slow yourself down if you start to
pick<00:01:21.770> up<00:01:21.890> more<00:01:22.130> speed<00:01:22.369> than<00:01:22.490> you're

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
pick up more speed than you're

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.609 
pick up more speed than you're
comfortable<00:01:23.030> with<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.869> can<00:01:24.050> hammer<00:01:24.320> some

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
comfortable with you can hammer some

weight into your tail combined with a
little<00:01:26.690> counter<00:01:26.960> rotation<00:01:27.289> for<00:01:27.679> a<00:01:27.710> slash<00:01:29.170> this

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
little counter rotation for a slash this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.139 
little counter rotation for a slash this
technique<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.800> relatively<00:01:31.310> easy<00:01:31.580> in<00:01:31.880> tight

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
locations it will dump some speed but
