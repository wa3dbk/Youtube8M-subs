after the semi rather that he was

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
basically feeling himself out for the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.290 
basically feeling himself out for the
main<00:02:43.770> event<00:02:43.800> now<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.610> time<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:44.970> him<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.120> go

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.390 
main event now at the time for him to go
I<00:02:45.630> think<00:02:46.110> probably<00:02:46.590> though<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> first<00:02:47.220> few

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
I think probably though the first few

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.720 
I think probably though the first few
laps<00:02:47.610> he<00:02:47.850> was<00:02:48.000> still<00:02:48.209> feeling<00:02:48.450> himself<00:02:48.840> out<00:02:49.730> my

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
laps he was still feeling himself out my

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.780 
laps he was still feeling himself out my
guess<00:02:51.030> would<00:02:51.060> be<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.620> he's<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:53.340> only<00:02:53.459> one

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
guess would be that he's with only one

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.610 
guess would be that he's with only one
position<00:02:54.330> or<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.660> gain<00:02:54.959> because<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
position or so to gain because of the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.729 
position or so to gain because of the
huge<00:02:55.950> gap<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.340> front<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.290> Mike<00:02:58.290> koprowski

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
huge gap in front of Mike koprowski

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.890

Bradshaw one tonight this championship

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.990 
Bradshaw one tonight this championship
is<00:03:15.050> over<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.860> wonder<00:03:16.100> what<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.520> think<00:03:16.850> it

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
is over and I wonder what you think it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.700 
is over and I wonder what you think it
is<00:03:17.030> that's<00:03:17.420> going<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.720> save<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.170> title<00:03:18.530> hope

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
is that's going to save the title hope

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.860 
is that's going to save the title hope
so<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.400> example<00:03:19.520> Jeff<00:03:20.090> standard<00:03:20.510> number<00:03:20.600> two

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
so for example Jeff standard number two

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.560 
so for example Jeff standard number two
well<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.260> think<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:22.130> they<00:03:22.580> all<00:03:22.820> have<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.270> little

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
well I think that they all have a little

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.660 
well I think that they all have a little
bit<00:03:23.900> left<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.560> think<00:03:24.800> if<00:03:24.920> they<00:03:25.040> get<00:03:25.250> off<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
bit left and I think if they get off the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.060 
bit left and I think if they get off the
line<00:03:25.910> together<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.780> we're<00:03:26.960> going<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.260> see

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
line together that we're going to see

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.040 
line together that we're going to see
them<00:03:28.280> reach<00:03:28.580> down<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:28.910> find<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.630> little<00:03:29.870> bit

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
them reach down and find that little bit

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.300 
them reach down and find that little bit
extra<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.560> think<00:03:30.770> we're<00:03:30.860> going<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.070> see<00:03:31.130> the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
extra and I think we're going to see the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.770 
extra and I think we're going to see the
matchups<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.940> duels<00:03:32.210> and<00:03:32.480> we've<00:03:32.630> been

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
matchups the duels and we've been

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.900 
matchups the duels and we've been
looking<00:03:33.080> for<00:03:33.320> all<00:03:33.560> year<00:03:33.890> long<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.520> think

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
looking for all year long I think

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.630 
looking for all year long I think
Stanton<00:03:35.390> can<00:03:36.350> run<00:03:36.590> with<00:03:36.800> Bradshaw<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.490> I

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
Stanton can run with Bradshaw and I

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.220 
Stanton can run with Bradshaw and I
certainly<00:03:37.910> know<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.240> veil<00:03:38.660> can<00:03:38.990> bond<00:03:39.200> with

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
certainly know that veil can bond with

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.200 
certainly know that veil can bond with
Bradshaw<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.550> think<00:03:40.730> that<00:03:40.850> they<00:03:40.970> need<00:03:41.150> to

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
Bradshaw and I think that they need to

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.460 
Bradshaw and I think that they need to
prove<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.690> themselves<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.320> you<00:03:42.410> know

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
prove it to themselves and you know

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.870 
prove it to themselves and you know
where<00:03:42.680> they're<00:03:42.770> going<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.010> do<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.340> he's<00:03:43.640> not

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
where they're going to do that he's not

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.090 
where they're going to do that he's not
give<00:03:44.330> away<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.810> five<00:03:45.110> or<00:03:45.410> ten<00:03:45.590> seconds<00:03:46.040> at

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
give away that five or ten seconds at

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.440 
give away that five or ten seconds at
the<00:03:46.160> beginning<00:03:46.490> of<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:46.610> race<00:03:46.790> they've<00:03:47.030> got<00:03:47.270> to

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the beginning of the race they've got to

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.270 
the beginning of the race they've got to
get<00:03:47.570> off<00:03:47.720> with<00:03:47.900> Bradshaw<00:03:48.380> they've<00:03:48.800> got<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.070> run

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
get off with Bradshaw they've got to run

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.860 
get off with Bradshaw they've got to run
with<00:03:49.460> it<00:03:49.580> can<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:49.910> make<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.270> pass<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.510> then

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
with it can then make the pass and then

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.820 
with it can then make the pass and then
I<00:03:50.900> think<00:03:51.170> we're<00:03:51.290> going<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.500> see<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.650> whole<00:03:51.710> new

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
I think we're going to see a whole new

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.640 
I think we're going to see a whole new
series<00:03:52.160> as<00:03:52.820> we<00:03:53.180> watch<00:03:53.450> Stanton<00:03:54.020> circulating

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
series as we watch Stanton circulating

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.380 
series as we watch Stanton circulating
and<00:03:54.770> second<00:03:55.160> thought<00:03:55.370> there<00:03:55.640> is<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.790> change<00:03:56.210> in

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
and second thought there is a change in

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.390 
and second thought there is a change in
that<00:03:56.540> fifth<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.140> sixth<00:03:57.530> place<00:03:57.770> battle<00:03:58.280> it

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
that fifth and sixth place battle it

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.250 
that fifth and sixth place battle it
still<00:03:58.640> irako<00:03:58.970> fit<00:03:59.450> with<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.780> sixth<00:04:00.080> place

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
still irako fit with the sixth place

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.309 
still irako fit with the sixth place
