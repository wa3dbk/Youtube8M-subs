00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.710 
and the Patriots in the Super Bowl and I
think<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.099> Patriots<00:02:47.730> are<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.390> win<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.629> I

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
think the Patriots are going to win it I

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.940 
think the Patriots are going to win it I
think<00:02:48.959> Tom<00:02:49.110> Brady's<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.829> that

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
think Tom Brady's going to get to that

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.479 
think Tom Brady's going to get to that
number<00:02:50.299> four<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.870> Super<00:02:52.230> Bowl<00:02:52.489> wins

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
number four is it for Super Bowl wins

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.080 
number four is it for Super Bowl wins
and<00:02:53.849> number<00:02:54.150> six<00:02:54.470> appearances<00:02:56.090> grammatically

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and number six appearances grammatically

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.880 
and number six appearances grammatically
I<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:57.299> make<00:02:57.420> sense<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:58.109> six<00:02:58.379> it's<00:02:58.650> gonna<00:02:58.739> be

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
I don't make sense so six it's gonna be

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.500 
I don't make sense so six it's gonna be
a<00:02:58.920> sixth<00:02:59.310> appearance<00:02:59.609> in<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.269> Super<00:03:00.480> Bowl

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
a sixth appearance in the Super Bowl

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.380 
a sixth appearance in the Super Bowl
which<00:03:00.959> isn't<00:03:01.260> an<00:03:02.010> amazing<00:03:02.700> number<00:03:02.849> because<00:03:03.209> no

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
which isn't an amazing number because no

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.789 
which isn't an amazing number because no
one<00:03:03.510> has<00:03:03.629> ever<00:03:03.750> done<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.260> their<00:03:04.379> life<00:03:04.620> I

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799
