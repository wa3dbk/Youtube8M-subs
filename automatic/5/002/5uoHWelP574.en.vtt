welcome<00:00:00.329> back<00:00:00.450> Wolfpack<00:00:00.870> Burley's<00:00:01.319> here<00:00:01.500> and

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
welcome back Wolfpack Burley's here and

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.169 
welcome back Wolfpack Burley's here and
this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.829> how<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> use<00:00:02.100> loom<00:00:02.429> minions

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
this is how to use loom minions

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.210 
this is how to use loom minions
so<00:00:03.330> with<00:00:03.540> loom<00:00:03.750> minion<00:00:03.959> we<00:00:04.350> don't<00:00:04.680> have<00:00:04.950> the

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
so with loom minion we don't have the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.700 
so with loom minion we don't have the
greatest<00:00:05.520> base<00:00:05.819> stats<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.359> 91<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.259> going<00:00:07.649> to

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
greatest base stats that 91 is going to

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.290 
greatest base stats that 91 is going to
be<00:00:07.799> our<00:00:07.919> single<00:00:08.309> highest<00:00:08.490> base<00:00:08.760> stat<00:00:08.820> and

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
be our single highest base stat and

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.419 
be our single highest base stat and
that's<00:00:09.540> not<00:00:09.840> too<00:00:10.110> insane<00:00:10.410> also<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
that's not too insane also it is in the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.620 
that's not too insane also it is in the
speed<00:00:11.670> it's<00:00:11.849> not<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> really

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
speed it's not like we have a really

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.660 
speed it's not like we have a really
tricky<00:00:13.410> kind<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.860> defensive<00:00:14.280> setup<00:00:14.460> or

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
tricky kind of defensive setup or

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.670 
tricky kind of defensive setup or
anything<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:15.690> 86<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.379> these

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
anything that we have 86 on these

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.370 
anything that we have 86 on these
special<00:00:17.010> defense<00:00:17.220> 76<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> defense<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.720> 69

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
special defense 76 on the defense and 69

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950 
special defense 76 on the defense and 69
on<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.039> hit<00:00:20.189> points<00:00:20.460> which<00:00:20.580> means<00:00:20.820> we're<00:00:21.330> okay

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
on the hit points which means we're okay

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
on the hit points which means we're okay
if<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.350> fully<00:00:22.529> invest<00:00:22.949> into<00:00:23.100> tankiness<00:00:23.670> but

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
if we fully invest into tankiness but

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
if we fully invest into tankiness but
often<00:00:24.390> simply<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.779> only<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.019> 69<00:00:25.380> attack<00:00:25.800> and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
often simply we only have 69 attack and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.509 
often simply we only have 69 attack and
69<00:00:26.699> special<00:00:27.119> attack<00:00:27.330> okay<00:00:27.779> 69<00:00:28.650> anyway<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.490> we

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
69 special attack okay 69 anyway if we

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
69 special attack okay 69 anyway if we
go<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.300> look<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.750> its<00:00:30.929> typing<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.560> gonna

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
go and we look at its typing it's gonna

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.470 
go and we look at its typing it's gonna
be<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> pure<00:00:32.040> water<00:00:32.189> typing<00:00:32.640> which<00:00:33.000> actually

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
be a pure water typing which actually

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.630 
be a pure water typing which actually
works<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:33.989> well<00:00:34.710> pure<00:00:35.010> water<00:00:35.219> typing

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
works out really well pure water typing

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880 
works out really well pure water typing
being<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.149> strong<00:00:36.510> only<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.410> times

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
being very strong only a two times

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.200 
being very strong only a two times
weakness<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.340> grass<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:38.969> times

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
weakness to grass and a two times

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.049 
weakness to grass and a two times
weakness<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> electric<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.010> also<00:00:41.550> Lou

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
weakness to electric that is it also Lou

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
weakness to electric that is it also Lou
minion<00:00:42.390> does<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.020> these<00:00:43.140> storm<00:00:43.710> drain

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
minion does have these storm drain

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.139 
minion does have these storm drain
abilities<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.430> technically<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> water

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
abilities so technically a water

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
abilities so technically a water
immunity<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.320> playing<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.829> set<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
immunity if you are playing that set and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
immunity if you are playing that set and
then<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.550> also<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> lot<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> resistances

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
then we also have a lot of resistances

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.119 
then we also have a lot of resistances
so<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:49.800> consistent

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
so it's going to be a very consistent

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
so it's going to be a very consistent
typing<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:51.149> helping<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.600> stall<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
typing for helping out with stall and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.049 
typing for helping out with stall and
working<00:00:52.620> around<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> minion

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
working around that way so the minion

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
working around that way so the minion
can<00:00:54.390> pull<00:00:54.629> through<00:00:54.899> pretty<00:00:55.230> well<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.010> hopping

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
can pull through pretty well so hopping

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
can pull through pretty well so hopping
into<00:00:56.610> Pokemon<00:00:57.120> showdown<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> see

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
into Pokemon showdown we're going to see

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
into Pokemon showdown we're going to see
the<00:00:58.320> loom<00:00:58.500> minion<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.250> interesting

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the loom minion is an interesting

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389 
the loom minion is an interesting
Pokemon<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> use<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.620> jazz<00:01:02.039> tanky

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
Pokemon to use but it is as jazz tanky

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
Pokemon to use but it is as jazz tanky
as<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> Pachirisu<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.629> already<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
as a Pachirisu that we already know that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.219 
as a Pachirisu that we already know that
Pachirisu<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.129> proven<00:01:05.729> world<00:01:06.090> champion<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Pachirisu is a proven world champion it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.660 
Pachirisu is a proven world champion it
can<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.619> sorts<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.979> crazy<00:01:08.100> things<00:01:08.460> but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
can do all sorts of crazy things but

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
can do all sorts of crazy things but
only<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.119> 60<00:01:09.420> base<00:01:09.540> hit<00:01:09.750> points<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.200> 70<00:01:10.560> and

only have 60 base hit points and 70 and
90<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.130> defenses<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.330> compare<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
90 on defenses so when we compare that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.450 
90 on defenses so when we compare that
with<00:01:12.840> blue<00:01:13.020> mini<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> full<00:01:14.159> tank

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
investment we know we're going to be

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.210 
investment we know we're going to be
able<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> endure<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.320> hits<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.950> while<00:01:17.100> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
able to endure some hits and while it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
able to endure some hits and while it's
not<00:01:17.400> enough<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:17.790> fight<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.390> our<00:01:18.420> own<00:01:18.869> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
not enough to really fight on our own in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.990 
not enough to really fight on our own in
a<00:01:19.259> single<00:01:19.680> battle<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.640> lot<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
a single battle we do have a lot of

a single battle we do have a lot of
supportive<00:01:21.390> qualities<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> double<00:01:22.259> battle

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
supportive qualities in a double battle

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.200 
supportive qualities in a double battle
and<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.790> take<00:01:23.909> super

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and that means we know we can take super

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
and that means we know we can take super
effective<00:01:24.540> hits<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.020> take<00:01:25.170> some<00:01:25.619> decent

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
effective hits we can take some decent

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
effective hits we can take some decent
hits<00:01:26.220> overall<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.540> try

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
hits overall and we can just really try

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
hits overall and we can just really try
to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> great<00:01:28.259> support<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.430> I'm

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to be a great support so with that I'm

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
to be a great support so with that I'm
thinking<00:01:29.880> tailwind<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.869> mini<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.439> water

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
thinking tailwind we mini on for water

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
thinking tailwind we mini on for water
type<00:01:31.860> Pokemon<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.820> gets<00:01:32.970> tailwind

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
type Pokemon actually gets tailwind

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.609 
type Pokemon actually gets tailwind
which<00:01:33.720> means<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> throughout

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
which means you can go and throughout

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
which means you can go and throughout
the<00:01:34.799> tail<00:01:34.979> wing<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.340> start<00:01:35.970> playing<00:01:36.240> around

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the tail wing and start playing around

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.700 
the tail wing and start playing around
it<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> speed

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it like that that you get the speed

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
it like that that you get the speed
boost<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.369> double<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.670> 111<00:01:39.540> speed

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
boost so when we double that 111 speed

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.450 
boost so when we double that 111 speed
at<00:01:39.900> 1150<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.890> means<00:01:41.100> we're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
at 1150 it actually means we're going to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760 
at 1150 it actually means we're going to
be<00:01:41.520> faster<00:01:41.939> than<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> lot<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.750> Pokemon<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.619> then

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
be faster than a lot of Pokemon so then

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.200 
be faster than a lot of Pokemon so then
we<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.009> throw<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> charm<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
we just throw out the charm that it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
we just throw out the charm that it
lowers<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.689> targets<00:01:46.049> attack<00:01:46.259> by<00:01:46.409> two<00:01:46.470> which

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
lowers the targets attack by two which

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.350 
lowers the targets attack by two which
means<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> first<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.700> use<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
means the first time you use it it's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
means the first time you use it it's
going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> cut<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.930> targets<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.560> attack<00:01:50.070> in

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
going to cut your targets have attack in

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.130 
going to cut your targets have attack in
half<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.880> could<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.750> really

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
half and that could be just a really

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.539 
half and that could be just a really
great<00:01:52.350> thing<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.590> start<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
great thing to start up with or if you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.800 
great thing to start up with or if you
have<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> contrary<00:01:54.000> Pokemon<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.630> team<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
have a contrary Pokemon on your team you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
have a contrary Pokemon on your team you
charm<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> their<00:01:55.770> attack<00:01:56.070> doubles<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
charm them and their attack doubles and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.069 
charm them and their attack doubles and
now<00:01:56.909> they're<00:01:57.090> under<00:01:57.240> tailwind<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
now they're under tailwind so they get a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.330 
now they're under tailwind so they get a
lot<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> damage<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.710> could<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> nice

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
lot of damage that could be a nice

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
lot of damage that could be a nice
little<00:01:59.520> fun<00:01:59.729> thing<00:01:59.939> to<00:01:59.969> try<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.719> you

but<00:05:32.610> then<00:05:32.730> you're<00:05:32.850> protecting<00:05:33.240> or<00:05:33.419> they<00:05:33.540> just

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720

hit<00:05:33.810> themselves<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.410> confusion<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:34.950> take

hit themselves in the confusion and take
whirlpool<00:05:35.550> damage<00:05:35.880> I<00:05:36.060> think<00:05:36.270> it's<00:05:36.660> pretty

whirlpool damage I think it's pretty

the<00:05:42.660> mini<00:05:42.870> on<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.320> only<00:05:43.470> other<00:05:43.680> thing<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:43.950> was

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
the mini on the only other thing I was

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.290 
the mini on the only other thing I was
thinking<00:05:44.310> about<00:05:44.370> like<00:05:44.640> you<00:05:44.729> max<00:05:44.910> out<00:05:45.060> hit

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
thinking about like you max out hit

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.820 
thinking about like you max out hit
points<00:05:45.570> you<00:05:45.630> max<00:05:45.840> out<00:05:45.960> special<00:05:46.350> attack<00:05:46.620> and

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
points you max out special attack and

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.159 
points you max out special attack and
then<00:05:47.250> you<00:05:47.430> go<00:05:47.700> for<00:05:48.000> a<00:05:48.030> modest<00:05:48.479> nature<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.050> then

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
then you go for a modest nature and then

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.350 
then you go for a modest nature and then
you<00:05:49.260> run<00:05:49.470> something<00:05:49.800> like<00:05:50.010> ace<00:05:50.550> Alec<00:05:51.090> Barry

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
you run something like ace Alec Barry

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.969 
you run something like ace Alec Barry
sighs<00:05:51.900> Barry's<00:05:51.960> going<00:05:52.410> to<00:05:52.470> raise<00:05:52.590> your<00:05:52.710> speed

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
sighs Barry's going to raise your speed

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.350 
sighs Barry's going to raise your speed
when<00:05:53.160> you<00:05:53.220> drop<00:05:53.400> below<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.640> quarter<00:05:53.820> hit<00:05:54.060> points

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
when you drop below a quarter hit points

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.909 
when you drop below a quarter hit points
whether<00:05:54.780> this<00:05:54.930> level<00:05:55.229> of<00:05:55.320> tankiness<00:05:55.770> you

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
whether this level of tankiness you

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.860 
whether this level of tankiness you
might<00:05:56.130> survive<00:05:56.490> in<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:56.729> red<00:05:56.910> and<00:05:57.180> then<00:05:57.600> from

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
might survive in the red and then from

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.270 
might survive in the red and then from
there<00:05:58.050> you<00:05:58.140> just<00:05:58.169> kind<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.500> play<00:05:58.740> off<00:05:58.979> of

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
there you just kind of play off of

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.370 
there you just kind of play off of
really<00:05:59.700> storm<00:06:00.090> drain<00:06:00.390> switching<00:06:01.020> on<00:06:01.110> water

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
really storm drain switching on water

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.320 
really storm drain switching on water
type<00:06:01.590> move<00:06:01.830> get<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.460> special<00:06:02.729> attack<00:06:03.090> boost

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
type move get that special attack boost

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.730 
type move get that special attack boost
now<00:06:03.750> your<00:06:03.870> special<00:06:04.169> attack<00:06:04.350> is<00:06:04.500> gonna<00:06:04.620> be

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
now your special attack is gonna be

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.320 
now your special attack is gonna be
relatively<00:06:05.100> strong<00:06:05.520> with<00:06:05.729> the<00:06:05.820> salic<00:06:06.150> Barry

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
relatively strong with the salic Barry

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330 
relatively strong with the salic Barry
propping<00:06:06.750> after<00:06:07.410> they<00:06:07.560> try<00:06:07.770> to<00:06:07.830> damage<00:06:08.190> you

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
propping after they try to damage you

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.280 
propping after they try to damage you
you<00:06:08.490> know<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:08.669> just<00:06:08.970> go<00:06:09.120> for<00:06:09.360> offensive<00:06:10.110> moves

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
you know you just go for offensive moves

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.719 
you know you just go for offensive moves
you<00:06:10.410> get<00:06:10.560> moves<00:06:10.740> like<00:06:10.890> ice<00:06:11.130> beam<00:06:11.400> you<00:06:11.580> get

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
you get moves like ice beam you get

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.610 
you get moves like ice beam you get
moves<00:06:11.940> like<00:06:12.180> scald<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.900> then<00:06:13.229> you<00:06:13.350> can<00:06:13.500> just

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
moves like scald and then you can just

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.810 
moves like scald and then you can just
kind<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:13.860> play<00:06:13.979> around<00:06:14.130> those<00:06:14.370> moves<00:06:14.610> a<00:06:14.729> little

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
kind of play around those moves a little

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.940 
kind of play around those moves a little
better<00:06:15.090> so<00:06:15.720> that<00:06:15.990> was<00:06:16.320> really<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.680> only<00:06:16.830> other

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
better so that was really the only other

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.350 
better so that was really the only other
thing<00:06:17.280> I<00:06:17.400> was<00:06:17.460> thinking<00:06:17.729> about<00:06:17.790> for<00:06:18.030> Lew<00:06:18.180> mini

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
thing I was thinking about for Lew mini

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.180 
thing I was thinking about for Lew mini
on<00:06:18.540> I<00:06:18.690> don't<00:06:18.780> know<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.320> rest<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.710> its<00:06:19.830> coverage

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
on I don't know the rest of its coverage

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.520 
on I don't know the rest of its coverage
it<00:06:20.490> does<00:06:20.729> get<00:06:20.910> silver<00:06:21.300> wind<00:06:21.450> so<00:06:21.990> if<00:06:22.080> like<00:06:22.260> maybe

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
it does get silver wind so if like maybe

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.260 
it does get silver wind so if like maybe
you<00:06:22.650> use<00:06:22.800> that<00:06:22.979> one<00:06:23.280> turn<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.669> use<00:06:23.790> silver<00:06:24.000> wind

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
you use that one turn to use silver wind

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.180 
you use that one turn to use silver wind
and<00:06:24.540> silver<00:06:24.840> wind<00:06:25.020> is<00:06:25.169> interesting<00:06:25.710> because

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
and silver wind is interesting because

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.520 
and silver wind is interesting because
it<00:06:26.430> works<00:06:26.640> like<00:06:26.729> amna<00:06:27.180> swim<00:06:27.419> 10%<00:06:28.169> chance<00:06:28.320> to

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
it works like amna swim 10% chance to

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.380 
it works like amna swim 10% chance to
raise<00:06:28.650> all<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.919> your<00:06:29.040> stats<00:06:29.280> by<00:06:29.550> one<00:06:29.850> well<00:06:30.330> it

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
raise all of your stats by one well it

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.610 
raise all of your stats by one well it
is<00:06:30.510> low<00:06:30.720> odds<00:06:30.900> you're<00:06:31.260> going<00:06:31.470> to<00:06:31.530> be

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
is low odds you're going to be

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.500 
is low odds you're going to be
anticipating<00:06:32.190> just<00:06:32.220> taking<00:06:32.640> damage<00:06:32.850> so<00:06:33.419> it's

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
anticipating just taking damage so it's

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.270 
anticipating just taking damage so it's
like<00:06:33.599> okay<00:06:33.900> use<00:06:34.140> silver<00:06:34.470> wind<00:06:34.620> 10%

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
like okay use silver wind 10%

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.980 
like okay use silver wind 10%
is<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.580> really<00:06:36.150> good<00:06:36.330> stuff<00:06:36.600> happens

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
is that really good stuff happens
