00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.070 
struggle with finding upgrading
materials<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:45.880> found<00:04:46.180> two<00:04:46.420> great<00:04:46.840> ways<00:04:47.020> to

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
materials but I found two great ways to

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.690 
materials but I found two great ways to
get<00:04:47.350> plenty<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.830> them<00:04:48.010> which<00:04:48.370> you'll<00:04:48.580> need

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
get plenty of them which you'll need

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.000 
get plenty of them which you'll need
plenty<00:04:49.390> of<00:04:49.510> them<00:04:49.690> because<00:04:49.960> if<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:50.260> don't<00:04:50.530> you

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
plenty of them because if you don't you

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.710 
plenty of them because if you don't you
have<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.190> chance<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.580> your<00:04:51.700> item<00:04:51.940> be<00:04:52.090> destroyed

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
have a chance of your item be destroyed

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.290 
have a chance of your item be destroyed
in<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.050> process<00:04:53.550> which<00:04:54.550> has<00:04:54.700> happened<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.180> me

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
in the process which has happened to me

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.580 
in the process which has happened to me
too<00:04:55.540> many<00:04:55.780> times

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
too many times

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.500 
too many times
anyways<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.520> first<00:04:57.670> way<00:04:57.910> I'd<00:04:58.060> recommend

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
anyways the first way I'd recommend

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.880 
anyways the first way I'd recommend
getting<00:04:58.690> these<00:04:58.840> upgrading<00:04:59.260> materials<00:04:59.680> would

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
getting these upgrading materials would

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.440 
getting these upgrading materials would
be<00:04:59.920> by<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.190> deconstruction<00:05:01.000> of<00:05:01.060> quality

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
be by the deconstruction of quality

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.670 
be by the deconstruction of quality
items<00:05:01.750> which<00:05:01.930> are<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.170> items<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.500> have

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
by deconstructing these items you have

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.070 
by deconstructing these items you have
the<00:05:06.940> chance<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.270> getting<00:05:07.540> upgraded<00:05:07.990> materials

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
the chance of getting upgraded materials

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.720 
the chance of getting upgraded materials
