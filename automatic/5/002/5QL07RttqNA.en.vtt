playing Minecraft again because I'm

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.429 
playing Minecraft again because I'm
prepping<00:00:17.660> for<00:00:18.660> when<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> update<00:00:19.140> comes<00:00:19.320> out

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.960 
prepping for when the update comes out
so<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.619> already<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> world<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.490> I've<00:00:20.580> made<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
so I already have a world so I've made a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.250 
so I already have a world so I've made a
brand-new<00:00:21.330> world<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.810> I've<00:00:21.900> made<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
brand-new world and I've made it a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
brand-new world and I've made it a
little<00:00:22.380> Hut<00:00:22.590> enough<00:00:22.859> started<00:00:23.189> mining<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
little Hut enough started mining and I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.400 
little Hut enough started mining and I
was<00:00:24.240> recording<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.900> commentating

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
was recording and I was commentating

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.089 
was recording and I was commentating
stuff<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:26.490> uh<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:28.080> problem<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
stuff but uh the problem was that the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.730 
stuff but uh the problem was that the
recording<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.480> FPS<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.260> no<00:00:31.410> audio

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
recording was at one FPS with no audio

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.290 
recording was at one FPS with no audio
and<00:00:32.149> that<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.050> been<00:00:34.230> doing

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
and that is because I have been doing

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.430 
and that is because I have been doing
I've<00:00:36.300> been<00:00:36.360> building<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.809> really<00:00:37.170> really

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I've been building this really really

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.500 
I've been building this really really
really<00:00:37.620> long<00:00:37.890> highway<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.180> taking<00:00:39.420> me

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
really long highway and it's taking me

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.510 
really long highway and it's taking me
hours<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.989> far<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:41.190> pretty<00:00:41.370> impressive

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
hours so far and it's pretty impressive

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.340 
hours so far and it's pretty impressive
it's<00:00:41.820> looks<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.390> long<00:00:42.750> minecraft

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it's looks like a really long minecraft

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
it's looks like a really long minecraft
highway<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.829> goes<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.910> pretty<00:00:45.239> much

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
highway that goes like it's pretty much

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
highway that goes like it's pretty much
dead<00:00:45.629> straight<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.530> through<00:00:46.770> any

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
dead straight and it will go through any

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.920 
dead straight and it will go through any
obstacle<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.430> stands<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.700> its<00:00:47.789> way<00:00:47.879> which<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
obstacle that stands in its way which is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
obstacle that stands in its way which is
pretty<00:00:49.020> neat<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.710> looks<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.129> cool<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
pretty neat and it looks really cool the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.889 
pretty neat and it looks really cool the
problem<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.960> uh<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:53.329> had<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> record<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.750> 1

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
problem is that uh I had to record a 1

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.540 
problem is that uh I had to record a 1
FPS<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.350> no<00:00:55.440> audio<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:56.010> what's<00:00:56.430> going

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
FPS with no audio because what's going

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.740 
FPS with no audio because what's going
to<00:00:56.610> happen<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.180> done<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to happen is what I'm done I'm going to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.310 
to happen is what I'm done I'm going to
speed<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> footage<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.989> obviously<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
speed up the footage so and obviously I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
speed up the footage so and obviously I
don't<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.649> recording<00:01:02.070> extraneous<00:01:02.850> footage

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
don't to be recording extraneous footage

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
don't to be recording extraneous footage
so<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.629> recorded<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.229> frame<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> second<00:01:04.799> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so I just recorded one frame a second so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580 
so I just recorded one frame a second so
I<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.700> condense<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.390> minute<00:01:06.810> into<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.170> second

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
I can condense a minute into a second

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.450 
I can condense a minute into a second
and<00:01:07.799> an<00:01:07.920> hour<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.460> minute<00:01:08.700> etc<00:01:10.340> which<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and an hour into a minute etc which is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.690 
and an hour into a minute etc which is
really<00:01:11.640> useful<00:01:12.590> however<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.950> didn't<00:01:14.460> change

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

doing<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.560> rather<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.829> my<00:01:43.920> old<00:01:44.130> gameplay

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
doing is rather than in my old gameplay

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520 
doing is rather than in my old gameplay
where<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> sort<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.479> ventured<00:01:46.049> around<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.409> lot

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
where I sort of ventured around a lot

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.800 
where I sort of ventured around a lot
and<00:01:46.619> made<00:01:46.740> lots<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.189> basis<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.810> this

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and made lots of little basis in this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.969 
and made lots of little basis in this
one<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> try<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.320> concentrate

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
one I'm going to try and concentrate

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.120 
one I'm going to try and concentrate
more<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.490> having<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.880> spectacular<00:01:51.720> base<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
more and having one spectacular base and

more and having one spectacular base and
I<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.310> talking<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.490> how<00:01:53.759> when<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> watched

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
I was talking about how when I watched

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.030 
I was talking about how when I watched
axis<00:01:54.689> videos<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.610> was<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:57.299> awe<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.380> his<00:01:58.649> ability

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
axis videos I was in awe of his ability

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.709 
axis videos I was in awe of his ability
to<00:01:59.250> care<00:01:59.820> as<00:02:00.000> much<00:02:00.060> as<00:02:00.270> he<00:02:00.360> did<00:02:00.479> about<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
to care as much as he did about the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.600 
to care as much as he did about the
aesthetics<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> his<00:02:01.380> buildings<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:02.369> sort<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
aesthetics of his buildings that sort of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
aesthetics of his buildings that sort of
house<00:02:02.790> stuff<00:02:02.939> looks<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.390> things<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.780> I'm<00:02:04.140> going

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
house stuff looks of things so I'm going

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.630 
house stuff looks of things so I'm going
to<00:02:04.380> try<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.530> emulate<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.280> how<00:02:05.399> much<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
to try and emulate that and how much I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.730 
to try and emulate that and how much I
care<00:02:05.850> well

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
care well

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.900

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.250 
sort of the way I'm building stuff
rather<00:02:09.119> than<00:02:09.210> just<00:02:09.450> whether<00:02:09.900> or<00:02:09.990> not<00:02:10.170> i<00:02:10.229> am

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
rather than just whether or not i am

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.580 
rather than just whether or not i am
building<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:12.720> basically<00:02:12.960> 20

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
building it so that's basically 20

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
building it so that's basically 20
minutes<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.950> light<00:02:14.070> just<00:02:14.370> did<00:02:14.610> condensed<00:02:15.030> into

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
minutes of light just did condensed into

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.380 
minutes of light just did condensed into
one<00:02:15.600> minute<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:17.160> apologize<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.210> being

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.810 
quite brief but I just did it all and I
I<00:02:20.450> can't<00:02:21.450> be<00:02:21.600> asked<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.020> do<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.200> all<00:02:22.320> over<00:02:22.350> again

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
I can't be asked to do it all over again

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.810

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
now i spawned on that sand and my

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.380 
now i spawned on that sand and my
building<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:07.920> here<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.240> see<00:03:09.270> i

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
building is here and as you can see i

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.270 
building is here and as you can see i
built<00:03:09.600> outside<00:03:09.780> rather<00:03:10.260> than<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.040> wall<00:03:11.250> of

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
built outside rather than in the wall of

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.979 
built outside rather than in the wall of
the<00:03:11.489> mountain<00:03:11.850> like<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.150> usually<00:03:12.270> do<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.810> this

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
the mountain like I usually do so this

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.960 
the mountain like I usually do so this
is<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> slight<00:03:13.560> change<00:03:13.770> from<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.070> norm<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:14.880> I

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
is a slight change from the norm but I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.970 
is a slight change from the norm but I
feel<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.300> gives<00:03:15.480> me<00:03:15.570> more<00:03:15.600> room<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.110> expand<00:03:16.410> I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
feel it gives me more room to expand I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.979 
feel it gives me more room to expand I
will<00:03:17.430> spend<00:03:17.610> careful<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.970> replant<00:03:18.390> trees<00:03:18.510> that

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
will spend careful to replant trees that

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.510 
will spend careful to replant trees that
I<00:03:19.050> ever<00:03:19.170> started<00:03:19.770> planting<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.340> think

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
I ever started planting and I think

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.330 
I ever started planting and I think
that's<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> matchy<00:03:21.650> no<00:03:22.650> no<00:03:23.100> there's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that's one of the matchy no no there's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.570 
that's one of the matchy no no there's
one<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:25.470> let<00:03:25.830> me<00:03:25.860> skip<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> door<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.400> hill

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
one so let me skip the door this hill

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.490 
one so let me skip the door this hill
this<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.030> where<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.450> another<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:28.380> is

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
this is where is another one this is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.040 
this is where is another one this is
where<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.250> came<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.390> look<00:03:30.480> at<00:03:30.570> my<00:03:30.690> world<00:03:30.900> I

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
where I I came to look at my world I

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.320 
where I I came to look at my world I
think<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.350> Britni<00:03:31.700> lots<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.790> rolling<00:03:33.120> hills

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
think is Britni lots of rolling hills

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.690
