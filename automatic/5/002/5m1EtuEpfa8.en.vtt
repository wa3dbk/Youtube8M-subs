00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.270
 a new video workouts so in 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.670
 does it okay it's going to be more about the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.200
 shoulders so in fact it will be either for 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.680
 catch a weak point in the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
 shoulders 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.200
 so at the level of the thickness of your 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.040
 volume shoulders etc be in fact if 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.360
 you do not have the time to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 work because you do not have 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.770
 a lot of workouts by 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 week either because devoted some 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.650
 something that can be placed at the end 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.820
 a back workout for example or 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.620
 then de facto 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 so in fact the principle is enough 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.840
 simple there are three exercises brought together in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.360
 a single series so it's going to be mostly 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.370
 lateral elevations after 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.899
 elevations with the bent bust and a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.399
 developed at inter classical 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.350
 the goal is to keep the same weight 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.300
 that is to say to take a game of alter 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.950
 so start with the exercise the blow 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.160
 hard for me the hardest is the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.440
 lateral voters after spent on the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.910
 elevations actually the bust leaned a 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.369
 little easier to execute 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.960
 whatever we'll be already pre tired so that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.970
 would be a little harder but and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 after spent on developing it with 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.030
 dumbbells so there actually does develop it to 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.409
 why I put it in the end 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 yet it is an exercise to beat 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.229
 it's because in fact the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 this exercise usually in order to home 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.030
 me it burns me before the triceps and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.530
 then the shoulders that's why 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.939
 do I put it in the end because 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.729
 my shoulders are already well prepared 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.729
 so tired and that I do it I do it the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.200
 circuit I do it two three times this 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.539
 which allows it takes less than ten minutes 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 at the end of a workout it allows to 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.159
 well well congested or to make a 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 drill session for the shoulders and that's 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.369
 super helpful for people who are 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.729
 in weak lane he should celebrate his sister 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.729
 many 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.520
 1 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.520
 no 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.230
 long time 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.510
 we 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.120
 good
