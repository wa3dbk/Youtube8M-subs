00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.509
 here we see now how to repair 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.339
 the glove box 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.700
 I state that we are in the dark because I am 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.270
 I find garage there is little light on the bottom 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:27.190
 what you see are four sites with 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.070
 head torx 20 to drain the key 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.900
 you do not see these student screws 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.929
 because they are protected by a profile of 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.440
 plastic that will be enough to pull 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:42.519
 well away and so you have the four screws e 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.940
 disassemble then you also have the catch of 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.510
 little pig who goes up who is ad 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.159
 simply pull it together 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.059
 refit the shower sbito book 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.579
 you style easily this way here 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.260
 he once side ejects and 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.190
 unscrew the hatch four times 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 of anemia 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.860
 therefore the doorman once the yarn 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.790
 and assembled in die casting 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.590
 substance there are no screws that die cast 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.720
 so it's all a piece 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 will therefore need to slowly with a 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.340
 dargaud screwdriver starting from the side 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.340
 rear so that it does not ruin the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.710
 visible profile that slowly force 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.760
 up to remove all the points of 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.290
 contact that I tell you I am 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.780
 then die cast 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.450
 it's a delicate job but once 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.790
 done you save in some money 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.320
 mine was easily opened because 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.500
 already the second time it happens to me 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.400
 this problem had already been there 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.970
 basically glued 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.090
 this happens when 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.630
 closing that we play true that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.330
 you basically drop it see this 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.240
 violino this here is released fury of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.240
 open close pulls out raises the 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.820
 mechanism here is where we challenge ourselves 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.290
 raise the locking mechanism and lo 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.100
 closes more beautiful just put it back in 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.400
 place to press it properly and subsequently 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.870
 put a point of coma this is the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.820
 work that makes the mechanism once 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.560
 closed he engages the stands still 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.260
 when you go to fetch with the wing 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.890
 it gets better from the outside it releases and opens 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.080
 the tailgate is therefore basically 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.170
 a bullshit to damage if you can 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.700
 call because it's simply a bad guy 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.550
 assembly at the end as you see 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.310
 now seen tell you the points where 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.820
 I will have to put the glue 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.950
 used of the post it used in the 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.730
 bostik that I put on one of the faces 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.230
 it's not a bit 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.450
 commander who demonstrates the commissioning 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.170
 a bit abundant way to make that 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 I didn't wait for it to dry 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.580
 the putty I simply put on 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.140
 the other piece and I let it be 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.690
 dry with the piece to use in contact 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.670
 try to put it much better than how 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.030
 I'm putting you why you I step 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.280
 calmly, however, be careful 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.610
 this is the front that has 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.390
 view put them sufficiently so 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.900
 that when you put the other side in there 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.090
 both the contact between better parts and the 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.090
 glue goes well to stick 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.379
 this is what you told me put 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.500
 also a bit of putty on there 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.200
 violin so that it becomes a little more 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.150
 it was difficult that I had already taken off 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.579
 done with work there the first time but it is 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.040
 unfortunately open close if you have slipped off 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.860
 another time, as you can see, there is a hole 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.010
 central in the inner part of the course 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.500
 so be careful when you open that 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.760
 that oven would be here 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.220
 before reassembling those who have passed less than 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.020
 a minute now that I've done 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.490
 match the two parts 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.250
 so before going to reassemble the 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.260
 do all this test here 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.990
 act directly on the closures that 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.419
 they must stay attached when there 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.550
 left here so rica rite mind 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.410
 it would be hooked to the retainers on the frame 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.840
 of the car go to press from 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.139
 back the shirt to do it 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.449
 shoot if you do this job can say 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.110
 that the repair operation has gone 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.449
 successful 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.910
 now just wait for the 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.139
 material dries and respectable 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.229
 I reassembled everything I hope it was 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.669
 useful when I turned 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.639
 one workshop had looked for him 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.800
 therefore not appropriate for the repair 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.460
 evaluate you lot by lot you can 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.460
 repair
