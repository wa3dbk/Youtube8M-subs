00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.230
 matches this season 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.660
 Excelsior Saturday in Rotterdam 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.550
 that with his team the button is gone so that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
 the season worthy of the champion 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.320
 can be closed 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.939
 yes i think thing from thursday we are 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.439
 nevertheless focused on the game 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.440
 Saturday is a few days then yes it should 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.500
 the space to party and the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 discharge is now large and understandable 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.649
 also a lot of players that first 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.500
 championship 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.879
 they should be able to fully enjoy it 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 Thursday we started training again and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.530
 we are going to prepare ourselves to be now 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.910
 it there excelsior in that yes that there 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.710
 perhaps done like that so that every 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.620
 also have taken another match 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.120
 that 's just about another on it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.699
 game for them 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.160
 that might also be nice for you 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.369
 but you also prestige status after 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.110
 absolutely that is also important to me 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.680
 the status the appearance 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.180
 There are players who are in the many success 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.790
 able to get 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 that must also support steam and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.890
 do everything about it so yes there is still enough 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.000
 to play for then you have it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.290
 about an objective other than 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 becoming a champion must be 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.380
 goals 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.580
 so we're going to try to get that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.470
 accomplish with all 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.790
 that is also a record number of points 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.350
 something like that in mind 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.540
 might still play along 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 after that is also a possibility and we 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.579
 are going to try to get to the games 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.220
 to win 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.409
 play there or enter the many 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.820
 prices as few counter goals as possible 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.840
 warrior it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.390
 yes that is something the group is also joining 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.790
 is busy and yes it is a button only 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.220
 must of course be around you can 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.560
 easy to say ok we are going now 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.689
 train may play but there will be 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.430
 what the players demand is the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.369
 training today was here again 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.350
 sharp think that we are ready to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.840
 up a good performance 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.329
 put 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.640
 how do you how do you do it with it 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.459
 someone on the back right for example 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.650
 now buttocks have just dropped out 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.129
 comes there tamata may I be so free 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.459
 to fill in 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:18.310
 well you can fill it in how you like it 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.610
 we'll see how that goes on Saturday 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.080
 are going to solve and yes that is one of them 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.400
 choice and the position we have to go 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.750
 to fill in 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.519
 because I suck you with the keepers too ' 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.930
 talking something is going to happen there 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.930
 then that is also possible 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.269
 leendert also sit on or something 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.110
 also to keep everyone involved make you 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.060
 want 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.400
 First, we want to achieve that knew 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.049
 I it the starting point 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.730
 on the other hand, it is also one 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.610
 championship of the entire team 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.530
 and that was not achieved by boys 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.810
 who have made the most minutes or 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.220
 the mistress has that that has it 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.319
 everyone done need more here 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.690
 Well had it may well be that 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.760
 there is a choice that falls on someone else 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.120
 And I certainly would not think so 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.040
 counting team saw one knock over only one 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.650
 choice is best of time on someone else 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.840
 fall and give you all along sure 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.639
 those last three games to play 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.560
 enjoy in a good way 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.819
 afterwards i think it is important that we us 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.380
 game what they tell how played 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.650
 have in those games will also leave 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.639
 see 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.359
 and then without the pressure and yes the race 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.260
 to the title 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.690
 Good thing that is in itself I think 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.799
 whole art and the group should be fine there 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.930
 to handle 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.370
 that we will sit you look excelsior 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.810
 How come 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.510
 how we do that and then it comes to enjoy 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.950
 of course yes that achieves results 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.090
 and when your fat cells wind and you enjoy 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.079
 always more 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.079
 that must be the objective
