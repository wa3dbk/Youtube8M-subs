00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
ok let's create a new file and these can

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.349 
ok let's create a new file and these can
work<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.809> everything<00:01:01.609> every<00:01:02.609> single<00:01:02.879> thing

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that you have so I'm going to use a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.649

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
plane just to show you the Tron grip

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.969 
plane just to show you the Tron grip
gonna<00:01:10.590> make<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> camera<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.610> looks<00:01:11.760> nice

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
gonna make a camera so it looks nice

gonna make a camera so it looks nice
excuse<00:01:13.979> me<00:01:21.020> ok<00:01:22.020> maybe<00:01:22.229> we're<00:01:22.500> gonna<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
excuse me ok maybe we're gonna put the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.460 
excuse me ok maybe we're gonna put the
camera<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.520> little<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> looks<00:01:25.140> like

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
camera a little bit up so it looks like

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.600 
camera a little bit up so it looks like
that<00:01:25.650> looks<00:01:26.280> really<00:01:26.640> nice<00:01:28.220> make<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> plane

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that looks really nice make the plane

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
that looks really nice make the plane
bigger<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:32.009> make<00:01:32.189> sure<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.820> plane<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
bigger and make sure the plane is the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.310 
bigger and make sure the plane is the
same<00:01:35.189> size<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.270> same<00:01:36.420> width<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> same

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
same size the same width and the same

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.880 
same size the same width and the same
height<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.180> change<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.810> width<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.399 

2,000<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.170> 2,000<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
2,000 you have to be 2,000 for the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.520 
2,000 you have to be 2,000 for the
height<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.180> segments<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> same

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
height so that segments are the same

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
height so that segments are the same
they<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.659> look<00:01:51.840> square<00:01:53.570> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
they look like that they look square so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.410 
they look like that they look square so
I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:56.250> good<00:01:56.520> let's<00:01:57.149> see

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
I think I think that's good let's see
the<00:01:57.570> camera<00:01:57.780> oh<00:01:58.140> yeah<00:02:00.770> I'm<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.579> this

let's<00:02:08.050> go<00:02:08.230> to<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.500> rendering<00:02:08.860> settings<00:02:09.220> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
let's go to the rendering settings you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.070 
let's go to the rendering settings you
I'm<00:02:11.860> gonna<00:02:12.070> change<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.730> output<00:02:13.240> so<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.900> looks

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
I'm gonna change the output so it looks

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.760 
I'm gonna change the output so it looks
a<00:02:14.320> little<00:02:14.380> bit<00:02:14.620> better<00:02:15.960> leave<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.140> at<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.500> same
