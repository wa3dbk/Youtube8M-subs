00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.600
 if r and in this video you will learn about 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.209
 game cities skylines like you for sure 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.709
 know if you are interested 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.220
 urban simulators then in 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.430
 This genre is a trendsetter is 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.610
 simcity 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.070
 yes there are other lines of simulators but 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.700
 the most popular is the ruler 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.610
 simcity 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.000
 simcity 2000 appeared in the early 90s 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.780
 years and became the ancestor of the genre 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.480
 town planning simulators 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.120
 Since then, much time has passed and the series 7 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.410
 10 evolved other games appeared 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.590
 of a similar genre 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 Well, today we are talking about another 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.680
 beginner who is trying to press 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.440
 famous and not very famous cities 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.510
 building simulators in this genre 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.660
 there are not so many new products yes 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.260
 was recently fig cities xxl 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.469
 but the desire to sell the fall is exactly the mouth 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.170
 not even an addon like new game and cut down 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.689
 for easy money cost much 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.299
 developer companies yes how old are you 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.950
 money they earned but so low 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.590
 ratings for the game 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.409
 decent like a game I have not seen 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.149
 so then the company is surely more in 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.069
 town planning simulator and not climb 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.770
 will be because buying more from her 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.509
 no one will be ok 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.270
 get in full 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.029
 of cities skylines waiting for us a lot 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.829
 pleasant hours but not really 

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:35.349
 very much let's rabanut right away 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.299
 truth-womb game fast enough 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.429
 bored is naive and important 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.359
 the problem is of course also minor bugs 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:46.029
 but it's not so scary, but the fact that Challenge 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.439
 no Challenges literally 15 20 

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:49.119
 hours you already get bored with me 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.340
 play is a fact 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.829
 Of course the game has support 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.140
 modifications steam but mostly there 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.780
 Now modifications to change the external 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.630
 buildings and they actually playability 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.430
 do not really add up quickly and 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.380
 having built in one city all that you 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.130
 wanted you to be not so interesting 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.709
 playing this game again it turns out that 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.750
 at the time of release this game is exactly 1 1 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.080
 but how fast or short 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.670
 depends on you i'm slowly developing and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.120
 calmly build 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.489
 what i like so i have 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.840
 my small town has both the metro and 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.060
 trips and much more there of course 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.930
 what and boast in terms of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.540
 energy efficiency of the environment and 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.970
 so on in general features by 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.880
 building things really a lot 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.580
 but there are things that are a little bit zadolbal 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.500
 for example a huge number of bus 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.720
 routes which have to do and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.000
 the larger your city the greater the number 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.250
 routes you need to do near me 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 hundreds of routes here on this small 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.079
 a town that hardly takes one 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.870
 square to the word about squares earth why 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.670
 it is very cheap even late 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.730
 developmental stage when i have 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 accumulated 3 million local money 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.100
 land costs only 15 thousand 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.340
 again local money is soft 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.570
 speaking very cheaply and in the end it turns out 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.799
 that there is no stimulating development and 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.140
 efficient use of land we 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.440
 just buy the adjacent squares and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.480
 everything in my opinion is important here 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.360
 rework mechanics specifically related 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.670
 with land value and development game 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.370
 built on the unity engine and at first 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.709
 To be honest, I even doubted 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.150
 can this engine pull out a decent 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.840
 town planning simulator 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.540
 turned out to be quite possible but there is of course 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.030
 same limitations so the graphics which we 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.470
 saw in the videos she is a little bit 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.660
 unreal because despite 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.709
 maximum graphics settings that 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.290
 exhibited in the game 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.109
 get such a beautiful picture by 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.790
 clarity I did not get it strange 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.730
 Little 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.180
 and of course a little sad there 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.550
 some claims and to the logic of development 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.500
 availability of transport systems see 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.200
 subway in a small town in which not 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.370
 accumulated even 50 thousand people well 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.290
 to put it mildly strange in the game is implemented 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.160
 interesting mechanics zoned and where 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.920
 we can assign 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.500
 separate policies for each district and 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.150
 we can also manage policies 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.070
 everywhere for all the forge is very 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.470
 interesting mechanics earlier such mechanics 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.480
 As far as I know where I have not met as 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.930
 much i'm exactly such a mechanic nowhere 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.270
 saw a general summing up the game turned out 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.040
 interesting but there are some 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.560
 flaws that we hope 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.580
 will be fixed in subsequent patches 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:55.270
 in the meantime, the main claim to some 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.100
 not docking in the mechanics of the game which 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.830
 leads to visual 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.810
 gods for example when one ship 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.560
 passes through another ship or 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.680
 generally produces a turn on the shore and 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.050
 then calmly swims away into the sea there and 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.240
 Other some problems, but I hope everything 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.510
 they will be fixed well and the most important 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.280
 the problem is replayability right here 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.040
 developers need to think something and 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.870
 release a patch that will increase 3 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.540
 the playability of the game then there are some 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.950
 Challenges will add options there I do not know 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.870
 there may be some natural disaster 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.080
 is there something else 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.940
 it will increase replayability therefore in 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.610
 average game in my opinion decent 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.040
 scores seven and a half points out of 10 then 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.860
 There is a good game you can take but for now 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.350
 Nak again I say does not delay for a long time 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.940
 Like it all subscribe 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.160
 on my channel participate in our 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.950
 events and good luck on the fields 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.370
 battles wherever they occur while 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.370
 until
