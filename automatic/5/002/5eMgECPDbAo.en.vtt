00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960
hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.930
Today I am going to make another dish of course

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.619
Butter Chicken, Chicken Makhani whatever you call it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.820
but the speciality is i'm going to use
the gravy that is pressure-cooked makhani

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.449
gravy

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.450
I'm telling you once you make this kind
of gravy and serve or cook anything

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.680
forget about butter chicken you cook even
vegetables anything in this makhani gravy

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250
I'm telling you that will be the best makhani you have ever eaten

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.820
Dear friends first we have to learn how
to make this makhani gravy in a pressure

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.450
cooker

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.230
you know the advantages of cooking
anything in a pressure cooker is all the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
best flavors are extracted out and your
gravy will become fantastic

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.770
first I'm going to add some butter
cardamom cloves cinnamon and bay leaf

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.110
so I put everything in a muslin cloth
and then just put it in this butter add

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.840
onion to add some sweetness

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.990
to the sour tomatoes we're going to add
some cashew nuts

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
we're going to saute this onions till they are slightly transparent

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810
In this add salt add ginger-garlic paste we're going to saute this ginger garlic paste

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
for one-minute lot of red chilli and
little bit of green chili

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.540
in fact I prefer to add Kashmiri red chilies 
that will give a very nice red color

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.740
to your gravy

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.479
just add tomatoes there is so much
moisture in this tomatoes and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.759
onions that you don't need to add any
water

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.899
just put up lid off for this pressure
cooker

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.530
we're going to cook this for about 15
minutes

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.390
now you know after cooking this for
around 15 to 20 minutes

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.320
that is almost 5 - 6 whistles of a pressure
cooker

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.680
you know there's no point putting
everything in a blender

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.880
so first we're going to extract all the
liquid that is coming from this and only

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.960
the solids

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.399
we're going to put in a blender and just
make it to a puree. After straining all these

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.120
blended paste all you are left with with
the seeds

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.709
and the skin of the tomatoes you know
just add one or two teaspoons of

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.599
sugar in this much gravy

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.120
the real good flavor for your makhani comes by adding kasuri methi you can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.530
pretty much add anything, any vegetables
into this and they will taste fantastic

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.299
this is a basic you know nice makhani
gravy

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.170
but this is not truly a makhani gravy
and until unless you add cream and butter

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.510
now the gravy is all ready so let's go
ahead and cook the chicken and add

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.609
our makhani gravy so for this i'm going to
take the chicken  you know i have

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.019
taken the chicken breast

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.459
this chicken breast is nice and tender
look at how very thin slices I've cut

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.849
this chicken into and in this add some
salt, pinch of garam masala powder, do

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.739
not have too much very little to give a
nice flavor and some all-purpose flour

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.069
just pinch look at this just the way i
added salt

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.659
I'm adding some of the all-purpose flour, in this add just half a teaspoon of curd

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.190
that is yogurt

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.430
this is optional and then just mix all
of this with this chicken nicely

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.349
that's good and it is better if you can
marinate this in keep it for one or two

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.599
hours but since my chicken has already
brianed that means the chicken is nice and

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.290
tender

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.269
I'm going to cook it right away. In the
pan take some butter and we're going to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.010
first cook the chicken pieces take this
chicken pieces and just be going to cook

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.609
this chicken pieces after cooking the
chicken until the chicken is nice and

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.230
tender add the makhani gravy isn't it
very easy

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.250
Wow and just mix this and we're going
to put the lid on because they want this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.829
nice flavors to go into the chicken

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.510
look at this the gravy is all fantastic
the chicken is nice and tender just

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.680
reduce the flame and then we're going to
add some cream into this just one

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.519
tablespoon of cream into this and just
mix all of this

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.570
bring this to one boil and then switch
off the flame

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.530
look at this perfect color and amazing

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.930
The aroma hmm very surprisingly when the month of Ramadan starts

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.240
whatever I cook whatever I touch that
comes out super and super tasty

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.970
