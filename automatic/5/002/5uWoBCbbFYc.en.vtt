screen tablecloth but I don't know if

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.830 
screen tablecloth but I don't know if
it's<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.880> best<00:01:42.270> idea

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it's was the best idea

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's was the best idea
things<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.409> getting<00:01:43.619> stuck<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:45.020> but<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
things are getting stuck on it but you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
things are getting stuck on it but you
can<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> rear<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> actually<00:01:47.280> move<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.410 
can see the rear is actually move on the
tractor<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.630> pretty<00:01:48.930> neat<00:01:50.149> then<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.270> have

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
tractor so it's pretty neat then we have

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.100 
tractor so it's pretty neat then we have
fences<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.649> hold<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> different<00:01:53.490> livestock
