now when the Bible talks about death

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.699 
now when the Bible talks about death
it's<00:02:23.849> not<00:02:24.090> merely<00:02:24.599> talking<00:02:24.989> about<00:02:25.379> physical

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709

also talking about spiritual death
physical<00:02:31.470> death<00:02:31.680> involves<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> separation

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
physical death involves the separation

of life from the body spiritual death

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.240 
of life from the body spiritual death
involves<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> separation<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.130> life<00:02:38.790> from<00:02:39.480> God

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
involves the separation of life from God
