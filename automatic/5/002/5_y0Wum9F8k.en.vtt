yeah but going to put a new condenser on

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.860 
yeah but going to put a new condenser on
n<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.739> new<00:02:11.920> coil<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:13.360> should<00:02:13.540> fix<00:02:13.720> it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
n a new coil and that should fix it

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.040 
n a new coil and that should fix it
hopefully<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:18.220> Matthew<00:02:18.700> today<00:02:19.090> yes<00:02:19.690> put<00:02:20.019> a

hopefully for Matthew today yes put a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.690 
hopefully for Matthew today yes put a
new<00:02:20.200> coil<00:02:20.440> alone<00:02:20.709> since<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> regional<00:02:21.550> one

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
new coil alone since the regional one

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.570 
new coil alone since the regional one
for<00:02:21.940> nineteen<00:02:22.150> eighty<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:24.040> another<00:02:24.310> new

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
we're just went to go for a test drive

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.990 
we're just went to go for a test drive
in<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.740> unless<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.490> steering<00:02:47.880> wheel

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
in this and unless the steering wheel

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
sitting here for the car to go straight

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.370 
sitting here for the car to go straight
it<00:02:50.730> wasn't<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.240> last<00:02:51.660> time<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:51.990> had<00:02:52.230> this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
it wasn't like that last time I had this

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.160 
it wasn't like that last time I had this
two<00:02:52.620> weeks<00:02:52.830> ago<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.630> either<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:54.990> hit

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170

the tow truck did something to it
pulling<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.790> onto<00:03:03.210> it<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.890> looked<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
pulling it onto it I just looked at the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.890 
pulling it onto it I just looked at the
front<00:03:05.430> wheels<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.910> not<00:03:06.090> both<00:03:06.330> pointing<00:03:06.810> in

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
front wheels and not both pointing in
