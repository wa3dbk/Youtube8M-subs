00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 I love all kilo vom kieler 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.970
 Lamar and gets to pimp my face her 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.670
 on park road and lock but I have 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.420
 always felt red lips like that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.519
 today as well 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.230
 and I wanted you my five today 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.790
 tips show for the perfect red 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.790
 Lips that also last a lot of fun 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.680
 as a first step I ready mine 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.570
 lips of course before 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.279
 For that I take my toothbrush first 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.630
 and piercing your lips a bit like that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.070
 toothbrush I do a little something 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.689
 and carefully go over the lip 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.830
 about it, of course you should not now 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 copy 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 Of course that irritates the lip 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.829
 in addition, however, by slight circling 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.379
 movement or slight shapes back 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.180
 Movements with the toothbrush become like that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.129
 dead skin from the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 lip away because they really bother 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 this picture of lipstick on the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.559
 lips does not matter if it 's red or one 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.780
 other color never really looks like that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.620
 nice if he still so skin on 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.600
 the lip hang 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.649
 and if you go with it is natural 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.300
 you can do all sorts of other things 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.859
 make my method is peelings 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.510
 just that with the toothbrush because of it 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.280
 goes super fast and easy too 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.199
 not much costs such a toothbrush and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.090
 then next I go with one 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.830
 lip care stick over the lips and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
 let him act well not used 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.100
 always from world peace because he is for 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 me is best of all 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.490
 care effect but there you can 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.020
 Of course, take what you have given 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.640
 The lip care really takes time to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.200
 work and to move in I do that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 usually so before I make-up 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.759
 I give my cash in and out 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.439
 same train also the lip care stick 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.610
 lassalles and if I interact 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.960
 Completely made up if I have 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.970
 Then I start with the lipstick 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.860
 because then she is really right 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.259
 Well fed and the lips are 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.280
 really not dry anymore 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.930
 after that it almost goes to the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 Lipstick I'll start now 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 to edge with lipliner my lips 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.079
 and to paint them completely because 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.930
 i have the feeling if you are a little bit 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.939
 Miss pin is off and still the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.220
 lipliner complete that lip 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.110
 primed that is not quite so 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.360
 noticeable if the lipstick on some 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.219
 not quite as accurate 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.290
 then I'm already wearing the lipstick 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.969
 and after I've applied that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 always wear only a thin layer 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.240
 and then do it at a tempo 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.280
 Handkerchief with the cosmetics or one 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.380
 piece of toilet paper does not matter what you do 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.700
 just now I hope that careful 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.260
 off and go again a layer 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.290
 because I feel it through 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.569
 This steyn through this through 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.250
 This lipstick imprint keeps it 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.730
 just so good by being thin 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.319
 used and layered layers 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.360
 personally better for me than when 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.580
 I have such a grease coat lipstick 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.050
 give it to me and that he just me 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.489
 always a bit cautious yet 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.010
 let's do it and give it a little bit more 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.750
 I prefer pen over red 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.980
 Lipstick Matte Lipsticks Because Me 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.870
 the cool if they just do not slip 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.519
 so completely in the face of them hold 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.530
 much better if we then still times 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.430
 after that, the people are really big 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.430
 she should be 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.780
 then such a glossy lips dane 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.310
 Just give them that because I like that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.799
 feel then it keeps it better again 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.450
 because then, first of all, this dearest one 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.890
 So that's how a lipgloss you can 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.239
 take whatever you want 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.680
 for example, there is manhattan 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.450
 There are also such lip varnishes that have 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.280
 I on my channel in my favorites 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.810
 video mentioned because the easy 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.549
 wonderful are you looking at each other 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.319
 fall to one of manhattan, there is one 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.610
 plug in that you can give over there 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.130
 I feel the lips go 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.660
 stop first then then sometime 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.190
 Maybe the lipstick goes off and on 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.930
 after that he still had this 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.130
 lipliner underneath can actually be there 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.010
 really nothing happens when you do that 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.200
 so stratified and that if you have one 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.970
 you want to have a glassy lip 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 as far as durability is concerned 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.560
 each case better than if you just 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.910
 just take sun glossy lipstick because 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.590
 they really do stop most of the time 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.390
 slip a bit and when the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.310
 durability are not quite as good as 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.930
 math lipsticks now you could 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.700
 think you're done with that 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.859
 piece with the lipstick that's right 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.750
 but then I give around the lips 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.269
 Kontor to such a transparent 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.829
 Contour pencil mine is now from 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.500
 The ones I use but give 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.000
 also from bijou generally post duel because 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 I do a lot of high end stuff 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.900
 I use post for each one for you 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.389
 every high end product I use 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.880
 I'll post you in the infobox one more 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.590
 cheap tube from the drugstore with it 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.760
 you somehow still have such comparisons 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.049
 what you could use 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.299
 because they just do not have that much money 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.690
 want to spend between cook on each 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.190
 fall into the infobox if you are now 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.540
 I can not afford that 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.390
 I would not afford in the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.890
 infobox finds the alternatives or her 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.900
 Just take a little concealer 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.549
 and there is the lip contour that likes 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.049
 Personally, I like it too sometimes 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.660
 I just do both though 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.400
 Doubled is easy because of the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.380
 Concealer still we have the advantage 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.480
 that the lips account sharper again 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.460
 and the lips so the red still 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.920
 to be properly stressed and easy 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.390
 somehow more accurate and more beautiful 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.370
 look and that's why I do 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.750
 actually mostly both because it can 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.880
 yes, the main thing is not the lips 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.890
 case lipstick does not go or 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.780
 See legacy lips because they are sometimes 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.330
 so a little bit susceptible to that 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.560
 from the account but that will run out 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.420
 actually kept in check then 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.090
 really through concealer or this one 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.640
 Konturenstift and that 's it 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.130
 you get your perfect red 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.930
 lipstick occurs costs me up 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.910
 every case my pictures or post us 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.470
 of magnolia x pictures of yours 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.850
 perfect red lips 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.400
 that would really be happy even 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.080
 either a little break, but 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.120
 instagram or at twitter and linked 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.040
 just once only Janitz and Kerala mara 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.870
 then I definitely want to see that 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.700
 I say that was already here with me 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.870
 Parkstraße resolutely lays down again 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.180
 when a channel over if it is you 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.470
 liked and looks down here 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.210
 again in the infobox 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.580
 there are other videos from 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.900
 other magnolia, marius are having fun 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.900
 and see you next time
