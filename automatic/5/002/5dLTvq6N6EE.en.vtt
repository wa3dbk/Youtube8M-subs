we<00:00:34.710> need<00:00:34.769> to<00:00:34.890> ensure<00:00:35.039> that<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:35.429> select

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
we need to ensure that we select

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.079 
we need to ensure that we select

synchronous part template in addition to

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.389 
synchronous part template in addition to
this<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.379> also<00:00:40.500> include<00:00:40.859> the<00:00:41.070> 2d

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
this because we can also include the 2d

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.579 
this because we can also include the 2d
dimensions<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> synchronous<00:00:42.570> model<00:00:42.870> will

then we'll pick the right hand view then

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.470 
then we'll pick the right hand view then
we'll<00:00:50.170> pick<00:00:50.380> new<00:00:50.710> view<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.450> identify<00:00:52.450> the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.550 

we'll<00:01:14.270> start<00:01:14.510> by<00:01:14.660> hiding<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.140> coordinate

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
we'll start by hiding the coordinate

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.850 
we'll start by hiding the coordinate
system

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.460 

and<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:18.940> can<00:01:19.090> grab<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.510> appropriate<00:01:20.050> regions

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
and we can grab the appropriate regions

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.980 
and we can grab the appropriate regions
and<00:01:20.710> extrude<00:01:21.640> up<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.030> key<00:01:22.210> points<00:01:22.630> on<00:01:22.780> the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
we can now use the PMI dimensions to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.730 
we can now use the PMI dimensions to
