to show you guys my process so I start

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
to show you guys my process so I start
by<00:00:19.650> putting<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.279> heat<00:00:20.520> protectant<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.480> over<00:00:22.170> my

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
by putting a heat protectant all over my

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.660 
by putting a heat protectant all over my
twists<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:25.140> minimize<00:00:25.680> any<00:00:26.400> type

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
twists so that I can minimize any type

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.269 
twists so that I can minimize any type
of<00:00:26.699> damage<00:00:26.970> from<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> heat<00:00:27.779> from<00:00:28.590> using<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of damage from the heat from using a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.780 
of damage from the heat from using a
blow<00:00:29.730> dryer<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:31.140> flat<00:00:31.650> iron<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:32.610> just

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
blow dryer and a flat iron so I'm just

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.680 
and medium heat which is pretty much
cool<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.390> particular<00:00:51.960> blow-dryer<00:00:52.500> I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
twist so that I can detangle and kind of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.560 
twist so that I can detangle and kind of

well<00:01:50.190> as<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.370> can<00:01:51.550> see<00:01:51.730> since<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.270> decided<00:01:52.570> to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
well as you can see since I decided to

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.370 
well as you can see since I decided to
use<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.970> low<00:01:54.970> heat<00:01:55.210> setting<00:01:55.420> which<00:01:55.930> like<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.350> said

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
use a low heat setting which like I said

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.190 
use a low heat setting which like I said
it<00:01:56.620> was<00:01:56.710> pretty<00:01:56.980> cool<00:01:57.220> for<00:01:57.520> my<00:01:57.640> blow<00:01:57.850> dryer

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it was pretty cool for my blow dryer

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.040 
it was pretty cool for my blow dryer
this<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.380> how<00:01:59.530> my<00:01:59.680> hair<00:01:59.860> came<00:02:00.070> out<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.970> think<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
this is how my hair came out I think the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.960 
this is how my hair came out I think the
higher<00:02:02.290> heat<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.770> use<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.400> straighter<00:02:03.700> ur<00:02:03.820> to

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
higher heat you use the straighter ur to

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.970 
higher heat you use the straighter ur to
get<00:02:04.150> which<00:02:04.360> will<00:02:04.570> help<00:02:04.690> in<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.200> Flatiron

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
get which will help in the Flatiron

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.100 
get which will help in the Flatiron
process<00:02:06.520> but<00:02:06.760> again<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.240> was<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.600> nervous<00:02:07.780> about

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
process but again I was so nervous about

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.710 
process but again I was so nervous about
putting<00:02:08.470> heat<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.100> my<00:02:09.220> hair<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.240> this<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.570> my

needed<00:02:17.590> anything<00:02:18.420> better<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.810> was<00:02:20.050> not<00:02:20.260> going

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
needed anything better I was not going

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.330 
needed anything better I was not going
for<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> bone<00:02:21.700> straight<00:02:22.270> look<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
for a bone straight look so this is the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.910 
for a bone straight look so this is the
Flatiron<00:02:24.700> I'm<00:02:24.850> gonna<00:02:25.090> stick<00:02:25.510> with<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
Flatiron I'm gonna stick with so I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.420 
Flatiron I'm gonna stick with so I
decided<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.670> separate<00:02:28.260> my<00:02:29.260> fat<00:02:29.740> portion<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.280> my

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
decided to separate my fat portion of my

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.460 
decided to separate my fat portion of my
hair<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.150> section<00:02:31.510> I'm<00:02:31.810> gonna<00:02:32.020> start

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
hair this is the section I'm gonna start

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.270 
hair this is the section I'm gonna start
with<00:02:32.680> I'm<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> continue<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.660> use<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
with I'm going to continue to use the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.340 
with I'm going to continue to use the
comb<00:02:36.820> chase<00:02:37.090> method<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.960> Flatiron

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
comb chase method with the Flatiron

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.950 
comb chase method with the Flatiron
process<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.100> think<00:02:39.460> it's<00:02:39.670> more<00:02:40.030> effective<00:02:40.660> if

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
process I think it's more effective if

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.740 
process I think it's more effective if
you<00:02:41.200> do<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.500> process<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:43.120> rather<00:02:43.390> just

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
you do that process then rather just

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.440 
you do that process then rather just
flattening<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.560> on<00:02:44.770> its<00:02:44.980> own<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.970> here<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.270> can

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
flattening it on its own so here you can

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.020 
flattening it on its own so here you can

my<00:04:08.340> hair<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.820> night<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.330> was<00:04:09.510> not<00:04:09.720> used<00:04:09.900> to

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
my hair that night I was not used to

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.510 
my hair that night I was not used to
straight<00:04:10.290> hair<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.800> this<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.160> what<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.370> decided

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
straight hair so this is what I decided

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.480 
straight hair so this is what I decided
to<00:04:11.850> do<00:04:12.150> however<00:04:12.960> I'm<00:04:13.620> realizing<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.280> as<00:04:14.460> a

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
to do however I'm realizing this as a

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.890 
to do however I'm realizing this as a
trial<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:14.940> error<00:04:15.060> process<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.280> what<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.239> did<00:04:18.330> I

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
trial and error process so what I did I

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.360 
trial and error process so what I did I
figured<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.410> can<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.830> put<00:04:20.010> some<00:04:20.190> little

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
figured I can just put some little

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.720 
figured I can just put some little
twists<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.180> kind<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.570> bantu<00:04:21.930> knot<00:04:22.140> method

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
twists and kind of a bantu knot method

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.150 
twists and kind of a bantu knot method
all<00:04:23.730> over<00:04:24.120> my<00:04:24.240> head<00:04:24.510> what<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.320> should<00:04:25.740> have<00:04:25.950> done

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
all over my head what I should have done

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.490 
all over my head what I should have done
