00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.490
 We need the steam if you do not have an account 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.770
 I'll explain how it is and I also have a 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.050
 video that tells you exactly how 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.360
 we started going into steam 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.460

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.500

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.230
 to your email 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.100

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.759
 you have confirmed you can enter this 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.759
 so 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.420
 we start session 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.430
 ok what we would have to do is 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.430
 we come to store 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.180
 or we put here in the search engine 22 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.180

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.170
 a bus that has but works 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.690
 and we had the mythical game system of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.520
 valve 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.520
 that never ceases to amaze us 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 we give you a little 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.440
 once a little bit the pedals but 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.440
 let's go fast this 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.659
 we did not have the presentation 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.840
 this is the tutorial I advise you 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.810
 you do it so that you go testing what 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.740
 I 'm going to see how the keys go 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.250
 and else 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.670
 then it also has a shop but to me what 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.930
 What I like about this game is that 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.750
 they sell objects for example a sword or 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.600
 levels and such is very equipped with the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.930
 People who pay and do not pay only people 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.470
 that you pay you earned visualizations and little 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.470
 more so the pvp is very interesting 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:22.450
 you have here the shop here offers 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:25.890
 of the day the updates and other 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.120
 here are the tournaments 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.120
 and here is play 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.510
 once you pass the tutorial you will see 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.120
 here the departure of 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.920
 to play tournaments with 3 against 3 5 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:46.280
 against 5 duels against friends and others 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.030
 so let's see the tutorial here I 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.329

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.720

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.720

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.460
 in the presentation 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.950
 works 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.370
 the tutorials that has nothing to do 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.880
 with what is the game itself 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.780
 the game is pure pvp 3 against 3 5 against 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.780

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.620
 of missions and you're here tells you what 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.409
