and you can see that there is this very

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.560 
and you can see that there is this very
obviously<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.720> dark<00:03:14.080> tone<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:14.800> very<00:03:15.520> much<00:03:16.270> a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
obviously a dark tone but very much a

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.650 
obviously a dark tone but very much a
comedic<00:03:17.070> tone<00:03:18.070> overall<00:03:18.490> and<00:03:19.240> it<00:03:19.330> might<00:03:19.510> be<00:03:19.630> a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
comedic tone overall and it might be a

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.120 
comedic tone overall and it might be a
lot<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:20.260> Boogie<00:03:21.040> Nights<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:23.740> this<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.100> a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
lot of Boogie Nights and so this is a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.860 
lot of Boogie Nights and so this is a
very<00:03:24.550> different<00:03:26.040> mood<00:03:27.360> considering<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.720> his

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
very different mood considering that his

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.320 
very different mood considering that his
last<00:03:29.140> film<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.950> master<00:03:30.430> which<00:03:30.790> was<00:03:31.060> a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
last film the master which was a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
last film the master which was a
masterpiece<00:03:32.170> was<00:03:33.100> very<00:03:33.610> dark<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:34.630> him

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
masterpiece was very dark and so him

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.699 
masterpiece was very dark and so him
