focus<00:00:59.170> so<00:00:59.560> I<00:01:00.070> need<00:01:00.490> to<00:01:00.760> think<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:01.720> before

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
focus so I need to think of that before

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.890 
focus so I need to think of that before
I<00:01:02.050> can<00:01:02.140> go<00:01:02.290> anywhere<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:04.000> my<00:01:04.239> first<00:01:04.540> season

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900

and<00:01:05.740> with<00:01:05.920> each<00:01:06.040> season<00:01:06.250> after<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:06.909> it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
and with each season after that it's

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.910 
and with each season after that it's
really<00:01:07.390> been<00:01:07.509> too<00:01:07.659> focused<00:01:07.810> on<00:01:08.049> a<00:01:08.110> single<00:01:08.530> song

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
