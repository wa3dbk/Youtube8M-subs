ability because there are a lot of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.680 
ability because there are a lot of
questions<00:00:11.130> about<00:00:11.280> how<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.700> ability<00:00:11.969> exactly

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
questions about how this ability exactly

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.600 
questions about how this ability exactly
works<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:13.740> causes<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.400> switch

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
works and what causes you to switch

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.849 
works and what causes you to switch
stances<00:00:15.120> now<00:00:15.719> before<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.230> get<00:00:16.320> started<00:00:16.560> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
stances now before we get started and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.740 
stances now before we get started and
showing<00:00:17.279> how<00:00:17.400> exactly<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.940> all<00:00:18.060> works<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
showing how exactly this all works the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.300 
showing how exactly this all works the
thing<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:18.990> need<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.170> know<00:00:19.320> first<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
thing you need to know first is that the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.529 
thing you need to know first is that the
stats<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.910> aegislash

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
stats on aegislash

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.200 
stats on aegislash
change<00:00:21.869> significantly<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.769> each<00:00:23.010> form<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.910> in

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
change significantly in each form so in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.570 
change significantly in each form so in
shield<00:00:24.510> form<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.320> increased<00:00:25.890> defenses

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
shield form you have increased defenses

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
shield form you have increased defenses
with<00:00:26.760> base<00:00:26.939> 150<00:00:27.510> defense<00:00:27.840> one<00:00:28.080> bit<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:28.560> base

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
with base 150 defense one bit when base

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.370 
with base 150 defense one bit when base
150<00:00:29.310> special<00:00:29.670> defense<00:00:29.910> with<00:00:30.420> base<00:00:30.720> 50<00:00:31.109> attack

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
150 special defense with base 50 attack

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.290 
150 special defense with base 50 attack
and<00:00:31.619> base<00:00:31.740> 50<00:00:32.099> special<00:00:32.430> attack<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and base 50 special attack but when you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.850 
and base 50 special attack but when you
switch<00:00:33.480> over<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> blade<00:00:33.960> form<00:00:34.230> those<00:00:34.590> stats

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
switch over to blade form those stats

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.830 
switch over to blade form those stats
actually<00:00:35.010> swap<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.030> instead<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.630> base

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
actually swap so instead you have base

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780 
actually swap so instead you have base
150<00:00:37.469> attack<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.950> special<00:00:38.219> attack<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> then

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
150 attack and special attack and then

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.690 
150 attack and special attack and then
base<00:00:39.030> 50<00:00:39.510> defense<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.379> special<00:00:40.710> defense<00:00:41.129> now

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
base 50 defense and special defense now

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.100 
base 50 defense and special defense now
the<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.000> important<00:00:42.420> thing<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> also<00:00:42.930> make

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the one important thing to also make

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.709 
the one important thing to also make
note<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> Eevee's<00:00:44.219> apply<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
note of is that the Eevee's apply to the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
note of is that the Eevee's apply to the
stats<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.289> actually<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
stats that you actually got them and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.279 
stats that you actually got them and
meaning<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.600> some<00:00:48.870> people<00:00:49.079> initially

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
meaning that like some people initially

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.020 
meaning that like some people initially
thought<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> stats<00:00:50.219> themselves<00:00:50.850> actually

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
thought the stats themselves actually

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.990 
thought the stats themselves actually
switch<00:00:51.750> they<00:00:52.379> don't<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.399> example<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
switch they don't so for example if you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.529 
switch they don't so for example if you
are<00:00:54.030> even<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.600> physical<00:00:55.020> attack<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
are even in physical attack and you

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
are even in physical attack and you
switch<00:00:57.539> forms<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.500> blade<00:00:58.800> form<00:00:59.070> your

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
switch forms to the blade form your

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
switch forms to the blade form your
defense<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:00.899> physical<00:01:01.079> attack

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
defense is not what your physical attack

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.060 
defense is not what your physical attack
just<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.280> your<00:01:03.000> attack<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.739> defense

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
just was your attack is or your defense

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
just was your attack is or your defense
is<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.640> defense<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> Eevee

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
is what your defense was with the Eevee

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
is what your defense was with the Eevee
so<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.590> attack<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.070> still<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.400> boosted

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
so your attack will still be boosted

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.060 
so your attack will still be boosted
when<00:01:09.270> you're<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.990> blade<00:01:10.380> form<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
when you're in the blade form as well so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.990 
when you're in the blade form as well so
that's<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.310> something<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.610> need<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> clear<00:01:11.970> up

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that's just something I need to clear up

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
that's just something I need to clear up
first<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
first because there was a bit of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.620 
first because there was a bit of
confusion<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.040> about<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.180> let's<00:01:15.509> just

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
confusion on about that but let's just

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.780 
confusion on about that but let's just
find<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.900> battle<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.350> quick<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.670> go

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
find a battle really quick here we go

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.660 
find a battle really quick here we go
and<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.869> will<00:01:18.930> explain<00:01:19.380> exactly<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.130> detail<00:01:20.430> how

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and I will explain exactly in detail how

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.179 
and I will explain exactly in detail how
this<00:01:21.299> ability<00:01:21.570> works<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> lick<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
this ability works so we got a lick of

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.020 
this ability works so we got a lick of
tongue<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:23.729> kind<00:01:23.939> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
tongue and that's actually kind of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.520 
tongue and that's actually kind of
perfect<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.960> does<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> move

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
perfect because it does have a move

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
perfect because it does have a move
called<00:01:26.310> refresh<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.210> actually<00:01:27.540> be

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
called refresh that will actually be

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.359 
called refresh that will actually be
helpful<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.500> demonstrating<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.189> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
helpful in demonstrating this but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.039 
helpful in demonstrating this but
anyways<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.060> first<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> point<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
anyways the first thing to point out is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.569 
anyways the first thing to point out is
that<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.290> always<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> battle<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.340> in

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that you always start the battle off in

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.460 
that you always start the battle off in
shield<00:01:32.939> form<00:01:33.210> no<00:01:33.600> matter<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.049> happens

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
shield form no matter what happens

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230
