natural gas prices are going to continue
to<00:00:41.160> increase<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.930> cold<00:00:43.170> weather

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
that range and natural gas prices move

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.720 
that range and natural gas prices move
up<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.730> bit<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.149> far<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.739> oil<00:00:56.160> prices

demand a scenario like right now well

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
demand a scenario like right now well
over<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.130> past<00:01:14.159> year<00:01:14.640> we've<00:01:14.820> seen<00:01:15.180> demand

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
over the past year we've seen demand

withdrawals<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:18.930> last<00:01:19.229> year<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.950> what

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
withdrawals from last year now what

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.010 
withdrawals from last year now what
we're<00:01:20.340> finding<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> natural<00:01:21.270> gas<00:01:21.570> prices

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
we're finding is that natural gas prices

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
we're finding is that natural gas prices
are<00:01:22.140> staying<00:01:22.470> steady<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.909> dollar

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
are staying steady over that for dollar

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.730 
are staying steady over that for dollar
mark<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.750> firmly<00:01:25.080> believe<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.470> they're

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
mark and we firmly believe that they're

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
mark and we firmly believe that they're
going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.040> higher<00:01:26.430> only<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> energy

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
going to go higher only with the energy

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to go higher only with the energy

terminals<00:01:38.460> coming<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.820> board<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
terminals coming on board here in the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480 
terminals coming on board here in the
near<00:01:39.659> future<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:40.409> see<00:01:40.619> natural<00:01:40.770> gas<00:01:41.070> prices

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
near future we see natural gas prices

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.100 
near future we see natural gas prices
move<00:01:41.670> into<00:01:41.909> five<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> six<00:01:42.450> dollar<00:01:42.659> range<00:01:42.899> if

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
move into five and six dollar range if

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
move into five and six dollar range if
not<00:01:43.259> higher<00:01:43.439> okay<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.670> has<00:01:45.119> weighed<00:01:45.420> on

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
not higher okay so what has weighed on

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
not higher okay so what has weighed on
oil<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.320> these<00:01:46.470> months<00:01:46.770> has<00:01:46.890> obviously<00:01:47.310> been

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
oil of these months has obviously been

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.600 
oil of these months has obviously been
the<00:01:47.640> large<00:01:47.850> supply<00:01:48.439> low<00:01:49.439> demand<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the large supply low demand and the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.700 
the large supply low demand and the
strong<00:01:51.180> US<00:01:51.600> dollar<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> dollar

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
strong US dollar it's really a dollar

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
strong US dollar it's really a dollar
store<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.149> gold<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:55.049> are

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
store just as it is for gold what are

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.660 
store just as it is for gold what are
some<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> fundamentals<00:01:56.189> when<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.460> talk

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
some of the fundamentals when we talk

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.719 
some of the fundamentals when we talk
not<00:01:56.969> gas<00:01:57.290> well<00:01:58.290> what<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.310> with

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
not gas well what we see with with

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
not gas well what we see with with
natural<00:02:00.090> gas<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:00.600> about<00:02:00.810> demand<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
natural gas it's all about demand and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.840 
natural gas it's all about demand and
then<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.740> much<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> costs<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> pull<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
then how much it costs to pull it on the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
then how much it costs to pull it on the
ground<00:02:03.030> where<00:02:03.329> royal<00:02:03.630> energy<00:02:04.049> drills<00:02:04.380> in

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
ground where royal energy drills in

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.230 
ground where royal energy drills in
california<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
california we don't have to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.880 
california we don't have to
hydraulically<00:02:06.719> fracture<00:02:07.140> those<00:02:07.320> wells<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
hydraulically fracture those wells and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.130 
hydraulically fracture those wells and
so<00:02:08.250> therefore<00:02:08.459> our<00:02:08.759> costs<00:02:09.149> are<00:02:09.239> down<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
so therefore our costs are down so that

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.470 
so therefore our costs are down so that
gives<00:02:10.649> us<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.039> ability<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.640> pull<00:02:11.879> out<00:02:12.030> gas<00:02:12.270> on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
gives us the ability to pull out gas on

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.800 
gives us the ability to pull out gas on
the<00:02:12.599> groun

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the groun

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.930 
the groun
for<00:02:13.050> below<00:02:13.319> two<00:02:13.380> dollars<00:02:13.920> hour<00:02:14.310> lifting<00:02:14.610> costs

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
for below two dollars hour lifting costs

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.460 
for below two dollars hour lifting costs
or<00:02:15.030> sub<00:02:15.450> two<00:02:15.630> dollars<00:02:15.930> per<00:02:16.080> thousand<00:02:16.440> cubic

or sub two dollars per thousand cubic
foot<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.150> we<00:02:18.150> feel<00:02:18.390> confident<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.020> prices

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
foot and we feel confident that prices

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.990 
foot and we feel confident that prices
are<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.709> move<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.160> future<00:02:20.520> now

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
are going to move up in the future now

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.630 
are going to move up in the future now
with<00:02:21.180> oil<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.989> gold<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.010> see<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.459> those

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
with oil and and gold you see that those

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.640 
with oil and and gold you see that those
lifting<00:02:24.000> costs<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.420> come<00:02:24.450> down<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
lifting costs have come down and the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.890 
lifting costs have come down and the
demand<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.489> high<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.420> used<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> be

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
demand is not as high as it used to be

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.339 
demand is not as high as it used to be
so<00:02:28.470> we're<00:02:29.069> constantly<00:02:29.670> finding<00:02:30.510> ways<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.200> pull

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
so we're constantly finding ways to pull

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.770 
so we're constantly finding ways to pull
out<00:02:31.500> natural<00:02:31.890> gas<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.640> cheaper<00:02:33.030> way<00:02:33.180> just

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
out natural gas at a cheaper way just

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.290 
out natural gas at a cheaper way just
like<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> oil<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.560> gold<00:02:34.680> producers<00:02:35.190> are<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
like the oil and gold producers are the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.360 
like the oil and gold producers are the
funny<00:02:36.510> thing<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.349> oil<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.010> gold<00:02:38.190> are

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
funny thing is is that oil and gold are

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.430 
funny thing is is that oil and gold are
very<00:02:38.610> much<00:02:38.819> connected<00:02:39.569> because<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.260> fact

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
very much connected because of the fact

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.259 
very much connected because of the fact
that<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.860> they're<00:02:41.099> tied<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.489> US<00:02:41.730> dollar<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
that a they're tied to the US dollar and

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.630 
that a they're tied to the US dollar and
then<00:02:42.630> be<00:02:42.930> it's<00:02:43.380> all<00:02:43.530> about<00:02:43.560> lifting<00:02:43.980> costs<00:02:44.459> how

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
then be it's all about lifting costs how

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.259 
then be it's all about lifting costs how
much<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:45.420> costs<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.810> pull<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.280> oil<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.640> gold

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
much it costs to pull that oil or gold

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.449 
much it costs to pull that oil or gold
out<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> ground<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.410> obviously<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.190> track

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
out of the ground so obviously you track

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.430 
out of the ground so obviously you track
gold<00:02:50.750> absolutely<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:51.930> let's<00:02:52.110> talk<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.290> little

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
gold absolutely so let's talk a little

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.990 
gold absolutely so let's talk a little
bit<00:02:52.620> about<00:02:52.769> your<00:02:52.920> forecast<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:53.519> gold<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.910> how

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
bit about your forecast for gold and how

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.090 
bit about your forecast for gold and how
you<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.360> metal<00:02:54.630> well<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.500> all<00:02:55.620> depends<00:02:55.950> on

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
you see the metal well it all depends on

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.490 
you see the metal well it all depends on
interest<00:02:56.489> rates<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.850> risk<00:02:57.480> tolerant<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.049> what

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
interest rates and risk tolerant so what

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.100 
interest rates and risk tolerant so what
we're<00:02:58.650> finding<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.220> when<00:02:59.940> investors<00:03:00.900> are

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
we're finding is that when investors are

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.680 
we're finding is that when investors are
less<00:03:01.340> risk<00:03:02.340> adverse<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.150> they're<00:03:03.299> ready<00:03:03.510> to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
less risk adverse and they're ready to

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.270 
less risk adverse and they're ready to
take<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.049> risk<00:03:04.290> with<00:03:04.470> stocks<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.920> bonds<00:03:05.069> well

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
take on risk with stocks and bonds well

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.160 
take on risk with stocks and bonds well
gold<00:03:05.489> prices<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:05.940> going<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.120> come<00:03:06.360> down<00:03:06.569> when

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
gold prices are going to come down when

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.660 
gold prices are going to come down when
the<00:03:07.260> stock<00:03:07.500> market<00:03:07.530> starts<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.280> move<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.580> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
the stock market starts to move in a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.160 
the stock market starts to move in a
different<00:03:08.790> direction<00:03:09.000> well<00:03:09.810> we're<00:03:09.989> going<00:03:10.080> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
different direction well we're going to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.800 
different direction well we're going to
see<00:03:10.319> gold<00:03:10.530> prices<00:03:10.739> move<00:03:11.130> up<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.519> firmly<00:03:12.390> believe
