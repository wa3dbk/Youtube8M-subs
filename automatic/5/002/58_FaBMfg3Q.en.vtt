very very good at installing these skins
if<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.450> should<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:15.960> myself

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
if I should say so myself

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.530 
if I should say so myself
but<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.490> some<00:01:17.610> reason<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.360> bit

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
but for some reason I had a little bit

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.330 
but for some reason I had a little bit
of<00:01:18.570> difficulty<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.680> even<00:01:20.070> though

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of difficulty with this one even though

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.240 
of difficulty with this one even though
I<00:01:20.700> did<00:01:21.390> heat<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.869> sides<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> corners<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I did heat the sides and the corners and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
I did heat the sides and the corners and
try<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> mold<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> device<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
try to mold it because the device is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.289 
try to mold it because the device is
actually<00:01:25.409> curved<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.060> slick

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
actually curved and that is what slick

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
actually curved and that is what slick
wraps<00:01:27.509> recommends<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
wraps recommends that you do and now I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
wraps recommends that you do and now I
did<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> fairly<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.420> install<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.110> was<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
did get a fairly good install I was a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.780 
did get a fairly good install I was a
little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.770> disappointed<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.490> certain

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
little bit disappointed with certain

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
little bit disappointed with certain
parts<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> think<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.900> also<00:01:34.049> has<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
parts of it but I think that also has to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.840 
parts of it but I think that also has to
do<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> fact<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.340> dropped<00:01:35.610> my

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
do with the fact that I have dropped my

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 
do with the fact that I have dropped my
iPhone<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> past<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> corners<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
iPhone in the past and the corners are a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
iPhone in the past and the corners are a
little<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.920> dinged<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.540> besides<00:01:39.540> for

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
little bit dinged up but besides for

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
little bit dinged up but besides for
that<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.350> seemed<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.340> achieved<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that I do have seemed to achieved a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
that I do have seemed to achieved a
nearly<00:01:42.810> perfect<00:01:43.079> install<00:01:43.619> especially<00:01:44.009> when

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
nearly perfect install especially when

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
nearly perfect install especially when
it<00:01:44.220> comes<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.579> cutouts<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> camera<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
it comes to cutouts like the camera the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
it comes to cutouts like the camera the
flash<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.409> microphone<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> Apple<00:01:47.700> logo

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
flash the microphone and the Apple logo

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.889 
flash the microphone and the Apple logo
at<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.149> back<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.720> interesting

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
at the back and that's interesting

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
at the back and that's interesting
because<00:01:49.229> Apple<00:01:50.220> had<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.610> stopped

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
because Apple had actually stopped

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
because Apple had actually stopped
companies<00:01:51.270> from<00:01:51.479> allowing<00:01:51.869> them<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.439> have

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
companies from allowing them to have

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
companies from allowing them to have
cutouts<00:01:52.920> earlier<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.210> somehow<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.720> other

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
cutouts earlier but somehow or the other

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.230 
cutouts earlier but somehow or the other
slick<00:01:55.200> apps<00:01:55.380> managed<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.250> around<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
slick apps managed to get around that it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
slick apps managed to get around that it
actually<00:01:57.390> does<00:01:57.689> look<00:01:57.719> very<00:01:57.899> nice<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:59.310> did<00:01:59.430> you

going to protect from scratches but also

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.540 
going to protect from scratches but also
thin<00:02:23.900> enough<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.680> feels<00:02:24.890> really<00:02:25.130> nice<00:02:25.310> in

the hand this is of course a skin so

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.720 
the hand this is of course a skin so
it's<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:27.800> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> protect<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.430> from<00:02:28.459> any

drops<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.450> does<00:02:29.630> actually<00:02:30.110> avoid<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.040> use

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
drops but it does actually avoid the use

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.710 
drops but it does actually avoid the use
of<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.430> couple<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.760> cases<00:02:32.000> useless<00:02:32.569> because

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
of a couple of cases useless because

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.990 
of a couple of cases useless because
they<00:02:33.020> do<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.290> fit<00:02:33.620> over<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:33.950> since<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:34.970> a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
they do not fit over it since it is a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.059 
they do not fit over it since it is a
high<00:02:35.270> quality<00:02:35.300> skin<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> 3m<00:02:36.709> adhesive

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
high quality skin it is a 3m adhesive

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.710 
high quality skin it is a 3m adhesive
material<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:37.940> also<00:02:38.150> not<00:02:38.480> going<00:02:38.660> to

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
material so it is also not going to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.740 
material so it is also not going to
leave<00:02:38.840> any<00:02:39.050> residue<00:02:39.530> when<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.250> peel<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.459> off
