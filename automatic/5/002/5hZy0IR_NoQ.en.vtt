 Attention to the theme of influence is cold We want to hear story about heart disease, but teacher 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:44.540
 Is there a relationship between heart and cold? Taipei heart is easily affected by the environment 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.870
 It is one of the weak organs in the pound and especially when going from a warm place to a cold place 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.370
 The result shrinks and shrinks 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.620

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.579
 This is a starting point and a major illness may occur, so it is very dangerous. 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.129
 There is also 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.710
 As much as possible even because winter was in the inner you because it is the season to take the burden on the heart 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:13.360
 It is also a heavy person who died in the pre-emptive heart disease where we found Yes 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.980
 Yes you have heart disease 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:25.730
 Is the third leading cause of death next to vascular disease 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:28.900
 What is the disease of the newcomer, especially angina pectoris myocardial infarction, is very close 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:35.080
 It has the feature of attacking suddenly, yes 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:39.040
 You need to hurry up the treatment about the treatment of catheterization and surgery 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.180
 There is such a nature that will be things 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:48.890
 Angina and Myocardial Infarction are diseases I often hear 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:51.430
 Well, the eyes include it and explain while watching the disease of Xinjiang blood vessels 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.430
 2 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.960
 Yes 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.960
 Well from your heart out right as on the left side inside of 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.210
 You are looking at it from the front 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.810
 Blood in the body is in this blue blood vessel 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.750
 Go back to the right room of my heart 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.950
 The blood that came back once flowed to Yes and worked on the mountain villa enough 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:23.180
 It becomes beautiful blood and peony comes back to the room on the left side 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.130
 Yes, the blood that has returned is called the aorta. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.569
 It flows in the body I 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:37.150
 The so-called heart to the role of the pump to send the body to the blood 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.650
 Well, it is said that the heart is the left ventricle chased by this thick muscle 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.319
 Entered Nde 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:50.050
 In general , reducing the function of the headquarters sheath is a business condition of heart failure 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:54.130
 Yes that there is an aortic that sends blood into the body on the battlefield a 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.510
 It is about 3 centimeters in diameter , but with arterial syntax advanced 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.599
 Bring to the situation like the country called 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.879
 It will also be friends Avenue NYA full senior 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:10.709
 As this is serious when it bursts, it is 5 centimeters in diameter and 6 centimeters as a diameter. 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:15.920
 If you do, you need to be careful, so I think you should be careful in the heart 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:19.580
 If you pay attention to the heart is divided into four large rooms 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:26.209
 The flow of blood in vibration is always 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:31.700
 Dam is also located in the a stool that is between the room and the room of guarding and You're 42 of 2 exit 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:34.490
 Hojo is waiting for one step forward the case that this flight has left is a problem with the company 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.710
 I have chosen to take a prize Yes 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.030
 As I said earlier, the heart immediately receives and sends 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.690
 I use it 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:53.240
 There are however say cheerfully fly Warped in response to a brush station themselves as one of the organs 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.170
 Parfait general is to say determination stored in the Yes feelings on the surface here of brain heart 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:01.709
 It is said to NYA recoil 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:05.340
 I've come out of my body so that this kicker will narrow and close 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.730
 We call the table new product wage high speed 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.690
 Four heads are coming out and the upper left one is normal 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:19.360
 It is another brother is 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.440
 What is the early monk of arteriosclerosis to the result what is called p aa time plap 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.940
 it's finished 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:29.150
 This shows that the lumen of the blood vessel is narrowed and blood flow is blocked . 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.420
 This situation is angina. 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:38.580
 When this arteriosclerosis further progresses, it is with the head on the lower left 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:41.310
 The blood flow is blocked by the fact that the plaque breaks down and the thrombus gets clogged there 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:47.040
 This is the situation of divine balance 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:50.510
 In this case, the muscle that is said to be a shinkin in the future will be useless. 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.430
 It said such I have to the treatment contesting the moment 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.390
 Hmm 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:00.639
 I understand that angina is not fatal. 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.600
 Rubella disease is generally 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.480
 Say that strong pain 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:13.330
 It is said that there is no physical disorder feeling of ticket type and say either 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:19.569
 I think especially as also a large and you say who the patient as an uncomfortable feeling today 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.740
 It is to say rather than in the subsequent pain, but the top of feeling better is I'm a person that each have in common 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.990
 Cure 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.910
 Because there is a conversion 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:31.150
 It 's about the stomach, not just so . 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:34.760
 It seems that some people sell pain around their health if their left shoulder is stiff 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.970
 Heart failure say then edema and 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.740
 You may also go ahead with typical commerce 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.950
 I felt it was breathless when I moved 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:49.090
 Then I feel that it is a manufactured rear but it seems to be asking 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.880
 Anyway I do not think it is a sickness to buy at home 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.660
 Karoo symptoms don't 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:00.720
 Since the the Fu that I would like you to the all means com offerings 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:08.160
 I understand that it 's very important, but if I feel anxious or abnormal, I would go anywhere 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:09.870
 It may be good or there are severe symptoms of severe symptoms such as symptoms of pain or unconsciousness 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.430
 Get lost 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:19.480
 I think Fu that I would like you out ambulance immediately is not such symptoms 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:24.460
 Got the first primary care teacher and consultation in the case of mild symptoms do 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:27.689
 In transgressions that was had been admitted to hospital in Atsumarimaki one family in order to make an accurate inspection from it 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:33.179
 I think yes or no I understood 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:41.459
 Lastly, I tried to show a list of things called heart disease and circulatory organs 

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:42.460
 Ischemic referred to as angina pectoris myocardial infarction that was you talking about earlier from those light that high blood pressure and Namamyaku 

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:46.930
 Heart disease 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.569
 Was Shinkin more than basic credit unions that there is an abnormality in the valve because 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.520
 Then 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:57.569
 There are many types such as vascular disease like aortic aneurysm 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:02.340
 Because any progress may be life-threatening 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:03.539
 Samusen smell will eat Fu that please take care enough our understanding Yes 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.500
 To understand just below 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:10.740
