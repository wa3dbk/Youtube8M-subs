ok<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:18.500> once<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.590> always<00:01:19.860> seems<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
ok so now once that always seems to be a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.800 
ok so now once that always seems to be a
little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.670> easier<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.390> other<00:01:21.540> side

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
little bit easier than the other side

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030 
for me it's my left side so it's a
little<00:01:24.570> bit<00:01:24.720> easier<00:01:25.110> than<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
don't want to do every piece of hair go

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.050 
don't want to do every piece of hair go
in<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.799> same<00:01:59.950> direction<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.490> want<00:02:00.759> something

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
in the same direction you want something

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.300 
in the same direction you want something
to<00:02:01.090> go<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:02.079> other<00:02:02.110> direction<00:02:02.439> because<00:02:02.950> it's

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
to go the other direction because it's

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.499 
to go the other direction because it's
all<00:02:03.399> by<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.579> same<00:02:03.670> direction<00:02:03.939> it<00:02:04.299> kind<00:02:04.450> of

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
all by the same direction it kind of

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.050 
all by the same direction it kind of
ends<00:02:04.689> up<00:02:04.750> getting<00:02:04.840> pumped<00:02:05.349> into<00:02:05.470> one<00:02:05.770> big<00:02:06.189> curl

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
ends up getting pumped into one big curl

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.460 
ends up getting pumped into one big curl
so<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.479> don't<00:02:07.630> want<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.810> do<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:08.380> this

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
so you don't want to do that so for this

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.949 
so you don't want to do that so for this
piece<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.829> hair<00:02:08.979> we're<00:02:09.789> gonna<00:02:09.880> turn<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.869> iron

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
piece of hair we're gonna turn the iron

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.020 
piece of hair we're gonna turn the iron
in<00:02:11.290> words<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:12.340> make<00:02:12.430> go<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.790> other<00:02:12.819> direction

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
in words to make go the other direction

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.850 
in words to make go the other direction
because<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.660> kind<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.840> flipped<00:02:14.110> out<00:02:14.290> it

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
because it's kind of flipped out it

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.089 
because it's kind of flipped out it
seemed<00:02:14.980> good<00:02:15.099> before<00:02:15.430> pin<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.810> again<00:02:17.200> go<00:02:17.980> like

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
seemed good before pin so again go like

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.710 
seemed good before pin so again go like
this<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:18.819> time<00:02:19.030> we're<00:02:19.209> flipping<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
this and this time we're flipping the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.789 
this and this time we're flipping the
iron<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:21.299> little<00:02:22.299> bit<00:02:22.420> different<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.560> keep

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
iron in a little bit different just keep

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.460 
iron in a little bit different just keep
turning<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.459> hair<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.180> going<00:02:26.140> all<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> way

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
turning the hair and going all the way

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.819 
turning the hair and going all the way
down<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.769> piece<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.750> there<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.200> go<00:02:29.230> another

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
down the piece and there you go another

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.350 
down the piece and there you go another
chance<00:02:30.280> going<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.819> other<00:02:30.849> direction

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.850 

so<00:02:33.900> we're<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.170> keep<00:02:34.260> doing<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.620> all

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
so we're going to keep doing that all

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:50.540 
so we're going to keep doing that all
around<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.120> hair<00:02:37.640> alternating<00:02:38.640> pieces<00:02:49.550> now

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
around the hair alternating pieces now

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.920 
around the hair alternating pieces now
this<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.730> sad<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.240> always<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> little<00:02:51.600> more

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
this is sad that's always a little more

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.100 
this is sad that's always a little more
difficult<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.500> me<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.820> we're<00:02:54.810> gonna<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.020> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
difficult for me but we're gonna do the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
difficult for me but we're gonna do the
same<00:02:55.320> kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> first<00:02:56.250> piece

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
same kind of thing so the first piece

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.190 
same kind of thing so the first piece
that's<00:02:56.850> closest<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.720> front<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.900> your<00:02:57.990> face

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.520 
there you go I know it's hard because
sometimes<00:04:37.460> people<00:04:37.850> get<00:04:38.660> stuck<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.020> they<00:04:39.290> like

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
sometimes people get stuck and they like

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.960 
sometimes people get stuck and they like
does<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.890> grease<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.580> hair<00:04:40.790> like<00:04:40.940> a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
does that grease in the hair like a

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.450 
does that grease in the hair like a
crimping<00:04:41.510> that's<00:04:42.140> my<00:04:42.290> cue<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:42.800> just<00:04:43.310> don't

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
crimping that's my cue but just don't

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.940 
crimping that's my cue but just don't
hold<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.820> iron<00:04:44.000> too<00:04:44.360> tight<00:04:44.600> because<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.770> think

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
hold the iron too tight because I think

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.280 
hold the iron too tight because I think
that's<00:04:46.100> kind<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.430> what<00:04:46.640> helps<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.720> so<00:04:48.170> for

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
that's kind of what helps that so for

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.180 
that's kind of what helps that so for
this<00:04:48.380> one<00:04:48.500> we're<00:04:48.590> going<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.740> flip<00:04:48.950> it<00:04:49.040> out

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
this one we're going to flip it out

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.770

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
because the one right underneath it was

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.760 
because the one right underneath it was
flipped<00:04:51.020> in

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770
