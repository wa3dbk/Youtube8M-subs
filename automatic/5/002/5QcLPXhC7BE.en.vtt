00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
little cubes just like that I'm going to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.340 
little cubes just like that I'm going to
put<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> paper<00:01:55.530> towel<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.350> set

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
put a paper towel over it and set

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.109 
put a paper towel over it and set
another<00:01:58.619> plate<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.100> top<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.759> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
another plate on top of it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.770 
another plate on top of it
it'll<00:02:01.079> help<00:02:01.229> absorb<00:02:02.270> some<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> water

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
it'll help absorb some of the water

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.340 
it'll help absorb some of the water
while<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.680> prepare<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.810> rest<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
while we prepare the rest of the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.889 
while we prepare the rest of the
stir-fry<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.670> should<00:02:08.940> make<00:02:08.970> enough<00:02:09.420> for

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
stir-fry and this should make enough for

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.589 
stir-fry and this should make enough for
either<00:02:10.470> four<00:02:10.890> people<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.489> two<00:02:11.790> really<00:02:12.330> really

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
either four people or two really really

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.280 
either four people or two really really
hungry<00:02:12.810> people
