environment<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.750> nerve<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
environment for that nerve and this to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.120 
environment for that nerve and this to
live<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.079> next<00:01:43.470> visit<00:01:43.920> after

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
live in so on that next visit after

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
live in so on that next visit after
visit<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.909> determined<00:01:45.479> okay<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.290> looks

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
visit one we determined okay this looks

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
visit one we determined okay this looks
like<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> patient<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> be

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
like a patient that is going to be

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
like a patient that is going to be
helped<00:01:48.210> through<00:01:48.299> chiropractic<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.439> we're

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
helped through chiropractic now we're

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
helped through chiropractic now we're
going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> manipulation<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
going to do the manipulation and that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
going to do the manipulation and that
manipulation<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> open<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.799> space

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
manipulation is to open up space

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.670 
manipulation is to open up space
increase<00:01:53.909> oxygenation<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> all<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> studies

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
increase oxygenation and all the studies

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
increase oxygenation and all the studies
show<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.700> type<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.180> spinal<00:01:57.509> issue

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
show that that type of spinal issue

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.050 
show that that type of spinal issue
manipulation<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.369> increased

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
manipulation will do that increased

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.969 
manipulation will do that increased
blood<00:02:00.299> flow

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
blood flow

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
blood flow
oxygenate<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.009> area<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.299> by<00:02:03.450> doing<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
oxygenate the area so by doing that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.260 
oxygenate the area so by doing that
you're<00:02:04.350> creating<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> healing<00:02:05.250> effect<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.119> is

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you're creating a healing effect so is

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.219 
you're creating a healing effect so is
that<00:02:06.420> done<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.350> hands<00:02:07.829> or<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
like a big machine like a traction

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.010

because sometimes people come in and

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.470 
because sometimes people come in and
they'll<00:02:54.430> say<00:02:54.610> let's<00:02:54.849> say<00:02:55.000> from<00:02:55.150> physical

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
they'll say let's say from physical

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
felt worse after that first visit so

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.270 
felt worse after that first visit so

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
miraculous release because that

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.640 
miraculous release because that
adjustment<00:03:09.760> has<00:03:10.209> been<00:03:10.510> shown<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.079> studies

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
adjustment has been shown and studies

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.140 
adjustment has been shown and studies
have<00:03:11.680> shown<00:03:12.010> also<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.700> endorphin

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
have shown also that endorphin

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.090 
have shown also that endorphin
production<00:03:13.959> or<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.319> body's<00:03:14.950> natural

painkillers<00:03:15.880> are<00:03:16.000> produced<00:03:16.329> with<00:03:16.480> that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
painkillers are produced with that

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.599 
painkillers are produced with that
immediate<00:03:17.049> thrust<00:03:17.380> okay<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.190> that's<00:03:18.489> where

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
immediate thrust okay so that's where
