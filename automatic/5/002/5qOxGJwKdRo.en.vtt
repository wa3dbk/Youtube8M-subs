00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
money into the 1,000,000 cornflowers the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.220 
money into the 1,000,000 cornflowers the
1.5<00:00:32.489> million<00:00:32.850> corn<00:00:33.030> players<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:33.630> anybody<00:00:34.020> even

1.5 million corn players or anybody even

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049 
1.5 million corn players or anybody even
more<00:00:34.559> expensive<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.100> their<00:00:35.489> prices<00:00:35.910> are

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
more expensive because their prices are

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.030 
more expensive because their prices are
going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> continually<00:00:36.960> drop<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
going to continually drop that is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
going to continually drop that is
basically<00:00:38.430> essentially<00:00:38.940> due<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> fact

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
basically essentially due to the fact

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.299 
basically essentially due to the fact
that<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.680> many<00:00:40.770> packs<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.219> are

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that there's so many packs that are

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.950 
that there's so many packs that are
being<00:00:41.550> bought<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.300> chances<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.750> those

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
being bought and the chances of those

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690 
being bought and the chances of those
players<00:00:43.170> being<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.860> those<00:00:44.219> packs<00:00:44.520> I'll

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
players being that in those packs I'll

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.670 
players being that in those packs I'll
go<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.090> slim<00:00:45.390> there<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> still<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> chance<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
go very slim there is still a chance and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
go very slim there is still a chance and
everyone<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.340> goes<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.789> market

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
everyone that goes up on the market

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.119 
everyone that goes up on the market
decreases<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> price<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.649> people<00:00:49.980> tend

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
decreases the price because people tend

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
decreases the price because people tend
to<00:00:50.219> undercut<00:00:50.700> each<00:00:50.730> other<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.899> will<00:00:52.050> lose

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
because he invested in them during team

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.590 
because he invested in them during team
of<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.400> season<00:02:53.700> i'm<00:02:53.820> not<00:02:54.060> sure<00:02:54.270> if<00:02:54.330> he<00:02:54.420> had

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.240 
of the season i'm not sure if he had
them<00:02:54.720> before<00:02:54.840> but<00:02:55.320> their<00:02:55.710> prices<00:02:56.070> will

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
them before but their prices will

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.520 
them before but their prices will
continually<00:02:56.820> go<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.810> they<00:02:58.200> might<00:02:58.410> not

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
continually go down and they might not

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.140 
continually go down and they might not
go<00:02:58.590> down<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.920> lot<00:02:59.190> but<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.490> chances<00:02:59.910> of<00:02:59.970> a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
go down a lot but the chances of a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.690
