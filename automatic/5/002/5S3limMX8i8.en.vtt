00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 for the third consecutive week 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.930
 we are in Zuidbroek for the supercross 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.660
 in Zuidbroek and we are now looking at the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.940
 finals on Saturday and Sunday in the fx 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.639
 a class with among other things with it 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 number 25 flora 3c the frenchman there 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.060
 is gone very quickly 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.820
 we also have the Dutchman with this 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.590
 is not kouwenberg that is neat 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.330
 qualified for this final 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 had already had two semi-finals 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.230
 of course a number of series and now so 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.189
 that final final in fifteen rounds 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.329
 on this circuit of about 400 meters long 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.430
 she got laid out naturally 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.469
 Freddie was retrying and he had one 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 certainly not an easy job made 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.300
 but when we looked at Florence Reshape 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.110
 the one there so the compact one had it whole 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110
 little trouble with that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.320
 the sea was reasonably fast in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.360
 qualifications 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.190
 the fastest while we're not there for a while 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.260
 cauwenbergh have it there 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.010
 is by the way passed by couches 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.960
 him 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 American who had a very difficult weekend 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.000
 had program wcd very pretty in the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.519
 qualifications he was certainly not the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.799
 fastest hand fastest in qualifying 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.119
 that was Jack Brunell 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.470
 Englishman which in this final it anyway 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.470
 which was less satisfactory 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.049
 and richet who pulled his own 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.729
 plan on the kawasaki machine that which 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.500
 just borrowed from a groningen 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.689
 Greeks Postma 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
 spring we are very slightly modified 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.369
 send something else red 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.369
 and then reshape of starts 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.509
 also long in the glossy german soup 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.600
 this Frenchman's big name and how good he is 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.070
 is that white that in Zuidbroek look at this 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 this difficult job especially the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.549
 surface appeared for a number of riders 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.549
 to give some problems 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.320
 and that shot, for example, also one for 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.800
 dimples that are not really there in a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.800
 piece occurred 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.100
 there we see link aerts and rambo 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.320
 lloyd rambo and then also saw 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.920
 for a moment cheryl or franÃ§ois and is here 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.750
 it again 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.160
 nick kouwenberg was fifth in the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.590
 qualification training 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.930
 and he was seventh in his semi-final 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.630
 and with that he earned a place 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.630
 in this final on the Saturday evening 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.680
 but this Saturday night final that was 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:38.590
 clear for this man floor to richet 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.510
 he was definitely the fastest and the second 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.230
 place was finally for Christmas one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.050
 link card 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.790
 third place was for rambo and fourth 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.400
 t which was never maier for filip 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.630
 Building and missed Saturday this 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.120
 man 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.950
 machine cabbage siepel stood there 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.150
 but the American himself was not there 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.150
 unfortunately he had fallen on Saturday he 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 his head had hurt quite a light 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.600
 concussion and he decided on 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.480
 Saturday not to drive and on Sunday 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.390
 fortunately the ones would be there 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.410
 bit stuffy gave it to himself he would 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.410
 control is still trying 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.530
 says difficult was easy to constantly 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.970
 drive through the surface 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.650
 little different than in america of course 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.600
 and souls here by the way last year 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.530
 even though he said yes I know how 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.820
 it works a bit 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.560
 yes with you is of course not tasty 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.600
 really nice but the rooster and resident 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.220
 Moreover , he says at home in America 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.750
 drive in suzuki 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.340
 and here I have to switch to one 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.019
 hondahonda from 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.780
 mulders engines you looking at the 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.239
 final on Sunday with richet with lloyd 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.610
 from bora with the number 519 tennis 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.470
 Ulrich is also there and we see the good ones 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.750
 start for concealer with a 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.790
 number 18 but here we already have 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.920
 problems for among others 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.519
 Jack brunell and dennis flies there in the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.080
 first turn but everyone else comes 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.660
 good road and so I have everyone 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.310
 unfortunately no nick kouwenberg 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.709
 therefore mountains he got injured 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.690
 fell on Sunday during training and 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.459
 thereby broke his wrist and had to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.120
 let the final go and there with the number 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.310
 11 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.169
 Then we see chews for a little while 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.150
 it was really difficult 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.340
 op om was ninth in the final 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.310

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.169
 final on Sunday and name is frank 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.430

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.620
 six months ago 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.900
 and because of that he missed a bit in it 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.789
 game rhythm came here with 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.570
 send one's own outlets and 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.380
 the rear suspension 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.030
 but still missed the front suspension and it broke 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.250
 him a little bit like that 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.410

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.919
 choose again to use this competition 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.810
 just like many riders, by the way 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:28.510
