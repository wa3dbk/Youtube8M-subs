is<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.940> sow<00:02:06.179> them<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.599> seed<00:02:07.910> big<00:02:08.910> seeds<00:02:09.239> like

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
is to sow them from seed big seeds like

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.800 
is to sow them from seed big seeds like
nasturtiums<00:02:10.430> sunflowers<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.209> sweet<00:02:12.510> peas

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
nasturtiums sunflowers and sweet peas

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.550 
nasturtiums sunflowers and sweet peas
can<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:13.920> right<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.489> where<00:02:14.760> they're<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.180> grow

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
can go right in where they're to grow

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.110 
can go right in where they're to grow
but<00:02:16.560> when<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.830> comes<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> smaller<00:02:17.730> seeds

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
but when it comes to the smaller seeds

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.910 
but when it comes to the smaller seeds
you're<00:02:18.330> really<00:02:18.780> better<00:02:18.990> off<00:02:19.170> starting<00:02:19.740> them

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
you're really better off starting them

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.480 
you're really better off starting them
and<00:02:20.070> see

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
and see

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.140 
and see
trays<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.630> all<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.050> need<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:22.800> is

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
trays so all you need to do here is

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.270 
trays so all you need to do here is
shake<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.330> seeds<00:02:26.060> over<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> surface<00:02:28.280> press

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
shake the seeds over the surface press

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.590 
shake the seeds over the surface press
them<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:31.580> small<00:02:32.580> seeds<00:02:32.910> don't<00:02:33.210> need<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.480> be

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
them in small seeds don't need to be

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.690 
them in small seeds don't need to be
covered<00:02:33.960> very<00:02:34.200> much<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.250> makes<00:02:35.490> them<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
covered very much but this makes them a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
covered very much but this makes them a
little<00:02:35.760> bit<00:02:35.970> difficult<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.390> water<00:02:36.750> because

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
little bit difficult to water because

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710 
little bit difficult to water because
they<00:02:37.710> can<00:02:37.890> sometimes<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.490> washed<00:02:38.730> away<00:02:38.970> if<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
they can sometimes be washed away if you

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.680 
they can sometimes be washed away if you
use<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:39.990> hose<00:02:40.350> or<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.770> watering<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.390> I'd

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
use a hose or a watering can so I'd

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.050 
use a hose or a watering can so I'd
recommend<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.320> water<00:02:43.560> them<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:43.980> either<00:02:44.060> put

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
recommend to water them you either put

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.700 
recommend to water them you either put
them<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> container<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.320> with<00:02:46.530> some

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
them in a container like this with some

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.740 
them in a container like this with some
water<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.220> base<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.760> wait<00:02:48.390> till<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
water in the base and wait till the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.810 
water in the base and wait till the
water<00:02:48.900> glistens<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.190> see<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
water glistens up and you see it on the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.570 
water glistens up and you see it on the
top<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.210> mix<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:52.110> drain<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:54.140> or

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
top of the mix and then drain it or

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.490 
top of the mix and then drain it or
water<00:02:56.580> with<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> soft<00:02:57.360> gentle<00:02:57.690> mist<00:02:57.990> sprayer

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
water with a soft gentle mist sprayer

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.700 
water with a soft gentle mist sprayer
like<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:59.960> because<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.050> don't<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> top

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
like this because you don't want the top

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.970 
like this because you don't want the top
to<00:03:01.890> dry<00:03:02.160> out<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> prevent<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.350> either

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
to dry out so to prevent that either

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.310 
to dry out so to prevent that either
cover<00:03:05.400> with<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> bit<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:05.940> plastic<00:03:06.180> wrap<00:03:09.020> or<00:03:10.020> put

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
cover with a bit of plastic wrap or put

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.110 
cover with a bit of plastic wrap or put
your<00:03:10.500> seed<00:03:10.710> tray<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.640> these<00:03:11.760> Yates

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
your seed tray into one of these Yates

your seed tray into one of these Yates
mini<00:03:12.420> greenhouses<00:03:13.610> these<00:03:14.610> are<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:15.120> clever

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
mini greenhouses these are really clever

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.110 
mini greenhouses these are really clever
because<00:03:16.290> they've<00:03:16.530> got<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.860> air<00:03:17.010> vents<00:03:17.490> on<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
because they've got the air vents on the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.900 
because they've got the air vents on the
top<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.690> on<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.110> sides<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.550> you'll<00:03:20.730> see

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
top and on the sides so as you'll see

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.660 
top and on the sides so as you'll see
things<00:03:21.060> grow<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:22.350> can<00:03:22.500> move<00:03:22.740> these<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.370> give

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
things grow you can move these and give

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.050 
things grow you can move these and give
them<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.940> little<00:03:24.150> bit<00:03:24.270> more<00:03:24.480> air<00:03:25.520> then<00:03:26.520> when

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
them a little bit more air then when

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.530 
them a little bit more air then when
they're<00:03:27.270> big<00:03:27.450> enough<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:28.590> take<00:03:28.860> them<00:03:29.100> out

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
they're big enough you take them out

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.120 
they're big enough you take them out
separate<00:03:30.540> them<00:03:30.780> out<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.290> either<00:03:31.740> put<00:03:31.890> them

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
separate them out and either put them

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.330 
separate them out and either put them
into<00:03:32.280> bigger<00:03:32.580> pots<00:03:32.850> or<00:03:33.150> out<00:03:33.330> into<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.930> garden

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
into bigger pots or out into the garden

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.120 
into bigger pots or out into the garden
so<00:03:35.340> there<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.910> have<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.770> flowers<00:03:37.770> there<00:03:38.100> are

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
so there you have it flowers there are

so there you have it flowers there are
some<00:03:38.490> for<00:03:38.700> every<00:03:39.150> time<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> year<00:03:39.930> there

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
some for every time of the year there

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.110 
some for every time of the year there
are<00:03:40.590> some<00:03:40.800> for<00:03:40.980> all<00:03:41.190> sorts<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.670> containers

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
there are some for different positions

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.090
