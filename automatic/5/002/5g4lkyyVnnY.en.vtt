00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
as well basically it's a European for

as well basically it's a European for
gaming<00:01:10.790> I'll<00:01:10.880> believe<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:12.380> object<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:13.009> to<00:01:13.310> lay

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
gaming I'll believe the object is to lay

as<00:01:14.270> many<00:01:14.300> tracks<00:01:15.110> as<00:01:15.289> possible<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.270> connect

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
as many tracks as possible and connect

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.520
