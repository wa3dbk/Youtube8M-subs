hi everyone this is Brent previously
I've<00:00:34.520> recommended<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.180> GoPro<00:00:35.630> floaty

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
I've recommended the GoPro floaty

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.370 
I've recommended the GoPro floaty
backdoor<00:00:36.320> as<00:00:36.920> being<00:00:37.760> an<00:00:38.000> absolute<00:00:38.690> must<00:00:39.110> if

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
backdoor as being an absolute must if

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.450 
backdoor as being an absolute must if
you're<00:00:39.530> going<00:00:39.650> to<00:00:39.740> use<00:00:39.860> your<00:00:40.010> GoPro<00:00:40.430> camera

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
windsurfing any of those activities if

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.840 
windsurfing any of those activities if
you<00:00:48.050> drop<00:00:48.290> your<00:00:48.320> GoPro<00:00:48.860> camera<00:00:48.890> over<00:00:49.640> deep

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
you drop your GoPro camera over deep

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.819 
you drop your GoPro camera over deep
water<00:00:50.150> you're<00:00:50.690> probably<00:00:50.960> never<00:00:51.320> going<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.620> see

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
water you're probably never going to see

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:52.420 
water you're probably never going to see
it<00:00:51.860> again

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
it again

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.460 
it again
the<00:00:53.120> only<00:00:53.270> drawback<00:00:53.570> with<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.230> floaty

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
the only drawback with the floaty

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.700 
the only drawback with the floaty
backdoor<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:55.700> that<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.600> only<00:00:56.780> floats<00:00:57.260> up<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.530> a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
backdoor is that it only floats up to a

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.400 
backdoor is that it only floats up to a
certain<00:00:58.070> weight<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.450> today<00:01:00.079> I'm<00:01:00.170> going<00:01:00.320> to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
certain weight so today I'm going to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.950 
certain weight so today I'm going to
test<00:01:00.680> in<00:01:00.920> this<00:01:01.040> water<00:01:01.309> bowl<00:01:01.579> to<00:01:02.239> see<00:01:02.480> which<00:01:02.930> of

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
test in this water bowl to see which of

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.010 
test in this water bowl to see which of
the<00:01:03.320> basic<00:01:03.860> GoPro<00:01:04.430> mounts<00:01:04.939> will<00:01:05.420> float<00:01:05.780> with

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
the basic GoPro mounts will float with

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.700 
the basic GoPro mounts will float with
my<00:01:06.200> GoPro<00:01:06.439> hero3<00:01:08.109> will<00:01:09.109> test<00:01:09.409> from<00:01:09.649> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
my GoPro hero3 will test from the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.779 
my GoPro hero3 will test from the
lightest<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.999> heaviest<00:01:12.069> first<00:01:13.069> the

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
lightest to the heaviest first the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.740 
lightest to the heaviest first the
handlebar<00:01:14.299> seatpost<00:01:14.630> mouth

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.870 

the<00:01:19.290> vented<00:01:19.650> helmet<00:01:20.100> strap

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.410 

so<00:03:26.829> there<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.159> have<00:03:27.189> it<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.879> floaty<00:03:28.180> backdoor

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
so there you have it the floaty backdoor

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.470 
so there you have it the floaty backdoor
will<00:03:29.049> float<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.590> handlebar<00:03:30.579> seatpost<00:03:30.879> mount

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
will float the handlebar seatpost mount

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.110 
will float the handlebar seatpost mount
the<00:03:32.290> vented<00:03:32.620> helmet<00:03:32.950> strap<00:03:33.219> and<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.939> head

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
chesty are just a little bit too heavy

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.069 
chesty are just a little bit too heavy
so<00:03:39.879> if<00:03:39.939> you're<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.269> use<00:03:40.420> those<00:03:40.689> over

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
so if you're going to use those over

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.539 
so if you're going to use those over
water<00:03:41.319> you're<00:03:41.889> gonna<00:03:41.980> have<00:03:42.159> to<00:03:42.280> be<00:03:42.400> extra
