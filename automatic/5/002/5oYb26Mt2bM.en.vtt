00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello I always get the please 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.859
 by e-mail 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
 michaela also tells me again about 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.580
 the minimum durability date of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.980
 cosmetic articles 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.410
 For one thing, there is a very great about it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.510
 nice tv show on sat1 gold with 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.420
 Martina and me when he is on mine 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.630
 homepage goes www make up coach punkt de 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.369
 then click on the shop you come on 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.939
 my designed shop at first 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.740
 page 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.939
 and if you are so very little bit round 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.329
 the cross depending on how big the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.640
 screen is then sat 1 gold and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.550
 radio and when you open sat 1 gold 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.440
 you can check the whole twelve links on the left 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.030
 to the individual television broadcasts and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.149
 somewhere is also a link there 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.710
 something about the date of the best before date 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.570
 in cosmetic articles 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.039
 and there it is within ten or twelve 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.789
 Everything was very nice again 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.680
 described 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.570
 what it is about but I also want to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.410
 this way again about it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 to report 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.280
 The legislator demands from manufacturers 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.650
 cosmetic articles that on the little bit 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.830
 boxes or outer packaging 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.900
 the best before date is displayed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.080
 it's pott with this open cream 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.330
 and then there is the number of months 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.960
 the months that the product will last 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.409
 should 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 beautiful and good I can see everything 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.770
 that must be something but I do not see 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.470
 Why this nail polish is there? 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.189
 on it memorial 18 months it is indeed 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.500
 I should be disposed of 18 months 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.960
 then dispose of my nail polish if he does 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 forgive that can if he confessed then 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.899
 has in the sun or too warm before 18 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.210
 months but I have ' nagellacke 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.829
 this also significantly older and why 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.399
 you should have such a product then 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.079
 actually dispose of where would have been in there 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.689
 like in a lipstick, for example 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.939
 is it perfectly okay if there is one 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.530
 best before date draufsteht 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.000
 Besides, it's also confusing 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.219
 the buyer band does not know how 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.829
 long actually the product already in the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.320
 located and meant 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.569
 of course from the day you open it 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.209
 and then the product with oxygen 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.540
 has been connected 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.969
 differently 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.870
 Products have different months 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.090
 information 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.760
 wherein the sometimes complete as rubbish 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.620
 for example, here at the eyeshadow stands 18 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.150
 months to see time on it 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.430
 that 's why I also have the glasses on the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.950
 head yes it 's 18 months on it 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.230
 so I own eyeshadow 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.629
 at least 18 years old no he 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.150
 even older we are here for example 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:39.269
 beautiful range of dior da 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.739
 are totally great matte bright colors on it 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.870
 and here these moonlights are called 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.159
 they are so shimmering shimmering that 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.170
 the first ones were doing this 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.840
 this direction was still there 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.819
 good and he is still tough 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.769
 and apply well on the eye 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.230
 for me is a cosmetic product 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.510
 then not good if that under the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.609
 nose no longer smells good so this one 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.060
 eyeshadow report as normal 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.310
 Eyeshadow is definitely over 20 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.340
 years old after 18 months too 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.379
 Disposing would be a sin because 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.290
 it all cost a lot of money so 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.810
 please do every product with his nose 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.220
 test it as a look on the back or 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.109
 I already have one and a half 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.000
 years now I have to throw that away 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:29.639
 this is recognizable at least 50 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.579
 years old that is from the 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.290
 Hairdressing of my parents 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.239
 that was used at that time around so 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.549
 silver and golden streaks in the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.169
 to blow hair but gold dust 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.629
 and silver dust in it so too 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:46.139
 still my silver which with the nose 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.299
 Everything is wonderful, I need it 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.859
 not to be disposed of because I think so 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.479
 but now has to be bad then 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.019
 everywhere where fatters get a little rancid 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.760
 can 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.010
 there says the nose then works well 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.720
 Lipsticks no longer report well 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.609
 mascara can do that too fast 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.799
 that one says the stink this time away 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.120
 or so concealer pens with one 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.799
 small brush on the front 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.989
 they'll stink, too 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.699
 Please decide with the nose and not 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.250
 necessarily with the date on the back 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.409
 is who makes it very exemplary 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.629
 for example the company delicacy because 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:19.320
 they even have that on their products 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.060
 date from then if they say well then 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.919
 I should always control that but 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.389
 for example here is foot pilling me 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.040
 Do not believe that after the expiry of the 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.230
 datums 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.270
 then it should be broken and if so how 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.860
 said then it will smell funny and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.350
 then you can not use that anyway 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.760
 so please do not stiffen what 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.250
 is there on the back but her 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.290
 controlled with the nose and with yours 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.630
 common sense whether that is 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.820
 can still take product or not 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.220
 who is very sensitive to it and 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.800
 says no, that's all so dangerous 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.860
 can do that but it is complete 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.690
 superfluous actually after 18 months 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.790
 to throw away an eyeshadow differently 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.680
 does it look if someone is an acute one 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.500
 fascia inflamed conjunctivitis 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.850
 had and is always funny with that 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.740
 Brush back and forth between 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.840
 eye and eyeshadow then I would 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.900
 in fact I'm considering this one 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.580
 then maybe dispose of paint 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.590
 you can exchange that for example 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.820
 on my pallets you can see the colors 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.160
 remove all individually 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.010
 So that was a thing to think about 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.470
 but in the normal case is easy 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.670
 then replace it if you think so 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.320
 does not smell good anymore 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.150
 and that will also be the case with eyeshadow 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.340
 be beyond 20 years 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.440
 as I said nail polish dries at some point 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.350
 One of you only takes care of lipstick 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.180
 mascara and concealer products that way 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.770
 a small pinselt who can 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.220
 stink ever and then they come in 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.090
 the garbage 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.090
 See you
