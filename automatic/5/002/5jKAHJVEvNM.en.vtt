start jiggling it and what I'm doing is
I'm<00:00:30.960> sending<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> shock<00:00:31.679> down<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> line<00:00:32.430> make

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
I'm sending a shock down the line make

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.020 
I'm sending a shock down the line make
that<00:00:33.239> cross<00:00:33.540> tail<00:00:33.870> bounce<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.340> softness<00:00:35.850> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
that cross tail bounce the softness of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
that cross tail bounce the softness of
this<00:00:36.180> bait<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.809> comes<00:00:37.079> into<00:00:37.260> play<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
this bait really comes into play and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
this bait really comes into play and
also<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> softness<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> rod<00:00:39.059> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
also the softness of the rod that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
also the softness of the rod that
softens<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> rod<00:00:40.410> allows<00:00:40.739> me<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.399> jiggle

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
softens in the rod allows me to jiggle

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.240 
softens in the rod allows me to jiggle
it<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.510> bait<00:00:42.840> isn't<00:00:43.469> coming<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.920> off<00:00:44.100> the

to be I don't know if we moved off the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.479 
to be I don't know if we moved off the
edge<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.469> bit<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.219> give<00:01:02.370> me<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
edge a little bit or what but give me a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.880 
edge a little bit or what but give me a
sec<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:05.119> can<00:01:06.119> see<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.540> edge<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.840> much<00:01:07.590> more

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
sec I can see this edge so much more

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 
sec I can see this edge so much more
clear<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.520> finder<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:09.860> just

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
clear on my finder right now just

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.020 
clear on my finder right now just
because<00:01:11.010> there's<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.310> bit<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> chop<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
because there's a little bit of chop on

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.370 
because there's a little bit of chop on
the<00:01:12.119> water<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> reset

side yeah I can fish on this edge I'm
set<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.189> rocks<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.820> edge

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
set up right on this rocks and edge

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
set up right on this rocks and edge
fishings<00:01:25.049> all<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.200> edges<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
fishings all about edges and on the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.350 
fishings all about edges and on the
Great<00:01:26.430> Lakes<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> water<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.210> crystal

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
Great Lakes here the water is crystal

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
Great Lakes here the water is crystal
clear<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:28.770> easier<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> visualize<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
clear so much easier to visualize that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
clear so much easier to visualize that
edge<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.780> small<00:01:31.110> most<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> spring

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
edge and these small most in the spring

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
edge and these small most in the spring
are<00:01:32.280> crawling<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.630> down<00:01:36.049> there<00:01:37.049> really

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
are crawling up and down there really

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.450 
are crawling up and down there really
crawling<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> shells<00:01:38.100> everywhere

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
crawling all of the shells everywhere

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
crawling all of the shells everywhere
but<00:01:38.700> they're<00:01:38.810> relating<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.049> edges

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
but they're relating to these edges

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.999 
but they're relating to these edges
between<00:01:40.680> rock<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.070> sand<00:01:42.049> there's<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
between rock and sand there's one you

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
between rock and sand there's one you
can<00:01:44.159> see<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> flicked<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.000> there<00:01:45.270> onto<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
can see I flicked it out there onto that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.679 
can see I flicked it out there onto that
edge<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.220> textbook<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.210> drop

pounds you can see that drop shot minnow

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.340 
pounds you can see that drop shot minnow
way<00:02:22.280> down<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.880> mouth<00:02:23.060> there<00:02:23.360> that's<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:24.200> is

a<00:02:24.380> jackal<00:02:24.950> cross<00:02:25.580> tail<00:02:25.910> shad<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.250> often

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
a jackal cross tail shad and we often

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.850 
a jackal cross tail shad and we often
don't<00:02:29.000> use<00:02:29.150> jackal<00:02:30.140> cross<00:02:30.350> tails<00:02:30.620> while<00:02:30.740> we're

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
don't use jackal cross tails while we're

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.620 
don't use jackal cross tails while we're
pre-fishing<00:02:31.220> because<00:02:31.580> they<00:02:32.090> are<00:02:32.240> expensive

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
pre-fishing because they are expensive

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.050 
pre-fishing because they are expensive
but<00:02:33.200> they<00:02:33.350> are<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.890> most<00:02:33.920> effective<00:02:34.820> drop

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
but they are the most effective drop

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.490 
but they are the most effective drop
shot<00:02:35.270> baits<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.810> can<00:02:35.990> substitute<00:02:36.230> that

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
shot baits so you can substitute that

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.660 
shot baits so you can substitute that
with<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> power<00:02:36.920> minnow<00:02:37.130> or<00:02:37.220> something<00:02:37.580> like

smallmouth but it doesn't need to be
