00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.550
 little implicated mix thoroughly with 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 form laminate I will do 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.670
 fifty meters long because 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.619
 last time to me 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.619
 heat me 1 sacrificial tissue on 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.619
 half a meter I take three and a half meters 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.760
 cut in half it turns out clearly on 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.809
 the length of the form this time when cut 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 already in half I realized that I was three with 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 half and three meters well in principle for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.699
 short bows that mean enough 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:02.570
 then I use this spatula 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 notched trowel, and I can distribute 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.580
 he means a notched trowel he shares 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.810
 this one this one 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.460
 let's say so a lot of birthmark on the strands and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.710
 strands already soaked much easier 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 than for example we would use a spatula 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.600
 flat flat it should be obtained resin in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.390
 dargah when yes yes and here for example 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.850
 plays deeper already in these cells 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.299
 formed by hours of happiness a little bit 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.079
 spatula walk and such here are formed 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:44.780
 such here are grooves where already penetrated 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:47.490
 uralets well this impregnation procedure on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.000
 black market basically if someone 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.460
 starts something better first 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.590
 practice transparent on 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.799
 clear laminate 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.350
 with the addition of pigment, I just know 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.119
 How much does this process take? 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.679
 time, so then somewhere year 5 5 7 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.259
 minutes from this pierced 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.940
 it is with a warm form in a cold form 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.860
 it will be much longer 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.860
 for uniform quality impregnation 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.660
 try roving nowhere not move from 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.590
 side to side how we wound it 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.269
 so it should so we have to lie and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.280
 form because it can happen 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.099
 we push it strongly to one side of 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.450
 us laminate work on one side 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:52.220
 for example, but 9 and on the other hand we 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:55.819
 steel 07 then it will not be very good 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.000
 such laminate can be used 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:04.480
 just on the pad so the whole process 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.579
 our impregnation itself is almost finished 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.459
 on what we do next 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:19.160
 manipulation in the process of such 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:22.450
 we can have impregnations with roving 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.459
 which is directly in 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.620
 cellophane and bottom 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.150
 he may not be soaked 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.540
 for this, I take here such things with 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.139
 wire grip wire hardened 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:47.450
 quite so elastic and take 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:51.849
 building dryer building dryer i 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.849
 looking for some cellophane and rolls 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.299
 turn on the hair dryer is not much warmed up 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.519
 we cellophane not wrinkled 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.000
 we kind of squeeze roving with small 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.069
 which we have 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.400
 flows down and falls between primarily on 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:22.470
 on our future you suspect there 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.970
 tar unload 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.940
 this time 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.940
 occurs more qualitatively 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:52.030
 everything 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:54.840
 it is enough to remove the next stage 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.840
 superfluous again
