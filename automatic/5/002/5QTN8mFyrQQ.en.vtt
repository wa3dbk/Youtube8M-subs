00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
here I was a little afraid there when I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.580 
here I was a little afraid there when I
saw<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.539> looked<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.560 
saw what it looked like I was like this
is<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.770> meet<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.460> bread<00:00:53.850> sauce<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> pretty

good<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
good on here I think it's kind of a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.459 
good on here I think it's kind of a
sweeter<00:00:55.890> sauce<00:00:56.129> mm-hmm<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> bacon<00:00:58.289> gives

sweeter sauce mm-hmm and the bacon gives

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.189 
sweeter sauce mm-hmm and the bacon gives
it<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:59.090> saltier<00:01:00.090> flavor<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.660> seems
