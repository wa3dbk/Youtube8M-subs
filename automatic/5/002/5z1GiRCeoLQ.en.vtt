00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.360
 Hello dear table tennis friends I am 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:14.370
 it again like it and today i test 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.370
 for you the avaloq 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
 relatively soft sponge 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.320
 Let's see what the puro can do 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.990
 hello love table tennis friends it's me 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.580
 sylvie again and I have just that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.470
 blogs puro flooring tested i have on 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.539
 the present and back with him 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.760
 played 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.500
 Unfortunately I found him for the forehand 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.160
 a bit too slow 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.570
 he lives from the control in the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.450
 Backhand on the backhand side was that 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.530
 rather so that you are very good and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.760
 could block controlled and thereby 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.850
 Of course, the ball is also very good 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.320
 That's why I think I can distribute 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.800
 very much for them on the backhand page 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.330
 beneficial for those too 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.930
 advanced player on the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.230
 At the end I would the pyro he 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.360
 gamblers recommend no to 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.480
 Fast covering should also play 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.390
 not too slow anymore the puro is exactly 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.190
 in the middle and so should the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.190
 test thank you
