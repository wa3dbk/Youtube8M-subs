this is the microphone zoom in zoom out

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.710 
this is the microphone zoom in zoom out
the<00:04:02.000> picture<00:04:04.130> button<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.269> where<00:04:06.450> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
the picture button this is where the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.559 
the picture button this is where the
battery<00:04:07.680> will<00:04:07.799> go<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.730> much<00:04:08.910> we're<00:04:09.120> gonna<00:04:09.329> pull

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
battery will go so much we're gonna pull

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.440 
battery will go so much we're gonna pull
a<00:04:09.600> bit<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.190> not<00:04:11.190> sure<00:04:11.340> if<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.609> has<00:04:11.790> any<00:04:12.000> power<00:04:12.359> or

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
a bit in not sure if it has any power or

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:20.599 
a bit in not sure if it has any power or
not

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:28.950 

I<00:04:21.609> guess<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.349> side<00:04:26.680> we<00:04:27.009> have<00:04:27.840> one<00:04:28.840> of

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
I guess on this side we have one of

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.909 
I guess on this side we have one of
these<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:31.479> this<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.810> ready<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.080> charge<00:04:32.500> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
these so this is ready to charge the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.390 
these so this is ready to charge the
camera<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.639> believe<00:04:34.060> that's<00:04:34.949> what<00:04:35.949> the<00:04:36.039> cable

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
camera I believe that's what the cable

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.999 
camera I believe that's what the cable
type<00:04:36.580> seen<00:04:36.909> earlier<00:04:37.270> it's<00:04:37.539> for<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.440> one<00:04:38.680> it's

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
type seen earlier it's for this one it's

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.909 
type seen earlier it's for this one it's
for<00:04:39.310> actually<00:04:39.669> charging<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.479> camera<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.229> could

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919
