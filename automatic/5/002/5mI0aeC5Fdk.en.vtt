I'm gonna do what themes like a lot more
than<00:00:29.710> necessary<00:00:30.250> but<00:00:30.640> when<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.270> have<00:00:31.360> curly

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
than necessary but when you have curly

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.930 
than necessary but when you have curly
hair<00:00:31.750> it<00:00:32.140> tends<00:00:32.380> to<00:00:32.500> drive<00:00:32.890> back<00:00:33.130> dry<00:00:33.700> out

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
hair it tends to drive back dry out

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.820 
hair it tends to drive back dry out
faster<00:00:34.390> so<00:00:34.600> I<00:00:34.630> don't<00:00:34.930> want<00:00:35.080> it<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.200> look<00:00:35.290> frizzy

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
faster so I don't want it to look frizzy

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.490 
faster so I don't want it to look frizzy
and<00:00:36.820> I<00:00:37.180> need<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.480> do<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.600> brush<00:00:37.989> there<00:00:38.230> easily

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
and I need to do a brush there easily

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.490 
and I need to do a brush there easily
because<00:00:39.040> curls<00:00:39.460> can<00:00:39.730> get<00:00:39.970> very<00:00:40.330> tailing<00:00:40.870> so

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
because curls can get very tailing so

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.350 
because curls can get very tailing so
using<00:00:41.830> a<00:00:41.920> wide<00:00:42.129> tooth<00:00:42.160> comb<00:00:42.430> is<00:00:42.820> going<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.150> help

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
using a wide tooth comb is going to help

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.670 
using a wide tooth comb is going to help
me<00:00:43.449> get<00:00:43.600> through<00:00:43.780> them<00:00:43.960> easily<00:00:44.140> without

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
me get through them easily without

00:00:44.680 --> 00:01:27.450

breaking<00:00:45.309> my<00:00:45.340> hair

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.290 

now<00:01:28.460> I'm<00:01:28.580> going<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.790> be<00:01:28.850> putting<00:01:29.060> the
