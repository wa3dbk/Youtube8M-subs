00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
anyone else has heard about but at $70

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.560 
anyone else has heard about but at $70
it's<00:00:37.980> definitely<00:00:38.430> half<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> price<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it's definitely half the price and you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920 
it's definitely half the price and you
get<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:39.989> more<00:00:40.910> can't<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.120> say<00:00:42.270> how<00:00:42.390> huge

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
get some more can't really say how huge

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.520 
get some more can't really say how huge
this<00:00:43.170> box<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.190> basically<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.239> huge<00:00:45.660> 17

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
this box is but basically it's huge 17

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.139 
this box is but basically it's huge 17
by<00:00:46.770> 17<00:00:47.399> by<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:47.969> 7<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> actually<00:00:50.610> did

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
by 17 by about 7 so what I actually did

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.139 
by 17 by about 7 so what I actually did
was<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.930> bring<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.530> another<00:00:53.219> familiar<00:00:53.489> model

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
was to bring in another familiar model

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.709 
was to bring in another familiar model
kit<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.039> show<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> imagine<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
kit and show you that so I imagine you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.590 
kit and show you that so I imagine you
probably<00:00:57.780> recognize<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.640> 350

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
probably recognize this one the 350

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.280 
probably recognize this one the 350
Enterprise<00:01:01.559> from<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.520> from<00:01:02.550> polar<00:01:02.910> lights

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
Enterprise from also from polar lights

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.600 
Enterprise from also from polar lights
so<00:01:05.090> they're<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> same<00:01:06.450> exact<00:01:06.869> size<00:01:07.110> 17<00:01:07.830> by<00:01:08.010> 17

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so they're the same exact size 17 by 17

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.090 
so they're the same exact size 17 by 17
but<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.600> one's<00:01:09.840> probably<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.650> quarter

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
but this one's probably just a quarter

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.240 
but this one's probably just a quarter
deeper<00:01:11.790> than<00:01:12.110> all<00:01:13.110> enterprise<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
deeper than all enterprise and if you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520 
deeper than all enterprise and if you
know<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.460> big<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.880> kit<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.840> you'll

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
know how big this kit is then you'll

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.230 
know how big this kit is then you'll
begin<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:17.340> an<00:01:17.430> idea<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.030> much<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
begin to get an idea of how much a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.670 
begin to get an idea of how much a
monster<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> c57<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.689> also<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.500> some

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
monster the c57 is also when I get some

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.060 
monster the c57 is also when I get some
plastic<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.310> I'll<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> preliminary<00:01:25.500> tape

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
plastic out I'll do a preliminary tape

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.090 
plastic out I'll do a preliminary tape
together<00:01:26.340> drive<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.619> take<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.009> how

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
together drive it and take a look at how

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.249 
together drive it and take a look at how
big<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.520> saucer<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.990> supposed

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
big this saucer is because it's supposed

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
big this saucer is because it's supposed
to<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.500> two<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> quarter<00:01:32.400> feet<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.119> don't

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to be two and a quarter feet I don't

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.120 
to be two and a quarter feet I don't
really<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.350> where<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> put<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
really know where I'm going to put this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
really know where I'm going to put this
model<00:01:35.549> yet<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.119> I'll<00:01:36.689> certainly<00:01:37.020> find<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
model yet but I'll certainly find a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.880 
model yet but I'll certainly find a
place<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
place for it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.300 
place for it
so<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.610> don't<00:01:40.850> see<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.080> signature<00:01:42.080> on<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.500> cover

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so I don't see a signature on this cover

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.150 
so I don't see a signature on this cover
painting<00:01:43.610> here<00:01:44.230> at<00:01:45.230> least<00:01:45.410> I<00:01:45.560> don't<00:01:45.650> think<00:01:45.830> I

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
painting here at least I don't think I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.250 
painting here at least I don't think I
do<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.390> definitely<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.840> nice<00:01:47.990> piece<00:01:48.230> of

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
do but it's definitely a nice piece of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.160 
do but it's definitely a nice piece of
artwork<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:49.370> they<00:01:49.970> had<00:01:50.120> to<00:01:50.270> fit<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.660> ED

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
artwork and they had to fit the ED

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.590 
artwork and they had to fit the ED
monster<00:01:51.740> in<00:01:51.860> there<00:01:52.070> somehow<00:01:52.400> so<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.390> know<00:01:53.450> it

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
monster in there somehow so you know it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.570 
monster in there somehow so you know it
certainly<00:01:54.020> works<00:01:56.830> over<00:01:57.830> here<00:01:57.860> on<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.340> sides

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
certainly works over here on the sides

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.650 
certainly works over here on the sides
there<00:01:59.240> basically<00:01:59.660> each<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.320> same<00:02:00.560> artwork

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
there basically each the same artwork

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.450 
there basically each the same artwork
shrunk<00:02:02.660> down<00:02:02.900> this<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> skill<00:02:03.830> level<00:02:04.010> three

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
shrunk down this is a skill level three

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.410 
shrunk down this is a skill level three
age<00:02:04.700> 12<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.300> up<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.200> over<00:02:06.290> on<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.680> back<00:02:06.860> here

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
age 12 and up and over on the back here

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.320 
age 12 and up and over on the back here
we<00:02:08.420> get<00:02:08.570> some<00:02:08.810> photos<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> kid<00:02:09.619> itself<00:02:10.330> now

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
we get some photos of the kid itself now

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.930 
we get some photos of the kid itself now
there<00:02:11.540> are<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:12.140> number<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.800> inaccuracies<00:02:13.070> to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
there are a number of inaccuracies to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.150 
there are a number of inaccuracies to
this<00:02:14.060> model

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
this model

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
exactly correct there were a couple

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.420 
exactly correct there were a couple
different<00:02:30.050> models<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.920> four<00:02:31.160> foot

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
different models of this the four foot

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.460 
different models of this the four foot
and<00:02:32.560> maybe<00:02:33.560> one<00:02:33.860> or<00:02:33.980> two<00:02:34.130> other<00:02:34.310> small<00:02:34.670> ones<00:02:34.910> I

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
and maybe one or two other small ones I

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.060 
and maybe one or two other small ones I
forget<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.650> story<00:02:36.950> at<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:37.310> point<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:38.060> uh

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
forget the story at this point but uh

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.340 
forget the story at this point but uh
the<00:02:40.070> figures<00:02:40.370> look<00:02:40.580> pretty<00:02:40.820> cool<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.350> we'll

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
the figures look pretty cool and we'll

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.680 
the figures look pretty cool and we'll
see<00:02:42.560> how<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.770> building<00:02:43.280> goes<00:02:43.459> these<00:02:43.850> are<00:02:44.000> 172

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
see how the building goes these are 172

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.270 
see how the building goes these are 172
so<00:02:45.790> they're<00:02:46.790> definitely<00:02:47.239> pretty<00:02:47.480> damn<00:02:47.690> small

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
so they're definitely pretty damn small

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.680 
so they're definitely pretty damn small
you<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:49.760> comes<00:02:49.970> with<00:02:50.209> an<00:02:50.360> interior

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
you see that this comes with an interior

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.289 
you see that this comes with an interior
and<00:02:51.230> what<00:02:52.130> I'm<00:02:52.250> pretty<00:02:52.489> sure<00:02:52.700> I'm<00:02:52.880> going<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.090> do

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
and what I'm pretty sure I'm going to do

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.140 
and what I'm pretty sure I'm going to do
is<00:02:53.720> build<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.190> in<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> movies<00:02:55.820> so

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
is build this just like in the movies so

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.840 
is build this just like in the movies so
we'll<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.900> model<00:02:57.230> piece<00:02:57.440> with<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
we'll have a model piece with just the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.729 
we'll have a model piece with just the
next<00:02:59.150> area<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.570> then<00:02:59.989> I'll<00:03:00.320> build<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
next area and then I'll build the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.150 
next area and then I'll build the
interior<00:03:01.580> as<00:03:01.850> its<00:03:02.090> own<00:03:02.299> set<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.530> can<00:03:03.799> do<00:03:03.950> some

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
interior as its own set so I can do some

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.340 
interior as its own set so I can do some
shots<00:03:04.400> around<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.060> hopefully<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.170> would

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
shots around that hopefully and I would

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.800 
shots around that hopefully and I would
also<00:03:06.580> make<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.090> pull<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.600> walls

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
also make it so I can pull the walls

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.590 
also make it so I can pull the walls
apart<00:03:09.310> theoretically<00:03:10.310> still<00:03:11.209> got<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.480> open

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
apart theoretically still got to open

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.140 
apart theoretically still got to open
this<00:03:11.870> thing<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.680> see<00:03:13.040> what's<00:03:13.610> going<00:03:14.030> on

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
this thing up and see what's going on

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.640 
this thing up and see what's going on
here<00:03:14.799> so<00:03:15.799> let's<00:03:16.730> go<00:03:16.940> ahead<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.540> open<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.530> up

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
here so let's go ahead and open it up

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.770 
here so let's go ahead and open it up
here<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.130> we'll<00:03:19.850> see<00:03:20.030> what<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.299> parts<00:03:20.600> look

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
here and we'll see what the parts look

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.910 
here and we'll see what the parts look
like

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.380 

I<00:03:29.050> should<00:03:30.050> probably<00:03:30.140> get<00:03:30.470> like<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:31.390> something

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
I should probably get like a something

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.760 
I should probably get like a something
to<00:03:32.480> stand<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.230> wait<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.650> second<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
to stand on here wait a second so the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.290 
to stand on here wait a second so the
problem<00:03:37.069> with<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> really<00:03:37.520> big<00:03:37.700> models<00:03:37.940> is

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
problem with the really big models is

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.850 
problem with the really big models is
you<00:03:38.450> gotta<00:03:38.630> get<00:03:38.810> really<00:03:39.200> far<00:03:39.440> away<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.739> see

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
you gotta get really far away to see

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.809 
you gotta get really far away to see
what's<00:03:40.220> going<00:03:40.580> on<00:03:40.700> here<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.860> little<00:03:43.580> bit<00:03:43.760> of

with the it'd monsters in there
geez<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:57.950> dome<00:03:58.190> is<00:03:58.430> huge<00:04:04.390> some<00:04:05.390> ramps

geez this dome is huge some ramps

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.610 
geez this dome is huge some ramps
control<00:04:06.230> panels<00:04:06.739> insides<00:04:09.280> all<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.549> figures

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
control panels insides all the figures

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.610 
control panels insides all the figures
more<00:04:12.620> ramps<00:04:13.690> more<00:04:14.690> insides<00:04:15.200> doors<00:04:16.000> chairs

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
more ramps more insides doors chairs

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.840 
more ramps more insides doors chairs
looks<00:04:18.620> like<00:04:18.799> some<00:04:18.979> good<00:04:19.100> detail<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.729> the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
looks like some good detail on the

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.310 
looks like some good detail on the
chairs<00:04:20.120> we'll<00:04:20.630> take<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.870> look<00:04:21.049> at<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.260> a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
chairs we'll take a look at that a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.230 
chairs we'll take a look at that a
little<00:04:21.500> further<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.840> panels<00:04:25.030> looks<00:04:26.030> like

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
little further and the panels looks like

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.900 
little further and the panels looks like
each<00:04:26.450> one<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.840> them<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:27.139> individually<00:04:27.290> wrapped

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.560 

and<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:36.050> directions<00:04:36.440> in<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.980> bottom<00:04:40.390> so<00:04:41.390> the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
and the directions in the bottom so the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.470 
and the directions in the bottom so the
lad<00:04:41.750> is<00:04:41.780> much<00:04:42.290> like<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:43.250> Robby<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.120> Robot

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
lad is much like the Robby the Robot

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.350 
lad is much like the Robby the Robot
model<00:04:44.900> at<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.140> very<00:04:45.350> least<00:04:45.790> and<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:46.940> far<00:04:47.210> as

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
model at the very least and so far as

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.100 
model at the very least and so far as
it's<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.930> condensed<00:04:49.870> folder<00:04:52.840> figures<00:04:53.840> first

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
it's a condensed folder figures first

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.410 
it's a condensed folder figures first
the<00:04:54.740> interior<00:04:55.340> is<00:04:55.550> definitely<00:04:56.090> looking<00:04:56.210> like

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
the interior is definitely looking like

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.220 
the interior is definitely looking like
it's<00:04:56.780> going<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.020> be<00:04:57.230> a<00:04:57.260> monster<00:04:58.040> as<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.730> were

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
it's going to be a monster as it were

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.430 
it's going to be a monster as it were
looking<00:05:00.230> forward<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.650> seeing<00:05:00.980> that<00:05:02.440> however

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
looking forward to seeing that however

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.260 
looking forward to seeing that however
that's<00:05:03.620> not<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:04.040> say<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.430> just<00:05:04.640> putting<00:05:04.880> the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
that's not to say that just putting the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.150 
that's not to say that just putting the
saucer<00:05:06.080> together<00:05:06.380> is<00:05:06.590> not<00:05:06.740> going<00:05:06.950> to<00:05:07.010> be<00:05:07.130> a

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
saucer together is not going to be a

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.330 
saucer together is not going to be a
monster<00:05:07.370> in<00:05:07.760> its<00:05:07.910> own<00:05:08.150> right<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.600> do<00:05:08.890> but<00:05:09.890> it's

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
monster in its own right to do but it's

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.050 
monster in its own right to do but it's
definitely<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.820> nice<00:05:11.000> graphic<00:05:11.540> there<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:12.020> the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
definitely a nice graphic there of the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.400 
definitely a nice graphic there of the
completed<00:05:14.060> interior<00:05:14.600> what<00:05:14.810> that<00:05:14.990> should<00:05:15.260> look

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
completed interior what that should look

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.370 
completed interior what that should look
like<00:05:15.470> if<00:05:15.920> I'm<00:05:16.070> getting<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.430> in<00:05:16.490> frame<00:05:16.850> there<00:05:20.380> so

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
like if I'm getting it in frame there so

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.600 
like if I'm getting it in frame there so
let<00:05:21.980> me<00:05:22.100> unwrap<00:05:22.250> a<00:05:22.490> few<00:05:22.850> samples<00:05:23.360> here<00:05:23.690> and

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
let me unwrap a few samples here and

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.160 
let me unwrap a few samples here and
I'll<00:05:25.610> catch<00:05:25.790> up<00:05:26.030> with<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.300> in<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.510> second<00:05:29.170> all

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
I'll catch up with you in a second all

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.570 
I'll catch up with you in a second all
right<00:05:30.320> so<00:05:30.530> as<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.710> can<00:05:30.890> see<00:05:30.950> there's<00:05:31.310> a<00:05:31.430> fair

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
right so as you can see there's a fair

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.700 
right so as you can see there's a fair
amount<00:05:31.880> of<00:05:32.000> pieces<00:05:32.390> but<00:05:32.660> not<00:05:32.900> nearly<00:05:33.230> as<00:05:33.470> many

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
amount of pieces but not nearly as many

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.480 
amount of pieces but not nearly as many
as<00:05:33.890> I<00:05:34.010> had<00:05:34.400> initially<00:05:35.000> anticipated<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.860> upper

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
as I had initially anticipated the upper

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.430 
as I had initially anticipated the upper
left<00:05:37.760> there<00:05:37.970> it's<00:05:38.180> three<00:05:38.600> trees<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.230> same

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
left there it's three trees of the same

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.220 
left there it's three trees of the same
thing<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:40.100> single<00:05:41.000> bag<00:05:41.300> of<00:05:41.540> figures<00:05:41.840> which<00:05:42.080> I

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
thing a single bag of figures which I

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.830 
thing a single bag of figures which I
won't<00:05:42.410> be<00:05:42.560> pulling<00:05:42.800> out<00:05:43.100> of<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.790> bag<00:05:44.240> because

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
won't be pulling out of the bag because

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.420 
won't be pulling out of the bag because
I<00:05:45.140> may<00:05:45.380> as<00:05:45.470> well<00:05:45.530> just<00:05:45.800> keep<00:05:46.010> them<00:05:46.190> sealed

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
I may as well just keep them sealed

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.970 
I may as well just keep them sealed
until<00:05:46.880> they're<00:05:47.030> ready<00:05:47.440> some<00:05:48.440> clear<00:05:48.680> plastic

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
until they're ready some clear plastic

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.780 
until they're ready some clear plastic
over<00:05:49.610> in<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.940> top<00:05:50.810> right<00:05:51.140> ish<00:05:51.320> they're<00:05:51.790> two

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
over in the top right ish they're two

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.840 
over in the top right ish they're two
huge<00:05:53.240> plastic<00:05:53.960> domes<00:05:54.200> that<00:05:54.410> look<00:05:54.620> awesome

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
huge plastic domes that look awesome

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.910 
huge plastic domes that look awesome
then<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:56.090> interior<00:05:56.420> is<00:05:56.840> done<00:05:57.110> in<00:05:57.290> those<00:05:57.440> three

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
then the interior is done in those three

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.910 
then the interior is done in those three
shells<00:05:58.580> right<00:05:58.940> there<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.450> ceiling<00:05:59.930> walls<00:06:00.440> and

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
shells right there the ceiling walls and

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.200 
shells right there the ceiling walls and
Bay<00:06:02.320> there's<00:06:03.320> the<00:06:03.710> central<00:06:04.040> landing<00:06:04.490> pod<00:06:04.730> and

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
Bay there's the central landing pod and

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.820 
Bay there's the central landing pod and
then<00:06:05.420> two<00:06:06.140> other<00:06:06.350> unique<00:06:06.890> sprue<00:06:08.830> mostly

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
then two other unique sprue mostly

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.410 
then two other unique sprue mostly
interiors<00:06:10.370> it<00:06:10.640> looks<00:06:10.820> like<00:06:11.030> with<00:06:11.240> one

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
interiors it looks like with one

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.240 
interiors it looks like with one
stairway<00:06:11.990> but<00:06:12.230> I<00:06:12.260> think<00:06:12.530> I<00:06:12.620> really<00:06:12.860> need<00:06:13.040> two

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
stairway but I think I really need two

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.940 
stairway but I think I really need two
stairways<00:06:14.020> get<00:06:15.020> to<00:06:15.140> that<00:06:15.290> later<00:06:15.560> on<00:06:15.680> the

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
stairways get to that later on the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.940 
stairways get to that later on the
accuracy<00:06:16.280> issue<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:18.110> then<00:06:18.200> the<00:06:18.410> pie<00:06:18.620> slices

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
accuracy issue and then the pie slices

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.670 
accuracy issue and then the pie slices
here<00:06:19.370> there's<00:06:19.640> six<00:06:19.970> of<00:06:20.180> each<00:06:20.390> six<00:06:21.170> of<00:06:21.410> the

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
here there's six of each six of the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.430 
here there's six of each six of the
lower<00:06:22.460> bottom<00:06:22.910> one<00:06:23.090> there<00:06:23.330> is<00:06:23.600> the<00:06:23.840> underside

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
lower bottom one there is the underside

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.680 
lower bottom one there is the underside
and<00:06:24.800> then<00:06:24.920> six<00:06:25.340> of<00:06:25.640> the<00:06:25.790> upper<00:06:26.090> one<00:06:26.300> there<00:06:26.540> in

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
and then six of the upper one there in

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.760 
and then six of the upper one there in
the<00:06:26.810> left<00:06:26.990> which<00:06:27.320> is<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.830> upper<00:06:28.220> side<00:06:28.630> so

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
the left which is the upper side so

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.680 
the left which is the upper side so
let's<00:06:30.770> get<00:06:30.980> down<00:06:31.280> and<00:06:31.580> take<00:06:31.640> a<00:06:31.850> closer<00:06:32.240> look<00:06:32.420> at

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
let's get down and take a closer look at

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.190 
let's get down and take a closer look at
all<00:06:32.810> this

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.020 

all<00:06:35.890> right<00:06:36.010> so<00:06:36.220> there's<00:06:36.430> so<00:06:36.610> much<00:06:36.730> here<00:06:37.000> that

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
all right so there's so much here that

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.420 
all right so there's so much here that
I'm<00:06:37.480> going<00:06:37.630> to<00:06:37.660> pull<00:06:38.140> stuff<00:06:38.410> off<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.860> table<00:06:39.040> as

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
I'm going to pull stuff off the table as

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.690 
I'm going to pull stuff off the table as
I<00:06:39.460> go<00:06:39.730> and<00:06:39.970> talk<00:06:40.180> about<00:06:40.390> it<00:06:40.690> real<00:06:40.840> quick<00:06:41.700> it

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
I go and talk about it real quick it

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.790 
I go and talk about it real quick it
monster<00:06:43.300> it's<00:06:43.480> pretty<00:06:44.110> cool<00:06:44.320> and<00:06:44.560> interesting

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
monster it's pretty cool and interesting

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.840 
monster it's pretty cool and interesting
effort<00:06:46.500> one<00:06:47.500> thing<00:06:47.710> I'm<00:06:47.860> pretty<00:06:48.280> sure<00:06:48.520> about

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
effort one thing I'm pretty sure about

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.780 
effort one thing I'm pretty sure about
is<00:06:49.120> that<00:06:49.390> the<00:06:49.570> legs<00:06:49.810> are<00:06:50.340> should<00:06:51.340> kick<00:06:51.580> back

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
is that the legs are should kick back

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.210 
is that the legs are should kick back
maybe<00:06:52.150> they<00:06:53.140> kind<00:06:53.290> of<00:06:53.410> go<00:06:53.530> forward<00:06:53.830> and<00:06:54.130> then

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
maybe they kind of go forward and then

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.010 
maybe they kind of go forward and then
the<00:06:54.520> feet<00:06:54.730> at<00:06:54.850> the<00:06:54.940> bottom<00:06:55.270> I<00:06:55.360> guess<00:06:55.570> but<00:06:55.810> this

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
the feet at the bottom I guess but this

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.600 
the feet at the bottom I guess but this
area<00:06:56.230> in<00:06:56.470> here<00:06:56.530> and<00:06:56.830> over<00:06:57.130> here

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
area in here and over here

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.970 
area in here and over here
pretty<00:06:58.420> sure<00:06:58.630> should<00:06:58.960> be<00:06:59.140> hollow<00:06:59.380> going<00:06:59.800> all

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
pretty sure should be hollow going all

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.500 
pretty sure should be hollow going all
the<00:07:00.100> way<00:07:00.130> back<00:07:00.250> because<00:07:00.730> the<00:07:00.970> creature<00:07:01.240> was

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
the way back because the creature was

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.400 
the way back because the creature was
shaped<00:07:01.780> more<00:07:02.140> like<00:07:02.650> an<00:07:03.490> egg<00:07:03.640> there<00:07:03.910> I<00:07:04.410> think

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
shaped more like an egg there I think

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.590 
shaped more like an egg there I think
I'll<00:07:05.650> have<00:07:05.770> to<00:07:05.890> watch<00:07:06.010> the<00:07:06.250> movie<00:07:06.550> again<00:07:06.580> and<00:07:07.540> I

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
I'll have to watch the movie again and I

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.180 
I'll have to watch the movie again and I
guess<00:07:07.810> this<00:07:08.050> is<00:07:08.260> the<00:07:08.290> tongue<00:07:08.650> up<00:07:08.830> here<00:07:09.040> that

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
guess this is the tongue up here that

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.970 
guess this is the tongue up here that
gets<00:07:09.370> punched<00:07:09.700> out<00:07:09.910> of<00:07:09.970> that<00:07:10.330> ring<00:07:10.600> there<00:07:10.980> but

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
gets punched out of that ring there but

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.770 
gets punched out of that ring there but
some<00:07:12.250> interesting<00:07:12.670> details<00:07:12.820> definitely<00:07:13.750> I

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
some interesting details definitely I

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.430 
some interesting details definitely I
can<00:07:14.050> see<00:07:14.260> how<00:07:14.910> throwing<00:07:15.910> some<00:07:16.150> LEDs<00:07:16.780> and<00:07:17.140> fiber

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
can see how throwing some LEDs and fiber

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.290 
can see how throwing some LEDs and fiber
optics<00:07:17.920> into<00:07:18.130> this<00:07:18.400> could<00:07:18.640> really<00:07:18.850> make<00:07:19.000> it

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
optics into this could really make it

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.930 
optics into this could really make it
pretty<00:07:19.930> sweet<00:07:20.230> so<00:07:20.710> a<00:07:20.740> work<00:07:21.490> on<00:07:21.700> that<00:07:23.730> put<00:07:24.730> that

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
pretty sweet so a work on that put that

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.260 
pretty sweet so a work on that put that
there<00:07:25.240> so<00:07:26.370> over<00:07:27.370> here<00:07:27.550> are<00:07:27.670> some<00:07:27.850> control

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
there so over here are some control

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.480 
there so over here are some control
panels<00:07:28.750> and<00:07:28.870> wall<00:07:29.110> areas<00:07:29.620> and<00:07:29.920> the<00:07:29.980> detail<00:07:30.370> is

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
panels and wall areas and the detail is

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.310 
panels and wall areas and the detail is
looking<00:07:30.820> really<00:07:30.970> nice<00:07:31.300> let<00:07:31.600> me<00:07:31.690> change<00:07:31.960> to<00:07:32.200> the

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
looking really nice let me change to the

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.430 
looking really nice let me change to the
macro<00:07:32.740> for<00:07:32.980> all<00:07:33.100> of<00:07:33.280> this
