was<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.330> those<00:01:24.390> deals<00:01:24.630> where

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
was going to be one of those deals where

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
was going to be one of those deals where
I<00:01:24.900> went<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> line<00:01:26.430> come

to<00:02:11.370> kind<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.970> know<00:02:12.030> look

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
to kind of you know look

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.780 
to kind of you know look
everything<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.170> then<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.430> it'd<00:02:14.580> be

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
everything and then see but it'd be

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.450 
everything and then see but it'd be
awful<00:02:15.150> risky<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.140> guess<00:02:16.530> we'll<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.770> think

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
awful risky but I guess we'll just think

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.160 
awful risky but I guess we'll just think
about<00:02:17.580> overnight<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.570> what<00:02:18.690> happens<00:02:18.990> all
