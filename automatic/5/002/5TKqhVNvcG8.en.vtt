00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
dr. nur hood and now myself so they've

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
gone through three different you know

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.849 
gone through three different you know
Dean's<00:00:47.559> in<00:00:48.339> in<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:49.000> in<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.570> very<00:00:49.600> short<00:00:50.199> period<00:00:50.769> of

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
Dean's in in a in a very short period of

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.829 
Dean's in in a in a very short period of
time<00:00:51.129> I<00:00:51.460> think<00:00:51.670> that's<00:00:51.879> that<00:00:52.030> that's<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.629> big

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
time I think that's that that's a big

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.989 
time I think that's that that's a big
deal<00:00:52.870> because<00:00:53.800> all<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.129> us<00:00:54.399> did<00:00:54.699> things

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
deal because all of us did things

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.239 
deal because all of us did things
differently<00:00:55.809> from<00:00:56.079> an<00:00:56.530> administrative

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
differently from an administrative

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.119 
differently from an administrative
perspective<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:59.379> also<00:00:59.620> been<00:00:59.920> an

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
perspective there's also been an

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.669 
perspective there's also been an
enormous<00:01:00.489> amount<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.239> curriculum<00:01:02.019> revision

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
enormous amount of curriculum revision

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.830 
enormous amount of curriculum revision
that<00:01:02.859> this<00:01:03.429> class<00:01:03.820> has<00:01:04.150> sort<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.510> been<00:01:04.690> the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
that this class has sort of been the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.190 
that this class has sort of been the
guinea<00:01:05.080> pigs<00:01:05.440> for<00:01:05.620> and<00:01:06.300> and<00:01:07.300> they've<00:01:07.960> really

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
guinea pigs for and and they've really

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.160 
guinea pigs for and and they've really
held<00:01:08.560> up<00:01:08.800> beautifully<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:10.450> done<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:10.990> done

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
held up beautifully and done and done

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.300 
held up beautifully and done and done
really<00:01:11.470> well<00:01:11.860> with<00:01:12.100> those<00:01:12.840> those<00:01:13.840> changes<00:01:14.560> so

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
really well with those those changes so

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.070 
really well with those those changes so
I<00:01:15.370> think<00:01:15.550> this<00:01:15.730> this<00:01:15.910> class<00:01:16.240> has<00:01:16.600> shown<00:01:16.840> they

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
I think this this class has shown they

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.530 
I think this this class has shown they
can<00:01:17.260> really<00:01:17.440> adapt<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.370> persevere<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.330> and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
can really adapt and persevere and and

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.630 
can really adapt and persevere and and
those<00:01:19.960> are<00:01:20.200> really<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.470> critical<00:01:20.860> things<00:01:21.460> for

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
those are really the critical things for

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.340 
those are really the critical things for
from<00:01:22.240> being<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.540> good<00:01:22.750> doctor

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350
