00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.110
 traditionally a rtt day for 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.010

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.170
 necessary when coming to us 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.420
 actually then this service is 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.500
 billed by norauto today 15 euros 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.690
 15 euros 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.340
 but after we pay 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.920
 all taxes from you 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.569
 or what else do you have to go 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.900
 wake me partly of other 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.269
 spear 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.069
 no need to move anywhere 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.140
 you pay with us the taxes we 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.420
 reloads them back to the state by 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.430
 the result so you come to the center on 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.019
 you made the gray card pay you the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
 taxes we can make you the plates 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.430
 registration wanted to pose for 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.900
 was leaving everything is done so here is little 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.459
 almost half an hour passed I had 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.780
 the time to have a coffee I could 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.489
 do all the steps but 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.140
 attention because the procedure that 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.610
 we had just followed for now 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.900
 is not valid for a simple 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.730
 address change 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.860
 if you move you always have that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.049
 to me to make this change on 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.000
 your gray card and if you are on 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.099
 the old system you will always need 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.099
 go through the prefecture
