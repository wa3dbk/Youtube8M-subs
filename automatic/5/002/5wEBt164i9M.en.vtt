00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.010
 day it is clear that in such a short 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.280
 time is very difficult to achieve 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.629

 truce announced 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.580
 Of course it became calmer 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.770

 just want peace and all peace want in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.420

 Ukrainian troops offend secret paths 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.930
 so calmer in the car there is nothing 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:05.239

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.920

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.450
 diabetes is 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.579

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.060
 a lot of diabetic people who suffer 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.030
 by this 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.599
 and the drugs here are catastrophic 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.069
 a lack of 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.200
 electricity in Slavyansk still 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.239
 there are only a few districts for 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.040
 electricity networks are being restored to citizens 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.950
 allowed to charge phones in direct 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 sense from the lamppost the biggest 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.910
 a communal problem remains 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.069
 hot water supply will not be yet 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.109
 long but cold city everything is possible 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:49.430
 still get this week we can 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:51.859
 to feed part of the city with water it is clear that 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.720
 it will not be all with what is missing 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.310
 we have a power palette of energy this is not 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.050
 pumps will work 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.660
 but 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.470
 the water itself will go therefore 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.810
 at least first second floors 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.580
 we can provide the mayor of Slavic 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.920
 claims people started coming back from 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.080
 neighboring cities and regions because 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.450
 there is nothing left to live there 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.209
 because believe a short truce 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.640
 change the world but occasionally volleys still 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.840
 sound both sides accuse each other of 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.940
 truce violation 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.190
