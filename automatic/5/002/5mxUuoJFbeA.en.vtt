different<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.200> when<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> open<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
different so as you see when you open it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.900 
different so as you see when you open it
up<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.070> already<00:00:44.219> tell<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.730> big

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
difference this is what they call a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.819 
difference this is what they call a
speed<00:00:47.280> dial<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:48.149> speed<00:00:48.870> dial<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.440> it's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

cool i thought if you're in a web if

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.170 
cool i thought if you're in a web if
you're<00:03:05.159> in<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> web<00:03:05.459> page<00:03:05.669> you<00:03:05.879> let<00:03:05.970> me<00:03:06.060> go<00:03:06.120> ahead

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
you're in a web page you let me go ahead

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.789 
you're in a web page you let me go ahead
and<00:03:06.299> show<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.569> i'll<00:03:07.379> just<00:03:07.560> open<00:03:07.620> up

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
and show you that i'll just open up

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.300 
and show you that i'll just open up
yahoo<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.409> see<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.739> loading<00:03:11.010> up<00:03:11.069> yahoo

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
yahoo so you see it's loading up yahoo

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.599 
yahoo so you see it's loading up yahoo
right<00:03:11.549> now<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:14.040> pretty<00:03:14.069> much<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.370> same

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
right now it's pretty much the same

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.390 
right now it's pretty much the same
speed<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:15.349> safari<00:03:16.349> i<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.829> opens<00:03:17.250> up

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
speed as safari i think it opens up

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.729 
speed as safari i think it opens up
faster<00:03:17.849> actually<00:03:18.510> i<00:03:18.690> think<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.260> opens<00:03:19.590> up

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
faster actually i think it opens up

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.399 
faster actually i think it opens up
faster<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.909> i<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:21.180> safari<00:03:21.599> shows<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
faster but i think safari shows you the

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.170 
faster but i think safari shows you the
images<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:22.889> stuff<00:03:23.040> before<00:03:23.489> actually<00:03:23.729> loads

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
images and stuff before actually loads

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.430 
images and stuff before actually loads
all<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.419> way<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.659> pretty<00:03:24.930> much<00:03:25.079> once<00:03:25.319> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
all the way this pretty much once it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.250 
all the way this pretty much once it
loads<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:26.010> loads<00:03:26.430> everything<00:03:26.879> so<00:03:27.510> that's<00:03:28.079> one

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
loads it loads everything so that's one

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.330 
loads it loads everything so that's one
of<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.409> differences<00:03:28.560> i'll<00:03:28.889> touch<00:03:29.099> on<00:03:29.280> that

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
of the differences i'll touch on that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.849 
of the differences i'll touch on that
though<00:03:29.609> if<00:03:29.760> i<00:03:29.849> did<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.739> defender<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
though if i did the defender the

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.800 
though if i did the defender the
comparison<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.819> let's<00:03:33.090> go<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.329> click<00:03:33.419> on<00:03:33.540> find

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.800 
comparison so let's go and click on find
in<00:03:33.989> page<00:03:34.229> and<00:03:34.560> i<00:03:35.370> don't<00:03:35.819> know<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.599> want<00:03:36.750> to

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
in page and i don't know so you want to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.569 
in page and i don't know so you want to
search<00:03:36.959> police<00:03:37.290> because<00:03:37.769> i<00:03:37.889> see<00:03:38.069> police<00:03:38.370> up

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
search police because i see police up

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.149 
search police because i see police up
there<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.930> then<00:03:40.199> hit<00:03:40.379> next<00:03:40.409> and<00:03:40.829> there<00:03:40.979> you<00:03:41.099> go

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
there and then hit next and there you go

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.129 
there and then hit next and there you go
see<00:03:41.549> how<00:03:41.639> highlights<00:03:42.030> police<00:03:42.419> and<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.019> go

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
see how highlights police and you can go

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.550 
see how highlights police and you can go
down<00:03:43.409> and<00:03:44.299> i<00:03:45.299> think<00:03:45.810> that's<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.079> that's<00:03:46.290> just<00:03:46.409> a

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
down and i think that's it that's just a

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.500 
down and i think that's it that's just a
little<00:03:46.769> story<00:03:48.019> maybe<00:03:49.019> others<00:03:49.440> i<00:03:49.590> don't<00:03:49.739> know

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
little story maybe others i don't know

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.819 
little story maybe others i don't know
nope<00:03:51.510> looks<00:03:52.049> like<00:03:52.169> that's<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.409> only<00:03:52.470> police

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
nope looks like that's the only police

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.259 
nope looks like that's the only police
but<00:03:53.129> as<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.459> see<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.699> highlights<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
but as you can see it highlights it

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.530 
but as you can see it highlights it
which<00:03:54.419> is<00:03:54.540> pretty<00:03:54.720> cool<00:03:55.879> especially<00:03:56.879> for<00:03:57.359> just

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
which is pretty cool especially for just

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.439

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
having on your mobile device so you can

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
back out the search and go back and that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.240 
back out the search and go back and that
just<00:04:03.209> takes<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.540> right<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.810> wear<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:04.349> you<00:04:04.620> saw

to go to help you can just learn about
operated<00:04:59.250> by<00:04:59.370> take<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.820> their<00:04:59.940> site<00:05:00.210> and

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
operated by take you to their site and

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.080 
operated by take you to their site and
whatnot<00:05:01.110> I'd<00:05:01.620> say<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.160> loads<00:05:02.520> up<00:05:02.729> really

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
whatnot I'd say this loads up really

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.290 
whatnot I'd say this loads up really
fast<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.830> reason<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.190> said<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.760> doesn't

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
fast the reason I said it it doesn't

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.969 
fast the reason I said it it doesn't
make<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.419> difference<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:06.990> earlier<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:07.889> the

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
make a difference and earlier in the

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.330 
make a difference and earlier in the
video<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.280> because<00:05:08.600> Safari<00:05:09.740> actually<00:05:10.740> loads

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
video is because Safari actually loads

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.000 
video is because Safari actually loads
up<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.729> images<00:05:12.210> like<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:13.289> loads<00:05:13.620> up<00:05:13.830> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
up the images like it loads up the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.640 
up the images like it loads up the
images<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:15.479> page<00:05:15.660> is<00:05:15.870> loading<00:05:16.199> it<00:05:16.350> puts

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
images as the page is loading it puts

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.469 
images as the page is loading it puts
image<00:05:17.039> and<00:05:17.310> then<00:05:17.370> like<00:05:17.789> a<00:05:18.000> couple<00:05:18.180> seconds

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
image and then like a couple seconds

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.150 
image and then like a couple seconds
later<00:05:18.630> we'll<00:05:18.780> put<00:05:18.870> another<00:05:18.900> image<00:05:19.500> pickup

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
later we'll put another image pickup

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.770 
later we'll put another image pickup
selector<00:05:20.310> later<00:05:20.729> I'll<00:05:20.910> add<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.150> text<00:05:21.419> and

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
selector later I'll add the text and

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.810 
selector later I'll add the text and
things<00:05:21.960> like<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.139> this<00:05:22.889> once<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.430> loads<00:05:23.610> it

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
things like that this once it loads it

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.310 
things like that this once it loads it
loads<00:05:24.000> everything<00:05:24.479> at<00:05:24.599> once<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.050> that's<00:05:25.199> why

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
loads everything at once so that's why

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.240 
loads everything at once so that's why
it<00:05:25.440> takes<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.680> little<00:05:25.800> longer<00:05:25.949> at<00:05:26.190> the

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
it takes a little longer at the

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.279 
it takes a little longer at the
beginning<00:05:26.520> but<00:05:27.030> then<00:05:27.180> after<00:05:27.449> that<00:05:27.570> just<00:05:27.810> blaze

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
beginning but then after that just blaze

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.930 
beginning but then after that just blaze
this<00:05:28.500> by<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.830> you'll<00:05:28.949> get<00:05:29.099> all<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.430> images

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.210 
this by and you'll get all the images
