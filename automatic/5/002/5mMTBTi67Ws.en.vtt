00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.309
 very good girls very good guys what 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.670
 such are you I hope you are all very 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.670
 all right 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.520
 today I tell you a story about oculus 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.800
 rif and the shooters and is that playing this 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.230
 mode to this type of game in oculus rif 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.950
 It will be easier than ever with a 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.710
 peripheral is to say that 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.140
 oculus rif as peripheral and advance 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.330
 technological in video games is a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.430
 last because all those who do 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.340
 we have tried already you will know that it presents 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.320
 a whole renovation of form that we have 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.420
 to play video games but 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.809
 it is also true that he still has 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.410
 a lot of way to go by putting 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.710
 an example is worth these reality glasses 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 Virtual found an enemy in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 shooters or shooting games because 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.280
 because because the field of vision that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.830
 we have in the game corresponds to the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.290
 our eyes and therefore the look of 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.329
 the gun goes with them what makes 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.250
 its handling is particularly complex 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 when we are used to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.530
 look and then aim thanks to kotaku 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.479
 as we have always known crisis 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 galizzi who is in love with this 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.110
 device and that has been put to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.960
 the work to solve this impediment 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.810
 with the help of the company and perkins 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.360
 because together they have developed a boost 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.280
 do for oculus rif what he does is 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.649
 able to move independently 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.610
 to the movements of your head and 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.520
 so much 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.190
 with the glasses so what he does is 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.800
 that when raising the weapon as we were aiming 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.050
 it will be true when you join our 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.750
 field of vision offering us a 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.540
 much more intuitive experience and for 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.100
 so realistic is to say that as we have 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 said previously they are still 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.560
 working on it but the video that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.150
 you have in the description they see that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.710
 we see that the results are very 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.840
 impressive 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.020
 what do you really think this is the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.810
 monda and lironda in a matter of reality 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.850
 virtual and told reuters that for example 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.910
 is the game mode that I like the most 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.070
 me not the style is awesome 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.459
 then if you have seen some 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.709
 you have seen the movie gamer this is 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.770
 very similar, it is very, very, very 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.320
 It looks very similar but very cool 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.880
 true so nothing guys I hope you 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.040
 have interested in the news or a 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.140
 I kiss everyone and see you in another video 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.140
