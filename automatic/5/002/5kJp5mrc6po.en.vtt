00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.970
 position 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.130
 tree 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.820

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.820

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.020
 one 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.579
 but step by step 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.240
 and that I'm not going to ever happen 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:55.150

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.150

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.989

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.730
 uy 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.060

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.060
 world 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.909
 this got us to transport to a 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.349
 kind of start with the game of 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.180
 hungry you have to wait ok 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:26.469
 there are the bunkers of arms 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.250
 it's worth there then you have to go running 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:33.329
 things and catch I know where you are 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.329

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:05.420

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:09.010

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.620

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.260
 this is one of the days 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.650
 we can not compete against this and if you 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.460

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:06.080

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.080
 horses 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.509
 everyone running around swimming and you can not 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:20.400
 go up said I'm left alone 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:22.879
 at the end in the water to have water 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.189
 in water 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.900

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:34.129

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.129
 not subjective the season 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:42.199
 and sent it to the shot since it had 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.199
 delayed to wear the head 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.820

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.630

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.990
 I had 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:23.990
 God awaits me for me 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.190
 underwater
