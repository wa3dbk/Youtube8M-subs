 football is the greatest spectacle of 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.009
 world there are very few days left for the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.019
 launch of 515 the new delivery of the 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.580
 favorite football simulator of the great 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.800
 most sports fans 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.600
 king who once again comes to us by the hand 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.380
 from jay esports this is not fiction this 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.060
 is real life our passion in this 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.890
 occasion in game centered many of his 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.780
 developments in the behavior of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.670
 players which for the first time 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.590
 will show emotions depending on the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.390
 situation of the party and they will even have 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.460
 memories of the mishaps that have 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.230
 suffered previous moves as per 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.450
 example a bad entry or having 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.040
 failed a clear goal opportunity what 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.370
 that will make your attitude change 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.870
 as the meeting progresses in this way 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.910
 for example if a player 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.980
 receives several fouls from the same rival 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 of this one it will be able to be in charge with him 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.850
 or if our forward fails too many 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.350
 shots on the door this will cause 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.079
 increase discontent and frustration 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.180
 among his teammates affirming 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.560
 he would stay footballer will have more than 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:14.299
 600 reactions 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.320
 is different is also another element in 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.390
 the one that is becoming special 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.799
 emphasis is on the new goalkeepers the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.840
 which center an intelligence 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.210
 artificially improved as well as 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.220
 around 50 new animations that 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.960
 they will show us in a fluid way how they are 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.240
 able to stop a ball in the last 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.850
 second carry out rejects and of 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.770
 species in a more realistic way though 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.570
 there will also be some greater giant teas 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.310
 factors that can make them commit 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.899
 errors being in general much more 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.899
 humans when making decisions 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.210
 On the other hand, we can not stop 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.100
 mention other aspects of the game that 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.200
 they have also been improved so that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.820
 parties are even more dynamic and of a 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.380
 greater intensity since now the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.120
 commentators who convey the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.100
 meeting will also take into account 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.870
 reactions of the fans in their 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.180
 comments while the latter 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.190
 will present a different behavior 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.440
 in according to your country or club 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.420
 football that they encourage being this similar 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.340
 to the real fans of these 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.560
 teams in real life so every 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.880
 edition will be unique 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.650
 to all this we must add new 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.270
 animations of the characters that are 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.400
 in the band and the new celebrations 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.380
 when a goal is scored and you can see 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.200
 now how the players of a team 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.209
 they participate once again in 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.160
 responsible for narrating the parties in the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.260
 Spanish version of the game will be the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.160
 sports journalists manolo lama and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.160
 paco gonzÃ¡lez 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.100
 likewise fifa science also we 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.840
 will offer the same wide variety of 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.670
 modes of the game to which the saga and we 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.739
 have been accustomed since playing a 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.870
 fast match until we get to tiendo 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.670
 in career mode, of course, with 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.800
 the possibility of playing tournaments 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.599
 both alone and with others 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 players from the same console to 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.200
 through the online connection without 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.849
 forget us either of the popular way 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.709
 ultimate team which equally 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.709
 will incorporate many improvements 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.570
 In addition, as expected, we will return to 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.880
 count on a huge amount of 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.680
 national teams clubs and leagues 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.750
 football with an official license in which 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.730
 play as for example the English the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.650
 Italian the Spanish and even the league 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.020
 Turkish that will make their debut in 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.000
 the saga although unfortunately also 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.280
 there will be some important absences like 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.140
 is the case of the Brazilian league due to 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.280
 the impossibility of reaching an agreement 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.280
 to be able to include it 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.840
 finally with regard to 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.340
 visual section we have to highlight the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.439
 perfect modeling of all 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.599
 footballers and especially in their 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:41.069
 faces all had a level of detail 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.069
 really surprising 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.040
 will also encompass this perfectionism 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.900
 everything that surrounds them can see things 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.670
 like the clothes of the players are 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.710
 go messing up in matches with 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.720
 rain and mud or as they leave the mark of 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.820
 your boots on the lawn while this is 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.260
 is deteriorating little by little during the 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.480
 I find what you have to add many 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.220
 more interactive elements like that the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.080
 pennant of horns is doubled if it is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.940
 hit or even that the goal 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.250
 tremble when receiving the impact of a 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.590
 ball on the crossbar while we have to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.510
 say that all this great technical parade 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.580
 we will only see them in full I started and 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.830
 the new generation xbox consoles 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.870
 one and flexion 4 taking advantage of the 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.870
 potential offered by the imade engine 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.949
 As expected, the xbox versions 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.539
 360 and playstation3 light were at a level 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.069
 lower due to the logic 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.750
 vicinity of your hardware 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.550
 suppressing also some 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.979
 features of the game as per 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.960
 example the club mode which is not 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.960
 will include in these last two consoles 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.430
 and she szpolski easy promising 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.590
 become once again the game of 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.360
 most realistic football ever created and for 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.790
 check it you just have to wait for your 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.130
 planned departure for this next 25 of 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:59.070
 September on the Xbox platform pc 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.070
 playstation 4 xbox 360 and playstation3 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.920
 We will confirm that it also 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.270
 will launch specific versions for 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:12.110
 consoles wii psp nintendo 3ds 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.110
 it's soccer 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.930
 fifa 15 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.930
 live football
