00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.750
 a trajinera are welcome to another 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.670
 video and this time we are in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.980
 minecraft sandwich in the bil 3 that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.630
 He left early today and one wanted 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.710
 show them this thing in the new way 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.619
 of fishing that I have not noticed 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.750
 because he had not reached 100% but well 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 let's introduce this thing 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.380
 the one to fish with the bait and well this 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.750
 new method that the ones from 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.390
 yang that the truth is great that in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.650
 overall I liked how to start doing the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.239
 little fish and you will go 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 directly towards the fishing rod with 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 the bait and it's going to fall 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.470
 this wants to control you and lower 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.079
 imagining that turning the cane is approaching 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.110
 of fishing comes 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.190
 excellent grip but is hardworking 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.190
 in fact it is very far 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.980
 it's apology for making the little bubbles 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.490
 fish that is approaching and grabs the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.490
 bait 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.970
 It takes a little bit of typical time 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820
 today there was this that was supporting this 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.890
 thing that the fishing rod and the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.890
 gigantic social bait 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.170
 there was a gigantic bait that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.720
 occupied the entire map or not all the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.140
 map but it occupied the entire screen 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.940
 when you can see right here near that 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.310
 here perfect at any time of 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.300
 appear a fish and go directly 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.160
 towards the bait 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.850
 I think it is the world that is here 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.049
 the world 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.049
 sometimes puffer fish appears 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.190
 I will appear there is up out 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.620
 some bubbles 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 this sounds the same as in minecraft 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.840
 obviously it does the same thing as pc manga 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.939
 console air 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.100
 but the same is right at the moment that 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.469
 you hear the sound of water is when 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.670
 must remove the cane and appear in that the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:10.800
 moment again and it's already night 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.800
 it is night to see if we catch something 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.739
 it takes a lot 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.489
 was quite in fact added the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.830
 spiders the poisonous cave spiders 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.159
 but some of them are wanted 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.110
 neither inches and it's a problem that 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.630
 good 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.340
 let's wait for these new ones to fall 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.040
 it's so creative , even if they take it 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.660
 appears in my inventory because because 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.990
 disappears in creative all things 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.990
 that we grab 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.280
 it takes a lot 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.220
 you're there the fish goes 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.360
 but good this fact and good I hope that 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.790
 have liked this way of fishing 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.170
 much better if you know there is a fish 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.450
 in the catches faster than normal 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.060
 unlike mainquÃ© of caused the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.490
 PC demand because there you only have 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.160
 that to stay in bubbles below the 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.300
 bait and fish although it takes a long time 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.300
 but good that's all and thanks
