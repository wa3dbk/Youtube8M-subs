shaft obviously then we've got a fly bar

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.499 
shaft obviously then we've got a fly bar
obviously<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.770> main<00:01:31.950> axis<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:32.610> no

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
obviously and the main axis will no

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.400 
obviously and the main axis will no
doubt<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:34.080> buggered<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.250> well<00:01:36.080> what<00:01:37.080> else<00:01:37.200> we

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
doubt be buggered as well what else we

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.710 
doubt be buggered as well what else we
got<00:01:37.560> ah<00:01:37.770> skin<00:01:38.550> as<00:01:38.670> well<00:01:38.819> that's<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:40.399> skids<00:01:41.399> bang

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
got ah skin as well that's a skids bang

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.120 
got ah skin as well that's a skids bang
and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.929> think<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.830> dig<00:01:44.009> around

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and I think in here if we dig around

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
and I think in here if we dig around
here<00:01:45.530> yeah<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.069> buried<00:01:48.229> good<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
here yeah it's just buried good so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.029 
here yeah it's just buried good so
there's<00:01:50.460> bang<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.880> well<00:01:51.119> ah<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.770> too

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
there's bang as well ah that's not too

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.350 
there's bang as well ah that's not too
bad<00:01:53.069> could<00:01:53.580> be<00:01:53.610> worse<00:01:54.170> ah<00:01:55.729> no<00:01:56.729> broken<00:01:57.119> body

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
bad could be worse ah no broken body

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.830 
bad could be worse ah no broken body
that's<00:01:57.630> good<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:59.360> yeah<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.690> not<00:02:00.810> too

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that's good as I think yeah it's not too

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.960 
that's good as I think yeah it's not too
bad<00:02:00.990> hopefully<00:02:01.380> no<00:02:01.800> stripped<00:02:02.250> servos<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
bad hopefully no stripped servos it's a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
bad hopefully no stripped servos it's a
real<00:02:03.119> pain<00:02:04.700> no<00:02:05.700> broken<00:02:06.060> blades<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
real pain no broken blades it's a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.059 
real pain no broken blades it's a
surprise<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.709> buried<00:02:08.100> itself<00:02:09.920> look<00:02:10.920> at

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
surprise it's just buried itself look at

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.320 
surprise it's just buried itself look at
that<00:02:11.250> that's<00:02:11.940> how<00:02:12.060> far<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.360> winter<00:02:13.100> awesome

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
that that's how far it winter awesome

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
that that's how far it winter awesome
then<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.390> got<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.630> bit<00:02:15.750> upside<00:02:16.020> down<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.380> me<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.620> I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
then I got a bit upside down on me and I

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.710 
then I got a bit upside down on me and I
don't<00:02:17.430> really<00:02:17.550> know<00:02:17.730> what<00:02:17.910> went<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.450> me<00:02:18.600> with

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
don't really know what went on me with

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.250 
don't really know what went on me with
oh<00:02:18.780> I've<00:02:18.840> got<00:02:19.110> um<00:02:21.170> disorientated<00:02:22.170> it's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
oh I've got um disorientated it's

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.880 
oh I've got um disorientated it's
probably<00:02:22.470> most<00:02:22.650> likely<00:02:23.360> yeah<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.860> a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
probably most likely yeah so that is a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.240 
probably most likely yeah so that is a
crashed<00:02:27.620> deinem<00:02:28.620> eraser<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.599> think<00:02:30.599> feels<00:02:30.959> like

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
crashed deinem eraser I think feels like

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
crashed deinem eraser I think feels like
yep<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.520> gotta<00:02:32.700> strip<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.270> strip<00:02:33.810> save<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.200> its

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
yep so gotta strip the strip save on its

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.010 
yep so gotta strip the strip save on its
side<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:35.030> don't<00:02:36.030> know<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.390> normal<00:02:36.720> or

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
that one's okay on decay as well so just

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.790 
that one's okay on decay as well so just
one<00:02:46.500> strip<00:02:46.860> survey<00:02:48.860> like<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> say<00:02:50.129> boom<00:02:50.519> strike

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
one strip survey like I say boom strike

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.750 
one strip survey like I say boom strike
miss<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.959> blades<00:02:55.349> must<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.830> damaged<00:02:56.250> surely

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
miss the blades must be damaged surely

that might be yeah looks fly ball

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.110 
that might be yeah looks fly ball
actually<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.130> be<00:03:08.160> honest<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:09.239> blade<00:03:09.860> oh<00:03:11.120> hang

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
actually to be honest that blade oh hang

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.240 
too bad yeah problem probably blades as
well<00:03:21.150> they<00:03:22.140> actually<00:03:22.410> don't<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.860> bed<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.220> little

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
well they actually don't to bed a little

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.440 
well they actually don't to bed a little
bit<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.610> neck<00:03:23.730> out<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.090> route<00:03:24.239> there

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
bit of a neck out of the route there

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.259 
bit of a neck out of the route there
which<00:03:24.630> they<00:03:24.980> often<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.459> but<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:26.730> not<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.060> big

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
which they often get but it's not a big

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.330 
which they often get but it's not a big
deal<00:03:28.819> pedal<00:03:29.819> absolutely<00:03:30.650> bet<00:03:31.650> deep<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.099> do<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
deal pedal absolutely bet deep and do it

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.420 
deal pedal absolutely bet deep and do it
anyway<00:03:32.569> that's<00:03:33.569> probably<00:03:33.810> enough<00:03:33.989> yeah<00:03:34.890> see

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
anyway that's probably enough yeah see

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.519 
anyway that's probably enough yeah see
