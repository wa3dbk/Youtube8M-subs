 but for example this rock that he 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.920
 It took in the two hours to make it 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.860
 It's very quiet, I used all the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.880
 all lines even give only one 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.760

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.210
 I did not try to do a little school 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.299
 But it did not work. 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.759

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:16.719
 I did not remember him but he has a 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.960
 This time is already here, everything is as faithful 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.479
 Except that xbox is not 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.899
 It was cool, I just thought I could have 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.670
 been better zinho okay yes i think 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.560
 that the secret of the idol you have a 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.149
 cool badge, you work hard 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.969
 with shadow, right? 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.200
 As you can see there, we have a 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.899
 black 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.780
 the agent has a darker gray gray 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.969
 lighter and then I got it from me is 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.799
 increasing the color né 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.579
 until very bright even though this 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.719
 half here until you try a little spark here 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.670
 on the side is a sparkling ball there 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.100
 I think it's cool, I think if you have 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.409
 this notion there, I think it's nice of you 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.749

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.679
 That's cute, and it took forever. 

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:11.890
 Thank you, I confess, it took too long. 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.430

 A lot, just take a look. 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.790
 This attack took a long time and I have 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.750
 patience 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.930

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.889
 that I was going to do this on a single layer 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.469
 I used almost all of them but he was well 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.629

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.219

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.229

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.359

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.389
 I finished layer but I thought it generated 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:08.530
 take less of it but it is not mine. 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:11.379

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.190
 Only it did not take long to do it alone. 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.710
 could not increase much because 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.660
 It missed because space is lacking space 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.940
