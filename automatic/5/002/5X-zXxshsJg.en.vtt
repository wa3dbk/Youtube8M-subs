00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
and kind of the fuel that would be

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.629 
and kind of the fuel that would be
loosely<00:00:04.670> labeled<00:00:05.670> sacred<00:00:06.450> geometry<00:00:06.660> and

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:07.639 
loosely labeled sacred geometry and

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.580 
loosely labeled sacred geometry and
synthesizing<00:00:08.639> all<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.389> was<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> beach

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
synthesizing all that I was on the beach

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.290 
synthesizing all that I was on the beach
explaining<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> friend<00:00:11.849> but<00:00:12.030> I've<00:00:12.150> been

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
explaining to a friend but I've been

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.730 
explaining to a friend but I've been
learning<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.809> realized<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.410> could<00:00:13.590> do

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
learning and I realized that I could do

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650 
learning and I realized that I could do
the<00:00:14.009> things<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.880> beach<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.480> was

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
the things on the beach that that was

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.130 
the things on the beach that that was
that<00:00:16.470> could<00:00:16.619> be<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> canvas<00:00:17.510> I'm<00:00:18.510> describing

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that could be the canvas I'm describing

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.200 
that could be the canvas I'm describing
what<00:00:19.439> fuels<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:19.890> almost<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.730> scientific

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
what fuels like almost like scientific

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.380 
what fuels like almost like scientific
equations<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> beach<00:00:25.939> nothing<00:00:26.939> else<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
equations on the beach nothing else is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.029 
equations on the beach nothing else is
on<00:00:27.510> my<00:00:27.539> mind<00:00:27.840> when<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:28.439> doing<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> artwork

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
on my mind when I'm doing the artwork

on my mind when I'm doing the artwork
even<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:30.000> being<00:00:30.539> next<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> water<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
even just being next to the water the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.069 
even just being next to the water the
rest<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.430> cars<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.660> can't<00:00:33.870> hear<00:00:33.989> the

car as the city washes away in fact it
kind<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.710> always<00:00:37.920> surprised<00:00:38.340> that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
kind of I'm always surprised that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
kind of I'm always surprised that
there's<00:00:38.700> such<00:00:38.910> amazing<00:00:39.480> beaches<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.020> San

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
there's such amazing beaches in San

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.209 
there's such amazing beaches in San
Francisco<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.520> risks<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.879> use<00:00:45.120> are

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
Francisco the risks that I use are

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.090 
Francisco the risks that I use are
generally<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.550> leaf<00:00:47.850> rakes<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.100> because

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
generally there leaf rakes and because

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
generally there leaf rakes and because
those<00:00:50.309> rakes<00:00:50.520> ride<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> surface<00:00:51.570> they

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
those rakes ride on the surface they

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.950 
those rakes ride on the surface they
don't<00:00:52.469> dig<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.309> gravel<00:00:53.730> rake<00:00:53.879> would<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
don't dig in like a gravel rake would I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
don't dig in like a gravel rake would I
kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> consider<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:57.090> I'm

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
kind of consider that I'm that I'm

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.290 
kind of consider that I'm that I'm
painting<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.989> feels<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.850> I'm

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
painting is what it feels like but I'm

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.360 
painting is what it feels like but I'm
using<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.660> whole<00:01:00.780> body<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.649> rake<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
using my whole body and the rake is that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.570 
using my whole body and the rake is that
the<00:01:02.609> end<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> brush

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.930 

I<00:01:06.870> start<00:01:07.870> just<00:01:08.860> before<00:01:08.980> low<00:01:09.280> tide<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.760> and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
I start just before low tide and and

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.090 
I start just before low tide and and
just<00:01:10.270> after<00:01:10.660> low<00:01:10.810> tides<00:01:11.080> so<00:01:11.410> that<00:01:11.590> when<00:01:11.950> it's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
just after low tides so that when it's

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.340 
just after low tides so that when it's
coming<00:01:12.400> back<00:01:12.580> I've<00:01:13.090> used<00:01:13.450> up<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.750> area<00:01:14.110> that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
coming back I've used up the area that

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
coming back I've used up the area that
it<00:01:14.470> had<00:01:14.590> already<00:01:14.830> left<00:01:15.460> behind<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.130> tide

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
it had already left behind when the tide

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.390 
it had already left behind when the tide
is<00:01:18.400> returning<00:01:19.090> I'm<00:01:19.270> not<00:01:19.510> yet<00:01:19.840> done<00:01:20.400> that's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400
