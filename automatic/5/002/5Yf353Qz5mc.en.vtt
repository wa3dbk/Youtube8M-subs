00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so unless I'll talk about doing it both

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
so unless I'll talk about doing it both
ways<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.450> whichever<00:01:24.660> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
ways but you can really do whichever is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.420 
ways but you can really do whichever is
more<00:01:24.900> comfortable<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.680> sometimes<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
recommend doing it with with the way

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.250 
recommend doing it with with the way
that<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.910> least<00:01:30.120> comfortable<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> to

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
a little heavier folk feel in the verse

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.920 
a little heavier folk feel in the verse
and<00:03:08.560> then<00:03:08.920> kind<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.459> symphonic<00:03:09.849> crashing<00:03:10.480> in

the instrumental part that follows the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.759 
the instrumental part that follows the
chorus<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:14.019> lot<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.260> different<00:03:14.319> stuff<00:03:14.650> but

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
really just the first eight measures of

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.750 
really just the first eight measures of
the<00:03:26.859> intro<00:03:27.159> and<00:03:27.370> that's<00:03:28.359> that's<00:03:29.290> um<00:03:29.799> we're

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
in one way you could pretty much play

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.159 
in one way you could pretty much play
the<00:03:38.139> chords<00:03:38.469> D<00:03:39.780> one<00:03:40.780> thing<00:03:40.900> that's<00:03:41.019> really

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
we don't hear the really distinctly we

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.179

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
hear more of a d5 where the first string

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.089 
hear more of a d5 where the first string
is<00:03:51.819> being<00:03:51.939> killed<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.780> left<00:03:52.810> open<00:03:53.769> but<00:03:53.889> being

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
touched by the third finger so you're

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:04.240 
touched by the third finger so you're
really<00:03:55.659> only<00:03:55.870> getting<00:03:56.139> power<00:03:57.010> chord<00:03:57.400> sound
