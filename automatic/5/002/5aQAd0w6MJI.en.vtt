00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:18.630
 or the ones I bring you 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.630
 the curiosities of assassin's creed 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.580
 3 and what many people do not know is that 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.360
 if you do an epic battle like 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.810
 good as it is here 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.350
 it seems robin hood there they are riding 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.350
 in an attacker 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 show is not good 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.010
 that if it's okay to download me in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.010
 charger 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 we go 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.570
 format and what you can do if you love 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.570
 now the horse 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.460
 you have here to fill in the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.970
 inventory is to say 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.580
 how do you see how 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.310
 after 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.330
 I have all the arrows, all the bullets 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.060
 more bullets names of awakening 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.860
 but but you recover everything is 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.020
 totally a free laser 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.260
 and more everyone gets the stores 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.150
 making some bags the craft bags 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.150
 they were hard as to call it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.479
 and this gives you all the ammunition there are three 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.190
 bags I think I do not know what they're called and good 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.720
 they go pretty well so I give you the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.670
 I recommend 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.100
 but just supposes not being in the field anymore 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.400
 that the horse is the sun its course in the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.300
 campus 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.020
 as doubts we will also not return 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.020
 you ask me 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.020
 as you see the second curiosity is in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.560
 l'aquila on the boat 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.700
 it is a naval mission, as you see 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.030
 the crew is normal 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.610
 it was a bit a little stop it 's bad sea 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.550
 is a bit a little hectic is not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.250
 quiet and good what I 'm going to 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.500
 show is who accompanies me and this is 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.629
 that you can walk the ship if you 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.519
 if you put jumps from the water 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.519
 crew makes a war cry 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.390
 the bells and it's really cool I'm going to 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.550
 keep quiet so I appreciate it 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.550
 and well I will not leave with the scream 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.200
 although if you take a long time to go up 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.670
 As you can see , you have to synchronize 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.520
 than to repeat the version but in 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.209
 this case as at the beginning does not matter 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.220
 It matters a lot that people follow 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.220
 just as quiet as you see here 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.350
 it's the sea moves from the good boat and I 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.250
 I call it because this is just a little 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.250
 and we are going to give 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.680
 I've been galloping for a while for these vast 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.300
 land and I must give you advice never 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.590
 go hunting in winter because look 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.810
 because in everything he does he pays for it 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.080
 as now I have seen not a single animal 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.140
 to hunt 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.860
 and it 's because the winter animators 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.010
 that is of place is the place of the 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.750
 bears where there are more bears of all the whole 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.080
 border that does not know we are 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.300
 right here winos why 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.150
 because there is this right here in this 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.180
 lake as you see the teddy bears are here the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.660
 teddy bears and here there are hundreds 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.660
 of millions 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.999
 millions 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:20.019
 and there is not a single bear why why 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:21.870
 winter hibernate winter are not we say 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.650
 yes 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.560
 that's the last curiosity I discovered 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.230
 the other day accidentally 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.630
 and I liked it so nothing good anymore 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.220
 we finish with the epic battle that I am 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.380
 curious that he did not attack me while 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.350
 I expected 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.780
