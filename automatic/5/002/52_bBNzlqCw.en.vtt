mr. him today I am going to show you how

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.589 
mr. him today I am going to show you how
to<00:00:08.340> count<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.240> number<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:10.429> tab<00:00:11.780> blank<00:00:13.040> and<00:00:14.599> new

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
to count the number of tab blank and new

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.650 
to count the number of tab blank and new
line<00:00:15.929> from<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.470> input<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:17.490> C<00:00:17.850> program<00:00:20.420> you<00:00:21.420> can

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
line from the input in C program you can

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:34.720 
line from the input in C program you can
see<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:23.330> start<00:00:24.330> my<00:00:24.539> program

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.710 

I<00:00:34.820> take<00:00:35.570> an<00:00:35.750> integer<00:00:35.989> called<00:00:36.410> in<00:00:36.590> blank<00:00:37.720> take

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
I take an integer called in blank take

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.430 
I take an integer called in blank take
another<00:00:38.989> integer<00:00:39.350> in<00:00:39.620> tab<00:00:40.570> and<00:00:41.570> another

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
another integer in tab and another

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.610 
another integer in tab and another
integer<00:00:42.770> in<00:00:43.100> line<00:00:43.430> I<00:00:43.760> took<00:00:44.540> this<00:00:44.750> three

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
integer in line I took this three

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.280 
integer in line I took this three
integer<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.730> count<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.540> number<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.870> blank

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
integer to count the number of blank

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.759 
integer to count the number of blank
number<00:00:48.650> of<00:00:48.920> tab<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:49.430> number<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.760> line<00:00:50.739> now<00:00:51.739> I

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
number of tab and number of line now I

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:03.790 
number of tab and number of line now I
am<00:00:52.220> initializing<00:00:52.550> them<00:00:53.360> as<00:00:53.870> zero

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.240 

now<00:01:04.489> I<00:01:04.550> will<00:01:05.030> write<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.270> loop<00:01:05.630> which<00:01:06.290> will<00:01:06.560> help

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
now I will write a loop which will help

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.310 
now I will write a loop which will help
me<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.850> count<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.270> number<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.600> blank<00:01:08.960> number

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
me to count the number of blank number

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:29.429 
me to count the number of blank number
of<00:01:09.440> tab<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.010> number<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.310> line<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:12.830> can<00:01:13.010> see

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.899 

so<00:01:30.009> this<00:01:30.640> for<00:01:30.969> loop<00:01:31.149> will<00:01:31.420> continue<00:01:31.450> until<00:01:32.289> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
so this for loop will continue until it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.139 
so this for loop will continue until it
find<00:01:34.200> aesthetic<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.939> I<00:01:37.450> will<00:01:38.079> write<00:01:38.819> my<00:01:39.819> main

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
find aesthetic now I will write my main

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.809 
find aesthetic now I will write my main
portion<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:41.289> program<00:01:41.560> inside<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.640> while

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
portion of this program inside the while

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:54.649 
portion of this program inside the while
loop<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:44.640> my<00:01:45.640> input<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:46.810> equal<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:50.459> blank<00:01:52.590> then

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
loop if my input is equal to blank then

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.059 
loop if my input is equal to blank then
in<00:01:55.659> blank<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:57.759> increase<00:01:58.270> by<00:01:58.659> 1<00:01:58.689> so<00:01:59.649> in<00:01:59.799> blank

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
in blank will increase by 1 so in blank

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:08.759 
in blank will increase by 1 so in blank
plus<00:02:00.280> plus<00:02:00.579> if<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:04.000> input<00:02:04.179> is<00:02:04.659> equal<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:07.769> slash

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
plus plus if my input is equal to slash

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:19.259 
plus plus if my input is equal to slash
T<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:11.579> in<00:02:12.579> tab<00:02:13.000> will<00:02:13.930> increase<00:02:14.410> by<00:02:14.709> 1<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:18.269> my

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
T then in tab will increase by 1 if my

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:28.949 
T then in tab will increase by 1 if my
input<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:23.129> /n<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.769> line<00:02:27.359> will<00:02:28.359> increase<00:02:28.780> by

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
input is /n so in line will increase by

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.699 
input is /n so in line will increase by
1<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.500> length<00:02:29.680> plus<00:02:29.920> plus<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.500> all

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
1 so in length plus plus so this is all

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.160 
1 so in length plus plus so this is all
about<00:02:32.920> my<00:02:33.400> program<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.359> this<00:02:34.630> loop<00:02:34.900> will

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
about my program so this loop will

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.879 
about my program so this loop will
continue<00:02:35.709> until<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:37.079> find<00:02:38.079> aesthetic<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
continue until it find aesthetic and

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.680 
continue until it find aesthetic and
count<00:02:41.889> the<00:02:42.160> number<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.459> blank<00:02:42.849> number<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.389> tab

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
count the number of blank number of tab

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.520 
count the number of blank number of tab
and<00:02:43.900> number<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.139> line<00:02:44.579> so<00:02:45.579> I<00:02:46.030> will<00:02:46.569> use<00:02:46.870> printf

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and number of line so I will use printf

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.420 
and number of line so I will use printf
to<00:02:48.720> show<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.079> number<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.410> blank<00:02:53.099> number<00:02:54.099> of

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
to show the number of blank number of

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.039 
to show the number of blank number of
tab<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.180> number<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.690> line<00:02:55.959> in<00:02:56.440> my<00:02:56.500> program<00:02:58.049> in

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
tab and number of line in my program in

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:06.400 
tab and number of line in my program in
tab

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.860 

so<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.280> see<00:03:07.520> this<00:03:07.730> program<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:08.600> so

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
so you can see this program is not so

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.630 
so you can see this program is not so
difficult<00:03:10.270> it's<00:03:11.270> very<00:03:11.540> easy<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.170> have<00:03:13.130> to

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
difficult it's very easy you have to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:28.720 
difficult it's very easy you have to
understand<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.270> logic<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.900> that's<00:03:15.080> all

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.320 

so<00:03:29.300> this<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.989> all<00:03:30.140> about<00:03:30.290> my<00:03:30.709> program<00:03:31.010> now<00:03:31.940> I'm

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
so this is all about my program now I'm

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.540 
so this is all about my program now I'm
going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.870> show<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.170> how<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.980> work<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:36.519> have<00:03:37.519> to

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
going to show you how it work I have to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.960 
going to show you how it work I have to
set<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.090> document<00:03:38.510> control<00:03:38.780> s<00:03:39.790> start<00:03:40.790> without

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
set the document control s start without

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.350 
set the document control s start without
debugging<00:03:41.590> yes<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.500> box<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:47.150> can

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
debugging yes so this is the box you can

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.640 
debugging yes so this is the box you can
put<00:03:48.099> your<00:03:49.099> sentence<00:03:50.030> or<00:03:50.180> word<00:03:51.010> today<00:03:52.480> we<00:03:53.650> learn

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
put your sentence or word today we learn

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:05.729 
put your sentence or word today we learn
how<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:56.330> count<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:58.870> number<00:03:59.870> of<00:04:01.330> blank<00:04:03.459> line

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
how to count the number of blank line

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.259 
how to count the number of blank line
tab<00:04:06.819> in<00:04:08.349> C<00:04:09.349> so<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.610> program<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:11.060> write

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
tab in C so this is the program I write

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.380 
tab in C so this is the program I write
and<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.920> will<00:04:12.920> input<00:04:13.069> aesthetic<00:04:13.700> because<00:04:13.819> I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
and I will input aesthetic because I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.210 
and I will input aesthetic because I
want<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.110> end<00:04:15.380> my<00:04:15.850> sentence<00:04:17.139> steak<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.010> can

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
want to end my sentence steak so you can

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.550 
want to end my sentence steak so you can
see<00:04:19.430> number<00:04:19.729> of<00:04:19.910> blank<00:04:20.299> is<00:04:20.479> 13<00:04:20.900> number<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.320> tab

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
see number of blank is 13 number of tab

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.460 
see number of blank is 13 number of tab
is<00:04:21.709> 0<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.190> number<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.430> line<00:04:22.729> is<00:04:22.880> 1<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.900> now<00:04:24.410> you

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
is 0 and number of line is 1 so now you

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.010 
is 0 and number of line is 1 so now you
can<00:04:24.800> maybe<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.460> can<00:04:25.639> understand<00:04:26.120> what<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:26.900> the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
can maybe you can understand what is the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.700 
can maybe you can understand what is the
function<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.590> aesthetic<00:04:28.060> when<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.090> input

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
function of this aesthetic when I input

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.770 
function of this aesthetic when I input
aesthetic<00:04:30.970> then<00:04:31.970> my<00:04:32.150> while<00:04:32.389> loop<00:04:32.419> terminates

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
aesthetic then my while loop terminates

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.330 
aesthetic then my while loop terminates
as<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.740> result<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.850> can<00:04:34.880> see<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.950> number<00:04:37.250> of

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
as a result you can see the number of

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.219 
as a result you can see the number of
blank<00:04:37.639> number<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:38.180> tab<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.660> number<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:38.990> line

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
blank number of tab and number of line

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.730 
blank number of tab and number of line
so<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.940> way<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.720> can<00:04:42.020> count<00:04:42.500> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
so this is the way you can count the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.340 
so this is the way you can count the
number<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:43.160> blank<00:04:43.490> tab<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.419> line<00:04:44.690> in<00:04:45.050> C

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
number of blank tab and line in C

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.020 
number of blank tab and line in C
program<00:04:45.770> that's<00:04:46.550> all<00:04:46.789> for<00:04:47.030> today<00:04:47.330> thank<00:04:47.930> you
