the<00:00:00.630> mesh<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.290> amazing<00:00:03.200> coincidence<00:00:04.200> of

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
the mesh is this amazing coincidence of

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.460 
the mesh is this amazing coincidence of
aspects<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.569> textiles<00:00:06.569> because<00:00:06.839> it's<00:00:07.200> woven

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
aspects of textiles because it's woven

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.459 
aspects of textiles because it's woven
it's<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.639> fabric<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.179> wire<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.019> works

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
it's it's a fabric of wire but it works

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.830 
it's it's a fabric of wire but it works
kind<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.980> like<00:00:11.040> clay<00:00:11.550> but<00:00:12.030> then<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.330> actually

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
kind of like clay but then it's actually

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.760 
kind of like clay but then it's actually
metal<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.820> weld<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.719> solder<00:00:16.529> it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
metal and you can weld it and solder it

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.269 
metal and you can weld it and solder it
and<00:00:17.039> cut<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.150> torches<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.920> you<00:00:19.920> know<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
and cut it with torches and you know and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.060 
and cut it with torches and you know and
it's<00:00:20.400> very<00:00:20.640> very<00:00:20.910> very<00:00:21.119> sturdy<00:00:22.039> ideally<00:00:23.039> I

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it's very very very sturdy ideally I

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.450 
it's very very very sturdy ideally I
come<00:00:23.550> into<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.970> studio<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.680> start

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
come into the studio and I just start

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.779 
come into the studio and I just start
playing<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> material<00:00:27.930> really

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
playing and the material really

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.150 
playing and the material really
literally<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.060> speaks<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> me<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.590> suggests

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
literally just speaks to me and suggests

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.369 
literally just speaks to me and suggests
let's<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:38.149> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.600> how<00:00:39.750> low-tech

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
let's do this this is just how low-tech

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.240 
let's do this this is just how low-tech
we<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.860> around<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:43.110> whether<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.010> works

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
we get around here and whether it works

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
we get around here and whether it works
or<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.969> point<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.329> departure<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
or not that's a point of departure and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:57.040 
or not that's a point of departure and
then<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.469> from<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:49.160> putting<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.370> this

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.510 

and<00:00:58.050> I'll<00:00:58.200> press<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.739> material<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.430> I'll

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and I'll press the material and I'll

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.890 
and I'll press the material and I'll
just<00:00:59.700> kind<00:00:59.880> of<00:00:59.940> work<00:01:00.150> it<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.420> I'll<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.660> kind

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
just kind of work it and I'll just kind

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.600 
just kind of work it and I'll just kind
of<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.110> it<00:01:01.230> flowing<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.890> I've<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.309> created

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
of get it flowing is I've just created

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.960 
of get it flowing is I've just created
sort<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.150> a<00:01:03.300> wave<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.430> swell<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
sort of a wave just like a swell on the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.800 
sort of a wave just like a swell on the
ocean<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> swell<00:01:07.800> on<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.160> ocean<00:01:08.810> looks

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
ocean but a swell on the ocean looks

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.650 
ocean but a swell on the ocean looks
like<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> hip<00:01:10.800> or<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.310> looks<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> thigh<00:01:12.300> or

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
like a hip or it looks like a thigh or

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.680 
like a hip or it looks like a thigh or
it<00:01:12.750> looks<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.550> belly<00:01:14.550> or<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> shoulder<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
it looks like a belly or a shoulder and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.100 
it looks like a belly or a shoulder and
then<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.259> know<00:01:16.410> it'll<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:17.160> of<00:01:18.110> evolved

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
then you know it'll just kind of evolved

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.770 
then you know it'll just kind of evolved
from<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:20.550> sometimes<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.300> first<00:01:21.540> few

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
from there so sometimes in the first few

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.219 
from there so sometimes in the first few
minutes<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.800> most<00:01:23.220> generalized

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
minutes of just this most generalized

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.560 
minutes of just this most generalized
sketching<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.670> come<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.000> something<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
sketching I come up with something that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.920 
sketching I come up with something that
that<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.830> want<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> work<00:01:29.190> with<00:01:29.930> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that I really want to work with so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
that I really want to work with so
there's<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> 1%<00:01:31.860> inspiration<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.580> then<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
there's the 1% inspiration and then the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.570 
there's the 1% inspiration and then the
99%<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> perspiration<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
99% is the perspiration to make it

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.850 
99% is the perspiration to make it
happen<00:01:35.940> as<00:01:36.750> sturdy<00:01:37.080> as<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.800> very

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
happen as sturdy as it is it's very

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
happen as sturdy as it is it's very
pliable<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.259> malleable<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:42.590> resilient

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
pliable and malleable and and resilient

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.690 
pliable and malleable and and resilient
but<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.940> know<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.300> almost<00:01:45.600> any<00:01:45.869> metal<00:01:46.289> it's

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
but you know like almost any metal it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
but you know like almost any metal it's
it's<00:01:47.700> got<00:01:47.940> some<00:01:48.180> memory<00:01:48.539> -<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.899> got<00:01:49.110> some

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it's got some memory - it's got some

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
it's got some memory - it's got some
spring<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.280> can't<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> work

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
spring to it so you can't have to work

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
spring to it so you can't have to work
it<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.420> past<00:01:51.660> where<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.140> want<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it a little bit past where you want it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.660 
it a little bit past where you want it
and<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> springs<00:01:53.280> back<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:58.340> creativity<00:01:59.340> isn't

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and it springs back and creativity isn't

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.999 
and it springs back and creativity isn't
to<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.409> at<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.770> it's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
to me it's not about will at all it's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.370 
to me it's not about will at all it's
just<00:02:02.070> about<00:02:02.310> being<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.049> can

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
just about being there so that you can

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.400 
just about being there so that you can
receive<00:02:05.720> what's<00:02:06.720> available<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.439> receive

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.539 

there's<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.560> many<00:02:13.650> new<00:02:13.920> things<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.519> I

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
there's so many new things that I

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.650 
there's so many new things that I
haven't<00:02:14.760> even<00:02:14.880> tried<00:02:15.239> with<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.019> yet<00:02:17.329> so<00:02:18.329> it's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
haven't even tried with it yet so it's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.990 
haven't even tried with it yet so it's
it's<00:02:19.079> exciting<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.459> know<00:02:20.549> coming<00:02:20.790> into

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's exciting it's you know coming into

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
it's exciting it's you know coming into
the<00:02:21.180> shop<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.570> think<00:02:21.780> well<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.110> could<00:02:22.410> try<00:02:22.650> that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the shop I think well I could try that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.440 
the shop I think well I could try that
thing<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.250> I've<00:02:23.400> never<00:02:23.610> tried<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.269> might

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
thing that I've never tried and it might
