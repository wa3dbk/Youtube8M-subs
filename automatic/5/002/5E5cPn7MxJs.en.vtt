00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.349
 which still has a few 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.170
 secondary functions and so you download 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.510
 speedhack polls to activate it 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.500
 you can assign a button to yourself 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.640

 let's get here and now push home from 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.009
 I'm still a speedhack but honestly not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.040
 saw all asleep hacks that I saw then 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.380
 they are somehow with some gods glitches 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.990
 I don't like these, but this one 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.460
 normal and let's move on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.770
 additional functions 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.850
 of the English alphabet, this is I press and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.280
 we are a third-person view I think it is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.240
 conveniently the following is what I will show you 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.270
 slowing the player to accomplish this 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.800
 you have to click on the mouse wheel here 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.960
 So 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.420
 we all jumped squeezed mouse wheel 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.670
 and we smoothly descend very smoothly 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.190
 to see it better let's bring 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.220
 third person view we switched view from 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.690

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.780

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:47.930

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:51.610

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.010
