start you're gonna download who next you
want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> Gateway<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
want to get the Gateway for now and you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
want to get the Gateway for now and you
want<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.219> both<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.270> the

want to get both because this is the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.729 
want to get both because this is the
ultimately<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:55.079> work<00:00:55.230> together<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
ultimately they work together as a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
ultimately they work together as a
package<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.190> obvious<00:00:56.520> reasons<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.629> for

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
package for obvious reasons but for

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
package for obvious reasons but for
today<00:00:58.469> we're<00:00:58.800> gonna<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> gateway<00:00:59.609> we're

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
today we're gonna do the gateway we're

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.240 
today we're gonna do the gateway we're
gonna<00:00:59.879> download<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.160> we're<00:01:02.160> gonna

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
gonna download that and we're gonna

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.700 
gonna download that and we're gonna
start<00:01:02.699> our<00:01:03.420> Oracle<00:01:03.840> VirtualBox<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> then

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
start our Oracle VirtualBox and then

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.719 
start our Oracle VirtualBox and then
what<00:01:04.920> we're<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.670> to

do<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> select<00:02:14.489> your<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:15.599> internet

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
do is select your your internet

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.650 
do is select your your internet
connection<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.000> my<00:02:18.150> bridged<00:02:18.450> adapter

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
connection so this is my bridged adapter

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.710 
connection so this is my bridged adapter
from<00:02:19.200> my<00:02:19.349> USB<00:02:20.180> I'm<00:02:21.180> gonna<00:02:21.390> go<00:02:21.540> ahead<00:02:21.630> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
from my USB I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360 
from my USB I'm gonna go ahead and
select<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.049> as<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.410> adapter<00:02:22.829> one<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.250> then

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
select that as my adapter one and then

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.170 
select that as my adapter one and then
two<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:24.660> should<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.989> stayed<00:02:25.320> as<00:02:25.620> UNIX<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.609> on

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
two this should be stayed as UNIX and on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.680 
two this should be stayed as UNIX and on
your<00:02:27.359> internal<00:02:27.630> network<00:02:28.430> okay<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.480> we'll<00:02:30.570> go

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
your internal network okay so we'll go

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.589 
your internal network okay so we'll go
ahead<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.019> then<00:02:31.109> we'll<00:02:31.140> start<00:02:31.650> up

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.970 

this<00:02:36.599> might<00:02:36.810> take<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:37.050> minute<00:02:37.260> while<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.830> loads

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this might take a minute while it loads

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.020 
this might take a minute while it loads
of<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> first<00:02:39.030> time<00:02:39.300> here

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.820 

okay<00:02:45.240> UNIX<00:02:45.720> has<00:02:45.810> been<00:02:46.050> loaded<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.770> I'm

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
okay UNIX has been loaded up so I'm

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.440 
okay UNIX has been loaded up so I'm
gonna<00:02:47.010> go<00:02:47.160> ahead<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.459> accept<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:49.280> agreement

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
gonna go ahead and accept the agreement
