00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello aureilhan kid decorator 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.469
 vegetable we will see how 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.730
 plant a climbing plant on a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.730
 balcony or on a terrace 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.210
 will the terrace be shaded 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.410
 where to position in the sun according to 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.840
 that we will select the types of 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.060
 sun plants or millions brrr and 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.710
 the desired visual effect one can either 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.340
 want to make a blackout palisade 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.809
 to want to dress a wall everything depends 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.800
 a little bit of the effect we want to 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.019
 give 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.539
 we have two solutions an installation that 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.390
 will be fixed in which we define 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.460
 a planting place that we are going 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 adapt and that will not budge over 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.659
 time the second solution would consist 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.939
 to choose a tray with a structure 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.100
 riding a compact set that 

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:01.320
 would plant the plant the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.129
 run on the yard and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.129
 able to move the whole 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 we put our soil 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 you have to know that the vine is a 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.210
 plant that we are going to plant and there is 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.460
 besides always during his period 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.000
 rest period ie period 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.780
 winter 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.780
 frost free 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:52.640
 we build a hole and we come here 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.640
 cover with the rest of the land 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.790
 we will delicately loosen the part 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.790
 climber of the plant 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.930
 we're not going to high school around cables our 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.100
 vines then when palliate a plant 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.970
 you have to be careful not to 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.820
 break because it's still 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.720
 relatively fragile to finalize the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.640
 planting the vine 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.640
 we will put a dardois country 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.370
 now with respect 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.459
 maintenance 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.140
 what to remember is the size in 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.180
 winter period during the period of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 rest and after a while 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.780
 so there are nutrient stores 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 enough but after a while they 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.530
 may miss a little bit so 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.350
 we can put fertilizer additives 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.390
 solid slow diffusion that we will put 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.739
 in the on the periphery of the substrate and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.430
 who will feed the plant all around 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.430
 throughout the year 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.030
 our life is planted there you can 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.069
