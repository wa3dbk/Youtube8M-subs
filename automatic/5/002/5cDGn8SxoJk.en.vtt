00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
pseudo color is this stuff came in the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.979 
pseudo color is this stuff came in the
hexagonal<00:00:30.769> jar<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> flip<00:00:33.000> top<00:00:33.210> lid<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
hexagonal jar has a flip top lid the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.500 
hexagonal jar has a flip top lid the
problem<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.530> these<00:00:34.710> lids<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
problem with these lids was that is the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
problem with these lids was that is the
hinge<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.380> well<00:00:37.800> they're<00:00:37.950> supposed<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> be

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
hinge here well they're supposed to be

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.709 
hinge here well they're supposed to be
like<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.850> thing<00:00:38.969> holding<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.450> would

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
like a little thing holding it on would

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.720 
like a little thing holding it on would
usually<00:00:39.989> break<00:00:40.200> off<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:41.399> you'd<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
usually break off and then you'd have to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.639 
usually break off and then you'd have to
just<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.480> sitting<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
just have this sitting down but the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.139 
just have this sitting down but the
great<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:43.890> about<00:00:44.070> these<00:00:44.399> was<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.969> were

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
great thing about these was they were

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.389 
great thing about these was they were
they<00:00:46.079> create<00:00:46.350> an<00:00:46.440> excellent<00:00:46.829> seal<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.370> here

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
they create an excellent seal in here

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.709 
they create an excellent seal in here
especially<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> store<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.390> upside<00:00:48.690> down

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
especially if you store them upside down

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
especially if you store them upside down
the<00:00:49.079> liquid<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.559> rest<00:00:49.770> against<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> bottom

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the liquid would rest against the bottom

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.889 
the liquid would rest against the bottom
you<00:00:50.940> didn't<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> worry<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.600> these

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you didn't have to worry about these

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
you didn't have to worry about these
guys<00:00:51.960> drying<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.070> also<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> sort

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
guys drying out and also if you sort

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.369 
guys drying out and also if you sort
them<00:00:53.820> upside<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:55.079> through<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
them upside down you can see through the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.510 
them upside down you can see through the
bottom<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:55.980> were<00:00:56.039> clear<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
bottom because they were clear and you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160 
bottom because they were clear and you
can<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:56.879> color<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.210> had<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> then

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
can see what color you had so and then

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.319 
can see what color you had so and then
because<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.770> hexes<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.940> could<00:01:00.120> have

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
because there are hexes you could have

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
because there are hexes you could have
them<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.600> arranged<00:01:01.199> nice<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.829> neat<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.010> very

the UK 17.5 milliliters for these and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
the UK 17.5 milliliters for these and
they<00:01:12.150> were<00:01:12.240> under<00:01:12.450> contract<00:01:12.659> through<00:01:13.229> coat<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
from code arms in England so here is and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
from code arms in England so here is and
they're<00:01:38.189> even<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.640> by<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> same<00:01:39.030> name<00:01:39.240> deadly

nightshade<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> code<00:01:41.070> arms<00:01:41.369> paint

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
nightshade this is a code arms paint

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
nightshade this is a code arms paint
this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.840> 18<00:01:43.229> milliliters<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:45.030> pricing

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
this is 18 milliliters and the pricing

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
this is 18 milliliters and the pricing
on<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.189> even<00:01:47.189> though<00:01:47.280> having<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.700> shipped

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
on this I even though having it shipped

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
on this I even though having it shipped
from<00:01:48.329> England<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:48.869> live<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.320> England

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
from England I don't live in England

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.679 
from England I don't live in England
three<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.729> ship<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:51.509> England

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
three of these ship from England

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.620 
three of these ship from England
including<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> shipping<00:01:53.149> cost<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.509> as

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
including the shipping cost just as

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.840 
including the shipping cost just as
about<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.930> much<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.320> buying<00:01:55.710> three<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.579> these

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
about as much as buying three of these

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.990 
about as much as buying three of these
new<00:01:57.090> GW<00:01:57.960> paints<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.979> not<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> lot<00:01:59.729> more

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
new GW paints so it's not a lot more

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
new GW paints so it's not a lot more
expensive<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> same<00:02:01.560> formula<00:02:02.130> as

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
expensive and it's the same formula as

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.069 
expensive and it's the same formula as
this<00:02:02.579> older<00:02:02.880> GW<00:02:03.299> stuff<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.960> this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this older GW stuff so if you like this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380 
this older GW stuff so if you like this
little<00:02:04.229> GW<00:02:04.799> stuff<00:02:05.009> look<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.850> code<00:02:06.000> arms

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
little GW stuff look for code arms

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.789 
little GW stuff look for code arms
they're<00:02:06.659> still<00:02:06.990> making<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.350> those<00:02:07.500> colors

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
they're still making all those colors

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.119 
they're still making all those colors
same<00:02:08.069> formula<00:02:08.569> good<00:02:09.569> stuff<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.770> time<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
same formula good stuff at the time that

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.550 
same formula good stuff at the time that
they<00:02:11.280> made<00:02:11.459> these<00:02:11.760> by<00:02:12.180> code

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
they made these by code

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.370 
they made these by code
arms<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.489> also<00:02:13.700> had<00:02:14.000> available<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.780> the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
arms you also had available to you the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.680 
arms you also had available to you the
the<00:02:15.410> washes<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.580> then<00:02:17.060> they<00:02:17.239> had<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> line<00:02:17.660> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the washes and then they had a line of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.170 
the washes and then they had a line of
metallics<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:19.220> all<00:02:19.700> sorts<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.030> different

metallics with all sorts of different
colors<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.440> me<00:02:21.560> now<00:02:21.680> slick<00:02:21.890> and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
colors this is this to me now slick and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.860 
colors this is this to me now slick and
blue<00:02:22.190> but<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> purple<00:02:23.120> they<00:02:23.660> made

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
blue but this is a purple they made

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.140 
blue but this is a purple they made
purple<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.440> green<00:02:25.120> blue<00:02:26.739> copper<00:02:27.739> bronze<00:02:28.280> brass

purple a green blue copper bronze brass

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.630 
purple a green blue copper bronze brass
two<00:02:29.870> types<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.290> gold<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.920> three<00:02:31.160> types<00:02:31.370> of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
two types of gold and three types of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.259 
two types of gold and three types of
silver<00:02:32.420> thinks<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.319> what<00:02:33.650> they<00:02:33.769> had<00:02:33.950> out<00:02:34.269> and

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
silver thinks is what they had out and

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.839 
silver thinks is what they had out and
then<00:02:35.420> there's<00:02:35.630> also<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.069> wash<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.550> this

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
then there's also the the wash I this

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.670 
then there's also the the wash I this
armorer<00:02:38.330> wash<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.750> love<00:02:38.989> I'd<00:02:39.200> use<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.530> for

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
armorer wash I love I'd use it for

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.309 
armorer wash I love I'd use it for
almost<00:02:39.800> everything<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:41.150> use<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.540> for<00:02:41.720> bad<00:02:42.290> a

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
almost everything and I use it for bad a

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.110 
almost everything and I use it for bad a
black<00:02:42.680> actually<00:02:43.130> replaces<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:44.000> me

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
black actually replaces it for me

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.330 
black actually replaces it for me
because<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.450> was<00:02:44.569> running<00:02:44.720> low<00:02:45.019> on<00:02:45.049> this<00:02:45.380> but

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
because I was running low on this but

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.949 
because I was running low on this but
again<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.850> could<00:02:47.000> get<00:02:47.150> more<00:02:47.299> from<00:02:47.480> coat<00:02:47.660> arms

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
again I could get more from coat arms

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.830 
again I could get more from coat arms
but<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.200> didn't<00:02:48.470> know<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.769> then<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:50.660> is

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
but I didn't know that then this is

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.720 
but I didn't know that then this is
really<00:02:51.110> good<00:02:51.230> stuff

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
really good stuff

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.520 
really good stuff
so<00:02:52.730> then<00:02:52.880> GW<00:02:53.420> switches<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.110> then<00:02:54.319> they<00:02:54.410> go

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
so then GW switches and then they go

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.130 
so then GW switches and then they go
with<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.709> company<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.519> in<00:02:56.090> France<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.810> they

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
with a company and in France and they

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.259 
with a company and in France and they
reduce<00:02:57.920> how<00:02:58.190> much<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.489> get<00:02:58.670> normally<00:02:59.090> get

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
reduce how much you get normally get

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.870 
reduce how much you get normally get
17.5<00:03:00.019> not<00:03:00.230> only<00:03:00.410> getting<00:03:00.620> 12<00:03:00.830> milliliters<00:03:01.670> and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
17.5 not only getting 12 milliliters and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.250 
17.5 not only getting 12 milliliters and
these<00:03:02.510> jars<00:03:02.930> here<00:03:03.380> have<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.010> screw<00:03:04.310> top<00:03:04.489> lid

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
these jars here have the screw top lid

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.170 
these jars here have the screw top lid
what<00:03:06.260> sucks<00:03:06.709> about<00:03:06.890> these<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.819> if<00:03:08.030> you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
what sucks about these is that if you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.620 
what sucks about these is that if you
get<00:03:08.390> any<00:03:08.660> paint<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.830> threads<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.630> then

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
get any paint in the threads and then

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.300 
get any paint in the threads and then
you<00:03:11.750> close<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.260> then<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.680> dries<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.160> there

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
you close it and then it dries in there

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.000 
you close it and then it dries in there
sometimes<00:03:13.910> now<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.319> probably<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.830> bad

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
sometimes now this is probably a bad

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.819 
sometimes now this is probably a bad
example<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.609> can<00:03:16.840> if<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:17.959> look<00:03:18.170> not<00:03:18.350> too<00:03:18.530> far<00:03:18.799> I

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
example I can if I look not too far I

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.680 
example I can if I look not too far I
can<00:03:18.950> show<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.220> somewhere<00:03:19.489> I've<00:03:19.579> had<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.850> take

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
can show you somewhere I've had to take

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.740 
can show you somewhere I've had to take

take needle nose pliers or something and

try and get a grip on this just to get
some<00:03:25.880> some<00:03:26.420> torque<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.200> can<00:03:27.350> get<00:03:27.440> it

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
some some torque on it so I can get it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.970 
some some torque on it so I can get it

rehydrating<00:03:33.290> them<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.560> live<00:03:33.799> in<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:34.010> desert<00:03:34.250> so

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
rehydrating them I live in a desert so

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.150 
rehydrating them I live in a desert so
it's<00:03:34.940> very<00:03:35.239> problematic<00:03:36.019> for<00:03:36.049> me<00:03:36.350> there's

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
it's very problematic for me there's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.490 
it's very problematic for me there's
colors<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.670> have<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.060> don't<00:03:38.180> use<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:39.230> seems

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
colors I have that I don't use it seems

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.680 
colors I have that I don't use it seems
every<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.579> know<00:03:40.609> every<00:03:41.060> few<00:03:41.180> months<00:03:41.359> I've<00:03:41.569> got

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
every you know every few months I've got

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.910 
every you know every few months I've got
to<00:03:41.750> go<00:03:41.840> through<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.139> you<00:03:42.200> start<00:03:42.410> adding<00:03:42.590> water

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
to go through and you start adding water

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.039 
to go through and you start adding water
to<00:03:43.069> these<00:03:43.280> two<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:44.090> keep<00:03:44.269> them<00:03:44.420> going<00:03:44.690> for<00:03:44.900> me

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
to these two to keep them going for me

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.770 
to these two to keep them going for me
and<00:03:45.340> then<00:03:46.340> they<00:03:46.430> did<00:03:46.579> away<00:03:46.700> with<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.239> washes

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
and then they did away with the washes

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.080 
and then they did away with the washes
at<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.049> time<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.500> had<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.769> inks<00:03:49.160> as<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.940> can

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
at that time it had the inks as you can

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.390 
at that time it had the inks as you can
tell<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:51.290> inks<00:03:51.530> just<00:03:51.709> kind<00:03:51.889> of<00:03:51.920> leak<00:03:52.160> I

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
tell this the inks just kind of leak I

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.710 
tell this the inks just kind of leak I
like<00:03:52.819> this<00:03:52.970> red<00:03:53.150> ink<00:03:53.299> it's<00:03:53.450> what<00:03:53.569> I've<00:03:53.660> been

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
like this red ink it's what I've been

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.680 
like this red ink it's what I've been
using<00:03:53.930> for<00:03:54.079> blood<00:03:55.069> it<00:03:55.639> has<00:03:55.819> an<00:03:55.970> equality<00:03:56.540> that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
using for blood it has an equality that

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.080 
using for blood it has an equality that
you<00:03:56.989> can<00:03:57.139> see<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.410> shines<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.980> little<00:03:58.100> bit<00:03:58.370> when

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
you can see it shines a little bit when

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.330 
you can see it shines a little bit when
it<00:03:59.269> when<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.750> dries<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.880> then<00:04:03.160> there's<00:04:04.160> still

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
it when it dries and then there's still

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.039 
it when it dries and then there's still
the<00:04:04.459> same<00:04:04.639> company<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.090> presume<00:04:05.780> because

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
the same company I presume because

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.080 
the same company I presume because
they're<00:04:06.230> made<00:04:06.410> in<00:04:06.560> France<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.400> then<00:04:07.910> they

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
they're made in France and then they

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.660 
they're made in France and then they
switched<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:10.069> flip-top<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.980> problem<00:04:13.489> with

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
switched to a flip-top the problem with

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.060 
switched to a flip-top the problem with
this<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.150> when<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.359> have<00:04:14.600> this<00:04:14.720> open<00:04:15.070> if

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
this is that when you have this open if

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.770 
this is that when you have this open if
you've<00:04:16.280> got<00:04:16.430> paint<00:04:16.760> in<00:04:16.850> here<00:04:17.060> when<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:17.269> drops

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
you've got paint in here when it drops

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.500 
you've got paint in here when it drops
it's<00:04:18.169> going<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.410> drop<00:04:18.829> onto<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.220> lip<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:19.880> what

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
it's going to drop onto the lip so what

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.820 
it's going to drop onto the lip so what
I<00:04:20.539> do<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.049> have<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.200> little<00:04:21.500> bit<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.680> this

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
I do is I have a little bit of this

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.750 
I do is I have a little bit of this
stuff<00:04:21.979> here<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.729> plasticine<00:04:23.630> poster<00:04:24.140> tack

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
stuff here the plasticine poster tack

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.280 
stuff here the plasticine poster tack
that<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:24.970> can<00:04:25.120> prop<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.390> up<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.720> an<00:04:25.810> angle<00:04:26.140> so

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
that I can prop it up in an angle so

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.750 
that I can prop it up in an angle so
it's<00:04:26.470> going<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.680> drip<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:27.010> falls<00:04:27.250> back<00:04:27.490> down

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
it's going to drip it falls back down

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.330 
it's going to drip it falls back down
into<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.060> pot<00:04:28.270> but<00:04:29.110> these<00:04:29.260> are<00:04:29.380> okay<00:04:29.590> again

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
into the pot but these are okay again

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.320 
into the pot but these are okay again
I've<00:04:31.020> got<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.140> keep<00:04:32.290> them<00:04:32.440> keep<00:04:32.890> them<00:04:32.950> hydrated

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
I've got to keep them keep them hydrated

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.050 
I've got to keep them keep them hydrated
and<00:04:34.330> now<00:04:34.600> GW<00:04:35.230> has<00:04:35.440> switched<00:04:36.040> and<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.820> believe

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
and now GW has switched and I believe

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.890 
and now GW has switched and I believe
they're<00:04:37.150> going<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.300> be<00:04:37.390> switching<00:04:37.630> their

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
they're going to be switching their

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.460 
they're going to be switching their
whole<00:04:38.140> line<00:04:38.410> over<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.820> style<00:04:40.410> these<00:04:41.410> are

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
whole line over to this style these are

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.770 
whole line over to this style these are
made<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:42.070> China<00:04:42.100> they've<00:04:43.030> probably<00:04:43.270> gone<00:04:43.540> with

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
made in China they've probably gone with

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.560 
made in China they've probably gone with
a<00:04:43.810> yet<00:04:44.380> again<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> lowest<00:04:45.010> bitter<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.420> got

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
a yet again a lowest bitter and you got

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.180 
a yet again a lowest bitter and you got
the<00:04:46.720> same<00:04:46.900> issue<00:04:47.140> here<00:04:47.590> when<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.830> open<00:04:48.100> these

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
the same issue here when you open these

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.010 
the same issue here when you open these
up<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.610> see<00:04:48.940> how<00:04:49.030> that's<00:04:49.210> kind<00:04:49.450> of<00:04:49.540> drying

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
up and see how that's kind of drying

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.530 
up and see how that's kind of drying
around<00:04:50.410> there<00:04:50.680> got<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.430> keep<00:04:51.550> these<00:04:51.730> hydrated

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.290 

as<00:04:55.540> well<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.290> I<00:04:56.530> prop<00:04:57.430> them<00:04:57.610> up<00:04:57.790> so<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.180> they

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
as well and I prop them up so that they

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.390 
as well and I prop them up so that they
fall<00:04:58.870> back<00:04:59.050> into<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.380> pot<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.740> time<00:05:00.040> I've

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
fall back into the pot this time I've

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.270 
fall back into the pot this time I've
had<00:05:00.790> trouble<00:05:01.270> getting<00:05:01.540> them<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.740> seal<00:05:03.100> you

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
had trouble getting them to to seal you

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.380 
had trouble getting them to to seal you
want<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.490> make<00:05:03.610> sure<00:05:03.640> that<00:05:03.910> they're<00:05:04.060> sealed

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
want to make sure that they're sealed

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.760 
want to make sure that they're sealed
all<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.600> way<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.110> they've<00:05:05.230> got<00:05:05.380> this<00:05:05.500> little

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
all the way and they've got this little

try you don't have to water it down you

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.880 
try you don't have to water it down you
can<00:05:52.390> use<00:05:52.510> it<00:05:52.660> right<00:05:52.840> out<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.140> pot<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.650> I

know in past with washes there's you
something<00:05:57.880> about<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.240> surface<00:05:58.630> tension

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
something about the surface tension

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.560 
something about the surface tension
either<00:05:59.230> at<00:05:59.560> a<00:05:59.590> drop<00:05:59.890> of<00:06:00.070> soap<00:06:00.280> or<00:06:00.640> add<00:06:00.940> a<00:06:01.000> drop

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
either at a drop of soap or add a drop

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.050 
either at a drop of soap or add a drop
of<00:06:01.600> future<00:06:02.050> floor<00:06:02.770> wax<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.430> that<00:06:03.460> affects<00:06:03.910> if

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
of future floor wax and that affects if

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.850 
of future floor wax and that affects if
it's<00:06:04.210> going<00:06:04.390> to<00:06:04.450> go<00:06:04.930> into<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.230> cracks<00:06:05.560> or<00:06:05.770> if

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
it's going to go into the cracks or if

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.260 
it's going to go into the cracks or if
it's<00:06:05.980> going<00:06:06.070> to<00:06:06.130> kind<00:06:06.340> of<00:06:06.400> beat<00:06:06.820> up<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:07.120> stay

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
it's going to kind of beat up and stay

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.760 
it's going to kind of beat up and stay
on<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.450> surfaces<00:06:07.870> this<00:06:08.290> you<00:06:08.470> don't<00:06:08.590> have<00:06:08.680> to

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
on the surfaces this you don't have to

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.500 
on the surfaces this you don't have to
worry<00:06:08.860> about<00:06:08.920> any<00:06:09.190> of<00:06:09.340> that<00:06:09.490> is<00:06:09.640> just<00:06:10.180> go<00:06:10.360> ahead

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
worry about any of that is just go ahead

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.070 
worry about any of that is just go ahead
and<00:06:10.630> use<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:11.200> it's<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:12.070> I<00:06:12.340> even<00:06:13.240> say<00:06:13.930> it's

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
and use it and it's a I even say it's

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.820 
and use it and it's a I even say it's
idiot-proof

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
idiot-proof

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.970
