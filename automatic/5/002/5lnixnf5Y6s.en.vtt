where they are the difference is that

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.589 
where they are the difference is that
whether<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:45.220> Obama<00:02:45.609> seems<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.150> be<00:02:46.269> an<00:02:46.390> aunt

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
seems to be that he disparages half of
