00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
small piece that we're going to end up

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.830 
small piece that we're going to end up
hearing<00:00:29.699> directly<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.240> top<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
hearing directly on top of the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.380 
hearing directly on top of the
background<00:00:31.260> area<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> begin<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.270> just

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
background area so to begin I'm just

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
background area so to begin I'm just
going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> use<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.840> smaller<00:00:34.350> cardstock<00:00:35.219> piece

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
going to use the smaller cardstock piece

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.310 
going to use the smaller cardstock piece
first<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> take<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> stamp<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.989> ink<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.230> up

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
first and take the stamp and ink it up

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.130 
first and take the stamp and ink it up
with<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> soft<00:00:37.920> stone<00:00:38.280> shadow<00:00:38.670> ink<00:00:39.140> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
with the soft stone shadow ink this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
with the soft stone shadow ink this
stamp<00:00:40.440> has<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> lot<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> solid<00:00:41.370> area<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
stamp has a lot of solid area and the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
stamp has a lot of solid area and the
soft<00:00:42.600> stone<00:00:42.809> ink<00:00:43.050> works<00:00:43.230> great<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.649> images

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
soft stone ink works great for images

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
soft stone ink works great for images
like<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> very<00:00:46.079> dark

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
like this because it's not a very dark

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.889 
like this because it's not a very dark
ink<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.120> especially<00:00:48.120> when<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> dries<00:00:48.570> back

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
ink it especially when it dries back

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.200 
ink it especially when it dries back
after<00:00:49.739> you've<00:00:49.890> stamped<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
after you've stamped with it it's just a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.090 
after you've stamped with it it's just a
nice<00:00:51.480> subtle<00:00:51.809> color<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.440> works<00:00:52.620> perfectly

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
nice subtle color and works perfectly

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
nice subtle color and works perfectly
for<00:00:53.370> these<00:00:53.520> type<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> background<00:00:54.030> images<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.379> i

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
for these type of background images so i

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
for these type of background images so i
went<00:00:55.590> ahead<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> completely<00:00:56.309> covered<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
went ahead and completely covered the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
went ahead and completely covered the
stamp<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.660> i'm<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.140> lay

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
stamp with it and i'm just going to lay

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.889 
stamp with it and i'm just going to lay
my<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.949> white<00:00:59.190> panel<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.760> top<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.329> we're

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
my little white panel on top and we're

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.180 
my little white panel on top and we're
not<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> whole<00:01:01.590> image<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
not going to get the whole image as you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.709 
not going to get the whole image as you
can<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> panel<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> little

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
can see because the panel is a little

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.590 
can see because the panel is a little
bit<00:01:03.840> smaller<00:01:04.170> than<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.250> actual<00:01:05.400> stamp<00:01:05.880> but

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
bit smaller than the actual stamp but

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210 
bit smaller than the actual stamp but
you<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> Center<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.830> into

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you just kind of want to Center it into

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
you just kind of want to Center it into
the<00:01:08.340> center<00:01:08.670> area<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.450> pick<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.780> some

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the center area so that you pick up some

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.710 
the center area so that you pick up some
of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> stars<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.830> around<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> edge

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
of the stars that are around the edge

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.580 
of the stars that are around the edge
because<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> look<00:01:13.080> we're<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.439> for

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
because that's the look we're going for

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
because that's the look we're going for
we<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> want<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> look<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.030> sky

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
we kind of want it to look like the sky

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.690 
we kind of want it to look like the sky
but<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.770> bit<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.400> stars

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
but we do want a little bit of the stars

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
but we do want a little bit of the stars
to<00:01:17.939> peek<00:01:18.150> through<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> edges<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.470> once<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to peek through on the edges so once I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.830 
to peek through on the edges so once I
take<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> off<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.780> see

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
take it off there you can kind of see

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.030 
take it off there you can kind of see
it's<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> little<00:01:22.320> bit<00:01:22.409> hard<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.830> video

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's a little bit hard to see on video

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.249 
it's a little bit hard to see on video
because<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.729> ink<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.600> definitely<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
because this ink is this is definitely a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
because this ink is this is definitely a
lighter<00:01:25.439> color<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.119> great

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
lighter color but it's got this great

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.899 
lighter color but it's got this great
texture<00:01:28.259> e<00:01:28.290> finish<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.070> inside<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> then

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
texture e finish in the inside and then

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
texture e finish in the inside and then
it<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> few<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> white<00:01:31.110> stars<00:01:31.530> kind<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it has a few of the white stars kind of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.950 
it has a few of the white stars kind of
all<00:01:32.250> around<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> edges<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> really

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
all around the edges so just a really

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.920 
all around the edges so just a really
fun<00:01:33.990> look<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.890> tiny<00:01:35.189> piece<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.930> now

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
fun look for this tiny piece and now

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
fun look for this tiny piece and now
we're<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> try<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.590> mimic<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.340> same

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we're going to try and mimic the same

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.749 
we're going to try and mimic the same
stamped<00:01:39.270> design<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.200> larger<00:01:40.650> piece<00:01:40.829> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
stamped design on this larger piece but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.100 
stamped design on this larger piece but
because<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> stamp<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.990> bit

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
because the stamp is a little bit

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.679 
because the stamp is a little bit
smaller<00:01:43.500> than<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.579> background<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.479> can't

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
smaller than the background we can't

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
smaller than the background we can't
just<00:01:45.930> give<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.380> stamp<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.159> done<00:01:47.369> we

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
just give it one stamp and be done we

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
just give it one stamp and be done we
kind<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.329> creative<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
kind of have to get creative here so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.960 
kind of have to get creative here so
what<00:01:49.710> I'm<00:01:49.799> doing<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.189> I'm<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.610> ahead<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
what I'm doing is I'm going ahead and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
what I'm doing is I'm going ahead and
inking<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.329> stamp<00:01:51.689> once<00:01:51.899> again<00:01:52.490> with<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
inking the stamp once again with the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
inking the stamp once again with the
same<00:01:53.759> soft<00:01:54.090> stone<00:01:54.329> ink<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.320> taking

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
same soft stone ink and then just taking

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
same soft stone ink and then just taking
a<00:01:55.710> baby<00:01:55.950> wipe<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> kind<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> dabbing<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
a baby wipe and kind of dabbing the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.050 
a baby wipe and kind of dabbing the
bottom<00:01:57.840> area<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.710> stamp<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> reason

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
bottom area of that stamp and the reason

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.670 
bottom area of that stamp and the reason
I'm<00:02:00.149> doing<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.659> because<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.350> don't<00:02:01.619> want

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
I'm doing that is because I don't want

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.340 
I'm doing that is because I don't want
the<00:02:01.920> star<00:02:02.159> images<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.909> show<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:04.079> it's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the star images to show up because it's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.630 
the star images to show up because it's
going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> end<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.770> being<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.189> center<00:02:05.460> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
going to end up being in the center of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
going to end up being in the center of
the<00:02:05.939> card<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:07.170> also<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.890> want<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the card and I also kind of want to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
the card and I also kind of want to
soften<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.700> edge<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.479> stamp<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
soften the edge so that when we stamp it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.140 
soften the edge so that when we stamp it
on<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.530> take<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> paper<00:02:11.190> off<00:02:11.340> we<00:02:12.060> don't

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
on here and take the paper off we don't

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.880 
on here and take the paper off we don't
have<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> hard<00:02:12.780> line<00:02:13.080> running<00:02:13.349> down<00:02:13.590> this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
have a hard line running down this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
have a hard line running down this
center<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.580> piece<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.790> paper<00:02:15.319> kind<00:02:16.319> of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
center of that piece of paper kind of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.490 
center of that piece of paper kind of
making<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.800> obvious<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.490> stamped<00:02:17.940> image

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
making it obvious that the stamped image

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.350 
making it obvious that the stamped image
ended<00:02:19.500> there<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.610> kind<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> see<00:02:21.060> there

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
ended there so you can kind of see there

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.300 
ended there so you can kind of see there
that<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.870> kind<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.140> tapers<00:02:22.530> off<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that it just kind of tapers off and and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.340 
that it just kind of tapers off and and
just<00:02:23.880> kind<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.150> fades<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.020> goes<00:02:25.170> into

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
just kind of fades out as it goes into

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.140 
just kind of fades out as it goes into
the<00:02:25.500> center<00:02:25.800> area<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> paper<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.640> that's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the center area of the paper and that's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.510 
the center area of the paper and that's
what<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.420> want<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:29.220> I'm<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
what we want to see so now I'm going to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.250 
what we want to see so now I'm going to
go<00:02:29.610> ahead<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.819> ink<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.330> again<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.959> do<00:02:31.170> it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
go ahead and ink this up again and do it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.110 
go ahead and ink this up again and do it
the<00:02:31.350> exact<00:02:31.560> same<00:02:31.590> way<00:02:31.980> put<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.490> ink<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.850> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
the exact same way put the ink on and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.210 
the exact same way put the ink on and
then<00:02:33.240> take<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.690> baby<00:02:33.900> wipe<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.040> DAB

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
then take that baby wipe and kind of DAB

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.460 
then take that baby wipe and kind of DAB
away<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.610> color<00:02:35.820> at<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.150> bottom<00:02:36.300> again<00:02:36.630> but

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
away the color at the bottom again but

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.960 
away the color at the bottom again but
this<00:02:37.590> time<00:02:37.650> when<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.070> stamp<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.520> we're<00:02:38.730> going

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
this time when we stamp it we're going

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.330 
this time when we stamp it we're going
to<00:02:39.150> take<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.840> white<00:02:40.800> piece<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.010> paper<00:02:41.130> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
to take the white piece of paper and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.920 
to take the white piece of paper and
flip<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> around<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.239> we're<00:02:42.420> stamping<00:02:42.600> on

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
flip it around so that we're stamping on

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
flip it around so that we're stamping on
the<00:02:42.959> other<00:02:43.170> end<00:02:43.410> which<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.860> no<00:02:44.610> image<00:02:44.970> on<00:02:45.180> it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the other end which has no image on it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.510 
the other end which has no image on it
yet<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.770> we're<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.070> go<00:02:47.190> ahead<00:02:47.280> and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
yet and we're just going to go ahead and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.370 
yet and we're just going to go ahead and
lay<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.850> there<00:02:48.120> again<00:02:48.420> kind<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:48.989> position

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
lay that on there again kind of position

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.140 
lay that on there again kind of position
it<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.680> make<00:02:49.920> sure<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.520> get<00:02:50.880> this

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it so you make sure that you get this

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.090 
it so you make sure that you get this
all<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.630> star<00:02:51.840> images<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.860> doesn't<00:02:53.010> have

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
all the star images but it doesn't have

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.710 
all the star images but it doesn't have
to<00:02:53.280> be<00:02:53.340> perfect<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.120> what's<00:02:54.420> great<00:02:54.600> about

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
to be perfect that's what's great about

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.050 
to be perfect that's what's great about
a<00:02:54.930> background<00:02:55.440> stamp<00:02:55.800> like<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.760> edges

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
a background stamp like this the edges

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.540 
a background stamp like this the edges
aren't<00:02:57.269> completely<00:02:58.260> linear<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.370> kind

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
aren't completely linear it's just kind

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.710 
aren't completely linear it's just kind
of<00:03:00.080> gives<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:02.030> very<00:03:03.030> realistic<00:03:03.570> type

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
of gives you that very realistic type

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.150 
of gives you that very realistic type
looking<00:03:04.050> background<00:03:04.500> where<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.739> kind<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.980> just

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
looking background where it kind of just

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.280 
looking background where it kind of just
fades<00:03:05.430> all<00:03:05.610> over<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.910> place<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.930> can<00:03:07.110> see

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
fades all over the place so you can see

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.770 
fades all over the place so you can see
now<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> I've<00:03:07.860> done<00:03:08.519> both<00:03:08.700> ends<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.450> have

the center area white I'm not concerned

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.850 
the center area white I'm not concerned
about<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> middle<00:03:13.230> because<00:03:13.440> we're<00:03:13.680> going<00:03:13.769> to

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860

to see so I'm going ahead and adding ink

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.660 
to see so I'm going ahead and adding ink
to<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.709> stamp<00:03:22.709> again<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.549> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
to that stamp again but just in the

to that stamp again but just in the
corner<00:03:24.060> area<00:03:24.239> because<00:03:24.900> we<00:03:25.079> want<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.769> pick

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
corner area because we want to just pick

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.460 
corner area because we want to just pick
up<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.130> star<00:03:26.549> pattern<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.209> stamp<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.110> into

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
up the star pattern and stamp that into

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.710 
up the star pattern and stamp that into
the<00:03:28.620> white<00:03:29.280> area<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.120> kind<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.390> have<00:03:30.510> left

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the white area that we kind of have left

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.900 
the white area that we kind of have left
over<00:03:30.989> there<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.709> looks<00:03:31.860> terrible<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.610> the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
over there and it looks terrible and the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.330 
over there and it looks terrible and the
center<00:03:33.209> area<00:03:33.299> looks<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.320> terrible<00:03:34.739> but

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
center area looks really terrible but

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.080 
center area looks really terrible but
we're<00:03:35.489> not<00:03:35.579> going<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.760> worry<00:03:35.910> about<00:03:36.000> that

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
we're not going to worry about that

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.060 
we're not going to worry about that
because<00:03:36.360> as<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.810> dries<00:03:37.019> back<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.739> to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
because as it dries back it's going to

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.069 
because as it dries back it's going to
look<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.790> lot<00:03:38.910> more<00:03:38.970> even<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.630> we're<00:03:39.900> going<00:03:40.019> to

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
look a lot more even and we're going to

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.410 
look a lot more even and we're going to
cover<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.470> center<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.970> we'll<00:03:42.090> set<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.299> aside

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
cover the center so we'll set that aside

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.210 
cover the center so we'll set that aside
to<00:03:42.780> dry<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.230> work<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> next<00:03:43.799> part<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
to dry and work on the next part of the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.060 
to dry and work on the next part of the
card<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:45.269> have<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> white<00:03:45.750> panel<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.500> Nina

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
of ran in a circular motion and it's a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.300

the<00:04:38.120> lemon<00:04:38.419> yellow<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.199> I'm<00:04:39.290> going<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.500> go

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
the lemon yellow and I'm going to go

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.159 
the lemon yellow and I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:39.919> cut<00:04:40.130> those<00:04:40.639> three<00:04:40.970> out<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.449> since

the pencils on the back you're not going
to<00:04:43.820> see<00:04:44.030> any<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.389> those<00:04:44.540> lines<00:04:44.900> or<00:04:45.229> even<00:04:45.710> know

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
to see any of those lines or even know

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.710 
to see any of those lines or even know
that<00:04:46.220> we<00:04:46.370> used<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.729> pencil<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.210> did<00:04:47.360> any<00:04:47.510> type

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
that we used a pencil and did any type

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.390 
that we used a pencil and did any type
of<00:04:47.750> tracing<00:04:48.169> at<00:04:48.290> all<00:04:48.470> it's<00:04:49.010> just<00:04:49.100> going<00:04:49.310> to

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
of tracing at all it's just going to

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.400 
of tracing at all it's just going to
look<00:04:49.520> like<00:04:49.580> we<00:04:49.850> die<00:04:50.060> cut<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.479> moon<00:04:50.690> into<00:04:51.169> star

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
look like we die cut a moon into star

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.469 
look like we die cut a moon into star
shapes<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.669> can<00:04:52.790> see<00:04:52.940> there<00:04:53.090> now<00:04:53.270> I've

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
shapes so you can see there now I've

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.060 
shapes so you can see there now I've
went<00:04:53.660> ahead<00:04:53.780> cut<00:04:54.110> them<00:04:54.260> out<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.590> they're<00:04:54.979> just

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
went ahead cut them out and they're just

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.710 
went ahead cut them out and they're just
kind<00:04:55.280> of<00:04:55.340> sitting<00:04:55.550> there<00:04:55.760> on<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:55.970> panel<00:04:56.419> for

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
kind of sitting there on the panel for

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.820 
kind of sitting there on the panel for
right<00:04:56.900> now<00:04:56.930> while<00:04:57.290> I<00:04:57.320> figure<00:04:57.680> out<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
right now while I figure out the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.520 
right now while I figure out the
sentiment<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.389> sentiment<00:04:59.870> stamp<00:04:59.960> is<00:05:00.320> from

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
sentiment so the sentiment stamp is from

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.140 
sentiment so the sentiment stamp is from
the<00:05:00.650> shoot<00:05:00.830> for<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.100> moon<00:05:01.250> clear<00:05:01.580> stamp<00:05:01.880> set

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
the shoot for the moon clear stamp set

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.529 
the shoot for the moon clear stamp set
and<00:05:02.530> it's<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.620> little<00:05:03.860> bit<00:05:03.979> um<00:05:04.340> longer<00:05:05.300> than<00:05:05.449> I

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
and it's a little bit um longer than I

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.210 
and it's a little bit um longer than I
wanted<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:06.080> wanted<00:05:06.229> it<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.650> kind<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.919> have<00:05:07.070> the

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
wanted I wanted it to kind of have the

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.800 
wanted I wanted it to kind of have the
first<00:05:07.370> part<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.850> saying<00:05:08.090> on<00:05:08.360> this<00:05:08.539> little

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
first part of the saying on this little

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.140 
first part of the saying on this little
front<00:05:09.650> piece<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.220> then<00:05:10.310> have<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.760> inside

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
front piece and then have the inside

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.390 
front piece and then have the inside
saying<00:05:11.419> on<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.840> inside<00:05:12.169> so<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.740> just<00:05:12.979> cut<00:05:13.190> the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
saying on the inside so I just cut the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.430 
saying on the inside so I just cut the
bottom<00:05:13.699> off<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.210> stamp<00:05:14.510> which<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.199> for

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
bottom off of the stamp which is the for

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.770 
bottom off of the stamp which is the for
you<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:16.250> don't<00:05:16.789> worry<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.270> you<00:05:17.300> can<00:05:17.570> still<00:05:17.750> use

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
you it don't worry and you can still use

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.990 
you it don't worry and you can still use
it<00:05:18.110> as<00:05:18.229> it<00:05:18.410> was<00:05:18.440> intended<00:05:18.650> if<00:05:19.100> you<00:05:19.310> don't<00:05:19.729> want

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
it as it was intended if you don't want

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.420 
it as it was intended if you don't want
to<00:05:20.330> always<00:05:20.780> have<00:05:21.139> them<00:05:21.350> separated<00:05:21.919> since

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
to always have them separated since

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.010 
to always have them separated since
they're<00:05:22.699> clear<00:05:22.970> they<00:05:23.150> easily<00:05:23.419> fit<00:05:23.840> back

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
they're clear they easily fit back

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.740 
they're clear they easily fit back
together<00:05:24.169> no<00:05:24.560> problem<00:05:24.889> at<00:05:24.979> all<00:05:25.100> and<00:05:25.630> now<00:05:26.630> I'm

together no problem at all and now I'm
just<00:05:26.780> going<00:05:27.020> ahead<00:05:27.410> I've<00:05:27.800> stamped<00:05:28.100> that<00:05:28.310> on

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430

where I want my the big die cut or not
they<00:05:33.139> looked<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.680> cut<00:05:33.979> but<00:05:34.130> this<00:05:34.310> dental<00:05:34.669> cut

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
they looked I cut but this dental cut

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.760

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
pieces and I have those kind of just

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.500 
pieces and I have those kind of just
sitting<00:05:37.039> there<00:05:37.070> while<00:05:37.400> I<00:05:37.460> go<00:05:37.700> ahead<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.210> stamp

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
sitting there while I go ahead and stamp

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.330 
sitting there while I go ahead and stamp
some<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.050> stars<00:05:39.349> from<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.889> shoot<00:05:40.070> for<00:05:40.250> the

some of the stars from the shoot for the
moon<00:05:40.490> stamp<00:05:40.820> set<00:05:41.120> onto<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.630> background<00:05:42.080> with

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
moon stamp set onto the background with

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.980 
moon stamp set onto the background with
the<00:05:42.830> same<00:05:43.039> soft<00:05:43.370> vanilla<00:05:43.700> ink<00:05:43.940> as<00:05:44.120> them<00:05:44.330> as<00:05:44.630> the

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
the same soft vanilla ink as them as the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.400 
the same soft vanilla ink as them as the
we<00:05:45.289> used<00:05:45.470> for<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.770> moon<00:05:45.979> and<00:05:46.280> there's<00:05:46.880> no

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
we used for the moon and there's no

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.990 
we used for the moon and there's no
pattern<00:05:48.410> I'm<00:05:48.710> just<00:05:48.860> kind<00:05:49.099> of<00:05:49.190> stamping<00:05:49.880> them

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
pattern I'm just kind of stamping them

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.820 
pattern I'm just kind of stamping them
randomly<00:05:50.360> all<00:05:50.750> around<00:05:51.080> just<00:05:51.320> filling<00:05:51.590> in<00:05:51.650> some

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
randomly all around just filling in some

of the blank space and tying look the

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.080 
of the blank space and tying look the
moon<00:05:54.560> and<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.860> stars<00:05:54.979> into<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.669> background

outside<00:07:54.620> and<00:07:55.100> looks<00:07:55.670> like<00:07:55.790> you<00:07:55.970> stamped<00:07:56.360> it

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:56.480 
outside and looks like you stamped it

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.750 
outside and looks like you stamped it
completely<00:07:56.960> with<00:07:57.140> one<00:07:57.410> stamp<00:07:57.740> even<00:07:58.400> though<00:07:58.520> we

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:58.760 
completely with one stamp even though we

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.280 
completely with one stamp even though we
know<00:07:58.910> we<00:07:58.940> used<00:07:59.210> a<00:07:59.390> smaller<00:07:59.660> stamp<00:08:00.020> for<00:08:00.200> the

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:00.290 
know we used a smaller stamp for the

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.440 
know we used a smaller stamp for the
larger<00:08:00.620> area<00:08:00.920> so<00:08:01.670> thanks<00:08:02.030> so<00:08:02.090> much<00:08:02.240> for
