00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
these new style of figures I guess you

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.670 
these new style of figures I guess you
could<00:03:02.910> say<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.630> articulation<00:03:04.350> allows

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
could say that the articulation allows

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.860 
could say that the articulation allows
them<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.190> posed<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.670> such<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> way<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.150> it's

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
them to be posed in such a way that it's

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.440 
them to be posed in such a way that it's
easy<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.470> knock<00:03:07.650> them<00:03:07.830> off<00:03:07.980> balance<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:09.150> if

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
easy to knock them off balance so if

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.580 
easy to knock them off balance so if
you're<00:03:09.660> going<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> want<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.020> pose<00:03:10.260> them<00:03:10.470> in

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
you're going to want to pose them in

you're going to want to pose them in
some<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.830> these<00:03:10.890> crazy<00:03:11.190> shapes<00:03:11.520> figure<00:03:12.150> stands
