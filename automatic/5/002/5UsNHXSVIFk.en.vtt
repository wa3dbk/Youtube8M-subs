like pit breaks in the trolley paper

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.670 
like pit breaks in the trolley paper
tends<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.389> be<00:05:15.479> lower<00:05:15.720> because<00:05:16.110> it's<00:05:16.470> more

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
tends to be lower because it's more

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.460 
tends to be lower because it's more

much higher but in my experience you can

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.560 
much higher but in my experience you can
