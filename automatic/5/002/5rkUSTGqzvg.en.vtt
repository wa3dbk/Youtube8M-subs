00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.800
 Hey 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
 9 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:13.599
 a 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.139
 the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.289
 in London 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.489
 18 39 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:20.980
 the first traces 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.109
 Well 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.900
 Hey 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.269
 then the first jumped with her weight 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.339
 the people sighed that transport would be faster and better than 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.570
 with the carriage and with the tow bar 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.360
 that was particularly disappointing in the beginning 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.620
 the train actually shot just as bad as a coach 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.750
 also the derailed train quite often that was not only dangerous it cost 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 time 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.100
 then the barge was even faster 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.610
 on October 3, 18 43 for accidents on a test drive from hair to lead the 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.060
 locomotive estate because a bridge keeper plowed the role over the warmer members 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.290
 had not locked properly 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.460
 the locomotive for under the dyke the stoke died 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.090
 the travelers quickly charge for the barge in the diesels 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.800
 keel was the train too 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.800
 there were three classes for the train bus waiting hammers 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.640
 but a few both pay for cheapest ticket to Amsterdam and Rotterdam 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.400
 and third phase weeks wage 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.430
 the railways had to lower the rates 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.810
 and then many people saw for the first time in their lives 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.570
 between 9 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 Amsterdam 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.710
 4 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.300
 around 1900 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.540
 as the train became the main means of transport for passengers 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.260
 and for freight 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.750
 such a 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.060
 my motto 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.320
 her head 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.400
 not at all 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.760
 the roles 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.430
 what do you think of traveling by train 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.359
 yes i just like to have a crazy one most of the time 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.879
 only it is always a bit messy is international law when you enter the game 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:07.710
 alongside 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.249
 beautiful things and really looking forward to buying 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:14.579
 that is just nice sometimes a lot smaller fulham because he often 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.310
 traffic jams are fast legs 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.569
 his contract states that it is quite funny on the first day that it is quite 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.069
 many people are sitting 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.249
 she sits in his stomach with the card putting funny to see the authorities 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.270
 as it nears its end, liem 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.279
 not so hard 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.359
 but with the train down adapted to it itself nice 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.119
 is this a means of transport of the future 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:40.459
 I don't think it is a proposal for it to be 6 because the year is too much 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.729
 in halle 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.999
 who hit the other layout in the train on the couch and because of it 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.559
 price tag in I think they are actually weird 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.400
 increasingly with a small cell these people had demanded it becomes more expensive 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.230
 and ds I think that people will eventually see that it might just be 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.999
 easy to travel by public transportation I think so 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.099
 will go much faster with transport later 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.120
 I think they have heard of families in total don't think you are 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.399
 told times 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:17.419
 because madge are doing experiments and so he sees one too 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.419
 very small particle can move to another place 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.829
 within a second 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.829
 and is very far away between free and 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.589
 escom even a small defeat 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.089
 what is your favorite means of transport 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:33.620
 include forces 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.400
 we get 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.369
 so put 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.329
 see the car rise and he jumped forward 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.779
 the feet 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:41.849
 this still needed 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.209
 to travel as far as million euros can see through webcams in service 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.239
 take
