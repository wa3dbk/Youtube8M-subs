00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
of gradually trying to eliminate figure

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.539 
of gradually trying to eliminate figure
out<00:00:12.929> what's<00:00:13.200> needed<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.679> what's<00:00:13.950> not<00:00:14.160> eating

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
out what's needed and what's not eating

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.330 
out what's needed and what's not eating
for<00:00:14.580> example<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.389> was<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.770> line<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.949> came<00:00:17.160> out

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
for example it was a line that came out

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.500 
for example it was a line that came out
of<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.240> ran<00:00:18.480> into<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.760> has<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> thing

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
of here it ran into here it has a thing

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
of here it ran into here it has a thing
that<00:00:21.779> goes<00:00:21.900> back<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.500> their<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> thing

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
that goes back to their and the thing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.439 
that goes back to their and the thing
that<00:00:23.880> throws<00:00:24.779> over<00:00:25.050> into<00:00:25.500> there<00:00:26.000> I'm<00:00:27.000> thinking

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449

don't feel another one right here i have
a<00:02:17.650> little<00:02:18.150> sending<00:02:19.150> units<00:02:19.480> probably<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.870> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
a little sending units probably going to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.290 
a little sending units probably going to
be<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.050> temperature<00:02:20.650> sending<00:02:21.100> unit<00:02:21.400> i<00:02:21.610> got<00:02:22.269> a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
be a temperature sending unit i got a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.090 
be a temperature sending unit i got a
gas<00:02:22.540> line<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.019> goes<00:02:23.050> over<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> motor<00:02:23.739> here

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
gas line that goes over the motor here

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
gas line that goes over the motor here
and<00:02:24.190> i<00:02:24.220> got<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> heater<00:02:24.730> hose<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.300> goes<00:02:25.360> over

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and i got a heater hose that goes over

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.690 
and i got a heater hose that goes over
here<00:02:26.110> hopefully<00:02:26.500> i<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.590> lift<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.069> enough<00:02:27.519> to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
here hopefully i can lift that enough to

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.970 
here hopefully i can lift that enough to
get<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.900> off<00:02:29.110> there<00:02:29.410> without<00:02:29.590> having<00:02:29.890> to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
get that up off there without having to

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.680 
get that up off there without having to
disconnect<00:02:30.519> because<00:02:30.700> i<00:02:31.060> always<00:02:31.180> hate<00:02:31.480> to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
disconnect because i always hate to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.170 
disconnect because i always hate to
break<00:02:32.560> open<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.040> cooling<00:02:33.400> system<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.000> still

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
break open the cooling system and still

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.030 
break open the cooling system and still
antifreeze<00:02:34.510> all<00:02:34.989> over<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.320> place<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.829> I<00:02:35.890> got

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
antifreeze all over the place and I got

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.920 
antifreeze all over the place and I got
this<00:02:36.190> one<00:02:36.250> wire<00:02:36.730> here<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.209> runs<00:02:37.329> over<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
this one wire here that runs over to the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.340 
this one wire here that runs over to the
cylinder<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:39.670> looks<00:02:39.850> like<00:02:39.940> somebody<00:02:40.420> rerigged

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
cylinder it looks like somebody rerigged

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.729 
cylinder it looks like somebody rerigged
starter<00:02:41.890> wire<00:02:42.100> here<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.049> think<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.410> can<00:02:44.440> work

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
starter wire here but I think I can work

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.729 
starter wire here but I think I can work
around<00:02:44.950> all<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.170> I'll<00:02:47.170> start<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
around all that so I'll start the

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.840 
around all that so I'll start the
process<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:49.170> loosening<00:02:50.170> up<00:02:50.459> valve<00:02:51.459> cover

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
process of loosening up valve cover

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.580 
process of loosening up valve cover
bolts<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.570> if<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.049> baby<00:02:53.320> off

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
bolts and see if I can get this baby off

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.270 
bolts and see if I can get this baby off
of<00:02:53.769> here<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.480> clean<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.660> all<00:02:55.780> up<00:02:55.810> put<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:57.130> back

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
of here and clean it all up put it back

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.789 
of here and clean it all up put it back
on<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.730> can<00:02:57.850> see<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.150> looks<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.320> plenty

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
on you can see this looks like a plenty

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.580 
on you can see this looks like a plenty
of<00:02:59.920> oil<00:03:00.130> leak<00:03:00.730> activity<00:03:01.570> right<00:03:01.959> in<00:03:02.140> here<00:03:02.410> now

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
of oil leak activity right in here now

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.530 
of oil leak activity right in here now
that<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:03.549> stuff's<00:03:03.850> I'll<00:03:04.030> away<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.450> can

there so let's see if I can get this

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.420 
there so let's see if I can get this
thing<00:03:20.380> off<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:20.799> here<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.130> we'll<00:03:21.250> go<00:03:21.400> from

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
thing off of here and we'll go from

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.670 
thing off of here and we'll go from
there
