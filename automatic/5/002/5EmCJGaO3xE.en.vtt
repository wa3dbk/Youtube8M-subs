00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
in learning amongst those things and

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.710 
in learning amongst those things and
then<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.620> ideas<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.720> kindergarteners

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
then the ideas that the kindergarteners

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.589 
then the ideas that the kindergarteners
generate<00:02:14.290> are<00:02:14.760> basically<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:16.000> end<00:02:16.180> up<00:02:16.329> being

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
generate are basically what end up being

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.979 
generate are basically what end up being
our<00:02:16.690> rules<00:02:17.049> for<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> year<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.420> type<00:02:19.750> up

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.210 
next week and laminate it and show them
their<00:02:27.670> rules<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.480> they<00:02:28.510> created<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:30.040> end

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
their rules that they created so we end

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.979 
their rules that they created so we end
up<00:02:30.400> with<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.790> very<00:02:31.150> similar<00:02:31.480> rules

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
up with actually very similar rules

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.770 
up with actually very similar rules
every<00:02:32.379> year<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:33.609> they<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.389> same

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
every year because they have the same

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.470 
every year because they have the same
concerns<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.560> all<00:02:35.910> kindergarteners<00:02:36.910> have<00:02:37.150> and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
concerns at all kindergarteners have and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.539 
concerns at all kindergarteners have and
so<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.959> really<00:02:38.500> like<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.859> idea<00:02:38.889> of<00:02:39.250> generating

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
so I really like the idea of generating

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.120 
so I really like the idea of generating
those<00:02:40.000> rules<00:02:40.299> i'll<00:02:40.510> put<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> date<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.829> and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
those rules i'll put a date on it and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.430 
those rules i'll put a date on it and
sometimes<00:02:42.340> even<00:02:42.670> with<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.030> older<00:02:43.299> kids<00:02:43.569> in

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
sometimes even with the older kids in

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.289 
sometimes even with the older kids in
the<00:02:44.590> fall<00:02:44.829> we<00:02:45.040> always<00:02:45.310> sit<00:02:45.519> down<00:02:45.730> together<00:02:46.000> and

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
the fall we always sit down together and

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.680 
the fall we always sit down together and
i'll<00:02:47.049> say<00:02:47.910> remember<00:02:48.910> these<00:02:49.030> rules<00:02:49.329> you<00:02:49.540> made

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
i'll say remember these rules you made

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.270 
i'll say remember these rules you made
last<00:02:49.900> year<00:02:50.170> remember<00:02:50.319> these<00:02:50.590> rules<00:02:50.889> you<00:02:51.040> made

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
last year remember these rules you made

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.009 
last year remember these rules you made
three<00:02:51.670> or<00:02:51.850> four<00:02:52.120> years<00:02:52.329> ago<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.930> they're

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
three or four years ago and they're

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.930 
three or four years ago and they're
somewhat<00:02:53.380> similar<00:02:53.859> and<00:02:54.069> we<00:02:54.160> look<00:02:54.579> them<00:02:54.790> over

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
somewhat similar and we look them over

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.080 
somewhat similar and we look them over
can<00:02:55.720> we<00:02:55.870> still<00:02:56.170> agree<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.709> these<00:02:56.859> this<00:02:57.819> year

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
can we still agree to these this year

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.349 
can we still agree to these this year
for<00:02:58.329> our<00:02:58.389> studies<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.650> that's<00:03:00.579> basically<00:03:01.060> how

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
for our studies and that's basically how

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.020 
for our studies and that's basically how
they<00:03:01.690> evolve<00:03:02.079> oh<00:03:02.349> it<00:03:02.530> turns<00:03:02.829> out<00:03:03.099> that<00:03:03.370> we

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
they evolve oh it turns out that we

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.460 
they evolve oh it turns out that we
always<00:03:04.209> end<00:03:04.510> up<00:03:04.599> with<00:03:04.780> about<00:03:04.810> four<00:03:05.260> or<00:03:05.290> five

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
always end up with about four or five

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.069 
always end up with about four or five
rules<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.150> i<00:03:07.299> said<00:03:07.510> just<00:03:07.720> through<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
rules with like i said just through the

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.360 
rules with like i said just through the
kids<00:03:08.290> coming<00:03:08.620> up<00:03:08.709> with<00:03:08.859> them<00:03:08.980> or<00:03:09.130> through

kids coming up with them or through
certain<00:03:09.639> leading<00:03:10.180> questions<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:12.370> of

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
certain leading questions and one of

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.390 
certain leading questions and one of
them<00:03:12.669> is<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:14.859> treat<00:03:15.190> everyone<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.299> everything

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
nicely they'll come up with different

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.360 
nicely they'll come up with different
wordings<00:03:20.109> for<00:03:20.349> that<00:03:20.500> some<00:03:20.829> will<00:03:20.980> say<00:03:21.130> with

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
wordings for that some will say with

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.040

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
where where they can walk so walk on the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.440 
where where they can walk so walk on the
paths<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.670> course<00:03:36.880> we<00:03:37.030> try<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.240> frame

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
paths and of course we try to frame

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.040 
paths and of course we try to frame
everything<00:03:37.750> in<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.080> positive<00:03:38.260> way<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:40.300> walk<00:03:40.750> on

everything in a positive way so walk on

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.210 
everything in a positive way so walk on
the<00:03:41.320> paths<00:03:42.750> stay<00:03:43.750> within<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.500> garden<00:03:44.920> gates

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
the paths stay within the garden gates

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.060 
the paths stay within the garden gates
that<00:03:45.640> comes<00:03:45.970> up<00:03:46.210> as<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:47.170> know<00:03:47.290> when<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.590> if<00:03:47.890> I
