00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
different video game I mean I I don't

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
different video game I mean I I don't
know<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.979> great<00:01:44.280> what

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.120 
they've done
it<00:01:47.960> showed<00:01:48.110> like<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.289> difference<00:01:48.740> like<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
it showed like a difference like the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.160 
it showed like a difference like the
polygons<00:01:49.670> look<00:01:50.450> at<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.600> look<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:50.960> mesh

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
polygons look at the look of the mesh

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.700 
polygons look at the look of the mesh
textures<00:01:51.740> there<00:01:51.979> look<00:01:52.969> like<00:01:53.180> difference<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
textures there look like difference the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.029 
textures there look like difference the

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
gnome and look at the facial expressions

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.090 
gnome and look at the facial expressions
I<00:01:58.250> mean<00:01:58.490> it's<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:59.500> there<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.649> be<00:02:00.710> able<00:02:00.890> to

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
and although they're not as bad as the

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.930 
and although they're not as bad as the
vanilla<00:05:01.900> races<00:05:02.380> they'd<00:05:03.160> need<00:05:03.400> help<00:05:03.639> still

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
vanilla races they'd need help still

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.150 
vanilla races they'd need help still
they<00:05:04.539> would<00:05:04.960> look<00:05:05.139> they<00:05:05.650> would<00:05:05.830> look<00:05:05.950> really

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
out of place so hopefully they do them

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.980 
out of place so hopefully they do them

really<00:05:23.139> interesting<00:05:23.590> this<00:05:23.680> topic<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.220> can't

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
really interesting this topic I can't

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.980 
really interesting this topic I can't
wait<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.580> see<00:05:24.789> more<00:05:24.940> information<00:05:25.180> as<00:05:25.720> time

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
wait to see more information as time

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.310 
wait to see more information as time
allows<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:27.400> think<00:05:27.970> that<00:05:28.090> you<00:05:28.630> see<00:05:28.810> more<00:05:29.020> than

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
allows I think that you see more than

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.200 
allows I think that you see more than
twenty-five<00:05:29.740> percent<00:05:29.860> done<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.610> they<00:05:31.030> say

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
twenty-five percent done that they say

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.550 
twenty-five percent done that they say
it<00:05:31.270> took<00:05:31.479> twenty<00:05:31.780> five<00:05:31.960> or<00:05:31.990> thirty<00:05:32.139> percent

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
it took twenty five or thirty percent

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.189 
it took twenty five or thirty percent
done<00:05:32.770> last<00:05:32.949> time<00:05:33.479> maybe<00:05:34.479> they<00:05:34.660> are<00:05:34.810> if<00:05:35.080> you've

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
done last time maybe they are if you've

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.270 
done last time maybe they are if you've
structured<00:05:35.560> all<00:05:35.770> out<00:05:35.949> I<00:05:35.979> guess

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
structured all out I guess

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.680 
structured all out I guess
percentage-wise<00:05:36.940> maybe<00:05:37.389> they're<00:05:37.570> actually

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
percentage-wise maybe they're actually

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.870 
percentage-wise maybe they're actually
being<00:05:37.960> literal<00:05:38.410> but<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.280> think<00:05:39.580> they've<00:05:39.699> done<00:05:39.820> a

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
being literal but I think they've done a

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.790 
being literal but I think they've done a
great<00:05:40.090> job<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.599> you<00:05:41.380> know<00:05:41.470> they<00:05:41.590> should<00:05:41.740> be

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
great job and you know they should be

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.490 
great job and you know they should be
proud<00:05:42.010> of<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.280> so<00:05:42.780> all<00:05:43.780> right<00:05:43.900> be<00:05:44.289> back<00:05:44.470> later

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
proud of it so all right be back later

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.050 
proud of it so all right be back later
and<00:05:44.830> I'm<00:05:44.949> with<00:05:45.370> more<00:05:45.550> information
