00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.390
 walter beginning living a new stage 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.590
 within road tourism with this 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.380
 year 2015 if that's the beginning 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.840
 pretty cute not a new challenge with 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.620
 these new cars also the engines 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.250
 so how good accommodating this 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 again how could you say regulation 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 with a lot of work is to say the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.900
 expectation is a lot so it's 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.750
 working hard accommodating too 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.850
 new staff and good many things 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 new for this 2015 that we hope that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.660
 be the best way the most important 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 it's going to be the same for everyone 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.350
 they will have practically the same car 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.239
 the same construction 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.820
 will work better than the best 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.549
 put to the point that that is the idea the idea 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.540
 It also made the costs a lot cheaper 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.600
 something also good to do 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.160
 the load of the car was greatly reduced 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.250
 say mostly in the front 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.200
 so in all that they will surely be 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.490
 most beautiful careers that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.860
 is going to have to have more overrides like this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.110
 that we hope that it happens in cute 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.700
 shows one understands that the pilot 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.439
 will have greater participation in the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 sensitivity for the set-up of 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.460
 the cars in this case in this stimulus 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.500
 in this new stage look I think so 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.439
 it's going to be very important the pilot is going to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 occupy a more preponderant place of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.770
 I had 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 and there 's also the part of the engine that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.480
 the engines are going to be very similar 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.420
 now 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.540
 so that's going to make it too very 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.400
 like who says that the pilot is going to 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.190
 have to take advantage of the car a hundred 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.000
 hundred and at the time this was the idea of 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.970
 years ago and it starts up this year so 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.820
 putting all the lack of charge 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.550
 front in this case it will not be total 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.530
 but it's going to be partly my idea was 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.770
 that was total, especially the part 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.300
 front and leave 40% behind that is 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.360
 where he needs it and where does that 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.970
 little dangerous but good acting 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.920
 to the extent that it was taken 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.570
 if I think it's going to help a 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.580
 car and behind another is not going to 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.790
 harming so much in the face of harming him 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.000
 is that it benefited him so what good 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.770
 it's a path this is going to be better and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.170
 I think that's going to be that they look 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.930
 much better races much more cute 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.790
 shows especially in some kind of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.430
 circuits where sometimes the races 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.350
 we were very monotonous in agreement as 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.880
 come working can be considered 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.280
 that before the first of the year they will 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.440
 have to be able to try all the cars 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.350
 with regard to what is the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.940
 chassis I think yes I'm convinced 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.030
 that is going to be able to let us get there 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.310
 in time I do not know what the part of the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.260
 engine how will they come or yes they are already 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.690
 all the elements ready I think if 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.580
 also this is a model as you said 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.680
 you had a starting point about 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.630
 a model that exists you on a basis 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.160
 you did you have changed a lot 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.830
 definitive model with which we 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.780
 we find now 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.610
 change a bit in the front 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.070
 after practically the same what is the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.110
 Central cage is the same and what would be 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.360
 the back also in the part 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.320
 front they change so much what is their 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.360
 structure but it's not a car that is 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.210
 that has some important difference 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.069
 it's a barbaric car so I guess they're going to 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.579
 work very well 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.499
 It would be good also how they will try it 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.969
 other teams are sure to 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.920
 keep improving and a lot 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.329
 we make a survey of the pilots 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.150
 of the tc that you have to your position for this 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.909
 2015 we are back after a 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.680
 time with a benedict sound and in the 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.409
 case of emanuel moriatis that returns to 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.359
 joining the team was before 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.219
 last year also with us and good 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.610
 and also will be Leonel Sotro is 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.710
 tell 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.110
 to this is added still missing some 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.150
 Detail fix with halal matÃ­as if it is 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.350
 that will have continuity but I think that 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.350
 it could be fixed
