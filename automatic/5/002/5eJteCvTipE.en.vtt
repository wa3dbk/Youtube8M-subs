00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 hello how about youtube people I hope 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.770
 that they are quite well I know that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.050
 took days without uploading content but 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.180
 I have a very good explanation for that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.949
 first let's go with the news it was 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.930
 revealed the content of all the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.270
 special editions that will count 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.099
 the game the standard edition does not contain 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.320
 more than the game itself and a code 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 for 14 days of golf just what one 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 can expect from the most basic edition 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.399
 the limited edition will contain a clear 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 copy of the game and also have a 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.879
 animated series of the fall of the ritz no 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.829
 many details about it but 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.900
 we can see the series through hello 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.970
 channel similar to hello night 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.920
 fall for the title is more than clear that 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.500
 we will follow the story of rich in their 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 last days in a different format so 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.160
 I just hope that this time it's something 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.500
 more attached to the original story 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 rich a requisition package for the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 14 premium supplies the third 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.360

 with this edition is that you will not have a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.720
 it will give more precision to the weapon and it comes 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.030
 with a skin called blood set in the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.860

 Previous battle still missing many 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.250
 stores in the list so I guess that 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.019
 in the next days it will follow 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.690

 that keep launching before finalizing 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.890
 this short video I would like to clarify that 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.870
 are the racks or requisition packages 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.700
 since they are mentioned as part of the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.069
 content of both editions 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.080
 limited as collector works and has 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.910
 added a new reward system 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.130
 in halo 5 in which after having 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.380
 completed a game either sand or 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.569
 of war zone you will get rack points 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.459
 which can be exchanged for 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.090
 packages with the same name as 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.890

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.810
 murders animations among other things 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.209
 you can also get some packages 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.590
 Greg while continuing to level up and 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.970
 they assure that even after the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.500
 game launch 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.750
 the company will continue to launch new 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.460
 packages constantly so that the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.890
 Players can continue and follow 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.750
 unlocking content the main use 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.000
 of these line that is given in the mode of 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.860
 war game are where players can 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.170
 access some terminals inside the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.540
 map to get supplies from 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.460
 weapons and vehicles now how do you 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.410
 can give an account there are certain weapons that 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.720
 will have different models that will 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.330
 will give a slight advantage to the player in 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.310
 sand to change weapons and skins will be 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.050
 only an aesthetic aspect that does not 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.180
 will affect the gameplay we can be 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.430
 sure that the classic multiplayer 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.410
 will continue to have equal starts and not 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.540
 there will be no supplies for this type 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.000
 Games in a similar way as 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.130
 gave in the beta any way I'm 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.810
 making a more complete video about 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.880
 everything we know about the multiplayer 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.130
 until the moment where I will explain better 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.990
 the differences between sand mode and 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.210
 War zone besides explaining 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.280
 totally how this new mode works 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.220
 of game so wait for this video very 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.440
 soon and good that would be everything 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.690
 for this short video the reason why 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.430
 been absent is because a week ago 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.220
 I had to undergo an operation of the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.900
 which one 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.850
 I want to give many details because it is 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.590
 something personal and I had some conflicts 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.850
 during the recovery that I 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.690

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.850
