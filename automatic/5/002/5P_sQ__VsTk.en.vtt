00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
leave it in the fridge for about half an

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.390 
leave it in the fridge for about half an
hour<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> when<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.500> cold<00:01:13.830> you'll<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.310> able

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
hour and when it's cold you'll be able

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.310 
hour and when it's cold you'll be able
to<00:01:14.549> roll<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.210> easier<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:16.049> take

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to roll it a little bit easier we take

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.999 
to roll it a little bit easier we take
the<00:01:16.590> meatballs<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.790> roll<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.450> hand

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
the meatballs and we roll them in hand

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
the meatballs and we roll them in hand
so<00:01:20.009> when<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> meatballs<00:01:21.140> you've

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so when we go with the meatballs you've

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.450 
so when we go with the meatballs you've
got<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.380> relatively<00:01:22.740> quick<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.340> them

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
got to be relatively quick with them

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
got to be relatively quick with them
here<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:23.850> splash<00:01:24.330> yourself<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.409> what

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
here but don't splash yourself and what

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
here but don't splash yourself and what
I<00:01:25.560> suggest<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.549> into<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.540> we

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I suggest is that we go into you know we

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.010 
I suggest is that we go into you know we
put<00:01:27.780> 18<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.799> another<00:01:28.920> weights

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
put 18 and then we do another weights

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.270 
put 18 and then we do another weights
and<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.229> move<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.590> around<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> oil

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and just move them around in the oil

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700 
and just move them around in the oil
we're<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.360> looking<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> cook<00:01:33.930> them<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.259> but
