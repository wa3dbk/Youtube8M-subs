00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.310
 the first clothespin invented it 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.919
 at the beginning of the 19th century a 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.690
 Christian organization the lakers was 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.339
 a cylindrical piece of wood with a 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.400
 Vertical cut on the bottom 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:15.530
 in 1853 an American inventor 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.450
 he patented a lever clamp in two 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.370
 pieces with spring and that's the kind that 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.000
 is still done today in plastic 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.000
 or in wood 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.190
 this Czech company manufactures tweezers in 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.720
 wood from there the wood from there is 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.720
 ideal because it is durable 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.440
 when the logs arrive at the factory 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.719
 a saw cut automated tape 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.680
 each one laterally in plates of 7 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.680
 centimeters thick 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.250
 wood by nature is wet from 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.050
 So it is vital to dry the plates if 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.090
 not what is manufactured is with her 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.270
 would expand and contract with the changes 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.890
 of temperature and it will crack first 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.200
 the plates are air dried during 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.410
 seven months until the levels of 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.940
 moisture drop to 20% then they are left in 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.520
 an oven for three or four weeks 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.840
 to lower the humidity level and leave it 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.520
 between 8 and 10 percent 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.290
 the wood is already stable 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.130
 the operators cut the plates in 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:22.350
 shorter and manageable pieces after 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.350
 in blocks of 7 x 7 centimeters 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.110
 then they introduce them into a 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.900
 cutter its four circular saws 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.220
 simultaneously cut each block in 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.210
 five pieces each one measures nine 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.210
 millimeters thick 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.980
 when these fine pieces come out of the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.260
 the inspecting machine operators 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.090
 all those that have knots or others 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.030
 defects are discarded and sold to 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.860
 a company that manufactures mousetraps the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.090
 who pass the inspection enter into a 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.090
 automated milling machine 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.650
 that cuts each piece into four pieces 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.630
 smaller later in each of 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.460
 these sculpt the shape of the spring of the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.090
 clamp on the front and a notch on the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.090
 back 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.390
 why 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:33.180
 so that each piece has gone from this 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.180
 to this and this 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.100
 and the notch on the back 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.200
 will hold the spring that joins the two 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.020
 parts of the clamp and will provide the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.570
 tension they need to grab 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.760
 the next machine marks four lines 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.630
 in each piece to cut it into five 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.630
 identical parts 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.769
 before and after all those cuts leave 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.450
 rough edges and splinters so 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.030
 that they have to introduce the clamps into 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.129
 a sanding container as the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.860
 container rotates the tweezers are rubbed 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.989
 each other and abrasion gradually sanding 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.150
 the roughness of the wood 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.730
 the operators also add a piece of 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.349
 wax while rotating the particles of 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.510
 wax are impregnating the wood for 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.150
 leave it softer yet 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.099
 meanwhile another machine manufactures the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.099
 springs with iron wire 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.200
 millimeter and a half thick this has 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.110
 a zinc bath to avoid rust 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.150
 watch in slow motion as the machine turns 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.849
 the wire seven times to create the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.290
 part of the spring in the form of a coil 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.130
 then fold the end to make the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.710
 part that fits into the slot 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.090
 Once all the pieces are ready, the 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.950
 Assembly time 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.600
 the operators introduce the two parts 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.850
 of the clamp and the springs in hoppers 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.680
 different from the assembly machine to 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.930
 As each spring falls a finger 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.790
 mechanical apart the end to place 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.070
 the two parts of the clamp and wrap the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.200
 coil then release the end of the 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.840
 spring to fit in the slot the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.250
 machine does its job at a rate of 8,000 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.250
 tweezers per hour 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.560
 those already finished fall on a ribbon 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.570
 conveyor that takes them to the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.079
 next machine that groups them by 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.079
 dozens 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.730
 and from there they travel to the packing machine 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.700
 which is programmed to group them in 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.040
 a specific format this is a package 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.020
 of 36 so that the machine is 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.410
 scheduled to stack three dozen 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.410
 tweezers 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.800
 once a paper label is placed 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.539
 over the machine in bag the tweezers 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.840
 eliminating the air inside the 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.840
 wrapping 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.050
 the clothespins may be 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.630
 a fairly common product but 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.630
 Let's face never leave us hanging
