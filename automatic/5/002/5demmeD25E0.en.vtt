00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.790
 some examples of the features of the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.400
 publisher's digital book for the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.900
 Portuguese collection and see how they 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.370
 can be applied in the classroom 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.199
 Impressionists was the name given to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.730
 artists who came together to put together a 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.820
 exhibition in 1874 they rejected art 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.859
 romantic and sought an art 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.510
 more plastic less committed to 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.640
 social questions 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.500
 according to the theorists the Impressionists 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.910
 they knew that the human eye is a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 powerful instrument 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.410
 just give the suggestion to the eye that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540
 he is in charge of doing the rest and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.070
 build the whole image 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.129
 however it is important to know 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.260
 these images so the art 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.670
 Impressionist took some time 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.329
 to be understood by the public 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.770
 the public had to learn to 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.379
 distanced from the work in order to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.199
 see there in its entirety 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.750
 understanding Impressionism helps us to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.850
 understand realistic literature and its 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.850
 unfolding in symbolist poetry 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.140
 money and was one of the most 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 of Impressionism and this 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.170
 screen of the sun rising from the sun 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.369
 1872 was precisely the screen that gave the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.880
 name for the impressionism movement 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:27.000
 I screened the autumn in arjan tail and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 1883 is one of the most important 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.610
 impressionism you observe her 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 portrays a landscape at the same time 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.500
 simple and exuberant the focus of the screen is 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.130
 a locality near the French called the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 dined next to the Seine river where 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.970
 the artist lived if we observed this 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.640
 screen from far away from without 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.299
 trees acquires a golden effect 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 is getting lost as people 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.659
 get closer 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.200
 look that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.470
 but the brushstrokes the textures 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.050
 the colors are the ones that will create this 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.540
 impacting sensory effect on the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.970
 viewer 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.970
 if you observe the clouds 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.730
 they are already made with more brush strokes 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.209
 smooth and rounded to print a 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.930
 texture softer the screen and here in the middle 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.920
 if you observe the artist just sketched 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.160
 the buildings the houses not to trap the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.310
 attention of the viewer and does not overshadow the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.060
 natural landscape that is the goal of 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.450
 screen 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 Now answer me the other name. 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.250
 Impressionism is important renato 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.250
 teacher renoir a great example 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.000
 renounce as well as the car that was one of the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.790
 landscapers of the 19th century and 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.859
 that even the one who created the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.750
 pointillism technique became clear today 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.760
 a proposal that combines content 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.160
 carefully crafted by 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.549
 professionals with experience in the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.579
 class with modern technological resources 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.739
 which bring new dynamics to teaching 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.799
 all focusing on the main objective 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.950
 of our work the learning of 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.950
 students
