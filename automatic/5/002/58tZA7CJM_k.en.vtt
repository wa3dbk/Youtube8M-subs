00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
as a big distraction right now and here

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
we'll charge these enemies you have a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.810 
we'll charge these enemies you have a
lot<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> light<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.430> light<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:07.429> will<00:02:08.429> also<00:02:08.459> have

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
lot of light of light I will also have

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.520 
lot of light of light I will also have
to<00:02:08.850> rely<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:10.290> general<00:02:12.230> let's<00:02:13.230> see<00:02:13.350> what's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to rely on my general let's see what's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.810 
to rely on my general let's see what's
going<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.830> air<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:16.230> my<00:02:16.410> fleet<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.860> charging<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
going on air so my fleet is charging the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.949 
going on air so my fleet is charging the
enemy<00:02:17.850> fleet<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:21.090> probably<00:02:23.690> that's<00:02:24.690> because

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
enemy fleet it's probably that's because

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.949 
enemy fleet it's probably that's because
they're<00:02:25.140> actually<00:02:25.680> gave<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.970> ayah<00:02:27.150> order<00:02:27.690> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
they're actually gave the ayah order to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.270 
they're actually gave the ayah order to
attack<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.739> they<00:02:29.580> decided<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.239> rush<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:31.280> with

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
attack but they decided to rush in with

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280 
attack but they decided to rush in with
the<00:02:32.610> skirmisher<00:02:33.270> which<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> completely

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
the skirmisher which is a completely

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.810 
the skirmisher which is a completely
stupid<00:02:34.590> idea<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:36.980> will<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.160> preferred<00:02:38.610> if

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
stupid idea I will have preferred if

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:46.220 
stupid idea I will have preferred if
they<00:02:39.030> had<00:02:39.269> simply<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:40.080> their<00:02:41.030> javelin<00:02:45.230> here

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
they had simply use their javelin here

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.870 
they had simply use their javelin here
my<00:02:46.380> legions<00:02:46.769> seem<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.130> be<00:02:47.250> doing<00:02:47.549> good

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
my legions seem to be doing good

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.070 
my legions seem to be doing good
progress<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.940> my<00:02:51.150> cavalry<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.630> actually

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
progress and my cavalry is actually

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.370 
progress and my cavalry is actually
capturing<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> place<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.720> my<00:02:54.900> sneaking

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
capturing the place so my sneaking

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.339 
capturing the place so my sneaking
around<00:02:55.680> was<00:02:56.090> beneficial

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
but mine engineer are still advancing

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.869 
but mine engineer are still advancing
pretty<00:03:56.840> well<00:03:59.230> so<00:04:00.230> I'm<00:04:00.319> still<00:04:00.379> doing<00:04:01.040> them<00:04:01.340> away

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
pretty well so I'm still doing them away

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.649 
pretty well so I'm still doing them away
from<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:04.069> main<00:04:04.220> center<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.940> interest<00:04:05.360> at<00:04:05.569> the

from the main center of interest at the

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.289 
from the main center of interest at the
moment<00:04:08.739> my<00:04:09.739> equity<00:04:10.069> probably<00:04:10.670> won't<00:04:10.879> manage

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
moment my equity probably won't manage

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.809 
moment my equity probably won't manage
to<00:04:11.510> go<00:04:11.660> them<00:04:11.900> long<00:04:12.080> enough<00:04:12.400> that's<00:04:13.400> not<00:04:13.610> long

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
to go them long enough that's not long

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.430

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.990

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:15.349 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.869 

it's<00:07:16.349> not<00:07:16.529> particularly<00:07:17.009> important<00:07:17.639> at<00:07:17.759> the

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 
it's not particularly important at the

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:28.219 
it's not particularly important at the
moment<00:07:23.779> okay<00:07:24.779> seem<00:07:25.110> to<00:07:25.289> be<00:07:27.110> resuming<00:07:28.110> the

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:28.229 
moment okay seem to be resuming the

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.579 
moment okay seem to be resuming the
capture<00:07:28.649> of<00:07:28.679> the<00:07:28.919> zone<00:07:29.129> I<00:07:30.050> need<00:07:31.050> to<00:07:31.169> do<00:07:31.289> so

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:31.589 
capture of the zone I need to do so

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:35.989 
capture of the zone I need to do so
before<00:07:32.479> the<00:07:33.479> enemy's<00:07:33.749> managed<00:07:34.349> to<00:07:34.999> unload

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:35.999 
before the enemy's managed to unload

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:39.739 
before the enemy's managed to unload
their<00:07:36.240> troops<00:07:37.729> which<00:07:38.729> is<00:07:38.939> the<00:07:39.149> reason<00:07:39.300> why<00:07:39.719> I

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:39.749 
their troops which is the reason why I

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:50.680 
their troops which is the reason why I
sacrifice<00:07:40.649> my<00:07:41.099> fleet

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:50.690 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.600 

and<00:07:51.690> victory<00:07:52.230> so<00:07:52.770> that<00:07:52.950> was<00:07:53.070> a<00:07:53.100> particular

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.610 
and victory so that was a particular

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.670 
and victory so that was a particular
battle<00:07:53.970> I<00:07:54.210> was<00:07:54.420> quite<00:07:54.570> a<00:07:54.660> bit<00:07:54.870> of<00:07:54.990> troops<00:07:55.260> but

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 
battle I was quite a bit of troops but

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.880 
battle I was quite a bit of troops but
the<00:07:55.950> enemy<00:07:56.250> were<00:07:56.460> much<00:07:57.030> larger<00:07:57.270> in<00:07:57.660> number<00:07:57.890> so

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:58.890 
the enemy were much larger in number so

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:07.010 
the enemy were much larger in number so
let's<00:07:59.160> see<00:07:59.840> well<00:08:00.840> that<00:08:01.050> went<00:08:01.760> kill<00:08:02.760> the<00:08:06.020> 2785

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:11.370 
and night last 1300 so that was a pretty

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.250 
and night last 1300 so that was a pretty
intense<00:08:11.610> battle<00:08:12.150> and<00:08:12.300> let's<00:08:12.690> go<00:08:12.900> back<00:08:12.930> to<00:08:13.110> the
