 which is the baptism of the saffron boat 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.750

 a sunny day like that the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.200
 main innovations of the boat are going 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.850
 be 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.650
 in fact these new forms of drifting 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.480
 who are like faunas 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.170
 on a race like the sold globe on 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.989
 could win 2 to 3 in the gravel pit 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.630
 that we bet on youth on the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.840
 motivation on the fiery star skipper 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.400

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.519
 the time to perfect 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.739
 here I am going to have a little dream 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.150
 awake since all these years but 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.260
 I try to make the most of it because 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.489
 that it's not given to everyone and 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.280
 it's good to be lucky 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.569
 that we found unfair and thing
