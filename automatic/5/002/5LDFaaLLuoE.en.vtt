download the software now I've already

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.830 
download the software now I've already
got<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.860> downloaded<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:11.300> was<00:01:11.480> just<00:01:11.630> going<00:01:11.750> to

extract onto the device and begin

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.580 
extract onto the device and begin
installing<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:15.860> process<00:01:16.340> probably<00:01:17.000> take

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
installing so this process probably take

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.980 
installing so this process probably take
15-20<00:01:18.590> minutes<00:01:18.890> now<00:01:19.730> maybe<00:01:20.150> probably<00:01:20.540> less

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
15-20 minutes now maybe probably less

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.470 
15-20 minutes now maybe probably less
depending<00:01:21.680> on<00:01:21.770> what<00:01:21.890> device<00:01:22.040> you've<00:01:22.370> got<00:01:22.580> but
