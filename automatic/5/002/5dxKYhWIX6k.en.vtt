one question I'd like to answer I guess

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.320 
one question I'd like to answer I guess
right<00:00:03.120> out<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.389> gate<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.840> why<00:00:04.410> edge<00:00:04.770> reflow

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 
right out of the gate is why edge reflow

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.400 
right out of the gate is why edge reflow
why<00:00:06.330> are<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.660> going<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.839> go<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.170> program

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
why are we going to go to this program

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.890 
why are we going to go to this program
and<00:00:07.770> use<00:00:07.919> it<00:00:08.099> well<00:00:08.280> some<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.970> already<00:00:09.179> you

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and use it well some of you already you

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.120 
and use it well some of you already you
already<00:00:10.050> know<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.679> that's<00:00:10.740> why<00:00:10.860> you're

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
already know that and that's why you're

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.039 
already know that and that's why you're
taking<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.610> course<00:00:11.969> most<00:00:12.300> likely<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
taking this course most likely but I

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.230 
taking this course most likely but I
wanted<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> give<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.950> an<00:00:14.099> overview<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
wanted to give you an overview of the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.080 
wanted to give you an overview of the
workflow<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.470> guess<00:00:16.830> generic<00:00:17.460> workflow<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
workflow I guess generic workflow that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.150 
workflow I guess generic workflow that
we<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.869> some<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.439> issues<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.039> some

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
we have and some of the issues and some

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.529 
we have and some of the issues and some
of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.310> challenges<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.180> with

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
of the challenges that we have with

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.380 
of the challenges that we have with
responsive<00:00:22.289> design<00:00:23.029> think<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.240> way

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390

it and say okay well that's what's going

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
it and say okay well that's what's going
to<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> desktop<00:01:10.140> great<00:01:10.830> let's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to look like on the desktop great let's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.120 
to look like on the desktop great let's
sign<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> off<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> build<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.950> now<00:01:13.950> with

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
sign it off a build this thing now with

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
sign it off a build this thing now with
responsive<00:01:14.729> design<00:01:15.030> we've<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:15.960> more

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
responsive design we've got a lot more

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.039 
responsive design we've got a lot more
to<00:01:16.229> think<00:01:16.409> about<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.580> consider<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.689> we

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
to think about we have to consider if we

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
to think about we have to consider if we
are<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:19.439> first<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.009> responsive

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
are going to go first of all responsive

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.850 
are going to go first of all responsive
okay<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.020> if<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.320> part<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> project

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
okay and if that's part of the project

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.490 
okay and if that's part of the project
then<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> consider<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:24.380> what<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
then we have to consider well what is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.630 
then we have to consider well what is
the<00:01:25.619> site<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> look<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.100> let's<00:01:26.430> say<00:01:26.490> on

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the site going to look like let's say on

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.840 
the site going to look like let's say on
mobile<00:01:27.240> devices<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.140> other<00:01:28.350> devices<00:01:28.850> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
mobile devices or on other devices so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.210 
mobile devices or on other devices so
having<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.840> static<00:01:31.290> design<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> photoshop<00:01:31.890> can

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
having a static design and photoshop can

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
having a static design and photoshop can
be<00:01:32.310> tricky<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.110> show<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
be tricky because you show this to a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
be tricky because you show this to a
client<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.490> sign<00:01:35.729> off<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.689> is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
client they sign off on it but this is

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
client they sign off on it but this is
only<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.409> part<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> story<00:01:38.220> you're<00:01:38.400> only

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
only one part of the story you're only

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.859 
only one part of the story you're only
seeing<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.540> in

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
seeing what it's going to look like in

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.039 
seeing what it's going to look like in
desktop<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.950> instance<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> lot<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you know desktop version which still

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.149 
you know desktop version which still
doesn't<00:01:54.990> tell<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> whole<00:01:55.500> story<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.040> at

the rather that said that they created
something<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.659> 14<00:02:04.649> or<00:02:04.680> 15<00:02:05.009> different

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
something like 14 or 15 different

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.300 
something like 14 or 15 different
Photoshop<00:02:06.000> files<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.509> each<00:02:06.689> web<00:02:07.110> page<00:02:07.409> just

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
Photoshop files for each web page just

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.550 
Photoshop files for each web page just
to<00:02:08.429> give<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> idea<00:02:09.239> or<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.690> tell<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.170> story<00:02:10.440> to

so<00:02:14.060> we're<00:02:14.510> looking<00:02:14.600> for<00:02:14.780> other<00:02:14.990> ways<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.440> do

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
so we're looking for other ways to do

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.200 
so we're looking for other ways to do
this<00:02:15.590> some<00:02:16.340> people<00:02:16.610> are<00:02:16.700> going<00:02:16.820> with<00:02:16.970> what<00:02:17.120> are

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
this some people are going with what are

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.700 
this some people are going with what are
called<00:02:17.240> style<00:02:17.660> tiles<00:02:17.930> there's<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> lot<00:02:18.680> of

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
called style tiles there's a lot of

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.000 
called style tiles there's a lot of
other<00:02:18.890> stuff<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.220> can<00:02:19.310> do<00:02:19.460> some<00:02:20.240> people<00:02:20.660> are

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
other stuff we can do some people are

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.830 
other stuff we can do some people are
starting<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.040> actually<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.610> dive<00:02:23.120> into<00:02:23.390> code

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
starting to actually just dive into code

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.560 
starting to actually just dive into code
and<00:02:24.110> actually<00:02:24.500> design<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.100> code<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.580> you're

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
and actually design in code so you're

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.840 
and actually design in code so you're
creating<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> web<00:02:27.620> page<00:02:27.830> you're<00:02:28.340> setting<00:02:28.730> up

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
creating a web page you're setting up

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.220 
creating a web page you're setting up
what<00:02:29.000> are<00:02:29.090> called<00:02:29.210> media<00:02:29.420> queries<00:02:29.959> which

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
what are called media queries which

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.810 
what are called media queries which
we've<00:02:30.410> already<00:02:30.530> talked<00:02:30.920> about<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.370> bit<00:02:31.610> and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
we've already talked about a bit and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.390 
we've already talked about a bit and
you're<00:02:32.630> just<00:02:32.780> going<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.130> maybe

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
you're just going at it and maybe

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800 
you're just going at it and maybe
creating<00:02:34.880> some<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.209> content<00:02:35.720> in

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
creating some of the content in

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.350 
creating some of the content in
Photoshop<00:02:36.200> Illustrator<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:37.459> by<00:02:37.610> content<00:02:38.180> I

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
Photoshop Illustrator but by content I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.440 
Photoshop Illustrator but by content I
mean<00:02:38.600> let's<00:02:39.170> say<00:02:39.350> buttons<00:02:39.740> logos<00:02:40.300> things<00:02:41.300> of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
mean let's say buttons logos things of

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.530 
mean let's say buttons logos things of
that<00:02:41.570> nature<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.970> kind<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.420> rough

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
that nature but this is kind of rough

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.690 
that nature but this is kind of rough
for<00:02:44.810> those<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.050> us<00:02:45.110> don't<00:02:45.290> want<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.650> jump<00:02:46.520> in

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
for those of us don't want to jump in

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.310 
for those of us don't want to jump in
and<00:02:46.850> hang<00:02:47.060> code<00:02:47.330> let's<00:02:47.600> say<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.959> want<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> more

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
and hang code let's say and want a more

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.460 
and hang code let's say and want a more
visual<00:02:48.620> way<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.010> do<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.900> where<00:02:51.140> edge

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
visual way to do this this is where edge

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.330 
visual way to do this this is where edge
reflow<00:02:52.190> steps<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:52.970> edge<00:02:53.260> reflow<00:02:54.260> allows<00:02:54.950> us<00:02:55.220> to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
reflow steps in edge reflow allows us to

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.490 
reflow steps in edge reflow allows us to
take<00:02:55.520> our<00:02:55.700> photo<00:02:55.970> shop<00:02:56.180> design<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.350> can

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
take our photo shop design and you can

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.260 
take our photo shop design and you can
see<00:02:57.590> right<00:02:57.620> here<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.160> takes<00:02:58.340> all<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.700> content

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
see right here it takes all the content

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.660 
see right here it takes all the content
from<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.750> Photoshop<00:03:00.140> design<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.739> allows<00:03:01.550> you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
from the Photoshop design and allows you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.090 
from the Photoshop design and allows you
to<00:03:01.760> import<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.300> into<00:03:02.360> reflow<00:03:02.900> in<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.830> couple

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
to import it into reflow in a couple

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.340 
to import it into reflow in a couple
ways<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:04.489> happen<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.000> make<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.260> that

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
ways that can happen and make it so that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.840 
ways that can happen and make it so that
you<00:03:06.470> can<00:03:06.620> start<00:03:06.830> your<00:03:07.130> responsive<00:03:07.610> design

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
you can start your responsive design

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.810 
you can start your responsive design
from<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.660> design<00:03:08.989> in<00:03:09.320> photoshop<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:10.280> that's

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
from the design in photoshop and that's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.000 
from the design in photoshop and that's
why<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.720> have<00:03:11.900> edge<00:03:12.050> reflow<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.739> very

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
why we have edge reflow it's a very

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.760 
why we have edge reflow it's a very
visual<00:03:13.370> tool<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.239> just<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.500> show<00:03:15.739> you

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
visual tool and just to just to show you

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.770 
visual tool and just to just to show you
I've<00:03:15.980> got<00:03:16.040> tons<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.610> applications<00:03:16.970> here<00:03:17.570> but

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
I've got tons of applications here but

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.289 
I've got tons of applications here but
I'm<00:03:17.870> going<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.049> crack<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:19.010> open<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:20.030> you're

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
I'm going to crack it open and you're

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.820 
I'm going to crack it open and you're
going<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.450> see<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.170> in<00:03:21.350> edge<00:03:21.530> reflow

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
going to see that in the in edge reflow

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.000 
going to see that in the in edge reflow
in<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.970> workspace<00:03:23.360> we<00:03:24.019> actually<00:03:24.200> have<00:03:24.680> this

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
in the workspace we actually have this

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.890 
in the workspace we actually have this
great<00:03:25.519> handle<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.299> will<00:03:26.390> handle<00:03:26.630> over<00:03:26.720> here

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
great handle that will handle over here

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.520 
great handle that will handle over here
the<00:03:27.019> ability<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.850> change<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.840> viewable<00:03:30.260> width

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
the ability to change the viewable width

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.740 
the ability to change the viewable width
here<00:03:30.799> if<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.040> will<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.940> pretend<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.510> we<00:03:32.630> are

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
here if you will so pretend that we are

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.840 
here if you will so pretend that we are
in<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.900> mobile<00:03:33.170> device<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:34.580> know<00:03:34.700> we're

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
in a mobile device and you know we're

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.190 
in a mobile device and you know we're
roughly<00:03:35.090> four<00:03:35.390> eighty<00:03:35.540> something<00:03:35.750> like<00:03:36.019> that

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
roughly four eighty something like that

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.740 
roughly four eighty something like that
on<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.440> newer<00:03:36.769> iphone<00:03:37.280> for<00:03:37.580> instance<00:03:37.910> we<00:03:38.600> could

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
on a newer iphone for instance we could

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.660 
on a newer iphone for instance we could
say<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:38.959> well<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.890> viewable<00:03:40.459> area

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
say that well this is the viewable area

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.460 
say that well this is the viewable area
and<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.390> lot<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.540> us<00:03:41.750> will<00:03:41.930> call<00:03:42.079> that<00:03:42.260> the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
and a lot of us will call that the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.360 
and a lot of us will call that the
viewport<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.209> design<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.900> match<00:03:45.079> that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
viewport and we can design to match that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.789 
viewport and we can design to match that
but<00:03:46.370> an<00:03:46.489> edge<00:03:46.700> reflow<00:03:47.030> we<00:03:47.570> can<00:03:47.780> visually<00:03:48.470> then

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
but an edge reflow we can visually then

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.910 
but an edge reflow we can visually then
go<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.370> let's<00:03:49.700> say<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.450> next<00:03:50.840> break<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.799> know

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
go to let's say the next break you know

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.080 
go to let's say the next break you know
when<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.190> design<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.489> going<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.700> break<00:03:52.820> we<00:03:52.970> can

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
when the design is going to break we can

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.520 
when the design is going to break we can
figure<00:03:53.239> out<00:03:53.360> okay<00:03:53.720> in<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.930> viewport<00:03:54.110> if<00:03:54.440> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
figure out okay in the viewport if the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.039 
figure out okay in the viewport if the
viewports<00:03:54.890> larger<00:03:55.370> what's<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.510> design<00:03:56.840> going

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
viewports larger what's the design going

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.229 
viewports larger what's the design going
to<00:03:57.110> look<00:03:57.230> like<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.489> all<00:03:58.910> done

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
to look like and this is all done

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.960 
to look like and this is all done
visually<00:03:59.810> you<00:04:00.380> know<00:04:00.890> it's<00:04:01.310> going<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.519> spit<00:04:01.940> out

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
visually you know it's going to spit out

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.720 
visually you know it's going to spit out
code<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.630> other<00:04:02.780> end<00:04:03.079> but<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:04.280> are<00:04:04.430> working

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
code the other end but you are working

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.280 
code the other end but you are working
on<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.880> visual<00:04:05.269> interface<00:04:05.630> here<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.019> get<00:04:06.170> this

on a visual interface here to get this

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.140 
on a visual interface here to get this

done to create a responsive design and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.810 
done to create a responsive design and
all<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.900> tools<00:04:09.079> or<00:04:09.380> something<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.769> you're

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
all the tools or something that you're

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.009 
all the tools or something that you're
relatively<00:04:10.820> familiar<00:04:11.150> with<00:04:11.570> there<00:04:11.810> are<00:04:11.900> going

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
relatively familiar with there are going

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.270 
relatively familiar with there are going
to<00:04:12.079> be<00:04:12.170> some<00:04:12.380> terms<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.010> things<00:04:13.130> like<00:04:13.220> that

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
to be some terms and things like that

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.280 
to be some terms and things like that
that<00:04:13.549> we're<00:04:13.670> going<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.850> talk<00:04:14.060> about<00:04:14.239> in<00:04:14.600> the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
that we're going to talk about in the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.740 
that we're going to talk about in the
next<00:04:15.320> lesson<00:04:15.739> next<00:04:16.190> week<00:04:16.479> where<00:04:17.479> we<00:04:17.600> talk

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
next lesson next week where we talk

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.840 
next lesson next week where we talk
about<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:18.769> know<00:04:18.859> padding<00:04:19.340> margins<00:04:19.669> all<00:04:19.729> these

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
about you know padding margins all these

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.190 
about you know padding margins all these
web<00:04:20.239> terms<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:20.690> you're<00:04:20.810> going<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:20.989> need<00:04:21.109> to

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
web terms that you're going to need to

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.589 
web terms that you're going to need to
know<00:04:21.320> but<00:04:22.220> this<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.400> one<00:04:22.729> of<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.880> reasons<00:04:23.210> why

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
know but this is one of the reasons why

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.990 
know but this is one of the reasons why
we're<00:04:24.320> opting<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.770> use<00:04:25.070> edge<00:04:25.250> reflow<00:04:25.460> or<00:04:25.880> at

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
we're opting to use edge reflow or at

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.030 
we're opting to use edge reflow or at
least<00:04:26.210> go<00:04:26.450> into<00:04:26.690> it

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
least go into it

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.850 
least go into it
look<00:04:27.250> at<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.840> now<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.110> we've<00:04:29.230> covered<00:04:29.440> some

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
look at it now that we've covered some

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.290 
look at it now that we've covered some
of<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:30.070> background<00:04:30.490> information<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.210> we

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
of the background information and we

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.690 
of the background information and we
talked<00:04:31.540> just<00:04:32.170> briefly<00:04:32.740> about<00:04:33.220> edge<00:04:33.430> reflow

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
talked just briefly about edge reflow

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.300 
talked just briefly about edge reflow
and<00:04:34.210> kind<00:04:34.390> of<00:04:34.420> where<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:34.660> fits<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:35.190> what<00:04:36.190> we're

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
and kind of where it fits in what we're

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.530 
and kind of where it fits in what we're
going<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.490> do<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:36.820> we're<00:04:36.970> going<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.120> jump<00:04:37.420> into

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
going to do is we're going to jump into

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.510 
going to do is we're going to jump into
Photoshop<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.050> start<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:39.070> guess<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.460> could

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
Photoshop and start to I guess you could

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.110 
Photoshop and start to I guess you could
say<00:04:39.700> finish<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.770> design<00:04:41.770> for<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.580> site<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:42.880> is

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
say finish a design for a site that is

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.340 
say finish a design for a site that is
going<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.420> be<00:04:43.510> what's<00:04:43.660> called<00:04:43.810> mobile-first

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
going to be what's called mobile-first

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.590 
going to be what's called mobile-first
which<00:04:44.620> we've<00:04:44.800> talked<00:04:45.010> about<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:46.330> show<00:04:46.510> you

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
which we've talked about and to show you

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.820 
which we've talked about and to show you
some<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.900> things<00:04:47.050> in<00:04:47.140> Photoshop<00:04:47.500> we<00:04:47.680> need

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
some of the things in Photoshop we need
