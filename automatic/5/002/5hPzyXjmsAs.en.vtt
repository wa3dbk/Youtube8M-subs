00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
near them I have damaged turned off but

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.199 
near them I have damaged turned off but
you<00:02:35.410> can<00:02:35.590> see<00:02:35.830> when<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.430> near<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.820> it

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
you can see when I get near it it

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.290 
you can see when I get near it it
basically<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:38.320> stinging<00:02:38.739> me<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:40.060> that's<00:02:40.209> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
basically is stinging me so that's a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.540 
basically is stinging me so that's a
jellyfish<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.739> basically<00:02:41.920> just<00:02:42.160> looks<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
jellyfish it basically just looks like a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.880 
jellyfish it basically just looks like a
little<00:02:42.670> mini<00:02:42.940> squid<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.510> think<00:02:44.500> that's<00:02:44.620> kind<00:02:44.860> of

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
little mini squid I think that's kind of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.240 
little mini squid I think that's kind of
cool<00:02:45.070> though<00:02:49.530> let's<00:02:50.530> see<00:02:50.739> what<00:02:50.830> else<00:02:50.890> we<00:02:51.130> could

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
cool though let's see what else we could

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.250 
cool though let's see what else we could
spawn<00:02:53.850> here<00:02:54.850> let's<00:02:55.060> do<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.330> chicken<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.080> think

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
spawn here let's do a chicken I think

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.949 
spawn here let's do a chicken I think
this<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.770> baby<00:02:57.010> chick<00:02:57.430> chicken<00:02:57.940> or<00:02:58.840> a

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
this is just a baby chick chicken or a

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.899 
this is just a baby chick chicken or a
chick
