spray<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.459> over<00:02:23.550> here<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.849> look<00:02:24.060> at<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.300> water

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
spray it over here and look at the water

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.229 
spray it over here and look at the water
just<00:02:24.840> fall<00:02:25.050> right<00:02:25.080> off<00:02:25.349> it's<00:02:26.069> pretty<00:02:26.370> cool<00:02:26.610> so

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
just fall right off it's pretty cool so

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.820 
just fall right off it's pretty cool so
now<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.630> have<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.989> sprayed<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> entire
