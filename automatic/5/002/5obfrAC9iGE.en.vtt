00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
many players can play the game so for

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.579 
many players can play the game so for
example<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.850> game<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.360> one<00:01:03.539> player<00:01:03.870> but

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
example in this game it's one player but

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.149 
example in this game it's one player but
you<00:01:04.709> can<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.100> local<00:01:05.700> co-op<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.450> two<00:01:06.569> players

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
you can have local co-op for two players

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
you can have local co-op for two players
nonsense<00:01:08.159> sure<00:01:08.399> if<00:01:08.759> it<00:01:08.999> is<00:01:09.119> online<00:01:09.479> co-op<00:01:09.929> two

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
nonsense sure if it is online co-op two

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
nonsense sure if it is online co-op two
players<00:01:10.499> but<00:01:10.829> some<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.459> the<00:01:11.609> other<00:01:11.789> games<00:01:11.999> have

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
players but some of the other games have

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
players but some of the other games have
been<00:01:12.509> so<00:01:12.689> hopefully<00:01:13.289> this<00:01:13.529> one<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.100> as

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
been so hopefully this one will be as

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.760 
been so hopefully this one will be as
well<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.789> I'm<00:01:15.450> sure<00:01:15.719> somebody<00:01:16.170> will<00:01:16.229> correct

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.690 
maybe less once we get the cellophane
wrapper<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.139> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.289> way<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.520> take<00:01:23.670> a

the game on the inside wasn't amusingly

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.820 
the game on the inside wasn't amusingly
enough<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.600> nonetheless<00:02:46.600> let's<00:02:47.380> carry<00:02:47.770> on

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
enough but nonetheless let's carry on
