test we should keep in mind that the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.609 
test we should keep in mind that the
Nexus<00:00:23.310> 5<00:00:23.490> cost<00:00:23.850> 350<00:00:24.539> euros<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.230> Germany

I<00:03:55.379> would<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.829> mention<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
I would like to mention is that the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.089 
I would like to mention is that the
build<00:03:57.329> quality<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.720> both<00:03:58.079> devices<00:03:58.319> is<00:03:58.859> very

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
build quality on both devices is very

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.479 
build quality on both devices is very
good<00:03:59.430> but<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.989> Nexus<00:04:01.349> 5<00:04:01.590> feels<00:04:01.919> better<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
good but the Nexus 5 feels better in the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.309 
good but the Nexus 5 feels better in the
hand<00:04:02.699> it's<00:04:03.329> not<00:04:03.599> as<00:04:03.810> sick<00:04:04.139> as<00:04:05.000> moto<00:04:06.000> G<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.540> it

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
hand it's not as sick as moto G and it

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.189 
hand it's not as sick as moto G and it
just<00:04:07.799> feels<00:04:08.129> a<00:04:08.489> little<00:04:09.150> more<00:04:09.329> premium<00:04:09.959> and

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
just feels a little more premium and

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.339 
just feels a little more premium and
that's<00:04:10.919> what<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.160> pay<00:04:11.370> for

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
that's what you pay for

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.009 
that's what you pay for
also<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.530> don't<00:04:13.650> like<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:15.019> vibrations

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
