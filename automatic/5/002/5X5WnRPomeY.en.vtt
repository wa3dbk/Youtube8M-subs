00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.330
 teaspoons of olive oil a 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.450
 pinch of parsley and a clove of garlic 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.770
 in addition to being and good pepper we are going to 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.770
 start making the vinaigrette 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.190
 ah 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.230
 the first and practically only peace of 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.050
 this dish is to pour all the food 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.630
 in a food crusher like the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.820
 thermomix or a blender anything 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.560
 we are good what we have to do 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.100
 is to take the grape wine 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.590
 and we take it out then we'll take the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.479
 balsamic vinegar 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.799
 and as we have said we will do 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.259
 only one teaspoon and you do not need 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.220
 more now the olive oil as we have 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:38.480
 said are three tablespoons 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.480
 from little by little because more than 1 2 and 3 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.270
 now the garlic clove 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:52.630
 the parsley all inside 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.990
 and perfect a little bit more 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.990
 ah 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.230
 the pepper 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:09.740
 to taste and salt a pinch without 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.350
 also from that effect and now what 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.150
 we're going to do is we're going to close it and 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.150
 we're going to put it to shred everything 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 all right 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.040
 Once the seasoning is finished we will have left 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.310
 in this way now what we are going to do 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.650
 is to serve it in a bowl like this one of this 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.629
 shape 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.599
 once we have finished with the dressing 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.150
 this is what we have left this seasoning 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.819
 for salad is very good and has a 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.829
 Very sweet flavor that makes it very special 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.170
 unlike normal vinegar the 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.390
 Balsamic vinegar gives it a sweetness that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.970
 is really very good and the juice of 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.530
 grape makes it even sweeter so if 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.609
 you want to dress your salads with 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.459
 something different 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.680
 this dressing is ideal for it finally 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.090
 we're done as usual remembering 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.319
 that you can subscribe to the different 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.269
