alright<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.760> covers<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.600> individual

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
alright so that covers the individual

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.250 
alright so that covers the individual
hits<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.830> our<00:00:23.130> snare<00:00:23.550> pattern<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:25.080> we'll

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
hits in our snare pattern and now we'll

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.519 
hits in our snare pattern and now we'll
go<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> snare<00:00:26.400> main<00:00:27.029> chain<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.840> i'm<00:00:28.410> going

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
go to the snare main chain and i'm going

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.589 
go to the snare main chain and i'm going
to<00:00:28.619> show<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.830> what's<00:00:29.250> running<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.849> all<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to show you what's running on all the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.930 
to show you what's running on all the
snares<00:00:30.869> together<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.579> kick<00:00:32.790> over

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
snares together so if we just kick over

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.639 
snares together so if we just kick over
here<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> end

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
here you can see right here is the end

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.700 
here you can see right here is the end
of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> drum<00:00:35.340> rack<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.170> here<00:00:37.170> starts<00:00:37.440> our

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
of the drum rack and here starts our

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
of the drum rack and here starts our
plug-in<00:00:38.160> chain<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> operates<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.090> all<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
plug-in chain that operates on all of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.720 
plug-in chain that operates on all of
the<00:00:39.660> snares<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.309> got<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the snares so first one we got here is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.470 
the snares so first one we got here is
PSP<00:00:42.300> vintage<00:00:42.629> warmer<00:00:43.160> I'll<00:00:44.160> totally<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
PSP vintage warmer I'll totally a go to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.260 
PSP vintage warmer I'll totally a go to
plug<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> love<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.410> plug-in<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:48.059> one

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
plug in love this plug-in and this one

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
plug in love this plug-in and this one
allows<00:00:48.510> me<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.809> add<00:00:48.930> some<00:00:49.260> analog<00:00:49.800> saturation

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
allows me to add some analog saturation

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
allows me to add some analog saturation
to<00:00:50.910> its<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> drive<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.809> I've<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.110> some<00:00:52.350> Drive

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
to its and drive so I've got some Drive

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
to its and drive so I've got some Drive
and<00:00:53.010> that's<00:00:53.640> pretty<00:00:53.850> much<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.239> i'm<00:00:54.420> using

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and that's pretty much all i'm using

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
and that's pretty much all i'm using
this<00:00:54.899> plugin<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:56.100> has<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> compressor

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this plugin for it also has a compressor

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
this plugin for it also has a compressor
and<00:00:57.180> some<00:00:57.329> eq's<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.050> i'm<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.260> using

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and some eq's in it but i'm not using

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.040 
and some eq's in it but i'm not using
those<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.039> case<00:00:59.359> i'm<00:01:00.359> adding<00:01:00.870> some

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
those in this case i'm adding some

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.680 
those in this case i'm adding some
additional<00:01:01.109> drive<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> using<00:01:02.910> Ableton

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
additional drive to it using Ableton

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.320 
additional drive to it using Ableton
saturator<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.979> i'm<00:01:05.159> using<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> drive

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
saturator so i'm using a bit of drive

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
saturator so i'm using a bit of drive
and<00:01:06.689> i've<00:01:07.080> reduced<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.590> output<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and i've reduced the output so that it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
and i've reduced the output so that it
stays<00:01:08.820> nice<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.060> consistent<00:01:10.070> then<00:01:11.070> i'm<00:01:11.159> using

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
stays nice and consistent then i'm using

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.499 
stays nice and consistent then i'm using
an<00:01:11.580> eq<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:13.250> i'm<00:01:14.250> using<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> eq<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> roll<00:01:15.299> off

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
an eq and i'm using the eq to roll off

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.530 
an eq and i'm using the eq to roll off
just<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:15.960> bit<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> high<00:01:16.830> end<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.540> i

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
just a little bit of the high end and i

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.120 
just a little bit of the high end and i
should<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.259> using<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.979> roll

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
should actually be using this to roll

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.380 
should actually be using this to roll
off<00:01:20.310> some<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> low<00:01:20.729> end<00:01:20.880> too<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.240> i'm<00:01:21.299> going

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
off some of the low end too so i'm going

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.539 
off some of the low end too so i'm going
to<00:01:21.450> activate<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.990> low<00:01:22.740> end<00:01:22.920> roll<00:01:23.159> off<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to activate this low end roll off and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.149 
to activate this low end roll off and
i'm<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> roll<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.860> 60<00:01:25.860> 70

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
i'm going to roll this right up to 60 70

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
i'm going to roll this right up to 60 70
Hertz<00:01:26.250> there<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.729> again<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.119> capping<00:01:27.570> off<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Hertz there so again I'm capping off the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
Hertz there so again I'm capping off the
bottom<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.100> need<00:01:29.310> if

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bottom and that we really don't need if

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.920 
bottom and that we really don't need if
any<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.880> happens<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.630> made<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
any of it happens to have made it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.819 
any of it happens to have made it
through<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> compressor<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
through and then we have a compressor so

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
through and then we have a compressor so
let's<00:01:35.040> listen<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:39.920> now<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.970> compressor

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
let's listen to this now the compressor

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.580 
let's listen to this now the compressor
is<00:01:42.750> really<00:01:43.649> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:45.110> sound<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.259> pop

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
is really going to get the sound to pop

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.039 
is really going to get the sound to pop
now<00:01:47.340> I've<00:01:47.640> also<00:01:47.790> got<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> limiter<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> main

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
now I've also got a limiter on the main

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.300 
now I've also got a limiter on the main
beats<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> deactivate

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
beats so I'm just going to deactivate

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.280 
beats so I'm just going to deactivate
that<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.329> hear<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:51.990> sounds

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that so you can hear what this sounds

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.870 
that so you can hear what this sounds
like<00:01:52.350> without<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.890> limiter<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
like without the limiter on it so you

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.670 
like without the limiter on it so you
can<00:01:54.030> hear<00:01:54.210> pre<00:01:54.780> limiter<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
can hear pre limiter what the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:05.480 
can hear pre limiter what the
compression<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> doing<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.979> settings<00:02:05.310> on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
compression is doing so the settings on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.020 
compression is doing so the settings on
here<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:06.960> specific<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.860> right<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
here are very specific to get right so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
here are very specific to get right so
what<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.259> are<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.510> attack

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
what we have are we have the attack

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.190 
what we have are we have the attack
and<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.550> reason<00:02:14.730> why<00:02:15.090> I've<00:02:15.420> backed<00:02:15.780> off<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and the reason why I've backed off the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.710 
and the reason why I've backed off the
attack<00:02:16.530> here<00:02:16.800> 284<00:02:17.730> milliseconds<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.480> it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
attack here 284 milliseconds is it's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.930 
attack here 284 milliseconds is it's
allowing<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.590> first<00:02:19.920> kind<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.310> chubby<00:02:20.670> part

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
allowing the first kind of chubby part

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.510 
allowing the first kind of chubby part
of<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> snare<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.900> come<00:02:22.110> through<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.740> then

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
of the snare to come through and then

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.460 
of the snare to come through and then
I'm<00:02:23.700> using<00:02:23.910> some<00:02:24.210> pretty<00:02:24.600> heavy<00:02:24.900> settings<00:02:25.350> on

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
I'm using some pretty heavy settings on

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.350 
I'm using some pretty heavy settings on
the<00:02:25.560> compressor<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.280> squashes<00:02:26.760> everything

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
the compressor so it squashes everything

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.500 
the compressor so it squashes everything
else<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> adds<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.650> really<00:02:28.860> punchy<00:02:29.850> front

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
else so it adds a really punchy front

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.570 
else so it adds a really punchy front
end<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> snare<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.800> hits<00:02:32.010> really

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
end to the snare so it hits really

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.690 
end to the snare so it hits really
really<00:02:32.970> hard<00:02:33.270> which<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.990> what<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> want<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
really hard which is what I want so and

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.950 
really hard which is what I want so and
then<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.880> want<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> compressor<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.690> spring

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
then I want the compressor to spring

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.180 
then I want the compressor to spring
back<00:02:37.140> pretty<00:02:37.440> quickly<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
back pretty quickly so I have the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.190 
back pretty quickly so I have the
release<00:02:38.490> down<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.360> know<00:02:39.420> 17<00:02:39.900> milliseconds

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
release down at you know 17 milliseconds

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.070 
release down at you know 17 milliseconds
and<00:02:40.680> I've<00:02:41.610> cranked<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> ratio<00:02:42.630> down<00:02:42.870> so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and I've cranked the ratio down so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.690 
and I've cranked the ratio down so
visually<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.130> getting<00:02:44.400> quite<00:02:44.670> a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
visually I can see it's getting quite a

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.020 
visually I can see it's getting quite a
bit<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:45.030> gain<00:02:45.240> reduction<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:47.370> threshold

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
bit of gain reduction and the threshold

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.190 
bit of gain reduction and the threshold
in<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.120> race<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:48.480> set<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:48.959> yeah<00:02:49.140> that's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
in the race you are set so yeah that's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.560 
in the race you are set so yeah that's
giving<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.620> compressing<00:02:49.980> quite<00:02:50.250> hard<00:02:50.570> so

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
giving it's compressing quite hard so

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.699 
giving it's compressing quite hard so
this<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.410> another<00:02:52.620> look<00:02:52.830> at<00:02:52.980> this

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:07.390 

you<00:02:58.709> can<00:02:58.860> hear<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.160> front<00:02:59.520> end<00:02:59.610> to<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.360> note

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.890 

awesome<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.450> leave<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.600> like

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
awesome so I'm going to leave that like

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.670 
awesome so I'm going to leave that like
that<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:11.150> an<00:03:12.150> important<00:03:12.720> thing<00:03:12.870> as<00:03:12.990> well<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
that and an important thing as well that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.110 
that and an important thing as well that
you<00:03:13.709> want<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.070> monitoring<00:03:14.580> as<00:03:14.850> you're

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
you want to be monitoring as you're

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.850 
you want to be monitoring as you're
going<00:03:15.270> through<00:03:15.360> your<00:03:15.570> track<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.709> want<00:03:16.830> to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
going through your track is you want to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.530 
going through your track is you want to
be<00:03:16.980> monitoring<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> frequency<00:03:17.940> spectrum<00:03:17.970> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
be monitoring the frequency spectrum and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.509 
be monitoring the frequency spectrum and
the<00:03:18.570> reason<00:03:19.350> why<00:03:19.500> you're<00:03:19.830> doing<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.160> is

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the reason why you're doing that is

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.310 
the reason why you're doing that is
because<00:03:20.700> when<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.480> get<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.840> mastering

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
because when you get to the mastering

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.560 
because when you get to the mastering
stage<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.250> haven't<00:03:23.640> rolled<00:03:23.940> out<00:03:24.150> enough

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
stage if you haven't rolled out enough

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.140 
stage if you haven't rolled out enough
of<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.930> low<00:03:25.110> end<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.620> track<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.940> lot

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
of the low end in your track and a lot

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.030 
of the low end in your track and a lot
of<00:03:27.180> sub<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.720> sneaking<00:03:28.019> through<00:03:28.350> from<00:03:28.620> elements

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
of sub is sneaking through from elements

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.460 
of sub is sneaking through from elements
where<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.370> really<00:03:29.550> shouldn't<00:03:29.880> be<00:03:30.090> then<00:03:30.989> you're

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
where it really shouldn't be then you're

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.509 
where it really shouldn't be then you're
going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.800> lot<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.010> trouble<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
going to have a lot of trouble in the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.740 
going to have a lot of trouble in the
mastering<00:03:32.880> process<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.390> you're<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.690> to

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
mastering process and you're going to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.780 
mastering process and you're going to
need<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.989> go<00:03:34.080> back<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.320> re<00:03:34.680> eq<00:03:35.100> everything<00:03:35.430> so

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
need to go back and re eq everything so

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.790 
need to go back and re eq everything so
I<00:03:36.090> really<00:03:36.959> want<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.170> guys<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:37.560> like

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
I really want you guys to have like

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.000 
I really want you guys to have like
super<00:03:38.310> fat<00:03:38.519> punchy<00:03:39.269> loud<00:03:39.540> beats<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:40.860> got

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
super fat punchy loud beats so you got

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.680 
super fat punchy loud beats so you got
to<00:03:41.130> stay<00:03:41.280> with<00:03:41.310> me<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:41.820> one<00:03:42.030> use

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
to stay with me on this one use

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.229 
to stay with me on this one use
frequency<00:03:43.110> analyzers<00:03:43.790> spectrum<00:03:44.790> analyzers

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
frequency analyzers spectrum analyzers

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.270 
frequency analyzers spectrum analyzers
so<00:03:45.390> Ableton<00:03:45.810> has<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.110> built<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.739> take<00:03:47.130> this

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
so Ableton has one built in is take this

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.039 
so Ableton has one built in is take this
bad<00:03:47.489> boy<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.090> drop<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.540> right<00:03:48.630> here<00:03:48.900> and

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
bad boy and you drop it right here and

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.020 
bad boy and you drop it right here and
what<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:49.950> will<00:03:50.130> do<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.580> going<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.760> show

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
what this will do is it's going to show

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.449 
what this will do is it's going to show
you<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.750> EQ<00:03:52.200> curve<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.040> now<00:03:53.220> i'm<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
you the EQ curve so now i'm going to

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.220 
you the EQ curve so now i'm going to
play<00:03:53.610> my<00:03:53.730> snares<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.450> we're<00:03:54.900> going<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.080> see

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
play my snares and we're going to see

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.890 
play my snares and we're going to see
how<00:03:55.320> they're<00:03:55.440> looking<00:03:59.390> so<00:04:00.390> as<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.510> can<00:04:00.690> see

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
how they're looking so as you can see

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.320 
how they're looking so as you can see
there's<00:04:01.110> really<00:04:01.410> nothing<00:04:01.980> going<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.700> this

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
there's really nothing going on in this

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.729 
there's really nothing going on in this
range<00:04:03.690> right<00:04:03.989> here<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.290> know<00:04:04.320> this<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.620> like

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
range right here you know this is like

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.520 
range right here you know this is like
100<00:04:05.160> hertz<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.730> down<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.350> don't

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
100 hertz and down and you really don't

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.820 
100 hertz and down and you really don't
need<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:08.040> range<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.549> your<00:04:08.700> snares<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
need that range in your snares so the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.530 
need that range in your snares so the
reason<00:04:11.160> why<00:04:11.280> there<00:04:11.519> isn't<00:04:11.820> any<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.239> going

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
reason why there isn't any of that going

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.150 
reason why there isn't any of that going
on<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.810> because<00:04:12.930> I've<00:04:13.290> been<00:04:13.320> really<00:04:13.650> careful

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
on is because I've been really careful

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.680 
on is because I've been really careful
to<00:04:14.370> filter<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.180> EQ<00:04:15.750> out<00:04:15.989> at<00:04:16.500> every<00:04:17.070> stage<00:04:17.690> the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
to filter and EQ out at every stage the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.180 
to filter and EQ out at every stage the
bottom<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.169> out<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.410> my<00:04:19.500> snares<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:19.950> that's

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
bottom and out of my snares and that's

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.339 
bottom and out of my snares and that's
going<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.400> allow<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:21.269> audio<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.840> does<00:04:22.109> get

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
going to allow the audio that does get

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.279 
going to allow the audio that does get
through<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:23.190> be<00:04:23.340> way<00:04:23.640> more<00:04:23.669> punchy<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.479> way

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
through to be way more punchy and way

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.540 
through to be way more punchy and way
more<00:04:25.320> loud

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
more loud

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.640 
more loud
and<00:04:26.669> if<00:04:26.879> I<00:04:27.030> hadn't<00:04:27.389> done<00:04:27.509> that<00:04:27.569> so<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.560> a

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
and if I hadn't done that so this is a

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.080 
and if I hadn't done that so this is a
good<00:04:28.800> practice<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.159> get<00:04:29.340> into<00:04:29.610> i<00:04:29.639> would<00:04:29.940> use

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
good practice to get into i would use

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.700 
good practice to get into i would use
spectrum<00:04:30.509> analyzers<00:04:30.990> on<00:04:31.139> pretty<00:04:31.590> much

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
spectrum analyzers on pretty much

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.379 
spectrum analyzers on pretty much
everything<00:04:32.099> so<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.460> can<00:04:32.580> watch<00:04:32.789> your<00:04:33.000> EQ

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
everything so you can watch your EQ

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:43.460 
everything so you can watch your EQ
curves<00:04:41.750> alright<00:04:42.750> now<00:04:42.960> we're<00:04:43.080> going<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.229> talk

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
curves alright now we're going to talk

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.850 
curves alright now we're going to talk
about<00:04:43.620> another<00:04:44.159> one<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.490> my<00:04:44.669> favorite<00:04:45.419> plugins

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
about another one of my favorite plugins

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.800 
about another one of my favorite plugins
so<00:04:46.860> what<00:04:47.129> I've<00:04:47.250> done<00:04:47.460> here<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.909> I've<00:04:48.270> taken<00:04:48.419> the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
so what I've done here is I've taken the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.110 
so what I've done here is I've taken the
snares<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.379> the<00:04:49.800> kicks<00:04:50.039> and<00:04:50.310> I've<00:04:50.849> grouped

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
snares and the kicks and I've grouped

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.029 
snares and the kicks and I've grouped
them<00:04:51.389> together<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:52.409> way<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:52.530> do<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.919> in

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
them together the way you do that in

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.589 
them together the way you do that in
Ableton<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.610> would<00:04:53.729> click<00:04:53.940> on<00:04:54.120> two<00:04:54.360> tracks

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
Ableton is you would click on two tracks

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.249 
Ableton is you would click on two tracks
and<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.590> hit<00:04:55.860> command<00:04:56.789> G<00:04:57.180> on<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.509> Mac<00:04:57.659> or<00:04:58.139> you

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
and you hit command G on the Mac or you

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.529 
and you hit command G on the Mac or you
just<00:04:58.379> right-click<00:04:58.979> and<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.849> can<00:05:00.000> go<00:05:00.150> group

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
just right-click and you can go group

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.420 
just right-click and you can go group
usually<00:05:01.440> when<00:05:01.560> you<00:05:01.620> have<00:05:01.800> if<00:05:02.009> they're<00:05:02.159> not<00:05:02.280> in

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
usually when you have if they're not in

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.129 
usually when you have if they're not in
a<00:05:02.490> group<00:05:02.669> already<00:05:03.229> so<00:05:04.229> on<00:05:05.060> this<00:05:06.060> group<00:05:06.449> or<00:05:06.719> a

referred<00:05:10.379> I<00:05:10.729> have<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.759> limiter<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:13.250> activate

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
referred I have a limiter and activate

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.790 
referred I have a limiter and activate
this<00:05:14.340> limiter<00:05:14.699> and<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:16.050> in<00:05:16.319> this<00:05:16.469> case<00:05:16.650> I'm

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
this limiter and this in this case I'm

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.290 
this limiter and this in this case I'm
using<00:05:16.830> izotope<00:05:17.490> ozone<00:05:17.520> there's<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.120> lot<00:05:18.270> of

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
using izotope ozone there's a lot of

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.879 
using izotope ozone there's a lot of
different<00:05:18.569> limiters<00:05:18.870> including<00:05:19.349> one<00:05:19.560> built

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
different limiters including one built

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.529 
different limiters including one built
in<00:05:20.069> to<00:05:20.190> live<00:05:20.340> but<00:05:20.789> this<00:05:21.030> is<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.240> one<00:05:21.360> that<00:05:21.449> I

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
in to live but this is the one that I

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.510 
in to live but this is the one that I
know<00:05:21.569> the<00:05:21.900> best<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.379> I<00:05:22.740> like<00:05:22.949> the<00:05:23.129> sound<00:05:23.280> of

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
know the best and I like the sound of

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.850 
know the best and I like the sound of
the<00:05:23.699> best<00:05:23.960> so<00:05:24.960> there's<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.229> lot<00:05:25.379> of<00:05:25.440> different

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
the best so there's a lot of different

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.010 
the best so there's a lot of different
modules<00:05:26.340> in<00:05:26.520> this<00:05:26.550> limiter<00:05:27.030> because<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:27.870> has

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
modules in this limiter because it has

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.020 
modules in this limiter because it has
other<00:05:28.259> functions<00:05:28.919> it's<00:05:29.069> a<00:05:29.190> mastering<00:05:29.699> plugin

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
other functions it's a mastering plugin

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.390 
other functions it's a mastering plugin
but<00:05:30.719> I'm<00:05:30.900> just<00:05:31.169> using<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.889> loudness

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
but I'm just using the loudness

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.149 
but I'm just using the loudness
Maximizer<00:05:33.120> which<00:05:33.419> is<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.779> limiter<00:05:34.289> now<00:05:35.099> the

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
Maximizer which is a limiter now the

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.730 
Maximizer which is a limiter now the
reason<00:05:35.490> why<00:05:35.729> I'm<00:05:35.819> doing<00:05:35.969> this<00:05:36.090> is<00:05:36.740> I've

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
reason why I'm doing this is I've

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.439 
reason why I'm doing this is I've
compressed<00:05:38.310> all<00:05:38.460> these<00:05:38.610> samples<00:05:39.060> they<00:05:39.210> sound

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
compressed all these samples they sound

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.899 
compressed all these samples they sound
punchy<00:05:39.990> a<00:05:40.169> limiter<00:05:40.979> will<00:05:41.190> take<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.699> to<00:05:41.819> the

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
punchy a limiter will take it to the

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.510 
punchy a limiter will take it to the
next<00:05:42.000> level<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:42.650> with<00:05:43.650> dance<00:05:43.949> music<00:05:44.310> it's<00:05:44.460> a

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
next level and with dance music it's a

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.490 
next level and with dance music it's a
little<00:05:44.759> different<00:05:44.909> than<00:05:45.240> say<00:05:45.750> mastering<00:05:46.409> a

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
little different than say mastering a

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.290 
little different than say mastering a
piece<00:05:46.830> of<00:05:46.860> classical<00:05:47.370> music<00:05:47.490> or<00:05:47.819> jazz<00:05:48.090> or

piece of classical music or jazz or

piece of classical music or jazz or
something<00:05:48.509> like<00:05:48.569> that<00:05:48.630> on<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.289> stuff<00:05:49.529> you'd

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
something like that on that stuff you'd

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:50.809 
something like that on that stuff you'd
want<00:05:50.099> to<00:05:50.159> be<00:05:50.219> really<00:05:50.460> careful<00:05:50.610> about

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
want to be really careful about

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.059 
want to be really careful about

and<00:05:55.529> dance<00:05:55.710> music<00:05:56.039> we<00:05:56.129> want<00:05:56.279> it<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.490> be<00:05:56.610> as<00:05:56.819> loud

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
and dance music we want it to be as loud

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.420 
and dance music we want it to be as loud
as<00:05:57.539> freakin<00:05:57.870> possible<00:05:58.349> and<00:05:58.529> we<00:05:59.099> want<00:05:59.279> it<00:05:59.310> to

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
as freakin possible and we want it to

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.869 
as freakin possible and we want it to
just<00:05:59.460> like<00:05:59.699> punch<00:06:00.659> out<00:06:00.870> of<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.050> system<00:06:01.259> so

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
just like punch out of the system so

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.950 
just like punch out of the system so
what<00:06:02.879> really<00:06:03.060> allows<00:06:03.360> us<00:06:03.509> to<00:06:03.629> do<00:06:03.719> that<00:06:03.840> as

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
what really allows us to do that as

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.129 
what really allows us to do that as
limiters<00:06:04.319> so<00:06:04.949> in<00:06:05.250> this<00:06:05.400> case<00:06:05.779> i'm<00:06:06.779> using<00:06:06.840> a

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
limiters so in this case i'm using a

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.080 
limiters so in this case i'm using a
limiter<00:06:07.409> on<00:06:07.440> my<00:06:07.800> main<00:06:08.129> percussion<00:06:08.699> elements<00:06:09.029> i

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
limiter on my main percussion elements i

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.180 
limiter on my main percussion elements i
don't<00:06:09.270> typically<00:06:09.599> use<00:06:09.870> it<00:06:09.990> on<00:06:10.139> high<00:06:10.440> hats<00:06:10.740> and

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
don't typically use it on high hats and

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.330 
don't typically use it on high hats and
and<00:06:11.370> other<00:06:12.029> stuff<00:06:12.590> because<00:06:13.590> it<00:06:13.770> gets<00:06:13.979> limited

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
and other stuff because it gets limited

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.159 
and other stuff because it gets limited
at<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.639> end<00:06:14.819> in<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.180> mastering<00:06:15.569> process<00:06:15.750> but

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
at the end in the mastering process but

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.260 
at the end in the mastering process but
in<00:06:16.349> my<00:06:16.590> process<00:06:16.889> of<00:06:17.159> production<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:17.909> writing

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
in my process of production and writing

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.240 
in my process of production and writing
my<00:06:18.360> beats<00:06:18.599> i<00:06:18.779> definitely<00:06:19.529> use<00:06:19.680> it<00:06:19.800> on<00:06:19.889> my<00:06:20.009> main

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
my beats i definitely use it on my main

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.369 
my beats i definitely use it on my main
beats<00:06:20.520> which<00:06:20.699> are<00:06:20.849> the<00:06:20.940> kick<00:06:21.120> and<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.300> snare

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
beats which are the kick and the snare

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.899 
beats which are the kick and the snare
so<00:06:22.379> I<00:06:22.409> have<00:06:22.620> these<00:06:22.770> bust<00:06:23.219> again<00:06:23.460> like<00:06:23.789> we

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
so I have these bust again like we

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.249 
so I have these bust again like we
talked<00:06:24.090> about<00:06:24.210> we<00:06:24.509> have<00:06:24.599> a<00:06:24.629> limit<00:06:24.930> of<00:06:24.990> running

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
talked about we have a limit of running

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.790 
talked about we have a limit of running
and<00:06:25.469> I<00:06:26.370> have<00:06:27.029> the<00:06:27.810> limit<00:06:28.080> or<00:06:28.169> running<00:06:28.469> so<00:06:28.680> that

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
and I have the limit or running so that

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.980 
and I have the limit or running so that
it's<00:06:28.949> at<00:06:29.219> its<00:06:29.490> fastest<00:06:30.090> possible<00:06:30.419> setting

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
it's at its fastest possible setting

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.499 
it's at its fastest possible setting
which<00:06:31.169> is<00:06:31.319> called<00:06:31.710> clipping<00:06:32.250> so<00:06:33.150> this<00:06:33.300> got<00:06:33.479> a

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
which is called clipping so this got a

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.649 
which is called clipping so this got a
speed<00:06:34.250> dial<00:06:35.250> here<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:35.789> I<00:06:36.029> have<00:06:36.180> it<00:06:36.270> running<00:06:36.479> it

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
speed dial here and I have it running it

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.540 
speed dial here and I have it running it
clipping<00:06:37.050> i'm<00:06:37.409> using<00:06:37.589> the<00:06:37.830> intelligent<00:06:38.370> to

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
clipping i'm using the intelligent to

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.370 
clipping i'm using the intelligent to
mode<00:06:38.789> and<00:06:39.060> I've<00:06:39.509> cranked<00:06:40.020> through

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
mode and I've cranked through

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.600 
mode and I've cranked through
hold<00:06:40.560> down<00:06:40.710> so<00:06:40.890> I'm<00:06:40.980> getting<00:06:41.130> like<00:06:41.370> kind<00:06:41.580> of

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
hold down so I'm getting like kind of

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.380 
hold down so I'm getting like kind of
425<00:06:42.420> decibels<00:06:42.990> of<00:06:43.080> limiting<00:06:43.500> on<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.910> hits<00:06:45.120> so

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
425 decibels of limiting on the hits so

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.300 
425 decibels of limiting on the hits so
just<00:06:45.900> play<00:06:46.530> this<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:46.860> listen<00:06:46.950> to<00:06:47.100> how<00:06:47.190> it

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
just play this and listen to how it

00:06:47.310 --> 00:07:00.380 
just play this and listen to how it
sounds<00:06:58.400> good<00:06:59.400> so<00:06:59.640> you<00:06:59.700> can<00:06:59.880> see<00:07:00.000> the<00:07:00.090> limiter

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
sounds good so you can see the limiter

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.320 
sounds good so you can see the limiter
working<00:07:00.750> and<00:07:01.100> again<00:07:02.100> that's<00:07:02.280> what's<00:07:02.670> giving

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
working and again that's what's giving

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.260 
working and again that's what's giving
our<00:07:03.480> main<00:07:04.260> kick<00:07:04.590> and<00:07:04.740> snare<00:07:04.860> that<00:07:05.070> super<00:07:05.970> super

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
our main kick and snare that super super

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.660 
our main kick and snare that super super
punchy<00:07:06.690> in-your-face<00:07:07.050> kind<00:07:07.440> of<00:07:07.590> sound<00:07:07.800> so

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 
punchy in-your-face kind of sound so

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.090 
punchy in-your-face kind of sound so
that's<00:07:08.940> ozone<00:07:09.330> and<00:07:09.570> limiting<00:07:10.230> which<00:07:10.440> is<00:07:10.620> kind

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
that's ozone and limiting which is kind

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.800 
that's ozone and limiting which is kind
of<00:07:11.160> last<00:07:11.400> of<00:07:11.670> my<00:07:11.790> favorite<00:07:12.180> plugins<00:07:12.420> when<00:07:12.720> it
