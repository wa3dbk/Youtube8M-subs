00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
but like I don't know usually usually

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.420 
but like I don't know usually usually

something but I don't understand this

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.990 
something but I don't understand this
one<00:02:51.920> uh<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.180> if<00:02:53.870> anybody<00:02:54.200> knows<00:02:54.670> feel<00:02:55.670> free<00:02:55.940> to

one uh so if anybody knows feel free to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.110 
one uh so if anybody knows feel free to
let<00:02:56.299> me<00:02:56.360> know<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:57.560> far<00:02:57.769> as<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.010> shoe<00:02:58.280> goes<00:02:58.519> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
let me know as far as the shoe goes the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.100 
let me know as far as the shoe goes the
entire<00:02:59.360> upper<00:02:59.750> is<00:02:59.930> three<00:03:00.440> M<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.450> lighting<00:03:02.870> is

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
entire upper is three M the lighting is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.539 
entire upper is three M the lighting is
probably<00:03:03.500> pretty<00:03:03.739> bright<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.280> probably

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
probably pretty bright so you probably

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.340 
probably pretty bright so you probably
can't<00:03:04.880> see<00:03:04.970> where<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.630> try<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.780> walk<00:03:05.989> some<00:03:06.230> of

can't see where you try to walk some of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.160 
can't see where you try to walk some of
it<00:03:06.440> actually<00:03:07.540> probably<00:03:08.540> can't<00:03:08.690> see<00:03:08.870> exactly

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
it actually probably can't see exactly

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.229 
it actually probably can't see exactly
how<00:03:09.410> bright<00:03:09.769> this<00:03:10.010> shoe<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.430> but<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:11.000> like
