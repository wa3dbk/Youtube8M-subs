00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:49.940

 internet user that program marcelo deus 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.400
 so that each one can follow his 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.020
 my own path and that's why I chose 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 follow the path of not mixing with 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:38.570
 Atheists ask if you could have defined 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.570
 they are and a word with this work 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.240
 most of the atheists 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.290
 think smarter than the question 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 Do you think you 're smarter than 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.250
 obsact with certainty 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.350
 certainly because the largest 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.759
 thinkers plus names from all over the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:08.179
 humanity is mateus 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:13.510
 look there for example the great father 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 nilton was christian and milton question 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.549
 I believe in the most beautiful art and science 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.159
 This discussion is asking God for help. 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:26.400
 You certainly do not love it the way you do. 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.560
 I wanted 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.960
 instead of war or if it gives to you 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:42.170
 an answering Bible passage 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:47.130
 perfectly that question about them 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:50.880

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:12.060
 revenge on the war of the 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.200
 crusades and never killed anyone can be 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.200
 compared to fitur 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:40.130
 living and learning let's go out 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.130
 that the harmony between an atheist 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.050

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:41.100
 religious leaders leaving Jews gave 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.340
 let sexual option left until your the 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.800
 that matters between them both do well 3 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.030
 does it matter what you do to the world 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.090
 I think when it comes to 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:07:02.300
 deities not as religion have 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:07:02.300
