hello everybody in today's video we're
going<00:00:15.429> to<00:00:15.490> take<00:00:15.580> a<00:00:15.639> look<00:00:15.849> at<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.090> cyclone<00:00:16.509> boys

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
going to take a look at the cyclone boys

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.010 
going to take a look at the cyclone boys
4x4<00:00:17.890> this<00:00:18.460> one<00:00:18.669> came<00:00:19.180> out<00:00:19.300> I'm<00:00:19.509> not<00:00:19.630> sure<00:00:19.660> how

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
4x4 this one came out I'm not sure how

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.409 
4x4 this one came out I'm not sure how
long<00:00:20.050> ago<00:00:20.619> I<00:00:20.829> believe<00:00:21.310> I've<00:00:21.640> seen<00:00:21.669> the<00:00:22.060> cyclone

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
long ago I believe I've seen the cyclone

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.760 
long ago I believe I've seen the cyclone
boys<00:00:22.599> for<00:00:22.960> quite<00:00:23.169> a<00:00:23.199> while

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
boys for quite a while

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.380 
boys for quite a while
I<00:00:23.800> just<00:00:24.369> think<00:00:24.550> that<00:00:24.640> they<00:00:24.820> didn't<00:00:25.060> have<00:00:25.239> any

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
I just think that they didn't have any

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.029 
I just think that they didn't have any
kind<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.689> popularity<00:00:26.230> until<00:00:26.529> some<00:00:27.009> other

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
kind of popularity until some other

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.530 
kind of popularity until some other
keywords<00:00:27.640> that<00:00:27.699> started<00:00:28.000> showing<00:00:28.270> them<00:00:28.390> on

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
keywords that started showing them on

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.319 
keywords that started showing them on
their<00:00:28.689> channels<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:30.279> I<00:00:30.340> may<00:00:30.550> be<00:00:30.579> wrong<00:00:30.700> I<00:00:31.180> mean

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
their channels but I may be wrong I mean

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.850 
their channels but I may be wrong I mean
I<00:00:31.390> think<00:00:31.540> I've<00:00:31.899> seen<00:00:32.079> them<00:00:32.230> for<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.469> long<00:00:32.619> time

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
I think I've seen them for a long time

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.580 
I think I've seen them for a long time
but<00:00:32.980> they<00:00:33.190> may<00:00:33.340> be<00:00:33.370> brand<00:00:33.640> new<00:00:33.790> anyways<00:00:34.660> so<00:00:35.379> I'm

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
but they may be brand new anyways so I'm

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.810 
but they may be brand new anyways so I'm
really<00:00:35.800> interested<00:00:35.980> in<00:00:36.250> this<00:00:36.370> because<00:00:36.640> I've

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
really interested in this because I've

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.760 
really interested in this because I've
tried<00:00:37.059> other<00:00:37.210> stickerless<00:00:37.690> 404s<00:00:38.410> like<00:00:38.680> the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
tried other stickerless 404s like the

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.400 
tried other stickerless 404s like the
dine<00:00:38.950> mf8<00:00:39.430> I've<00:00:40.000> tried<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.510> wit<00:00:40.780> for<00:00:41.079> I've

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
dine mf8 I've tried the wit for I've

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.470 
dine mf8 I've tried the wit for I've
tried<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.010> Dian<00:00:42.370> Ching<00:00:42.699> and<00:00:43.000> now<00:00:43.120> I'm<00:00:43.239> trying

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
tried the Dian Ching and now I'm trying

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.660 
tried the Dian Ching and now I'm trying
this<00:00:43.750> one<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.829> was<00:00:45.130> very<00:00:45.400> disappointed

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
this one and I was very disappointed

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.900 
this one and I was very disappointed
with<00:00:46.180> all<00:00:46.420> of<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.690> other<00:00:46.840> ones<00:00:47.079> and<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.760> I'm

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
with all of the other ones and so I'm

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.100 
with all of the other ones and so I'm
really<00:00:49.120> looking<00:00:49.360> forward<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.750> stickerless

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
really looking forward to a stickerless

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.710 
really looking forward to a stickerless
for<00:00:50.380> my<00:00:50.470> 4<00:00:50.649> because<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:50.950> do<00:00:51.010> enjoy<00:00:51.399> solving<00:00:52.360> a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
for my 4 because I do enjoy solving a

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.479 
for my 4 because I do enjoy solving a
stickerless<00:00:53.079> 3x3<00:00:53.770> from<00:00:53.950> time<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.280> time<00:00:54.310> I

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
stickerless 3x3 from time to time I

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.910 
stickerless 3x3 from time to time I
think<00:00:54.670> it's<00:00:54.940> just<00:00:55.120> a<00:00:55.300> little<00:00:55.899> fun<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.620> solve

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
think it's just a little fun to solve

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.040 
think it's just a little fun to solve
one<00:00:57.130> of<00:00:57.220> these<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:57.670> I<00:00:58.180> always<00:00:58.300> wanted<00:00:58.690> one<00:00:58.840> in

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
one of these and I always wanted one in

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.229 
one of these and I always wanted one in
a<00:00:59.170> 4x4<00:00:59.440> but<00:01:00.250> everyone<00:01:01.000> has<00:01:01.120> been

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
a 4x4 but everyone has been

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.180 
a 4x4 but everyone has been
disappointing<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:01.960> far<00:01:02.200> so<00:01:02.590> I<00:01:02.620> had<00:01:02.800> high<00:01:02.980> hopes

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
disappointing so far so I had high hopes

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.920 
disappointing so far so I had high hopes
for<00:01:03.370> this<00:01:03.579> one<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:04.059> after<00:01:04.329> having<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.689> for

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
for this one and after having this for

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.719 
for this one and after having this for
quite<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.259> long<00:01:05.409> time<00:01:05.469> now<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.950> have<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.369> say<00:01:06.549> that

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
quite a long time now I have to say that

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.850 
quite a long time now I have to say that
I<00:01:06.759> do<00:01:06.880> believe<00:01:07.329> that<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:08.049> one<00:01:08.259> is<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.530> best

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
I do believe that this one is the best

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.620 
I do believe that this one is the best
one<00:01:09.130> on<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.280> market<00:01:09.369> it's<00:01:10.149> still<00:01:10.450> not<00:01:10.570> very

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
one on the market it's still not very

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.679 
one on the market it's still not very
good<00:01:11.049> because<00:01:11.229> I<00:01:12.219> mean<00:01:12.579> as<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.729> speed<00:01:13.240> cube<00:01:13.570> I

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
good because I mean as a speed cube I

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.440 
good because I mean as a speed cube I
mean<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:13.960> puzzle<00:01:14.439> turns<00:01:14.939> fantastic<00:01:15.939> it's

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
mean this puzzle turns fantastic it's

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.319 
mean this puzzle turns fantastic it's
actually<00:01:16.840> really<00:01:17.170> really<00:01:17.319> nice<00:01:17.969> but<00:01:18.969> as<00:01:19.060> far

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
actually really really nice but as far

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.359 
actually really really nice but as far
as<00:01:19.359> speed<00:01:19.869> cubing<00:01:20.319> goes<00:01:20.530> it's<00:01:20.799> definitely<00:01:21.249> not

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
as speed cubing goes it's definitely not

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.029 
as speed cubing goes it's definitely not
going<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.579> keep<00:01:21.850> up<00:01:22.030> with<00:01:22.209> your<00:01:22.539> mo<00:01:23.259> u<00:01:23.319> cubes<00:01:23.889> or

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
going to keep up with your mo u cubes or

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.719 
going to keep up with your mo u cubes or
your<00:01:24.159> shangzhou

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
your shangzhou

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.699 
your shangzhou
or<00:01:24.999> something<00:01:25.329> like<00:01:25.389> that<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:26.469> if<00:01:26.560> you're

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
or something like that so if you're

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:29.219 
or something like that so if you're
looking<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:27.009> speed<00:01:27.549> solve<00:01:28.090> one<00:01:29.049> of<00:01:29.079> these

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
looking to speed solve one of these

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.230 
looking to speed solve one of these
puzzles<00:01:29.529> you<00:01:29.799> can<00:01:30.100> get<00:01:30.340> decent<00:01:30.549> times<00:01:30.880> with<00:01:31.090> it

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
puzzles you can get decent times with it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.669 
puzzles you can get decent times with it
but<00:01:31.659> you're<00:01:31.749> not<00:01:31.899> going<00:01:32.109> to<00:01:32.170> get<00:01:32.350> your<00:01:32.529> average

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
but you're not going to get your average

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.769 
but you're not going to get your average
for<00:01:33.069> sure<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:33.340> don't<00:01:33.399> think<00:01:33.579> at<00:01:33.850> least<00:01:34.029> unless

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:34.779 
for sure I don't think at least unless

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:36.269 
for sure I don't think at least unless
of<00:01:35.139> course<00:01:35.170> you're<00:01:35.469> using<00:01:35.619> something<00:01:36.039> worse

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:36.279 
of course you're using something worse

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:37.769 
of course you're using something worse
than<00:01:36.310> this<00:01:36.819> and<00:01:36.880> that's<00:01:37.209> what<00:01:37.329> you're<00:01:37.479> used<00:01:37.689> to

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779 
than this and that's what you're used to

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:38.849 
than this and that's what you're used to
of<00:01:37.959> course<00:01:38.079> you'll<00:01:38.319> get<00:01:38.409> something<00:01:38.740> better

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
of course you'll get something better

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.359 
of course you'll get something better
probably<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:39.959> anyways<00:01:40.959> a<00:01:40.990> turning<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:42.219> outer

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
probably so anyways a turning the outer

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.190 
probably so anyways a turning the outer
layers<00:01:42.639> are<00:01:42.759> very<00:01:43.119> very<00:01:43.359> nice<00:01:43.569> on<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:44.049> I

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
layers are very very nice on this I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.760 
layers are very very nice on this I
really<00:01:44.529> enjoy<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.069> outer<00:01:45.189> layers<00:01:45.959> now<00:01:46.959> for

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
really enjoy the outer layers now for

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.739 
really enjoy the outer layers now for
the<00:01:47.859> 3x3<00:01:48.219> aspect<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:48.999> this<00:01:49.090> it's<00:01:49.299> actually<00:01:49.420> not

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
the 3x3 aspect of this it's actually not

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.410 
the 3x3 aspect of this it's actually not
too<00:01:50.079> bad<00:01:50.109> but<00:01:50.920> there's<00:01:51.069> zero<00:01:51.609> tolerance<00:01:51.999> for

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
too bad but there's zero tolerance for

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.359 
too bad but there's zero tolerance for
reverse<00:01:52.899> corner<00:01:53.229> cutting<00:01:53.349> as<00:01:53.709> you<00:01:53.829> can<00:01:53.979> see<00:01:54.189> so

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
reverse corner cutting as you can see so

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.599 
reverse corner cutting as you can see so
you<00:01:54.819> can<00:01:55.149> get<00:01:55.299> some<00:01:55.509> serious<00:01:55.899> lock<00:01:56.169> ups<00:01:56.439> so<00:01:57.249> in

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
you can get some serious lock ups so in

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.580 
you can get some serious lock ups so in
a<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.209> a<00:01:58.299> cube<00:01:58.539> like<00:01:58.569> this<00:01:58.749> what<00:01:59.139> you<00:01:59.229> tend<00:01:59.499> to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
a in a cube like this what you tend to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.120 
a in a cube like this what you tend to
do<00:01:59.829> is<00:02:00.099> and<00:02:00.939> it's<00:02:01.329> bad<00:02:01.599> actually<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.439> really

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
do is and it's bad actually to really

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.190 
do is and it's bad actually to really
get<00:02:03.279> used<00:02:03.459> to<00:02:03.609> a<00:02:03.639> cube<00:02:03.939> like<00:02:04.029> this<00:02:04.090> because<00:02:04.599> you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
get used to a cube like this because you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.589 
get used to a cube like this because you
tend<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.679> overshoot<00:02:06.069> and<00:02:06.609> you<00:02:06.969> rely<00:02:07.329> on<00:02:07.359> the

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
tend to overshoot and you rely on the

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.210 
tend to overshoot and you rely on the
corner<00:02:07.929> cutting<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.410> way<00:02:08.560> because<00:02:08.770> even

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
corner cutting this way because even

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.070 
corner cutting this way because even
though<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.369> has<00:02:09.489> zero<00:02:10.300> reverse<00:02:10.750> corner

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
though it has zero reverse corner

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.600 
though it has zero reverse corner
cutting<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.890> actually<00:02:12.160> has<00:02:12.310> pretty<00:02:12.520> decent

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
cutting it actually has pretty decent

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.570 
cutting it actually has pretty decent
regular<00:02:13.480> corner<00:02:13.810> cutting<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.400> really

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
regular corner cutting so you can really

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.550 
regular corner cutting so you can really
rely<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.959> your<00:02:17.080> algorithms

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
rely on that to get your algorithms

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.010 
rely on that to get your algorithms
going<00:02:17.830> fast<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.370> when<00:02:19.239> when<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.750> my

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
going fast and when when I do my

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.540 
going fast and when when I do my
algorithms<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:20.920> solve<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.280> thing<00:02:21.460> in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
algorithms or just solve this thing in

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.210 
algorithms or just solve this thing in
general<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:21.880> find<00:02:22.210> that<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.390> overshoot<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.440> bit<00:02:23.590> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
general I find that I overshoot a bit so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.950 
general I find that I overshoot a bit so
I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.670 
I
I<00:02:24.990> don't<00:02:25.350> lock<00:02:26.250> up<00:02:26.550> like<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.120> use<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.290> corner

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I don't lock up like I use the corner

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220 
I don't lock up like I use the corner
cutting<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.730> my<00:02:30.240> advantage<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.960> know<00:02:31.050> what<00:02:31.140> I

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
cutting to my advantage you know what I

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:40.970 
cutting to my advantage you know what I
mean<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:37.730> skip<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.880> back<00:02:39.710> but<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.830> middle

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
mean and skip this back but the middle

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.150 
mean and skip this back but the middle
the<00:02:41.310> middle<00:02:41.340> layers<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.270> crunchy<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
the middle layers are a bit crunchy and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.560 
the middle layers are a bit crunchy and
the<00:02:44.160> reason<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.460> had<00:02:44.640> really<00:02:45.060> high<00:02:45.180> hopes<00:02:45.390> for

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the reason I had really high hopes for

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.700 
the reason I had really high hopes for
this<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> does<00:02:46.440> use<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
this is because it does use the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.680 
this is because it does use the
shangzhou<00:02:47.130> mechanism<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.060> mean<00:02:48.210> we<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.480> see

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
shangzhou mechanism I mean we can see

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.360 
shangzhou mechanism I mean we can see
inside<00:02:48.990> there<00:02:49.260> I'll<00:02:49.680> actually<00:02:49.860> show<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.280> at

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
inside there I'll actually show it at

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.600 
inside there I'll actually show it at
the<00:02:50.400> end<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.470> does<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.250> internal

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the end that it does have that internal

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.070 
the end that it does have that internal
thing<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.330> viewcube<00:02:54.570> for<00:02:54.900> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
thing just like the viewcube for the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.750 
thing just like the viewcube for the
shank<00:02:55.320> shall<00:02:55.560> Damone<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.070> all<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.400> these<00:02:56.520> new

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
shank shall Damone you all of these new

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.480 
shank shall Damone you all of these new
cubes<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.120> are<00:02:57.180> coming<00:02:57.420> out<00:02:57.710> X<00:02:58.710> cube<00:02:59.160> for<00:02:59.460> I

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
cubes that are coming out X cube for I

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.070 
cubes that are coming out X cube for I
mean<00:02:59.820> we've<00:02:59.970> seen<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.360> for<00:03:00.570> quite<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> long<00:03:01.020> time

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
mean we've seen it for quite a long time

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.760 
mean we've seen it for quite a long time
now

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
now

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.250 
now
I<00:03:02.270> figured<00:03:03.270> because<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.690> use<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.170> would

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
I figured because it use that it would

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.360 
I figured because it use that it would
be<00:03:04.380> really<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:04.740> good<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.280> it's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
be really really good and it's

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220 
be really really good and it's
definitely<00:03:05.850> not<00:03:06.030> too<00:03:06.210> bad<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:06.990> it's

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
definitely not too bad it's just it's

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.900 
definitely not too bad it's just it's
just<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.860> best<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.490> market<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.880> don't

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
just not the best on the market I don't

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.690 
just not the best on the market I don't
think<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> 4x4<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.650> general<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.130> mean<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.430> do

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
think for a 4x4 in general I mean I I do

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.970 
think for a 4x4 in general I mean I I do
believe<00:03:15.210> it's<00:03:15.420> if<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.260> definitely<00:03:16.800> in<00:03:16.950> my

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
believe it's if it's definitely in my

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.970 
believe it's if it's definitely in my
opinion<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.580> best<00:03:17.760> stickerless<00:03:18.510> 4x4<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.860> if

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
opinion the best stickerless 4x4 but if

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.770 
opinion the best stickerless 4x4 but if
you're<00:03:20.100> looking<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.490> speed<00:03:20.850> solve<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:21.510> thing

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
you're looking to speed solve this thing

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.060 
you're looking to speed solve this thing
you're<00:03:22.050> not<00:03:22.200> going<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.440> get<00:03:22.560> very<00:03:22.650> good<00:03:22.830> times

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
you're not going to get very good times

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.920 
you're not going to get very good times
but<00:03:23.490> if<00:03:23.610> you're<00:03:23.730> not<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> speed<00:03:24.270> cuber<00:03:24.720> and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
but if you're not a speed cuber and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.200 
but if you're not a speed cuber and
you're<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.680> regular<00:03:25.830> puzzle<00:03:26.610> solver<00:03:27.030> and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
you're just a regular puzzle solver and

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.340 
you're just a regular puzzle solver and
you<00:03:27.300> really<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.870> look<00:03:28.020> of<00:03:28.110> sticklers

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
you really like the look of sticklers

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.710 
you really like the look of sticklers
cubes<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.890> highly<00:03:29.550> highly<00:03:29.760> suggest<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:30.510> one

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
cubes I highly highly suggest this one

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
cubes I highly highly suggest this one
it<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.500> very<00:03:31.950> very<00:03:32.250> good<00:03:32.870> now<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.900> do<00:03:34.170> get<00:03:34.500> pops

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
it is very very good now I do get pops

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.440 
it is very very good now I do get pops
once<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.280> while<00:03:35.430> but<00:03:35.910> I've<00:03:36.000> got<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.210> tension

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
once in a while but I've got a tension

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.660 
once in a while but I've got a tension
fairly<00:03:37.320> tight<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:38.100> find<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.460> if<00:03:38.580> I

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
fairly tight and I find that if I

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.630 
fairly tight and I find that if I
attention<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.180> any<00:03:39.420> any<00:03:39.810> looser<00:03:40.410> then<00:03:41.310> it

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
attention it any any looser then it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.880 
attention it any any looser then it
doesn't<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.720> pop<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.140> actually<00:03:43.410> explodes

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
doesn't just pop it actually explodes

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.210 
doesn't just pop it actually explodes
and<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.750> pieces<00:03:45.960> are<00:03:46.110> kind<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.650> difficult<00:03:47.160> to

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
and the pieces are kind of difficult to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.680 
and the pieces are kind of difficult to
put<00:03:47.430> back<00:03:47.460> in<00:03:47.790> there<00:03:48.000> they're<00:03:48.330> shaped

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
put back in there they're shaped

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.780 
put back in there they're shaped
differently<00:03:49.260> than<00:03:49.500> any<00:03:49.710> other<00:03:49.800> 4x4<00:03:50.460> I've<00:03:50.550> seen

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
differently than any other 4x4 I've seen

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.400 
differently than any other 4x4 I've seen
the<00:03:51.120> mechanism<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> same<00:03:51.930> but<00:03:52.260> they've

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the mechanism is the same but they've

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.560 
the mechanism is the same but they've
altered<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.980> pieces<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> little<00:03:53.580> bit<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
altered the pieces a little bit the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.980 
altered the pieces a little bit the
stock<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.380> corners<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:56.010> really<00:03:56.670> big<00:03:56.990> but

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
stock of the corners is really big but

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.960 
stock of the corners is really big but
you'll<00:03:58.170> see<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.470> in<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.650> bit<00:03:58.850> anyways<00:03:59.850> I'm

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
you'll see that in a bit anyways I'm

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.600 
you'll see that in a bit anyways I'm
going<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.180> go<00:04:00.240> through<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> solve<00:04:01.050> of<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.620> so

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
going to go through a solve of this so

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.390 
going to go through a solve of this so
you<00:04:02.700> can<00:04:03.030> see<00:04:04.020> how<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> locks<00:04:04.740> up<00:04:07.160> but<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.250> can

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
you can see how it locks up but you can

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.160 
you can see how it locks up but you can
see<00:04:08.610> even<00:04:08.790> during<00:04:08.940> scrambling<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.690> moves

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
see even during scrambling it moves

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.500 
see even during scrambling it moves
fairly<00:04:10.620> well<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.910> did<00:04:12.060> take<00:04:12.240> this<00:04:12.330> thing

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
fairly well and I did take this thing

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.510 
fairly well and I did take this thing
apart<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.990> lube<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.380> but<00:04:13.830> what<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.130> don't<00:04:14.220> like

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
apart and lube it but what I don't like

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.360 
apart and lube it but what I don't like
is<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.970> these<00:04:15.210> really<00:04:15.950> crunchy<00:04:16.950> metal<00:04:17.220> layers

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
is is these really crunchy metal layers

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.110 
is is these really crunchy metal layers
you<00:04:17.549> can<00:04:17.580> hear<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.090> even<00:04:19.970> compared<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.030> an

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
you can hear that even compared to an

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.559 
you can hear that even compared to an
outside<00:04:21.920> it's

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
outside it's

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:29.850 
outside it's
it's<00:04:25.569> really<00:04:25.930> loud<00:04:28.139> all<00:04:29.139> right<00:04:29.409> let's<00:04:29.650> see

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
it's really loud all right let's see

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.790 
it's really loud all right let's see
what<00:04:29.889> we<00:04:30.099> got<00:04:30.370> here

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
what we got here

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.059 
what we got here
so<00:04:32.800> let<00:04:34.050> see<00:04:35.050> already<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.560> little<00:04:35.800> bit<00:04:35.919> of<00:04:36.009> a

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
so let see already a little bit of a

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.110 
so let see already a little bit of a
lock<00:04:36.250> up<00:04:36.460> there<00:04:36.699> I<00:04:38.639> was<00:04:39.639> going<00:04:39.759> to<00:04:39.819> say<00:04:39.970> I'm<00:04:40.060> not

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
lock up there I was going to say I'm not

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.279 
lock up there I was going to say I'm not
going<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.419> try<00:04:40.659> to<00:04:40.720> go<00:04:40.930> as<00:04:41.199> fast<00:04:41.530> as<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.009> can<00:04:43.289> but

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
going to try to go as fast as I can but

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.659 
going to try to go as fast as I can but
I<00:04:44.970> would<00:04:45.970> kind<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.210> defeat<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.569> purpose<00:04:46.659> of

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
I would kind of defeat the purpose of

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.330 
I would kind of defeat the purpose of
showing<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:50.289> abilities<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.949> puzzle<00:04:51.220> I

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
showing the abilities of the puzzle I

00:04:51.340 --> 00:05:01.770 
showing the abilities of the puzzle I
would<00:04:51.490> think<00:05:00.060> having<00:05:01.060> done<00:05:01.180> for<00:05:01.389> my<00:05:01.509> for<00:05:01.750> a

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
would think having done for my for a

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.149 
would think having done for my for a
little<00:05:01.990> while<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.259> ever<00:05:02.409> notice<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.860> do<00:05:02.919> this

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
little while you ever notice I do this

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.860 
little while you ever notice I do this
too

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
too

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.869 
too
any<00:05:04.870> time<00:05:05.139> that<00:05:05.379> somebody<00:05:05.710> does<00:05:05.860> is<00:05:05.979> solve<00:05:06.280> of

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:06.879 
any time that somebody does is solve of

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.980 
any time that somebody does is solve of
like<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.840> new<00:05:08.080> puzzle<00:05:09.449> they<00:05:10.449> go<00:05:10.599> oh<00:05:10.629> I<00:05:10.780> haven't

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
like a new puzzle they go oh I haven't

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.439 
like a new puzzle they go oh I haven't
solved<00:05:11.379> in<00:05:11.469> a<00:05:11.530> while<00:05:12.000> when<00:05:13.000> really<00:05:13.240> you're

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
solved in a while when really you're

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:21.930 
solved in a while when really you're
just<00:05:13.659> making<00:05:13.930> mistakes<00:05:17.219> okay<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.610> can<00:05:21.759> see

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
just making mistakes okay so you can see

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.070 
just making mistakes okay so you can see
that<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.659> turning<00:05:22.990> isn't<00:05:23.349> terrible<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:26.050> I

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
that it the turning isn't terrible but I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.620 
that it the turning isn't terrible but I
wish<00:05:26.379> it<00:05:26.530> was<00:05:26.680> better<00:05:26.919> for<00:05:27.159> sure<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:31.060> was<00:05:31.360> hoping

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
wish it was better for sure I was hoping

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.149 
wish it was better for sure I was hoping
we<00:05:31.750> get<00:05:31.870> parity<00:05:32.229> so<00:05:32.380> you<00:05:32.440> can<00:05:32.620> see<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.860> parity

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
we get parity so you can see the parity

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.740 
we get parity so you can see the parity
algorithm<00:05:33.550> in<00:05:33.639> action<00:05:33.789> on<00:05:34.029> this<00:05:34.150> thing<00:05:34.360> but<00:05:34.509> I

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
algorithm in action on this thing but I

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.939 
algorithm in action on this thing but I
will<00:05:35.380> do<00:05:35.889> that<00:05:36.009> after<00:05:36.360> this<00:05:37.360> solve<00:05:37.949> here's

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
will do that after this solve here's

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.350 
will do that after this solve here's
this<00:05:39.159> parity<00:05:39.580> algorithm<00:05:39.940> you<00:05:40.029> can<00:05:40.150> see<00:05:40.330> a

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
this parity algorithm you can see a

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.890 
this parity algorithm you can see a
little<00:05:40.509> bit<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.810> locking<00:05:41.229> up<00:05:41.349> happening<00:05:41.740> here

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.570 

alright<00:05:46.900> so<00:05:47.020> there's<00:05:47.199> a<00:05:47.259> parody<00:05:47.680> algorithms

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
alright so there's a parody algorithms

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.850 
alright so there's a parody algorithms
PLL<00:05:52.169> it<00:05:53.169> just<00:05:53.770> these<00:05:54.610> middle<00:05:54.969> layers<00:05:55.120> just<00:05:55.509> I

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
PLL it just these middle layers just I

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.170 
PLL it just these middle layers just I
don't<00:05:56.860> know<00:05:56.979> they<00:05:57.159> crunch<00:05:57.460> through<00:05:57.759> and<00:05:58.090> it's

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
don't know they crunch through and it's

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.730 
don't know they crunch through and it's
just<00:05:58.360> hard<00:05:58.569> to<00:05:58.659> get<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:59.020> alignment<00:05:59.259> like<00:05:59.620> you

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
just hard to get the alignment like you

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.519 
just hard to get the alignment like you
need<00:05:59.919> it<00:05:59.949> because<00:06:00.900> when<00:06:01.900> you're<00:06:01.990> doing<00:06:02.289> this

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 
need it because when you're doing this

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.869 
need it because when you're doing this
you<00:06:02.860> have<00:06:03.009> to<00:06:03.129> have<00:06:03.190> everything<00:06:03.669> aligned

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
you have to have everything aligned

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.119 
you have to have everything aligned
because<00:06:04.150> there's<00:06:04.330> zero<00:06:04.719> reverse<00:06:05.710> corner

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
because there's zero reverse corner

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.999 
because there's zero reverse corner
cutting<00:06:06.250> right<00:06:06.759> so<00:06:07.349> anyways<00:06:08.349> the<00:06:08.590> regular

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
cutting right so anyways the regular

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.320 
cutting right so anyways the regular
parity<00:06:09.250> algorithm<00:06:09.550> I<00:06:09.639> do<00:06:09.699> a<00:06:09.849> little<00:06:10.029> bit<00:06:10.150> weird

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
parity algorithm I do a little bit weird

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.119 
parity algorithm I do a little bit weird
most<00:06:10.599> people<00:06:10.930> will<00:06:11.080> do<00:06:11.259> double<00:06:11.469> flicks<00:06:11.860> like

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
most people will do double flicks like

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.629 
most people will do double flicks like
that<00:06:12.370> I'm<00:06:12.639> starting<00:06:13.539> to<00:06:13.719> get<00:06:13.840> used<00:06:14.050> to<00:06:14.229> them

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
that I'm starting to get used to them

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.070 
that I'm starting to get used to them
but<00:06:15.639> I<00:06:15.699> haven't<00:06:15.969> actually<00:06:16.300> practiced<00:06:16.840> them<00:06:16.930> so

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
but I haven't actually practiced them so

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.499 
but I haven't actually practiced them so
what<00:06:17.199> I<00:06:17.229> do<00:06:17.319> is<00:06:17.560> I<00:06:17.680> do<00:06:17.740> thumb<00:06:18.219> finger<00:06:18.759> like<00:06:19.330> that

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
what I do is I do thumb finger like that

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.459 
what I do is I do thumb finger like that
so<00:06:20.199> this<00:06:20.409> is<00:06:21.000> the<00:06:22.000> parity<00:06:22.389> algorithm<00:06:22.779> a<00:06:22.960> little

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
so this is the parity algorithm a little

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:28.309 
so this is the parity algorithm a little
bit<00:06:23.560> of<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.710> pop<00:06:23.949> here<00:06:26.340> so<00:06:27.340> let's<00:06:27.490> try<00:06:27.639> it<00:06:27.669> again

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
bit of a pop here so let's try it again

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:36.430 
bit of a pop here so let's try it again
what<00:06:29.340> I<00:06:30.360> screw<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.539> up

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.260 

so<00:06:37.440> I'm<00:06:37.710> too<00:06:37.920> scared<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.340> go<00:06:38.520> very<00:06:38.760> fast<00:06:39.000> with

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
so I'm too scared to go very fast with

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.820 
so I'm too scared to go very fast with
that<00:06:39.420> algorithm<00:06:39.600> because<00:06:40.050> on<00:06:40.200> that<00:06:40.470> algorithm

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
that algorithm because on that algorithm

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.480 
that algorithm because on that algorithm
is<00:06:41.220> where<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:41.520> pop<00:06:41.940> a<00:06:41.970> lot<00:06:42.300> so<00:06:42.630> anyways<00:06:43.440> guys<00:06:43.680> I'm

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
is where I pop a lot so anyways guys I'm

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.640 
is where I pop a lot so anyways guys I'm
going<00:06:44.640> to<00:06:44.700> show<00:06:44.790> you<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:45.000> pieces<00:06:45.150> now<00:06:45.570> so<00:06:46.560> you

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
going to show you the pieces now so you

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.380 
going to show you the pieces now so you
can<00:06:46.800> really<00:06:47.040> see<00:06:47.220> how<00:06:47.310> big<00:06:47.610> that<00:06:47.850> corner<00:06:48.240> is

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
can really see how big that corner is

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.990 
can really see how big that corner is
and<00:06:48.660> of<00:06:49.380> course<00:06:49.410> it<00:06:49.830> splits<00:06:50.160> apart<00:06:50.280> into<00:06:51.150> three

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
and of course it splits apart into three

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.960 
and of course it splits apart into three
pieces<00:06:54.680> maybe<00:06:55.680> this<00:06:55.890> one<00:06:56.070> stuck<00:06:56.460> together<00:06:56.640> too

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
pieces maybe this one stuck together too

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.850 
pieces maybe this one stuck together too
good<00:06:57.150> anyways<00:06:57.510> they<00:06:57.690> split<00:06:57.930> apart<00:06:58.170> we've<00:06:58.710> all

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
good anyways they split apart we've all

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.020 
good anyways they split apart we've all
seen<00:06:59.070> this<00:06:59.190> before<00:06:59.550> this<00:07:00.180> is<00:07:00.240> the<00:07:00.690> standard

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
seen this before this is the standard

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.580 
seen this before this is the standard
edge<00:07:03.030> piece<00:07:04.070> and<00:07:05.540> this<00:07:06.540> is<00:07:06.810> just<00:07:07.260> a<00:07:07.350> standard

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
edge piece and this is just a standard

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.410 
edge piece and this is just a standard
corner<00:07:08.250> piece<00:07:08.400> I<00:07:08.580> mean<00:07:08.700> we've<00:07:08.850> seen<00:07:08.880> this<00:07:09.240> in

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.420 
corner piece I mean we've seen this in

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.240 
corner piece I mean we've seen this in
all<00:07:09.540> puzzles<00:07:09.960> it's<00:07:10.140> just<00:07:10.290> shaped<00:07:10.710> a<00:07:10.920> little

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
all puzzles it's just shaped a little

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.880 
all puzzles it's just shaped a little
bit<00:07:11.400> differently<00:07:12.000> I<00:07:12.120> mean<00:07:12.390> we've<00:07:12.540> got<00:07:12.750> a<00:07:12.890> huge

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890 
bit differently I mean we've got a huge

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.980 
bit differently I mean we've got a huge
corner<00:07:14.160> stock<00:07:14.580> it's<00:07:14.910> not<00:07:15.240> very<00:07:15.420> rounded<00:07:15.870> in

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
corner stock it's not very rounded in

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.740 
corner stock it's not very rounded in
here<00:07:16.230> usually<00:07:17.010> on<00:07:17.130> these<00:07:17.280> pieces<00:07:17.630> we<00:07:18.630> don't

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
here usually on these pieces we don't

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.510 
here usually on these pieces we don't
see<00:07:19.020> like<00:07:19.170> this<00:07:19.320> V<00:07:19.710> happening<00:07:20.310> it's<00:07:20.430> usually

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
see like this V happening it's usually

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.670 
see like this V happening it's usually
just<00:07:20.670> a<00:07:20.910> straight<00:07:21.150> stock<00:07:21.540> so<00:07:22.320> pretty<00:07:22.530> much

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
just a straight stock so pretty much

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.010 
just a straight stock so pretty much
it's<00:07:22.890> the<00:07:22.980> same<00:07:23.310> mechanism<00:07:24.150> just<00:07:24.570> a<00:07:24.810> little

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
it's the same mechanism just a little

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.800 
it's the same mechanism just a little
bit<00:07:25.140> different<00:07:25.560> design<00:07:25.740> so<00:07:26.280> anyways<00:07:26.910> so

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
bit different design so anyways so

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.940 
bit different design so anyways so
overall<00:07:28.110> guys<00:07:28.440> I<00:07:28.650> recommend<00:07:29.310> this<00:07:29.460> puzzle<00:07:30.950> if

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
overall guys I recommend this puzzle if

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.390 
overall guys I recommend this puzzle if
you<00:07:32.700> don't<00:07:32.940> care<00:07:33.150> about<00:07:33.270> speed<00:07:34.070> or<00:07:35.070> if<00:07:35.280> you

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 
you don't care about speed or if you

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.940 
you don't care about speed or if you
have<00:07:35.610> one<00:07:35.850> that's<00:07:36.000> worse<00:07:36.810> than<00:07:37.140> this<00:07:37.290> and<00:07:37.500> you

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
have one that's worse than this and you

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.290 
have one that's worse than this and you
think<00:07:38.130> you<00:07:38.280> can<00:07:38.430> get<00:07:38.550> better<00:07:38.670> times<00:07:38.970> with<00:07:39.150> this

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 
think you can get better times with this

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.390 
think you can get better times with this
ensure<00:07:39.660> if<00:07:40.380> you're<00:07:40.530> just<00:07:40.650> a<00:07:40.770> regular<00:07:40.800> puzzle

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 
ensure if you're just a regular puzzle

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.800 
ensure if you're just a regular puzzle
solver<00:07:41.730> who<00:07:41.760> doesn't<00:07:42.120> care<00:07:42.270> about<00:07:42.450> speed<00:07:42.660> at

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:42.810 
solver who doesn't care about speed at

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.360 
solver who doesn't care about speed at
all<00:07:42.960> then<00:07:43.170> I<00:07:43.230> absolutely<00:07:43.650> recommend<00:07:44.160> this

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
all then I absolutely recommend this

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.070 
all then I absolutely recommend this
it's<00:07:44.580> a<00:07:44.670> very<00:07:44.970> very<00:07:45.240> good<00:07:45.420> puzzle<00:07:45.750> for<00:07:45.960> that

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 
it's a very very good puzzle for that

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.920 
it's a very very good puzzle for that
but<00:07:46.680> for<00:07:47.070> a<00:07:47.130> speed<00:07:47.520> cube<00:07:47.880> I<00:07:48.150> don't<00:07:48.720> really

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:48.930 
but for a speed cube I don't really

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.600 
but for a speed cube I don't really
recommend<00:07:49.230> it<00:07:49.530> at<00:07:49.650> all<00:07:49.800> but<00:07:50.310> I'm<00:07:50.430> going<00:07:50.550> to

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610 
recommend it at all but I'm going to

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.100 
recommend it at all but I'm going to
keep<00:07:50.760> it<00:07:50.880> because<00:07:50.970> it's<00:07:51.300> the<00:07:51.450> best<00:07:51.540> one<00:07:51.780> out<00:07:51.870> so

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110 
keep it because it's the best one out so

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.320 
keep it because it's the best one out so
far<00:07:52.350> but<00:07:52.860> I<00:07:52.890> have<00:07:53.070> heard<00:07:53.280> a<00:07:53.340> rumor<00:07:53.670> that<00:07:53.700> the<00:07:54.180> mo

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330 
far but I have heard a rumor that the mo
