that's<00:00:20.270> right<00:00:20.450> here<00:00:20.630> we<00:00:20.750> have<00:00:21.160> three<00:00:23.500> three

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
that's right here we have three three

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.590 
that's right here we have three three
units<00:00:24.860> perhaps<00:00:25.430> of<00:00:25.670> vehicles<00:00:26.140> full<00:00:27.140> tanks<00:00:27.530> and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
units perhaps of vehicles full tanks and

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600 
units perhaps of vehicles full tanks and
these<00:00:29.600> vehicles<00:00:30.290> need<00:00:31.010> to<00:00:31.100> make<00:00:31.250> their<00:00:31.430> way<00:00:31.550> to

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
these vehicles need to make their way to

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.670 
these vehicles need to make their way to
a<00:00:31.880> target<00:00:33.460> so<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.520> analyze<00:00:34.760> this<00:00:35.270> route<00:00:35.680> we're

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
a target so to analyze this route we're

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.240 
a target so to analyze this route we're
going<00:00:36.830> to<00:00:36.950> use<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.129> weighted<00:00:37.460> overlay<00:00:41.080> and

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
going to use a weighted overlay and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.240 
going to use a weighted overlay and
we're<00:00:43.250> going<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.430> select<00:00:43.699> some<00:00:44.480> criteria<00:00:45.250> it

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
we're going to select some criteria it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
we're going to select some criteria it
defines<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.960> most<00:00:47.960> efficient<00:00:48.379> path<00:00:49.270> for

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
defines the most efficient path for

defines the most efficient path for
example<00:00:50.690> these<00:00:51.020> vehicles<00:00:51.320> cannot<00:00:52.030> traverse

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
example these vehicles cannot traverse

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.729 
example these vehicles cannot traverse
35<00:00:54.309> or<00:00:55.309> more<00:00:55.489> degrees<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:58.250> we<00:00:58.460> can<00:00:58.580> rate<00:00:58.790> slow

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
35 or more degrees and we can rate slow

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.030 
35 or more degrees and we can rate slow
vegetation<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.460> Rudy<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:03.559> parameters

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
vegetation and Rudy and the parameters

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.200 
vegetation and Rudy and the parameters
with<00:01:04.220> them

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.940 

it's<00:01:08.210> using<00:01:08.540> information<00:01:09.670> we<00:01:10.670> can<00:01:11.650> create<00:01:12.650> a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
it's using information we can create a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.789 
it's using information we can create a
surface<00:01:15.490> these<00:01:16.490> nodes<00:01:16.820> 3<00:01:17.060> layers<00:01:17.710> find<00:01:18.710> that

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
surface these nodes 3 layers find that

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.430 
surface these nodes 3 layers find that
helplessly<00:01:19.250> each<00:01:19.970> pixel<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.570> on<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.840> map<00:01:23.440> and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
helplessly each pixel is on the map and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.910 
helplessly each pixel is on the map and
this<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:26.000> green<00:01:26.180> areas<00:01:26.800> have<00:01:27.800> the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
this is the green areas have the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.640 
this is the green areas have the
cheapest<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.490> traverse<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.570> document<00:01:30.530> and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
cheapest to traverse the document and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.880 
cheapest to traverse the document and
red<00:01:30.860> areas<00:01:31.070> more<00:01:31.700> expensive

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
red areas more expensive

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.250 
red areas more expensive
stephanie's<00:01:33.890> three<00:01:34.600> positions<00:01:35.600> what<00:01:36.050> is<00:01:36.170> the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
stephanie's three positions what is the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:48.960 
stephanie's three positions what is the
most<00:01:37.570> efficient<00:01:38.570> path<00:01:38.870> to<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.380> tagger

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.390 

so<00:01:49.510> that's<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.320> most<00:01:50.500> efficient<00:01:50.830> path<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.370> can

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
so that's the most efficient path we can

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.170 
so that's the most efficient path we can
move<00:01:51.610> these<00:01:51.790> around<00:01:53.400> these<00:01:54.400> features<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.030> J

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
move these around these features of J

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.320 
move these around these features of J
turn<00:01:55.420> off<00:01:55.600> this<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:57.000> again<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:58.180> can

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
turn off this and again we can

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.260 
turn off this and again we can
recalculate<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.520> most<00:02:00.520> efficient<00:02:00.940> path<00:02:02.250> mix

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
recalculate the most efficient path mix

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.620 
recalculate the most efficient path mix
is<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.480> we<00:02:04.570> can<00:02:04.830> generate<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:06.190> cargo<00:02:06.790> said

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
is that we can generate a cargo said

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.180 
is that we can generate a cargo said
this<00:02:07.870> is<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.050> most<00:02:08.260> efficient<00:02:08.530> path<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.920> orders

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
this is a most efficient path the orders

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.500 
this is a most efficient path the orders
the<00:02:09.369> also<00:02:10.000> minus<00:02:10.330> 3%<00:02:12.060> horrible<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.240> we<00:02:13.360> can

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the also minus 3% horrible that we can

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.730 
the also minus 3% horrible that we can
traverse

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.170
