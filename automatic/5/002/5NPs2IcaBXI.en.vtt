00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
and some friends were trying to build up

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.089 
and some friends were trying to build up
one<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.059> our<00:00:09.179> bases<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.750> new<00:00:10.050> server<00:00:10.530> I'm

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
one of our bases on a new server I'm

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.160 
one of our bases on a new server I'm
currently<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.670> only<00:00:11.759> one<00:00:12.000> online<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
currently the only one online and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.079 
currently the only one online and
unfortunately<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.980> can't<00:00:14.250> continue<00:00:14.820> building

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
unfortunately I can't continue building

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.420 
unfortunately I can't continue building
on<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.570> base<00:00:15.809> because<00:00:16.410> me<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.310> friend

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
on this base because me and a friend

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.920 
on this base because me and a friend
started<00:00:17.820> building<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.090> base<00:00:18.300> together<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
started building this base together and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.320 
started building this base together and
we<00:00:19.289> both<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.100> be<00:00:20.220> online<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.820> in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
we both if you have to be online and in

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.450 
we both if you have to be online and in
the<00:00:21.480> same<00:00:21.660> group<00:00:22.140> let's<00:00:23.100> been<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.430> of

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the same group let's been a lot of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.890 
the same group let's been a lot of
killing<00:00:23.850> while<00:00:24.090> we've<00:00:24.330> been<00:00:24.359> building<00:00:24.689> this

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
killing while we've been building this

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
killing while we've been building this
base<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.560> people<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:26.039> been<00:00:26.160> sniping<00:00:26.490> us

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
base and people have been sniping us

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.910 
base and people have been sniping us
through<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> walls<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.740> exploding<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.800> know

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
through the walls and exploding you know

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.849 
through the walls and exploding you know
glitches<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.390> stuff<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.869> we're

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
glitches and all that stuff so we're

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.840 
glitches and all that stuff so we're
probably<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> move<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.489> another<00:00:32.700> area

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
probably going to move to another area

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330 
probably going to move to another area
once<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.140> secured<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:35.040> bit<00:00:35.130> more

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
once we have secured a little bit more

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
once we have secured a little bit more
on<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.610> base<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:36.660> able<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> land<00:00:37.140> at

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
on this base so I was able to land at

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.690 
on this base so I was able to land at
least<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> those<00:00:37.980> shots<00:00:38.219> i'm<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.520> sure

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
least one of those shots i'm not sure

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
least one of those shots i'm not sure
which<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> when<00:00:40.500> things

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
gets interesting yes the door to that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:49.810 
gets interesting yes the door to that
check<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.079> open<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> guy<00:00:53.489> had<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> friend

he<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.940> course<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.270> game<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.900> incredibly

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
he of course the game is so incredibly

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.990 
he of course the game is so incredibly
laggy<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.040> there's<00:01:53.220> no<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.580> me<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> loot

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
laggy that there's no way for me to loot

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.210 
laggy that there's no way for me to loot
when<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> zombies<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.140> around<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:56.070> that

anyway I was able to get the liberal

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.530 
anyway I was able to get the liberal
stuff<00:02:04.920> from<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.159> base<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.420> all

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
stuff from this base that you have all

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
stuff from this base that you have all
that<00:02:06.630> much<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.380> least<00:02:07.500> some<00:02:07.740> crafting

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
material and actually I think a little

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
material and actually I think a little
bit<00:02:09.989> i'm<00:02:10.140> oh<00:02:10.350> so<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.489> did<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.030> went

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
bit i'm oh so what I did was that I went

bit i'm oh so what I did was that I went
back<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.360> our<00:02:12.480> unfinished<00:02:13.110> base<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.800> I

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
back to our unfinished base and I

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.729 
back to our unfinished base and I
dropped<00:02:14.760> some<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> loot<00:02:15.630> off<00:02:15.840> i<00:02:16.110> went<00:02:16.500> back
