00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello I'm doing a roll of san 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:12.350
 I already started doing the two 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.570
 bread bags here is the bag 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.810
 I made a bag and three quarters and about 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.550
 that little bit of two bags this bread 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.859
 only to the court on these shores 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.810
 everything coffee the banks and the ones and the 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.990
 four sides take away the irun coffee and 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.900
 the loaves all and mayonnaise them 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.970
 over the bread and I put them on top of this 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.310
 napkin that was wet one 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.940
 Napkin cleans the woman to squeeze 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.310
 well and on top then the bread all all 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.460
 pieces that the squares together 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.280
 I dropped mayonnaise and I put cheese 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 yellow white cheese over scattered 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.590
 I put them together so I do not have much 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.239
 Now I 'm going to put this ham on 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.940
 thick that you like this what 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.340
 buy thick and we'll put it like that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.660
 distributed not very close together 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.660
 and we are going to put like this 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.380
 that's also why that's not what 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.110
 you can buy with that so it is 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.530
 rather more good 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.780
 there's the ham we put it on maybe what 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.570
 let's put it like that because it's more is more 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.860
 boy space 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.860
 we are going to put it like this 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.770
 and we have here ready to make a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.530
 roll 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.710
 already saw that take the bread with mayonnaise 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.420
 over the yellow case the white cheese 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.329
 the ham and this we started to roll it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.909
 with the napkin the napkin is for 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.189
 that the roll can be done well and 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.189
 it's rolling like this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.660
 we are giving it back 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.550
 with the same napkin we are giving 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.550
 return 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.240
 we are taking it out 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.960
 we are taking out and as you can see it is going 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.970
 going through the ham 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.420
 about I put the edges because it 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.420
 travel 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.550
 until they are turning around and there 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.000
 ends like this the roll ends 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.490
 We do not return with tai napkin 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.740
 and we just turn it off a little bit for 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.010
 that is well pressed so that it does not 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.860
 do not undo the goal of cutting it and you 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.170
 entangle and the refrigerator gets a 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.780
 I'm waiting for it to cool 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.450
 but today we are going to leave 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.970
 and that sets you up two cans of vegetables 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.459
 here and after mayonnaise to accompany 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.650

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.810
 vegetable salad 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.680
 serve a slice and the rest we're going 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.390

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.390

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.200
