inch particle board 10 inch plate put

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.639 
inch particle board 10 inch plate put
some<00:00:36.390> velcro<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.780> back<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.200> stuck<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
some velcro on the back of it stuck it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.970 
some velcro on the back of it stuck it
to<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:39.210> strayed<00:00:39.930> eesof<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.500> carpet<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to that I strayed eesof some carpet to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
to that I strayed eesof some carpet to
the<00:00:41.070> top<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.719> figured<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.050> where<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the top of it and I figured out where it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
the top of it and I figured out where it
would<00:00:43.379> sit<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.829> spray<00:00:44.309> adhesive<00:00:44.730> carpet<00:00:45.210> on

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
would sit and spray adhesive carpet on

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
would sit and spray adhesive carpet on
the<00:00:45.390> inside<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.829> hole<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the inside here and a hole where it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.420 
the inside here and a hole where it
would<00:00:47.579> sit<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:48.809> now<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.280> hang<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
would sit and then now for hang on a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
would sit and then now for hang on a
second<00:00:52.160> alright<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.629> just<00:00:54.629> feed<00:00:54.930> this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
second alright so this just feed this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.130 
second alright so this just feed this
all<00:00:55.260> through<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:57.030> put<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
all through here I can put this right in

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
all through here I can put this right in
here<00:01:00.440> one-handed<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> guess<00:01:02.149> fits<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.270> there

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
here one-handed I guess fits in there

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.870 
here one-handed I guess fits in there
sits<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.650> now<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:07.850> see<00:01:08.850> how

sits right now like that and see how
hang<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.810> sec<00:01:09.960> time<00:01:10.110> swing<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:15.350> now

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
hang on one sec time swing it in now

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.510 
hang on one sec time swing it in now
when<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> put<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> balls<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
Polish and everything that is going to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.480 
Polish and everything that is going to
go<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:24.500> can<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.560> faster<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.340> RAM

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
go like I can go faster this is RAM

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.890 
go like I can go faster this is RAM
random<00:01:26.790> speed<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.299> his<00:01:27.390> lowest<00:01:27.630> setting

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
random speed that's his lowest setting

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510 
random speed that's his lowest setting
so<00:01:28.439> I'll<00:01:28.560> put<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> balls<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:29.310> put<00:01:29.490> some

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
somewhat dull these things are kind of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.960 
somewhat dull these things are kind of
known<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> being<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.409> shiny<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.920> stuck<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
in there and I realized was kind of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.149 
in there and I realized was kind of
flattened<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> did<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
flattened out a little bit so I did a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
flattened out a little bit so I did a
little<00:01:50.340> tester<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.509> should<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.780> ready<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
little tester and we should be ready to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.719 
little tester and we should be ready to
go<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.380> gonna<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:52.740> first<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.579> to

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.930 

it<00:05:27.470> hasn't<00:05:27.650> cut<00:05:27.950> itself<00:05:28.190> in<00:05:28.310> half<00:05:28.460> yet<00:05:28.730> so<00:05:28.910> I

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
it hasn't cut itself in half yet so I

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.230 
it hasn't cut itself in half yet so I
guess<00:05:29.120> we're<00:05:29.270> all<00:05:29.300> right<00:05:29.560> but<00:05:30.560> as<00:05:30.710> you<00:05:30.800> can<00:05:30.890> see

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
guess we're all right but as you can see

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.740 
guess we're all right but as you can see

there and do the same thing I'm pretty

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.670 
there and do the same thing I'm pretty
sure<00:05:55.280> we<00:05:55.610> probably<00:05:55.880> do<00:05:56.000> even<00:05:56.680> better

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
sure we probably do even better

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.460 
sure we probably do even better
polishing<00:05:58.160> them<00:05:58.250> up<00:05:58.310> like<00:05:58.460> gloss<00:05:58.730> so<00:05:59.180> I<00:05:59.510> might

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
polishing them up like gloss so I might

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.660 
polishing them up like gloss so I might
do<00:06:00.590> that<00:06:00.770> but<00:06:00.830> that'll<00:06:01.190> be<00:06:01.220> a<00:06:01.280> later<00:06:01.460> date

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
do that but that'll be a later date

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.960 
do that but that'll be a later date
that's<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.570> all<00:06:03.170> right<00:06:03.350> see<00:06:03.770> you<00:06:03.890> Andrew<00:06:04.760> looks
