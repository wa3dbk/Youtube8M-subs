00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello to you one of the undisputed stars 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.240
 This geneva salon lie 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.830
 obviously at chevrolet or the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.359
 American manufacturer present us his 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 all new stingray whose beauty 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.400
 say at the level of the style of this 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.380
 new corvette is she slice 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.180
 completely with the older generation 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 the c6 either at the level of the face 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.660
 front with this multi faceted hood that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.910
 we see a little better besides 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.620
 on the case on the cabriolet version and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.300
 the fires that reminds for some 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.160
 bad languages some american 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 even some Italian in the back 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.550
 it's like this chevrolet has completely 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 broken codes since generation 6 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 with lights that reminds anyway 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 that the camaro with whom it is a species 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.110
 plastic inserts and not necessarily 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.219
 of the best taste but we will have to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.500
 still admit that it's still a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.520
 style a particular charisma but the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.110
 true novelty that it will be in Geneva 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.090
 it's obviously the cabriolet version of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.010
 this corvette there as we can see 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.280
 on sail cut short at the level of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.480
 roof 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.180
 it gives a style that is still 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 Enough whole we'll say it please or that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.510
 not like it but I actually find that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.820
 reminds a little bit of the style of 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.780
 the camaro especially at the back with the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.850
 extremely wide wings 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.350
 the fires that are obviously still 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.060
 extremely square but so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 general we have a little bit of trouble 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.630
 find a unit in the drawing and for 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.189
 stroke and even if it is a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 exclusivity and that chevrel makes us the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.689
 gift to present it in premiere 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.729
 World 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.869
 I still prefer to cut you off 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.280
 still continue with a note that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.659
 is still a lot more positive this is to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 the interior on chevrolet anyway 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.829
 a lot of effort at the level of 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.450
 materials we find spoon of 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.579
 carbon there is an atmosphere really 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.840
 sports that emerges for the coup 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.670
 is really very far from what we can 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 to find in a camaro we only have one 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 want it's dice and ea on the road then 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 motorization level we have for 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.659
 the moment raised video of 450 horses 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 which is available on both versions 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.500
 and we do not know yet if the versions 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 the most athletic will be available 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 in the cabriolet version often the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 put a lot on this new 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.549
 corvette generation one of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.780
 essential components will obviously be 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.579
 are taken over announces 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.810
 today that the buyer of a 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.520
 corvette c6 will be able to afford 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.469
 to buy a c7 so it gives us a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.850
 high limit and therefore a price ratio 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.450
 performance that promises to be even 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.770
 unbeatable 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.000
 personally 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.739
 I still have a tiny 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.030
 preference for the coupe version that I 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.180
 really find a lot more 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.250
 harmonious and obviously to finish there 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.540
 disappointed will show the key 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.489
 success of this corvette will be his 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.989
 behavior on the road and on the track 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.360
 and for that there is a solution that's the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.319
 compare with the Germanic competition 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.890
 besides, maybe I 'll go 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.890
 search for keys
