 primate 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.419

 africa connections between but rather 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.989
 percent and in her opinion 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.839
 would not put up a tent anymore 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.019
 after fastened faster in 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:47.510
 foil 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.780
 because we have found the number 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.440
 Of course this and remembered about avoided us 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.940

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.560
 then this year after cooking once it was conducted 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.940
 lovely it is 2 on top 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 foil usually heat resistant fg 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.240
 and now 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.820
 represent our 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 i.e. plasterboard 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.040
 sheets of the year in the top three we will deploy 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.210

 on cup or degree 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.440
 put 10 then as usual plaster 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.100
 ceiling 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.360
 and we will promote this place as 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880
 extra charge

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.140
 metal profile 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.690
