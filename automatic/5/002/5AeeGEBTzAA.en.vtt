00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.040
 and that this kid is I am werner and 

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.669
 we are in a new video that the truth 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.110
 it's quite strange on my channel and 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.450
 we are effectively in a tutorial 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.749
 It's worth a tutorial which we are in the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.640
 version 1.8 shelf that has just come out and 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.070
 well the tutorial is based as you can 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 see in the title on a farm of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.480
 guardian is valid for those who do not know they are 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.910
 the guardians is the new bug 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.150
 that has come out at sea we can see it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.490
 below here we can observe your 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.060
 egg and then if we click here 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.550
 Well here we have the animal said 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.570
 this I will explain a little bit like that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.790
 over is fast on which this is based 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.100
 farm in this case quite improvised 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.860
 for my part game to start we can 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.260
 see what there is with a third one worth this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.970
 simulates the sea that I want to say then that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.220
 this farm has to be done in the sea 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.469
 they can not do it like this 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.690
 which because according to informed not 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.579
 appear here then the question is 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.610
 that has to be next to one of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.930
 the temples which have been created new 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 1.8 or just in the sea I see it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 a little less likely but obviously 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.770
 they will always appear in good 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 basically here they have to appear 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.800
 guardians worth which will go down 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.500
 here and having slim blocks over here 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.420
 they're going to start jumping up what 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.910
 will happen then that when they jump towards 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.890
 above this altitude will reach us to 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.600
 take the water to the water will happen to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.810
 another two is line the parents are going to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.479
 keep going up to the top 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 from the farm which water obviously 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.340
 and for the third time they are going to throw 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.259
 now they are going to fall towards the part of 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.660
 down because so much fall because it's 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.430
 quite likely that they will not die like this 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.619
 that you have to take into account in the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.780
 fall altitude you already know that I am not 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.460
 professional or anything of this but to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.160
 you here are what you do and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 the face in survival so have it 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.149
 account because sometimes they are not going to 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.220
 die good said this too and when 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.229
 drop here what will happen because here 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.570
 I have put these two bases on which 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.519
 they are going to keep on plan I know that there 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.819
 a little thing is going to go around until 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.219
 arrive 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.340
 to be here what's going to happen with this one 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:21.060
 here, it's just going to take her 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.069
 dispenser here I have put as you can 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.639
 see a pretty easy circuit I do not know 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.040
 network 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:28.769
 so if you see that something can be done 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.900
 better to improve in plan so that only 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.969
 do when you detect or things like that already 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.650
 you can do it yourselves but 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.750
 well I have put this basically 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.790
 because it is one of 2ms leave from the few 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.310
 what months so discuss please 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 said this when we put something 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.810
 here he is going to launch it as you can 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.019
 see and here that we have here we have 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 an air rise mechanism 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.769
 You can find this, I will not do a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.959
 tutorial this is the tutorial of the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.150
 farm that I will teach quickly and 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.069
 what will we do with this, simply, and 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.560
 there are them around here which is going to 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.750
 help with friction and let's go up 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.540
 the item that we want upwards is worth 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.939
 this is good to upload a tutorial 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.829
 about this quite effective and in fact I 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.780
 what about looking at him so nothing here 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.599
 you have the lift of the elevator there is 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.209
 rather said with the circuit what is going to 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.489
 go through with this simply when 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.099
 go up to the top they will come to 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.620
 this law of this hopper to this chest here 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.659
 it's crystal obviously when they go to 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.319
 go up the little things and the food 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.340
 so you can not save 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.500
 the four chests serve for this 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.330
 well said this does not have much 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.870
 explanation as you can see is what I have 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.190
 summed up in a couple of minutes which 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.810
 it usually works pretty well 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.420
 farm but as I'm telling you, you have to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.400
 monitor with attitude and part of 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.650
 down so they die so good 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.530
 now we are going to go with the important thing 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.549
 which is to see if it works here we can 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.230
 watch the jumping guardians 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.629
 As you can see they are going up little by little 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.760
 and once they get to this attitude and 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.640
 they start to jump from the second slide 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.220
 to this this one has arrived this be fast and 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.989
 has reached the third and good here 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.819
 is coming more here do not fall 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.459
 man what will happen then that the water 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.560
 the hesitate would fall and they will die 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.209
 what are these crystals as well 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.609
 I had basically put it to this 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.380
 altitude the crystals but when they are 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.510
 going down here they were going to me 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.330
 sides and that was a bit annoying so 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.370
 simply shake it down so it does not 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.199
 can go from the sides and fall 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.600
 right to the bottom part and it 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.240
 die 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.150
 and active is a survival you can 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.040
 do and can operate 24 hours that yes 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.020
 I do not know if they have to be activated 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.150
 or not all this topic do not ask me 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.640
 because I of technical survival or thing 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.230
 but good basically you know 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.510
 how is it already explained that this is 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.910
 do in a temple and put two blocks 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.460
 of lines will go jumping here two more and 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.890
 here you make a descent that goes down which 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.230
 will go with the circuit to go around 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.240
 and there's an itunes elevator that's going to 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.580
 bring here here if I 'm not wrong has 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.680
 that there are already prism fragments 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.390
 flour and crystals of priest marina 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.100
 which are 'the guardian' 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.260
 as you can see this farm in a 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.500
 Survival can be quite effective 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.960
 saying this I just wanted to tell you that I 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.820
 as you know and I've been saying all the 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.370
 video I'm pretty lame with this like this 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.560
 that if it is not explained many things what 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.600
 I feel but well basically you can see 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.340
 how is it basically is very easy to 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.950
 do and successfully to me has not taken me 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.600
 a long time so nothing if you have 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.790
 some doubt when the elevator or 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.200
 Any little thing is as easy as 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.150
 look it up on youtube and in five minutes 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.310
 you have done it 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.650
 put a combination of blocks 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.380
 fences and since you climb the hopper up and 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.000
 the chest and well now yes said this 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.760
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.160
 I do not usually do things like that on my channel anymore 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.980
 you know, but I really wanted to go up 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.080
 a farm and macy's of 1.8 because a 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.480
 me although it does not seem it I love of 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.160
 done I have a survival that I'm doing 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.940
 when I have time but here it has arrived 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.430
 another goodbye and well I like that 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.950
 surely to do that if I have to 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.140
 find the sea with temple and little things 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.780
 so I'm pretty manic because 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.430
 I'm going to take but good, here we have the 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.610
 different guardians that will go by 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.130
 around here they will go down and this one does not want 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.140
 jump you're going to jump you're going to jump there 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.570
 is jumping there is jumping and good 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.160
 You said this I hope you liked it 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.650
 As I told you, if it's cool, I hope that 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.480
 leave your like and any little thing 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.670
 Any comment any doubt that 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.470
 I can help you solve no doubt 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.470
 in putting a destruction come
