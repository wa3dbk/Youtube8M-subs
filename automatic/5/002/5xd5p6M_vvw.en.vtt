00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.340
 Hello everyone, I will spend with you 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.880
 tour of the real sunny 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.880
 electric france 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:24.730
 the station is located on the north side 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.680
 Sevastopol near my university 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.440
 so when first appearing 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.130
 opportunities 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.040
 I tried to go here the main 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.660
 part of the system that generates 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.380
 electricity is standard 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.480
 quasar polycrystalline modules 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.879
 meter by meter seventy 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 declared maximum power of each 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:01:01.110
 such a module 260 watts all photo elements 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.720
 located stationary 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.510
 with optimal distance and average 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.150
 daily direction to the sun in 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:16.120
 all year from the back 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.750
 they commute among themselves and come down 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.420
 to network inverters 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.430
 whose main task is translation 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.420
 DC to AC and reset 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.600
 generated electricity 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.950
 centralized network for each investor 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.590
 strictly defined connection 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.049
 number of modules 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:46.789
 totally not exceeding its maximum 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.960
 power for example the power of one such 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.600
 100 kilowatt inverter 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.850
 in front of it is located very 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.110
 useful 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.300
 information window covering his hand 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.399
 you can switch different modes 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:12.110
 display information for example what 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.690
 power output at the moment or 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.140
 how many kilowatt hour do 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 transformed by inverter hovered money for 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.180
 all the time the station was working 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.280
 total working hours of tension and much 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.280
 other 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.410
 but the most interesting is the schedule 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.740
 dependencies 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.760
 Energy received from the time of day on 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.650
 horizontals 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:48.470
 late time 6 am to six pm 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.360
 vertical kilowatt hours can be seen as sharply 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.030
 rising power with the rising of the sun 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.390
 maximum output per 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.210
 middle of the day 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.470
 and recession again 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.140
 in the evening at the moment the power station 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.420
 give out about two and a half 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.050
 megawatt 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.920
 on planned to increase the power behind 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.120
 installation of additional modules and 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.710
 reflector 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.710
 Well, let's see
