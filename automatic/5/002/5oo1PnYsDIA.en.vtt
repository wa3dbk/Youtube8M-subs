00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.060

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.369

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.880
 with rackets in hand what you do you say 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.969
 of no then three sets 5 September no I would say 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.190
 a game button consisting of six games 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.230
 even six games will never end 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.850
 ok va well no matter the challenge starts 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 going badly cut somewhere but 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.980
 we have to play tennis yoga 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.520
 you really introduced us to the class 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.039
 average debts even you don't have it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.879
 beautifully hurt by the two things 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.760
 we say yes they are complementary but to have 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.870
 point won very well we start big 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 style indeed among other things now there is a 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.770
 tennis ball in the world where the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.560
 kicked out that he didn't have it before is okay 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.369
 it's a gt5 mystery who can 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.630
 solve it will win a racket from 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.250
 tennis seemed to be around you 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.840
 position I would take another point 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 retires giuseppe gamer again but 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.130
 this is a golden point 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.729
 ok it won't be very quiet from very soon 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.470
 very well shut up i don't know that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.470
 too strong attention 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.979
 little does she counter point lost us 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.710
 guys that ok it's not not easy 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.359
 let's make a joke as you can see 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.640
 damn I can't understand when it goes 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:56.469
 in the center 6,000 useless ball is useless 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.950
 this plays under the net but if one 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:03.880
 worst bastard, but with exactly that 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.099
 verse 30 0 my mom no guys here 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.750
 let us immediately recover peace of mind mamma mia 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:13.180
 joseph guys from gamers then one 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.090
 joke as it should I want you here 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.849
 I want to take the ball auction that projects 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.519
 no other point won forgive me 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.019
 guys but fuck you to stage is the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.160
 function but fuck off is given further 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.989
 let's take all the balls quietly 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.390
 obviously in a good way, don't think 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.069
 then great giuseppe goes to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.410
 advantage therefore it was necessary to do the two 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.190
 points very well take this mom 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.470
 I think, among other things, one of the young people 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.250
 I always liked tennis though 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.950
 when I win I lose bam a bit 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.590
 under the net but we know if we can 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.910
 giuseppe break point maicon break point 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.650
 available voltage that does not respond 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.650
 I was expecting you guys but do not worry 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.389
 we are in clear advantage for you that 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.769
 fasti games try to take from 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:07.510
 this foolish point won attention 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.419
 giuseppe is true, what is this ready? 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.639
 what he did 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.959
 the boys had to do it shortly 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.609
 quiet it was a test 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.230
 I wanted to see if you were careful and 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.090
 just what I did guys 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.489
 point of the game don't let us do it 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.620
 run away from the game including them 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.760
 it is very hard fought 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.980
 this last point but we'll make it 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.980
 quiet attention giuseppe verdi 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.930
 search searches for space but does not find it 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.900
 attention that amanda is looking for a thread 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.370
 clear attention to point precisely 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.349
 towards ok, girls I'm doing it 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.160
 win I wo n't get too long 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.169
 under the net 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.870
 and in fact he couldn't take this 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.930
 ball game point ok was not before the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.380
 towards the holes tel this game then 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.470

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.240
 we start from the attention that the socket but 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.920
 I too get filthy that you are nothing else 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.890
 he made me a high ball when not 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.730
 I could take it quiet peaceful 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.330
 attention is this the point 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.370
 of the concentration boys game 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.430

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.970
