nothing for us loss against Brentford

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.710 
nothing for us loss against Brentford
they're<00:03:05.730> struggling<00:03:06.120> at<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.330> moment<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.690> that

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
they're struggling at the moment is that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.930 
they're struggling at the moment is that
good<00:03:07.080> or<00:03:07.170> bad<00:03:07.230> thing<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.620> norwich<00:03:07.860> all<00:03:08.790> right

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
good or bad thing for norwich all right

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.509 
good or bad thing for norwich all right
well<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.660> depends<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.349> day<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.250> again<00:03:11.489> I

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
well it depends on the day and again I

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.400 
well it depends on the day and again I
think<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:12.180> about<00:03:12.299> us<00:03:12.599> really<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.260> about

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
think it's about us really it is about

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.930 
think it's about us really it is about
us<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.950> would<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> good<00:03:14.340> thing<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.580> us<00:03:14.730> if

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
us it would be a good thing for us if

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.860 
us it would be a good thing for us if
we're<00:03:15.060> at<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.330> because<00:03:15.540> there's<00:03:15.810> an

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
we're at it because there's an

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.199 
we're at it because there's an
opportunity<00:03:16.049> there<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.799> go<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.880> put<00:03:18.030> more

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
opportunity there to go and put more

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.729 
opportunity there to go and put more
pressure<00:03:18.359> on<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.660> side<00:03:18.930> that's<00:03:19.200> that's<00:03:19.560> lost

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
pressure on a side that's that's lost

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.340 
pressure on a side that's that's lost
like<00:03:19.980> ourselves<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.519> midweek<00:03:20.820> if<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:21.989> if<00:03:22.320> we

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
it was when we have done all season then

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.750 
it was when we have done all season then
you<00:03:31.680> know<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.799> might<00:03:32.100> give<00:03:32.280> them<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.579> lift

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
you know that might give them the lift

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.250 
you know that might give them the lift
that<00:03:32.910> they<00:03:33.090> need<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.329> it's<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.170> an

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
that they need so it's it's an

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.720 
that they need so it's it's an
opportunity<00:03:34.410> they've<00:03:34.950> lost<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.280> game<00:03:35.459> you

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
opportunity they've lost the game you

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.460 
opportunity they've lost the game you
know<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.239> course<00:03:36.450> you'd<00:03:36.720> rather<00:03:36.900> go<00:03:37.109> be<00:03:37.290> going

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
know of course you'd rather go be going

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.780 
know of course you'd rather go be going
to<00:03:37.530> blame<00:03:37.769> them<00:03:37.950> when<00:03:38.100> they've<00:03:38.310> they're

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
to blame them when they've they're

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.009 
to blame them when they've they're
struggling<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.209> bit<00:03:39.239> themselves<00:03:39.780> rather<00:03:39.930> than

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
struggling a bit themselves rather than

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.550 
struggling a bit themselves rather than
flying<00:03:40.940> but<00:03:41.940> as<00:03:42.120> I've<00:03:42.780> always<00:03:42.930> said<00:03:43.019> it's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
flying but as I've always said it's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.050 
flying but as I've always said it's
about<00:03:43.769> how<00:03:43.889> we<00:03:43.950> perform<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.609> on<00:03:44.730> more<00:03:44.940> than

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
about how we perform that on more than

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.180 
about how we perform that on more than
likely<00:03:45.269> decent<00:03:45.750> determine<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.230> results<00:03:46.590> what

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
likely decent determine the results what

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.229 
likely decent determine the results what
a<00:03:47.220> quick<00:03:47.400> right<00:03:47.549> I'm<00:03:47.639> not<00:03:47.730> looking<00:03:47.940> for<00:03:48.090> us<00:03:48.180> I

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
a quick right I'm not looking for us I

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.970 
a quick right I'm not looking for us I
mean<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.480> surprise<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.200> better<00:03:49.319> they<00:03:49.590> drop<00:03:49.829> or

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
mean a surprise it better they drop or

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.379 
mean a surprise it better they drop or
is<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.430> pitfalls<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.209> league

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
is it just the pitfalls of this league

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.170 
is it just the pitfalls of this league
it<00:03:52.380> I'm<00:03:52.500> surprised<00:03:52.859> yeah<00:03:53.069> because<00:03:53.250> they<00:03:53.489> look

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
it I'm surprised yeah because they look

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.910 
it I'm surprised yeah because they look
strong<00:03:54.480> they're<00:03:55.200> at<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.410> top<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.769> table

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
strong they're at the top of the table

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.190 
strong they're at the top of the table
for<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.609> bit<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:56.970> obviously<00:03:57.299> they're<00:03:57.989> finding

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
for a bit and obviously they're finding

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.979 
for a bit and obviously they're finding
results<00:03:58.440> difficult<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.040> come<00:03:59.190> by<00:03:59.900> it's<00:04:00.900> an

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
results difficult to come by it's an

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.300 
results difficult to come by it's an
opportunity<00:04:01.170> for<00:04:01.530> us<00:04:01.680> now<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.160> know

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
opportunity for us now you know

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.289 
opportunity for us now you know
obviously<00:04:02.459> they'll<00:04:02.850> be<00:04:02.940> doing<00:04:03.120> everything

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
obviously they'll be doing everything

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.120 
obviously they'll be doing everything
they<00:04:03.569> can<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.780> get<00:04:04.019> back<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:04.440> track<00:04:04.560> similar<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
they can to get back on track similar to

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.729 
they can to get back on track similar to
ourselves<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:06.350> you<00:04:07.350> know<00:04:07.470> we<00:04:07.590> need<00:04:07.620> a

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
obviously that's that that's the main

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.300 
obviously that's that that's the main
thing<00:04:12.389> for<00:04:12.810> us<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:13.049> saturday<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.980> often<00:04:14.190> talk

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
thing for us on saturday we often talk

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.229 
thing for us on saturday we often talk
about<00:04:14.340> going<00:04:14.700> into<00:04:14.880> an<00:04:15.060> international

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
about going into an international

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.520

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
breaker on the back of the victory i

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.960 
breaker on the back of the victory i
guess<00:04:16.709> that's<00:04:16.859> even<00:04:17.250> more<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.519> prevalent<00:04:17.729> this

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
guess that's even more so prevalent this

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.629 
guess that's even more so prevalent this
weekend<00:04:18.239> isn't<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.479> of<00:04:18.780> course<00:04:19.049> yeah<00:04:19.639> ideally

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
weekend isn't it of course yeah ideally

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.899 
weekend isn't it of course yeah ideally
going<00:04:20.820> into<00:04:21.299> on<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.479> high<00:04:21.690> for<00:04:22.260> sure<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.789> it<00:04:23.789> is

going into on a high for sure and it is

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.790 
going into on a high for sure and it is
it<00:04:24.060> would<00:04:24.210> be<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.330> long<00:04:24.539> long<00:04:24.780> two<00:04:25.050> weeks<00:04:25.080> if<00:04:25.470> if

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
it would be a long long two weeks if if

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.230 
it would be a long long two weeks if if
we<00:04:26.010> don't<00:04:26.190> perform<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:26.729> we're<00:04:26.849> not<00:04:26.970> looking
