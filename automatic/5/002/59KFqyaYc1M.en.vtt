conserve<00:00:48.679> energy<00:00:48.859> I<00:00:49.370> don't<00:00:49.609> have<00:00:49.789> to<00:00:49.879> have<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
conserve energy I don't have to have the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.729 
conserve energy I don't have to have the
computer<00:00:50.300> running<00:00:50.539> on<00:00:50.749> all<00:00:50.899> night<00:00:51.109> doing<00:00:51.530> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
little example here five minutes this is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.929 
little example here five minutes this is
the<00:01:47.990> turn<00:01:48.320> time<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.799> like<00:01:48.950> 12:30<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:49.820> I'll

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
the turn time is like 12:30 so I'll

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.380 
the turn time is like 12:30 so I'll
start<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.299> task<00:01:50.539> now<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.200> then<00:01:52.060> yeah<00:01:53.060> see
