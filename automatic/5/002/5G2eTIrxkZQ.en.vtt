00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
turned solid you're ready to remove it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 
turned solid you're ready to remove it
from<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> mold<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.420> first<00:01:30.720> remove<00:01:31.020> an

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
from the mold when we first remove an

easy<00:01:31.500> flow<00:01:31.829> 60<00:01:32.280> casting<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> mold<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
easy flow 60 casting from the mold it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.569 
easy flow 60 casting from the mold it
will<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.780> fairly<00:01:34.320> hot<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.950> touch<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
will be fairly hot to the touch so you

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.149 
will be fairly hot to the touch so you
want<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> allow<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.390> cool<00:01:37.049> down<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:38.130> room

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
want to allow that to cool down to room

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.210 
want to allow that to cool down to room
temperature<00:01:38.369> before<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:40.079> proceed<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.890> your

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
finish now we're going to use the smart

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
stain black over the surface and it's a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.340 
stain black over the surface and it's a
good<00:01:47.909> idea<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.240> test<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.869> spray<00:01:49.140> pattern

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
good idea to test the spray pattern

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
good idea to test the spray pattern
before<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.220> apply<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.970> piece<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
before you apply it to your piece I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
before you apply it to your piece I
usually<00:01:52.140> spray<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> off<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> side<00:01:53.310> first

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
usually spray it off to the side first

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.240 
usually spray it off to the side first
and<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.060> spray<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:55.049> piece<00:01:55.290> now<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and then spray my piece now I'm going to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.870 
and then spray my piece now I'm going to
apply<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.840> fairly<00:01:57.840> heavily<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:59.549> wipe

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
apply this fairly heavily and then wipe

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
apply this fairly heavily and then wipe
some<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:00.810> while<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.320> still<00:02:01.590> wet

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
some of it back while it's still wet

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.609 
some of it back while it's still wet
just<00:02:02.310> using<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> clean<00:02:03.210> paper<00:02:03.509> towel<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.409> want

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
just using a clean paper towel we want

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.399 
just using a clean paper towel we want
to<00:02:04.680> wipe<00:02:04.890> off<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> excess<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.750> keep<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.200> mind

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to wipe off the excess but keep in mind

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.490 
to wipe off the excess but keep in mind
that<00:02:07.560> smart<00:02:07.950> stain<00:02:08.280> dries<00:02:08.849> very<00:02:08.879> fast<00:02:09.660> so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
that smart stain dries very fast so

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350 
that smart stain dries very fast so
within<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.920> few<00:02:11.190> minutes<00:02:11.550> that's<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> dry

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
within a few minutes that's going to dry

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.350 
within a few minutes that's going to dry
too

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
too

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.020 
too
a tough<00:02:14.170> stain<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.740> will<00:02:15.160> be<00:02:15.280> bonded<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.850> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
surface now to finish off our piece

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.940 
surface now to finish off our piece
