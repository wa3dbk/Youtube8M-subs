00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
now such got there in slow motion

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.900 
now such got there in slow motion
actually<00:00:17.390> saw<00:00:18.009> notice<00:00:19.009> the<00:00:19.130> green<00:00:19.279> is<00:00:19.520> way<00:00:19.730> up

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
actually saw notice the green is way up

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.420 
actually saw notice the green is way up
on<00:00:20.029> top<00:00:20.110> now<00:00:21.110> is<00:00:21.259> when<00:00:21.439> there<00:00:21.680> goes<00:00:21.860> kristen<00:00:22.399> to

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
on top now is when there goes kristen to

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.109 
on top now is when there goes kristen to
one<00:00:23.649> quick<00:00:24.649> shot<00:00:27.340> there's<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.520> light<00:00:28.759> way<00:00:29.000> up

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
that means way up on top big light over

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
that means way up on top big light over
the<00:00:45.500> cylinder<00:00:47.140> now<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.200> infrared<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.190> there

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
the cylinder now the infrared and there

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.010 
the cylinder now the infrared and there
goes<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.730> Pistons<00:00:50.240> slammed<00:00:51.140> back<00:00:52.690> with<00:00:53.690> Greek

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
goes the Pistons slammed back with Greek

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.270 
goes the Pistons slammed back with Greek
40<00:00:56.050> we<00:00:57.050> don't<00:00:57.200> want<00:00:57.470> tremendous<00:00:58.010> force

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
40 we don't want tremendous force

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:26.010 
40 we don't want tremendous force
because<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:58.700> will<00:00:59.950> great<00:01:00.950> yes<00:01:01.700> that's<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.329> okay

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
okay now we're going to see that shot in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.560 
okay now we're going to see that shot in
slow<00:01:29.330> motion<00:01:29.540> there's<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:30.640> reaction<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.820> lot<00:01:31.910> of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
slow motion there's of reaction a lot of

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.690 
slow motion there's of reaction a lot of
line<00:01:32.750> there<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.170> green<00:01:33.410> way<00:01:33.680> over<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.250> right

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
line there is a green way over the right

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.410 
line there is a green way over the right
side<00:01:34.730> and<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:36.560> reaction<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.490> another

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
side and the reaction and another

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.490 
side and the reaction and another
reaction<00:01:39.580> with<00:01:40.580> big<00:01:41.210> reaction<00:01:41.870> there<00:01:42.110> there

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
reaction with big reaction there there

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.860 
reaction with big reaction there there
goes<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.710> piston

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:58.970 

okay<00:01:50.440> that<00:01:50.710> was<00:01:50.800> a<00:01:50.830> good<00:01:51.010> one<00:01:51.190> yeah<00:01:52.180> that's<00:01:52.420> you

Pistons going down there's a piston
going<00:02:26.989> down<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.489> bounces<00:02:28.489> right<00:02:28.760> back<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.420> mean

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
going down and bounces right back I mean

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.949 
going down and bounces right back I mean
that<00:02:30.410> was<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.550> strong<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.120> just<00:02:32.330> bounced<00:02:32.569> right

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
that was so strong it just bounced right

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:53.970 
that was so strong it just bounced right
back<00:02:34.030> great

quarter six in the city of angels we're

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.390 
quarter six in the city of angels we're
going<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.750> do<00:03:35.900> another<00:03:36.650> one<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.310> our<00:03:37.400> tests<00:03:37.910> and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
going to do another one of our tests and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.770 
going to do another one of our tests and
we're<00:03:40.400> going<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.580> do<00:03:40.700> actually<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.239> test<00:03:41.510> one

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
we're going to do actually to test one

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.960 
we're going to do actually to test one
of<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.260> B<00:03:42.620> engine<00:03:42.980> which<00:03:43.160> will<00:03:43.190> test<00:03:43.640> for<00:03:43.850> the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
of the B engine which will test for the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.960 
of the B engine which will test for the
gases<00:03:44.420> only<00:03:44.780> which<00:03:45.019> is<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:46.069> engine<00:03:46.400> back<00:03:46.550> here

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
gases only which is the engine back here

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.890 
gases only which is the engine back here
and<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:48.670> then<00:03:49.670> we'll<00:03:49.819> take<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.090> gases<00:03:50.600> out<00:03:50.720> of

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
and and then we'll take the gases out of

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.110 
and and then we'll take the gases out of
there<00:03:51.170> since<00:03:52.130> we've<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.459> only<00:03:52.640> system<00:03:52.970> we

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
there since we've the only system we

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.650 
there since we've the only system we
have<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.480> syringe<00:03:54.910> we<00:03:55.910> haven't<00:03:56.480> yet

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
have is a syringe we haven't yet

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.110 
have is a syringe we haven't yet
perfected<00:03:57.079> our<00:03:57.470> little<00:03:58.280> manifold<00:03:58.760> system

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
perfected our little manifold system

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.160 
perfected our little manifold system
which<00:03:59.510> we<00:04:00.410> will<00:04:00.620> get<00:04:00.829> it<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:02.510> we'll<00:04:02.660> take<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
which we will get it so we'll take the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.470 
which we will get it so we'll take the
gases<00:04:03.590> out<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.700> B<00:04:04.850> engine<00:04:05.120> we're<00:04:05.299> going<00:04:05.420> to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
gases out of the B engine we're going to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.449 
gases out of the B engine we're going to
look<00:04:05.660> put<00:04:05.930> them<00:04:06.049> into<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.410> a<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.890> B<00:04:06.920> engine

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
look put them into the a the B engine

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.210 
look put them into the a the B engine
and<00:04:07.610> then<00:04:07.730> we're<00:04:07.880> going<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.530> try<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.590> fire<00:04:10.040> it

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
and then we're going to try to fire it

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.440 
and then we're going to try to fire it
that<00:04:10.370> doesn't<00:04:10.549> mean<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:10.790> going<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.000> fire<00:04:11.209> this

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
that doesn't mean is going to fire this

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.810 
that doesn't mean is going to fire this
is<00:04:11.600> our<00:04:11.720> first<00:04:12.049> attempt<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.769> just<00:04:13.489> like<00:04:13.670> the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
is our first attempt and just like the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.880 
is our first attempt and just like the
other<00:04:13.970> engine<00:04:14.420> we<00:04:14.570> had<00:04:14.810> at<00:04:15.440> least<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.739> hundred

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
other engine we had at least a hundred

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.330 
other engine we had at least a hundred
attempts<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.260> they<00:04:18.260> all<00:04:18.380> failed<00:04:18.680> until<00:04:19.220> we

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
attempts and they all failed until we

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.920 
attempts and they all failed until we
finally<00:04:19.700> hit<00:04:19.789> pay<00:04:19.850> dirt<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.510> she<00:04:21.500> works<00:04:22.930> but

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
finally hit pay dirt and she works but

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.200 
finally hit pay dirt and she works but
if<00:04:24.050> she<00:04:24.200> does<00:04:24.410> then<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.100> engine<00:04:25.520> is<00:04:25.669> exactly

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
if she does then this engine is exactly

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.060 
if she does then this engine is exactly
like<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.630> two-cylinder<00:04:27.229> engine<00:04:27.470> except<00:04:27.890> that's

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
like a two-cylinder engine except that's

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.760 
like a two-cylinder engine except that's
just<00:04:28.250> one<00:04:28.520> cylinder<00:04:29.060> all<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.960> components<00:04:30.260> in

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
just one cylinder all the components in

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.670 
just one cylinder all the components in
this<00:04:31.580> engine<00:04:32.030> are<00:04:32.300> identical<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.440> a

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
this engine are identical to a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.870 
this engine are identical to a
two-cylinder<00:04:34.280> engine<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.890> this<00:04:36.890> one<00:04:37.070> works<00:04:37.280> so

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
two-cylinder engine so this one works so

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.150 
two-cylinder engine so this one works so
will<00:04:38.060> a<00:04:38.090> two-cylinder<00:04:38.660> engine<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.890> we're

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
will a two-cylinder engine so we're

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:59.400 
will a two-cylinder engine so we're
ready<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.780> do<00:04:41.780> our<00:04:41.810> test<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.640> away<00:04:43.640> we<00:04:43.789> go

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.219 

that<00:05:00.410> was<00:05:00.560> huge<00:05:01.389> that<00:05:02.389> balance<00:05:02.810> all<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> way

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
that was huge that balance all the way

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:30.100 
that was huge that balance all the way
back<00:05:10.539> okay<00:05:11.539> okay<00:05:12.820> yeah<00:05:26.530> he<00:05:27.530> did<00:05:28.750> are<00:05:29.750> we<00:05:29.900> ready

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
back okay okay yeah he did are we ready

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.700 
back okay okay yeah he did are we ready
yeah<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:31.130> lecture<00:05:32.740> okay<00:05:33.740> we<00:05:34.479> we<00:05:35.479> fired<00:05:35.810> for<00:05:36.229> we

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
yeah the lecture okay we we fired for we

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.999 
yeah the lecture okay we we fired for we
fire<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.520> fourth<00:05:38.020> generation<00:05:39.020> gases<00:05:39.830> and

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
fire the fourth generation gases and

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.100 
fire the fourth generation gases and
first<00:05:40.370> they<00:05:40.520> all<00:05:40.610> work<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.030> what<00:05:41.960> we're<00:05:42.080> going

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
first they all work and what we're going

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.260 
first they all work and what we're going
to<00:05:42.289> do<00:05:42.470> next<00:05:42.710> is<00:05:42.979> we're<00:05:43.370> going<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.669> we<00:05:43.970> pulled

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
to do next is we're going to we pulled

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.870 
to do next is we're going to we pulled
some<00:05:44.720> more<00:05:44.900> cc's<00:05:45.470> out<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:46.070> then<00:05:47.110> we<00:05:48.110> lost<00:05:48.320> more

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
some more cc's out and then we lost more

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.670 
some more cc's out and then we lost more
so<00:05:49.880> evidently<00:05:50.449> there<00:05:50.930> shouldn't<00:05:51.440> be<00:05:51.470> any

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
so evidently there shouldn't be any

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.320 
so evidently there shouldn't be any
hanging<00:05:52.009> that<00:05:52.280> never<00:05:52.490> was<00:05:52.669> anything<00:05:53.030> in<00:05:53.180> there

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
hanging that never was anything in there

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.040 
hanging that never was anything in there
with<00:05:53.449> her<00:05:54.970> and<00:05:55.970> we<00:05:56.090> got<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.270> leak<00:05:56.479> at<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:56.660> bottom

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
with her and we got a leak at the bottom

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.020 
with her and we got a leak at the bottom
we<00:05:57.139> got<00:05:57.289> a<00:05:57.320> leak<00:05:57.560> we<00:05:58.460> got<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.639> leak<00:05:58.849> at<00:05:58.970> the

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
we got a leak we got a leak at the

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.430 
we got a leak we got a leak at the
bottom<00:05:59.449> we<00:05:59.570> got<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.720> leak<00:05:59.930> at<00:06:00.050> the<00:06:00.080> top

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
bottom we got a leak at the top

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.899 
bottom we got a leak at the top
everything<00:06:01.039> is<00:06:01.190> coming<00:06:01.460> out<00:06:01.610> we're<00:06:01.729> going<00:06:01.820> to
