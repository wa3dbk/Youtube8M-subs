00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.230
 how about youtube I come to teach you 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.430
 the new town cowboy the town 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.610
 old when building 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:18.600
 the buildings are based on buildings 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.880
 from the old west in the usa 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.010
 and soon I will be based on some 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.130
 from Mexico especially in special 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.150
 some haciendas that there are in san luís 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.920
 potosí 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.169
 very well 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.100
 This is the first thing I want to teach you 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.780
 is what 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.180
 this is to do all this is going to be 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.899
 part of the town the soldiers the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.899
 figures 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.980
 starting with the small canyon 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.070
 that I bought good this came in a set of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 lego that just left the llanero 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.719
 lonely 'but only came the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.800
 truck the cannon said with three mini 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.260
 figures that soldier and the two that are 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.689
 there 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.380
 this cart I just did it was not 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.380
 nothing difficult 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.530
 or anything but soon I'm thinking 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.659
 in making a bigger cart nothing more 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.200
 get pieces 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.210
 the horses are 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.210
 of the new ones that have just come out 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.840
 to my point of view they are pretty good 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.430
 since the comparison of the ancient 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.610
 you can not 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:46.220
 move or anything and here I am to cel after 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.040
 of stopping two-legged this officer good 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.170
 of the army I bought it in a 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.690
 well I got it in a train of lego 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.020
 I also bought from long granger 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.660
 lego and these are the other soldiers that 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.430
 they came in the package that I told them 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.640
 previously 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.990
 very well now I'm going to start 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.180
 teach my people good this is llanero 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.590
 lonely 'that comes if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.590
 in all the sets of that saga 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.050
 let's start with the middle building 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.420
 because this one 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.900
 to my point of view it's pretty good 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.340
 only I need to put other 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.410
 two windows up here 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.260
 and still does 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 how am I going to do with the roof but now 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.159
 think of something after 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.720
 the bottom part is thought to make a 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.410
 small store 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.120
 and this family that is going to be here is going to 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.750
 carry when you will be in charge of the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.750
 store and here in this part are going to live 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.700
 they will be comfortable 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.640
 about two bedrooms I believe and nothing more 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.370
 here the store is quite wide 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.379
 I think and in addition to very detailed 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.690
 good very detailed for the part of 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.110
 outside I feel that if I stay enough 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.920
 well in addition to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.950
 the steps I put him and the small ones 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.830
 bases to excel because I do not know if 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.280
 have seen but the old buildings 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.280
 made of wood regularly had 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.720
 as a platform for not 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.680
 were built as a result of the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.189
 land 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.189
 Y 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.489
 the part below is also good 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.019
 made to support the weight that goes to 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.720
 have up and will not sink or 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.170
 nothing with a support here other support 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.330
 here and a last one supports here 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.540
 this one here in the middle is more than anything 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.890
 to join the pieces and just in case 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.890
 that is also a support 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:16.040
 the next building is this 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.040
 where are these two going to live 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.130
 small little figures 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.490
 I feel like I'm getting enough 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.110
 well with this with these details that you 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.460
 I went to here to do nothing skiing or if so 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.660
 you can tell him 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.350
 this building with a window and you 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.810
 I plan to put two more like this 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:47.070
 but as they are not yet finished 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.070
 that's why they look like this 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.070
 this building 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.580
 they are more 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.210
 wide than the longest balloon very little 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.210
 than the previous 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.790
 if you can see here you have two more 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.580
 supports more than the hand one more support 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.930
 that the previous one here is one here 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.639
 another this and this that are the main 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.639
 in addition to the middle one that is to join 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.139
 the bases that I still do not get one for 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.789
 put it here also wooden stairs 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.639
 and here is going to be the bedroom down here 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.990
 I do not know it's going to do I think putting a 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.990
 barbershop or something similar 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.430
 and good 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.910
 this is my last hand my other figure 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.650
 that also came in him 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:48.240
 then train that I bought and here goes to 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.180
 be the telegraph office I think to 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.840
 just like this this here to put the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.199
 the ceiling 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.889
 up or not tilted only 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.440
 for this part and for here to have 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.510
 a second floor so you can live 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:10.129
 someone but being this building here 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.189
 they are going to take advantage of these stairs 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:15.090
 well, this is all I wanted them 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:18.150
 teach my 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.639
 cowboy town when building 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.500
 although it is not finished yet and 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.330
 that someone asked me in a video 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.900
 previous where are you with the pieces 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.940
 well 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.160
 this is from here the majority are from a 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.390
 mega blog bucket that you buy in 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.440
 long time 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.440
 these are from 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.699
 of legos that I have been disarming in their 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.310
 most of the strong the strength of the 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.750
 gurus and good the strength of the abyss of 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.820
 helm that came out a year ago 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.920
 also disarmament and wants the 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.200
 pieces counting this platform our 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:00.440
 windows are based 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.410
 a layman who had super old Harry 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.390
 potter obviously is already being very 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.100
 they lost the pieces but they did not lose 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:12.540
 but they stirred 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:14.900
 and so these are from a house left gray 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.900
 I think 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:22.930
 soon I will try to get 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.600
 another lego from the long ranger where he goes to 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.060
 be him 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.820
 the bank and the sheriff's office for 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.760
 keep taking pieces and go expanding my 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.240
 good town this is all thanks for 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.370
 watch the video I hope you liked my 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:42.310
 town that arrived until now 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:45.780
 and the style of constructions 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.780
 Greetings and see you next time
