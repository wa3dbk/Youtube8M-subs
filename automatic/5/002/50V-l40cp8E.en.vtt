project you can drive right to the site

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.430 
project you can drive right to the site
I've<00:02:16.890> worked<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.310> many<00:02:17.430> fly-in<00:02:18.120> fly-out

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
I've worked in many fly-in fly-out

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.420 
I've worked in many fly-in fly-out
operations<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.680> remote<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.280> difficult

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
operations that are remote and difficult

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.210 
operations that are remote and difficult
to<00:02:20.880> access<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.530> stood<00:02:22.800> out<00:02:22.860> for

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
to access so that really stood out for

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.360 
to access so that really stood out for
me<00:02:23.280> great<00:02:24.240> topography<00:02:24.990> amenable<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.770> an<00:02:26.040> open

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
me great topography amenable to an open

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.850 
me great topography amenable to an open
pitch<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.000> when<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.720> looked<00:02:27.930> at<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.470> took<00:02:28.680> me

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
pitch and when I looked at it it took me

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.650 
pitch and when I looked at it it took me
a<00:02:28.890> very<00:02:29.130> very<00:02:29.610> little<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.910> period<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.270> time<00:02:30.420> to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
a very very little a period of time to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.880 
a very very little a period of time to
know<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.080> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> be<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> mine<00:02:31.620> one<00:02:31.860> day

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
know this is going to be a mine one day

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.340 
know this is going to be a mine one day
and<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.420> these<00:02:33.570> are<00:02:33.750> some<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.020> things<00:02:34.230> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
and so these are some of the things that

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.900 
and so these are some of the things that
really<00:02:34.650> made<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> project<00:02:35.400> stand<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.730> from

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
really made the project stand out from

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.640 
really made the project stand out from
the<00:02:35.940> other<00:02:36.360> hundred<00:02:36.840> or<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.530> were

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the other hundred or so that you were

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.220 
the other hundred or so that you were
looking<00:02:37.800> at<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.489> stood<00:02:38.730> out<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:38.880> all<00:02:39.750> facets<00:02:39.989> of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
looking at it stood out in all facets of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.130 
looking at it stood out in all facets of
it<00:02:40.530> absolutely<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.120> released<00:02:42.930> an

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
it absolutely you just released an

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.260 
it absolutely you just released an
updated<00:02:43.620> resource<00:02:44.250> estimate<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.940> how<00:02:45.090> did<00:02:45.150> it

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
updated resource estimate so how did it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.240 
updated resource estimate so how did it
look<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:46.140> looked<00:02:46.350> great<00:02:46.560> actually<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:47.190> were

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
look it looked great actually we were

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.070 
look it looked great actually we were
very<00:02:47.370> pleased<00:02:47.730> with<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> results<00:02:48.450> it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
very pleased with the results it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.750 
very pleased with the results it
actually<00:02:49.290> wasn't<00:02:49.739> our<00:02:50.010> first<00:02:50.220> resource

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
actually wasn't our first resource

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.580 
actually wasn't our first resource
estimate<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.450> think<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:51.720> important<00:02:52.200> for

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
estimate I think it's important for

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.740 
estimate I think it's important for
shareholders<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.640> know<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.030> investors<00:02:54.450> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
shareholders to know and investors that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.900 
shareholders to know and investors that
North<00:02:55.530> er<00:02:55.709> actually<00:02:55.860> put<00:02:56.340> out<00:02:56.370> its<00:02:56.610> first

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
North er actually put out its first

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.410 
North er actually put out its first
resource<00:02:57.330> estimate<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:57.930> 2013<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.390> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
resource estimate in 2013 so this is a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.300 
resource estimate in 2013 so this is a
subsequent<00:03:00.870> resource<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.620> we<00:03:01.739> put<00:03:01.920> out<00:03:01.950> last

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
subsequent resource that we put out last

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.850 
subsequent resource that we put out last
week<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:03.660> were<00:03:03.810> very<00:03:03.989> very<00:03:04.170> happy<00:03:04.709> with

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
week and we were very very happy with

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.560 
week and we were very very happy with
the<00:03:04.950> results<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:05.580> saw<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.940> fourteen<00:03:06.390> percent

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
the results we saw a fourteen percent

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.840 
the results we saw a fourteen percent
increase<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.380> grade<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.400> seventeen

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
increase in the grade and a seventeen

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.539 
increase in the grade and a seventeen
percent<00:03:09.030> increase<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.600> total<00:03:09.930> ounces<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.400> in

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
percent increase in total ounces so in

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.400 
percent increase in total ounces so in
total<00:03:11.790> we<00:03:12.000> have<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.360> over<00:03:12.480> 63<00:03:13.200> million

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
total we have just over 63 million

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.860 
total we have just over 63 million

lot<00:03:31.769> more<00:03:31.980> because<00:03:32.220> there's<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.700> lot<00:03:32.940> of

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
lot more because there's a lot of

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.360 
lot more because there's a lot of
expansion<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.140> resource<00:03:34.440> potential<00:03:34.829> at<00:03:35.220> La

expansion and resource potential at La

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.550 
expansion and resource potential at La
sagara<00:03:35.810> now<00:03:36.810> what's<00:03:37.019> some<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.290> growth

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
sagara now what's some of the growth

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.210 
sagara now what's some of the growth
potential<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.489> see<00:03:38.790> at<00:03:39.239> at<00:03:39.690> La<00:03:39.900> sagara

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
potential that you see at at La sagara

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.009 
potential that you see at at La sagara
well<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:41.670> last<00:03:41.970> drilling<00:03:42.269> program<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
well in this last drilling program that

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.530 
well in this last drilling program that
we<00:03:43.140> completed<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.920> november<00:03:44.549> of<00:03:44.579> last<00:03:44.700> year<00:03:45.329> we

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
we completed in november of last year we

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.449 
we completed in november of last year we
uncovered<00:03:46.019> some<00:03:46.200> areas<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.769> we<00:03:46.860> prevent<00:03:47.340> lee

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
uncovered some areas that we prevent lee

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.340 
uncovered some areas that we prevent lee
previously<00:03:48.030> hadn't<00:03:48.360> really<00:03:48.540> focused<00:03:48.900> on<00:03:49.049> in

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
previously hadn't really focused on in

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.200 
previously hadn't really focused on in
this<00:03:49.470> drilling<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.549> one<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.090> interesting

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
this drilling so one of the interesting

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.630 
this drilling so one of the interesting
that<00:03:52.360> we<00:03:52.450> drilled<00:03:52.720> was<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.110> deeper<00:03:53.800> hole<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.250> we

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
that we drilled was a deeper hole and we

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.040 
that we drilled was a deeper hole and we
noticed<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.210> there<00:03:55.360> was<00:03:55.450> mineralization

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
noticed that there was mineralization

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.740 
noticed that there was mineralization
that<00:03:56.440> continued<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.160> death<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:58.240> that<00:03:58.270> God<00:03:58.630> is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
that continued to death so that God is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.570 
that continued to death so that God is
excited<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.320> little<00:03:59.500> bit<00:03:59.800> about<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.220> potential

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
excited a little bit about the potential

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.600 
excited a little bit about the potential
for<00:04:01.000> for<00:04:01.300> underground<00:04:01.690> drilling<00:04:02.160> as<00:04:03.160> well<00:04:03.460> as

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
for for underground drilling as well as

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.700 
for for underground drilling as well as
there's<00:04:03.850> an<00:04:04.000> area<00:04:04.240> to<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.480> north<00:04:04.750> west<00:04:05.260> called

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
there's an area to the north west called

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.460 
there's an area to the north west called
liberace<00:04:06.240> which<00:04:07.240> north<00:04:07.570> air<00:04:07.810> previously

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
liberace which north air previously

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.830 
liberace which north air previously
drilled<00:04:08.710> in<00:04:08.950> 2011<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:10.060> see<00:04:10.240> against<00:04:10.660> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
drilled in 2011 you see against the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.720 
drilled in 2011 you see against the
potential<00:04:11.200> in<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.470> area<00:04:11.830> as<00:04:12.130> well<00:04:12.160> as<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.520> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
potential in that area as well as to the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.160 
potential in that area as well as to the
east<00:04:12.880> so<00:04:13.060> really<00:04:13.330> open<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.840> all<00:04:13.960> directions

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
east so really open in all directions

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.130 
east so really open in all directions
including<00:04:14.770> to<00:04:15.220> depth<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.700> think<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.720> resource

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
including to depth I think the resource

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.530 
including to depth I think the resource
used<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.620> silver<00:04:17.920> price<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.370> 22<00:04:19.030> dollars<00:04:19.360> an

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
used is silver price of 22 dollars an

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.900 
used is silver price of 22 dollars an
ounce<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.020> when<00:04:20.590> do<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.800> see<00:04:21.040> silver<00:04:21.520> going

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
ounce so when do you see silver going

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.790 
ounce so when do you see silver going
back<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.300> those<00:04:22.450> levels<00:04:22.690> well<00:04:23.470> I'm<00:04:23.650> pretty

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
back to those levels well I'm pretty

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.980 
back to those levels well I'm pretty
optimistic<00:04:23.920> I<00:04:24.700> mean<00:04:24.850> when<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.150> join<00:04:25.540> or<00:04:25.750> ther

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
optimistic I mean when I join or ther

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.690 
optimistic I mean when I join or ther
silver<00:04:26.350> was<00:04:26.500> almost<00:04:26.770> twenty<00:04:27.070> dollars<00:04:27.430> and

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
silver was almost twenty dollars and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.070 
silver was almost twenty dollars and
that<00:04:27.790> was<00:04:27.970> just<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.300> little<00:04:28.510> over<00:04:28.660> five<00:04:28.870> months

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
that was just a little over five months

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.830 
that was just a little over five months
ago<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.640> silver<00:04:31.030> trending<00:04:31.360> back<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:31.720> that

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
ago I see silver trending back in that

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.810 
ago I see silver trending back in that
direction<00:04:32.230> in<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.070> not-too-distant<00:04:33.400> future

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
direction in the not-too-distant future

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.330 
direction in the not-too-distant future
we<00:04:34.630> closed<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.260> just<00:04:35.590> under<00:04:35.830> eighteen<00:04:36.160> dollars

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
we closed it just under eighteen dollars

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.270 
we closed it just under eighteen dollars
at<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.880> end<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.060> last<00:04:37.120> week<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.840> say<00:04:38.740> it's<00:04:39.040> not<00:04:39.220> a

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
at the end of last week I say it's not a

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.640 
at the end of last week I say it's not a
stretch<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.640> see<00:04:40.030> silver<00:04:40.420> get<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.960> 20<00:04:41.230> 22

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
stretch to see silver get that 20 22

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.110 
stretch to see silver get that 20 22
dollar<00:04:41.860> range<00:04:42.100> by<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.400> end<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.700> year<00:04:42.730> you

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
dollar range by the end of the year you

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.660 
dollar range by the end of the year you
meet<00:04:43.900> another<00:04:44.200> acquisition<00:04:44.560> which<00:04:45.250> was<00:04:45.490> the

meet another acquisition which was the
los<00:04:45.910> quatros<00:04:46.570> gold<00:04:46.870> project<00:04:47.440> yeah<00:04:47.740> how<00:04:48.070> does

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
los quatros gold project yeah how does

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.420 
los quatros gold project yeah how does
that<00:04:48.370> fit<00:04:48.700> in<00:04:48.880> with<00:04:49.210> less<00:04:49.840> agarra<00:04:50.430> lost

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
that fit in with less agarra lost

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.090 
that fit in with less agarra lost
qualities<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> continuous<00:04:53.100> mineral

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100

concession to Las agarra so it again
it's<00:04:56.650> just<00:04:56.830> adding<00:04:57.040> our<00:04:57.280> property<00:04:57.760> wide

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
it's just adding our property wide

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.360 
it's just adding our property wide
position<00:04:58.510> it's<00:04:59.080> an<00:04:59.260> interesting<00:04:59.590> target<00:05:00.220> it's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
position it's an interesting target it's

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.280 
position it's an interesting target it's
actually<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.670> gold<00:05:00.880> primarily<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.600> gold<00:05:01.840> target

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
actually a gold primarily a gold target

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.870 
actually a gold primarily a gold target
even<00:05:02.530> though<00:05:02.650> we're<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:02.980> silver<00:05:03.460> focused

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
even though we're a silver focused

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.090 
even though we're a silver focused
company<00:05:04.090> but<00:05:05.080> it's<00:05:05.230> had<00:05:05.440> some<00:05:05.680> very<00:05:05.830> very

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
company but it's had some very very

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.770 
company but it's had some very very
interesting<00:05:06.220> drilling<00:05:07.180> done<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.630> was

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
interesting drilling done it was

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.180 
interesting drilling done it was
previously<00:05:08.050> owned<00:05:08.500> by<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.710> company<00:05:08.950> called

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
previously owned by a company called

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.000 
previously owned by a company called
Serengeti<00:05:09.940> resources<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.780> we<00:05:11.470> acquired<00:05:11.830> that

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
Serengeti resources and we acquired that

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.310 
Serengeti resources and we acquired that
just<00:05:12.280> before<00:05:12.400> just<00:05:13.150> before<00:05:13.240> Christmas<00:05:13.810> last

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
just before just before Christmas last

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.190 
just before just before Christmas last
year<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:15.330> it's<00:05:16.330> a<00:05:16.420> long<00:05:16.630> target<00:05:17.020> two

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.950 
year and it's a long target two
kilometres<00:05:17.710> long<00:05:17.740> by<00:05:18.160> 500<00:05:18.790> metres<00:05:19.060> wide<00:05:19.330> so<00:05:19.780> it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
kilometres long by 500 metres wide so it

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.710 
kilometres long by 500 metres wide so it
really<00:05:20.350> just<00:05:20.680> it's<00:05:21.490> again<00:05:21.730> about<00:05:21.940> focus<00:05:22.390> at<00:05:22.570> La

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
really just it's again about focus at La

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.530 
really just it's again about focus at La
sagara<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.410> using<00:05:24.220> our<00:05:24.310> people<00:05:24.880> resources<00:05:25.210> on

geographically<00:05:29.790> what<00:05:30.790> kind<00:05:31.030> of<00:05:31.120> drilling<00:05:31.480> do

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
geographically what kind of drilling do

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.560 
geographically what kind of drilling do
you<00:05:31.690> have<00:05:31.870> planned<00:05:32.170> in<00:05:32.320> 2015<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:34.090> we<00:05:34.270> want<00:05:34.450> to

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
you have planned in 2015 so we want to

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.420 
you have planned in 2015 so we want to
continue<00:05:34.840> drilling<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:35.530> it<00:05:35.680> around<00:05:35.830> La<00:05:36.070> sagara

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
continue drilling in it around La sagara

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.850 
continue drilling in it around La sagara
we<00:05:37.240> anticipate<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:38.320> we'll<00:05:38.530> be<00:05:38.650> drilling

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
we anticipate that we'll be drilling

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.950 
we anticipate that we'll be drilling
probably<00:05:39.220> by<00:05:39.610> next<00:05:39.670> summer<00:05:40.270> again<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:40.840> we're

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
probably by next summer again and we're

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.770 
probably by next summer again and we're
well<00:05:41.140> funded<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.680> do<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.980> I'll<00:05:42.370> speak

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
well funded to do that I'll speak

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.320 
well funded to do that I'll speak
that<00:05:42.930> as<00:05:43.080> well<00:05:43.290> but<00:05:44.280> we<00:05:44.430> would<00:05:44.639> see<00:05:44.850> adding

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
that as well but we would see adding

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.540 
that as well but we would see adding
some<00:05:45.540> more<00:05:45.720> drill<00:05:46.290> holes<00:05:46.530> into<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.980> LA<00:05:47.190> cigar

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
some more drill holes into the LA cigar

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.340 
some more drill holes into the LA cigar
resource<00:05:48.030> area<00:05:48.450> itself<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.110> as<00:05:49.200> I<00:05:49.230> mentioned

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
resource area itself and as I mentioned

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.530 
resource area itself and as I mentioned
to<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:49.950> north<00:05:50.160> and<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:50.880> south<00:05:51.000> so<00:05:51.389> we're

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
to the north and to the south so we're

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.260 
to the north and to the south so we're
pretty<00:05:51.660> excited<00:05:51.780> about<00:05:52.169> that<00:05:53.000> what<00:05:54.000> else<00:05:54.030> are

metallurgical studies baseline we
actually<00:06:00.060> have<00:06:00.810> done<00:06:00.990> two<00:06:01.200> phases<00:06:01.440> of<00:06:01.620> met

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
actually have done two phases of met

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.129 
actually have done two phases of met
testing<00:06:02.310> and<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:03.000> project<00:06:03.360> has<00:06:03.540> had<00:06:03.750> great
