 shop in Milan as always ikea 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.679
 a peculiarity of ke ha is that which 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 you have to assemble always know them 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.639
 which perhaps no one has understood that this 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.420

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.330
 photo sun pizzica with Swedish meatballs 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.650
 in the end in my opinion this is how it is assembled 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.550
 the food from which the queue then remains 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.290
 sdram pizza with a refrigerator taste 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 but the Swedish meatballs are always worth 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.989
 unfortunately here and without jam e 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.989
 careful 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.130
 as he would say 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.460
 the more pizza you go down on this 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.050

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.050
 in italy and frozen sweden 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.540
 the urgency a little to the whole cover 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 that taste of agno 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.820
 that fits perfectly with the flavor 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.440
 pizzetta will rise lady who then has the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.060
 next time you get an idea 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.720
 in the end it touches everyone sooner or later 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.720

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.860
 which also has the cycle does has mounted and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.110
 without assembled constructions does not follow 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.119
 the other without limits unless you do 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.770
 if there is a drop of jam 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:42.060
 they found it was even better 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.950
 on the medium of flavor stop on Italian 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.000
