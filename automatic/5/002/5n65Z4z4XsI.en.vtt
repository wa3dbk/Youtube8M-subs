00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.710
 probably twenty years ago

 when got today remembered yes what 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.979
 The reason I did not wear skirts for very long 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.350
 the reason of the friends who judged me 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.030
 Israel is not wearing it is somehow not fashionable 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.860
 somehow ugly rays don't wear it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 the fact that it will be replaced better 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 don't do that, don't do it and i like that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.140
 know then many many years ago on 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.450
 it was weathering me 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.010
 some sort of yes I tried to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.260
 jeans because jeans are like kap 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.930
 the country is so accepted and then I have a little bit 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.480
 matured and realized that I was the most 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.610
 more that they advise something 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.890
 not very far gone in terms of fashion in 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.610
 style plan is not so stuck in some and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.860
 the same jeans and I decided what to do if 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.080
 impossible to get rid of their opinions nose 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.640
 geht es wird who should just keep away 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.560
 such friends and need to find friends 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.350
 who will support you in those 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 things you are interested in but do not interfere 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.780
 you develop and how to support 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.870
 do n't you encourage you and 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.340
 inspire development and if there are no such 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.200
 then just limit the communication to communicate 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.510
 you friends do not consult 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 regarding those things of opinion on which 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.370
 until you do not like it which you 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.989
 brakes and they all have but him 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.299
 state something just to relate to it 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.519
 how, but one grandma said a few who 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.549
 said if you read that this person 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.810
 not very competent in this area why 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.610
 listen stay 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.470
 don't find my people now 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.280
 the world is open about the same 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.530
 blogging 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.680
 instagram render on anything find 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.450
 a girlfriend who will be you 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.880
 inspire you and support you such 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.680
 things like putting on something that doesn't even 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.970
 very taken strange in israel 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.130
 very countries belong to people who 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.810
 wear long flat hats speak immediately 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.410
 we also come in as we walked black 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.750
 head covered sector 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.430
 long I often asked me this 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.980
 question do you not feel the stars to me 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.989
 anyway if i walk down the street someone 6 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.700
 religious are you dragging are you an atheist or 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.230
 someone decides 4 something different to me all 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.989
 Equally I enjoy it 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.050
 today so tomorrow i'm different and 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.320
 I found this inspiration in 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.750
 different fashionable such even not that 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.870
 bloggers yes just fashionable pages 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.790
 magazines that you know publish 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.830
 photos from fashion week which model 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.989
 wore what how who came who came by 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.610
 It was exactly what I found there 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.860
 draw such inspiration and not 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.010
 listen to some one other girlfriend 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.600
 which is up to one grandma said and here she is 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.250
 in her village there is no decided that she 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.410
 I must advise that I can not 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.930
 wear skirts because on the side 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.940
 someone may not like this 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.300
 my skirt hung in the closet very much 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.020
 many years later I just brushed it all off 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.940
 revised completely your wardrobe 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.150
 decided that from now on I would 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.770
 apply only what I want only 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.750
 what i think is cool 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.690
 right what I like is what 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.330
 for my soul soul for my personality 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.450
 comfortable they will satisfy 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.220
 needs of a society of girlfriends or someone 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.919
 other I am nothing that society is strong 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.620
 suffer if I am here like that dressed me 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.240
 it seems the opposite as i said in 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.760
 one of the videos that society has always 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.440
 will come in as you condemn and what's wrong with you 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.900
 say and think even if you come 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.640
 just from the most ordinary jeans and 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.020
 sweater too someone is something bad 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.950
 think so at all, and not to please 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.650
 find yourself where are you 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.539
 inspire and help you reveal here 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.220
 these are your desires to convey something 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.500
 unusual to do something unusual 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.710
 although what are we talking about already unusual 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.850
 just plain ordinary trite 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.850
 yyrki dresses and 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.650
 who if we girls will wear 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.960
 the dress will wait until the Scots 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.820
 man will come in skirts so i'm for 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.150
 to wear skirt dresses be a little bit 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.590
 more feminine you know adore
