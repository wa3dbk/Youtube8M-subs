00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.010
 love spectators practical tools and 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.869
 helper for audio and video applications 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.810
 is there again today in us 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.830
 league boss problem solver and as always with 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 I am very happy about that 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.490
 Managing director of degas burden 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.860
 thank you hello and welcome 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.900
 to the audience at home or today 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.110
 I look forward to your products again 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.449
 which is the first one we introduce today 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.129
 It's best to show them all at once 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.489
 the new league where video converter series 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.590
 in front 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.800
 and we start with a scart 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 hdmi converter but first of all too 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.350
 the general characteristics of these 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.920
 Articles 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.040
 The new series can basically do that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.820
 scale analog video and audio signals 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.300
 to 27 or 10 80 p resolution and this 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.149
 then to a hdmi terminal beamer monitor 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.690
 spend tvs 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.310
 In addition, they still have the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.310
 possibility and that is something completely 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.759
 special that they are the analog 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.940
 video signals what is indeed present in 2d in 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.100
 Transform a 3d signal and do that 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.259
 the converter all alone and that you 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.479
 need any tools for that 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.590
 Thus, they can also use their old dvds 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.550
 or even vhs bands in 3d on their 3d 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.039
 View enabled television or beamer 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.860
 We have one here for the first device 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.959
 scart to hdmi converter so to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.729
 example for all older skat 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.869
 baby you still have at home 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.700
 and do not want to know 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.970
 vhs player or older dvd player et 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.539
 cetera the scart connection supported 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.670
 not just the composite or it 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.819
 video signal but he even supports 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.890
 the rgb video signal was quality 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:07.130
 he clearly above the first one 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.350
 is and that is actually a very 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.530
 good thing 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.610
 not only that they all theirs 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.500
 Game consoles via a scart adapter 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.950
 it can be connected, for example 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.840
 even game consoles just the same 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:25.390
 rgb scart output have as for example 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.270
 that sega saturn and the like that was it 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 to the first product and to that we look 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.040
 summarizing a movie again 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.040
 on 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.770
 we want an analog signal on one 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.170
 flat screen with a digital hdmi 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.050
 bring in entrance 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.420
 the source is a vhs videorecorder 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.270
 from here the signal goes to the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.700
 scart input of the converter of this can 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.420
 one with built-scaling technology 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.780
 720p or 1080p full screen on the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.390
 bring flat screen TV 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.210
 besides, he can turn a 2d signal into a 3d 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.810
 signal so networked tv 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.810
 supports 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.349
 but there are others besides scart 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.440
 analog video signals and others 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.569
 converter from league where exactly here 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.400
 we now have the whole overview 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.980
 in addition to scart there is also the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.110
 Signals individually we have for example 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.950
 First, I'll just build the states 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.950
 in short we have s video first and 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.260
 composite video with audio of course 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.329
 connected with composite video 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.610
 course the lowest quality level in the 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.760
 analog video area shows afterwards 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:54.280
 the video comes this 4 pin plug 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:58.140
 and then we still have rgb or y ppr 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.030
 component video and with these two 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.790
 they can actually cover everything 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.739
 so on analogue source devices 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.590
 have disposal and then you can 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.590
 with the devices convert in hdmi 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.130
 they can produce a 3d effect and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.310
 the mentioned versions all 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.130
 use and beyond we still have 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.740
 a converter for vga that is in 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.150
 end effect also a rgb video signal but 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.270
 stop with vga connection 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.960
 you have that on the popular laptops 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.580
 computer netbooks and so on and so too 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.830
 We have a possibility for that 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.099
 to convert that into hdmi 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.620
 You can also use the audio signal here 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:44.380
 VGA as 3.5 millimeter jack with 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.099
 enter and that comes bundled 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.780
 as a hdmi forgot again I have forgotten 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.690
 nor that they convert to all 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.360
 turn off and turn on the led display 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.610
 So what disturbs the LED easy operation 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.260
 or because the dark home cinema led 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.490
 would not support the optics 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.349
 you can just turn this off 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.630
 pertile we already have some 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.919
 shipments will be made legal problems 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.440
 how many products do you have? 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:15.130
 actually at league where we have 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.300
 currently well over 100 audio and 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.940
 video equipment 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.580
 and for the spectators at home I think 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.530
 a look is worth it in the assortment 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.750
 if you have a problem write it 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.169
 us otherwise we can recommend something 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.460
 You also have to write on your own 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.909
 side also gain something to 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.699
 can 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:36.430
 we are giving away this one today 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.940
 brand new league-boss card to hdmi 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.550
 Converter with scaling function and 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.220
 with 3d effect function something completely 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.770
 special detail the gwo eu / 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.060
 sweepstakes and I hope we are then 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.949
 also in the next show again 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.020
 and so dear spectators what's up 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.509
 because there in the next show 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.129
 we doubt the toplink matrix four times 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.840
 you before 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:01.330
 and that is certainly a whole 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.219
 interesting sequence for the spectators up 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.219
 thank you mister thele bye bye
