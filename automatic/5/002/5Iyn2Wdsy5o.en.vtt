00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
ability for all players to get to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.229 
ability for all players to get to
maximum<00:00:38.040> level<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> lot<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.969> hardcore

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
maximum level and a lot of hardcore

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.420 
maximum level and a lot of hardcore
raiders<00:00:39.780> will<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.200> argue<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
raiders will kind of argue that well the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150 
raiders will kind of argue that well the
only<00:00:41.520> place<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.090> need<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> lack<00:00:43.530> max<00:00:43.860> level

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
only place you need to be lack max level

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
only place you need to be lack max level
is<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> hard<00:00:44.850> mode<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> raid<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
is the hard mode of the raid and that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.080 
is the hard mode of the raid and that
will<00:00:46.110> probably<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.530> consistent<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.520> into

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
will probably be consistent going into

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.229 
will probably be consistent going into
crotas<00:00:48.570> end<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.590> i<00:00:49.620> still<00:00:49.920> feel<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.340> players

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
crotas end but i still feel like players

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.770 
crotas end but i still feel like players
should<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.809> robbed<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:54.000> maximum

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
should not be robbed of the maximum

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
should not be robbed of the maximum
growth<00:00:55.260> level<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.980> their<00:00:56.100> character<00:00:56.520> i<00:00:56.550> don't

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
growth level for their character i don't

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.010 
growth level for their character i don't
think<00:00:56.879> that's<00:00:56.969> cool<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.660> i<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.930> there

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
think that's cool and i think there

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.470 
think that's cool and i think there
needs<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.289> some<00:00:58.620> sort<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.210> avenue<00:01:00.210> there

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
needs to be some sort of avenue there

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
needs to be some sort of avenue there
for<00:01:00.870> players<00:01:01.140> who<00:01:01.340> just<00:01:02.340> don't<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.850> do

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
for players who just don't like to do

had<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.460> mind<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.909> Bungie<00:01:36.540> needs<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
had it in my mind that Bungie needs to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.010 
had it in my mind that Bungie needs to
really<00:01:37.229> add<00:01:37.500> some<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.759> creative<00:01:39.420> gameplay

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really add some more creative gameplay

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.830 
really add some more creative gameplay
modes<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.829> destiny<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.360> those<00:01:42.450> modes

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
modes to destiny and one of those modes

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.719 
modes to destiny and one of those modes
could<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.560> sort<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.979> horde<00:01:44.250> mode<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
could be some sort of horde mode now I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.520 
could be some sort of horde mode now I
know<00:01:44.850> horde<00:01:45.240> mode<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.750> something<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
know horde mode is something that is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.179 
know horde mode is something that is
pretty<00:01:47.130> standard<00:01:47.549> across<00:01:49.189> first-person

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
pretty standard across first-person

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.899 
pretty standard across first-person
shooters<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.000> mmos<00:01:51.479> general<00:01:52.640> but<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> feel

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
shooters and mmos general but I feel
