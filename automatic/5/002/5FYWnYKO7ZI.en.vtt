but I think everybody is Strider bested
for<00:01:34.479> sure<00:01:34.630> there<00:01:34.779> was<00:01:34.899> you<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.319> know<00:01:35.439> if<00:01:35.799> you

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979

for sure there was you you know if you
come<00:01:36.130> here<00:01:36.249> means<00:01:36.520> that<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.819> had<00:01:36.939> to<00:01:37.090> push

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
come here means that you had to push

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.359 
come here means that you had to push
yourself<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.079> maximum<00:01:38.469> and<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:38.859> let's

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
yourself to the maximum and then let's

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.739 
yourself to the maximum and then let's
see<00:01:39.490> what's<00:01:39.670> happened<00:01:39.999> yeah<00:01:40.209> you<00:01:40.600> know<00:01:40.719> I

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
see what's happened yeah you know I

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.260 
see what's happened yeah you know I
think<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.829> also<00:01:42.549> we<00:01:42.729> saw<00:01:42.849> yesterday<00:01:42.999> in

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
think that I also we saw yesterday in

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.879 
think that I also we saw yesterday in
the<00:01:43.420> Latin<00:01:43.749> I<00:01:43.959> think<00:01:44.139> nothing<00:01:44.319> today<00:01:44.590> would<00:01:44.799> be

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
the Latin I think nothing today would be

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.679 
the Latin I think nothing today would be
the<00:01:44.920> same<00:01:45.219> I<00:01:45.459> think<00:01:45.759> everybody<00:01:46.149> had<00:01:46.389> the<00:01:46.509> World

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
the same I think everybody had the World

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.349 
the same I think everybody had the World
Championship<00:01:47.229> very<00:01:47.770> short<00:01:48.039> time<00:01:48.279> ago<00:01:48.459> and<00:01:48.759> I

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
Championship very short time ago and I

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.480 
Championship very short time ago and I
think<00:01:49.569> everybody<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.139> on<00:01:50.289> very<00:01:50.709> very<00:01:50.950> top<00:01:51.219> form

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
think everybody is on very very top form

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.510 
think everybody is on very very top form
so<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.090> think<00:01:52.359> the<00:01:52.959> level<00:01:53.109> is<00:01:53.439> will<00:01:54.189> be<00:01:54.340> very

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
so I think the level is will be very

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.870 
so I think the level is will be very
high<00:01:54.789> from<00:01:55.419> all<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.779> top<00:01:55.929> couples<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.700> we

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
high from all the top couples but we

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.580 
high from all the top couples but we
could<00:01:58.119> experience<00:01:58.659> that<00:01:59.169> the<00:01:59.439> new

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
could experience that the new

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.959 
could experience that the new
adjudication<00:02:00.310> system<00:02:00.669> 2.0<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:02.520> sometimes<00:02:03.520> it

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
adjudication system 2.0 is sometimes it

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.659 
adjudication system 2.0 is sometimes it
brings<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.450> different<00:02:04.630> result<00:02:05.139> and<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.639> a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:06.669 
brings a different result and it is a

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:09.870 
brings a different result and it is a

perfection that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.300 
perfection that
not<00:02:26.420> perfection<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.350> all<00:02:27.650> try<00:02:27.920> our<00:02:27.950> best

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
not perfection so we all try our best

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
best and and at the end of course is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.240
