my<00:04:12.340> lips<00:04:12.670> all<00:04:13.450> I'm<00:04:13.660> going<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.840> do<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:15.000> put<00:04:16.000> some

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
my lips all I'm going to do is put some

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:29.249 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.759 

so<00:04:30.149> they<00:04:30.239> can<00:04:30.389> be<00:04:30.479> glossy<00:04:30.959> but<00:04:31.169> not<00:04:31.379> like

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:31.769 
so they can be glossy but not like

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:35.149 
so they can be glossy but not like
overly<00:04:32.159> shiny<00:04:33.229> what<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.259> think<00:04:34.679> looks<00:04:34.889> best

skin<00:04:38.969> bronzy<00:04:39.539> eyes<00:04:39.749> I<00:04:40.169> think<00:04:40.769> it's<00:04:40.859> because

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
skin bronzy eyes I think it's because

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.949 
skin bronzy eyes I think it's because
it's<00:04:41.249> like<00:04:41.369> summer<00:04:41.849> it<00:04:42.209> all<00:04:42.419> kind<00:04:42.689> of<00:04:42.749> fits
