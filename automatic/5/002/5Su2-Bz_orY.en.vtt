is to stop worrying worry and prosperity

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
is to stop worrying worry and prosperity
are<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.770> two<00:01:02.219> totally<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:03.019> wavelengths

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
are on two totally different wavelengths

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
are on two totally different wavelengths
or<00:01:04.140> vibrations<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.760> them<00:01:05.909> as

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
or vibrations I like to think of them as

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
or vibrations I like to think of them as
radio<00:01:06.570> stations<00:01:07.049> where<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.590> listen<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.950> one

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
radio stations where I can listen to one

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.340 
radio stations where I can listen to one
or<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:09.180> listen<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> other<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> can't

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
or I can listen to the other but I can't

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.039 
or I can listen to the other but I can't
listen<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> both<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.460> exact<00:01:11.820> same<00:01:12.030> time<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
listen to both at the exact same time so

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.560 
listen to both at the exact same time so
it's<00:01:13.470> impossible<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.220> attract<00:01:14.610> prosperity<00:01:15.210> if

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it's impossible to attract prosperity if

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
it's impossible to attract prosperity if
you're<00:01:15.750> constantly<00:01:16.409> worried<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:16.950> there

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you're constantly worried because there

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
you're constantly worried because there
are<00:01:17.460> two<00:01:17.610> different<00:01:17.820> frequencies<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
are two different frequencies when you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.140 
are two different frequencies when you
do<00:01:19.680> catch<00:01:19.890> yourself<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> state<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> worry

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
do catch yourself in that state of worry

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.999 
do catch yourself in that state of worry
the<00:01:21.360> best<00:01:21.509> thing<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.409> pray<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> away

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the best thing to do is to pray it away

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.510 
the best thing to do is to pray it away
so<00:01:23.820> ask<00:01:24.119> God<00:01:24.509> ask<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.200> angels<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> come<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so ask God ask the angels to come and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.480 
so ask God ask the angels to come and
help<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.509> release<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.140> worry<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
help you to release the worry and you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
help you to release the worry and you
will<00:01:29.610> feel<00:01:29.759> better<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> finally<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> just

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
will feel better and finally I just

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.960 
will feel better and finally I just
wanted<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> mention<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:33.390> keep<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.780> mind<00:01:33.810> that

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
wanted to mention just keep in mind that

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.060 
wanted to mention just keep in mind that
prosperity<00:01:35.970> doesn't<00:01:36.390> often<00:01:36.840> initially<00:01:37.590> come

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
prosperity doesn't often initially come

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
prosperity doesn't often initially come
in<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.640> form<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.030> money<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.630> more<00:01:40.290> likely

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
in a form of money it's more likely

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
in a form of money it's more likely
that's<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.310> come<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> form<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.270> an

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
that's going to come in the form of an

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's going to come in the form of an
idea<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> form<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.220> an<00:01:44.399> opportunity
