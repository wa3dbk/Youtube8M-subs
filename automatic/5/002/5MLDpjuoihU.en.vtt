00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
compatible for disc brakes you can't

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
compatible for disc brakes you can't
just<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.900> them<00:01:34.049> fit<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.860> be

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
just make them fit they have to be

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.249 
just make them fit they have to be
compatible<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.079> that's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
compatible for it and this is so that's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710

on<00:02:27.640> them<00:02:27.760> right<00:02:27.880> now<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.450> done<00:02:28.720> from<00:02:28.990> maybe

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
on them right now is done from maybe

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.260 
on them right now is done from maybe
five<00:02:29.530> percent<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.040> writing<00:02:30.340> idea<00:02:30.640> because

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
five percent of the writing idea because

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.240 
five percent of the writing idea because
it<00:02:31.390> was<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.630> concrete<00:02:32.050> we're<00:02:32.800> gonna<00:02:32.890> get<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.160> to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
it was on concrete we're gonna get on to

that you really got to be careful on

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.620 
that you really got to be careful on
this<00:02:53.380> bike<00:02:53.620> because<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.250> wheels<00:02:54.820> are<00:02:55.240> single

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
this bike because the wheels are single

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.320 
this bike because the wheels are single
wall<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.290> 29<00:02:56.590> inch<00:02:56.830> rim<00:02:57.010> so

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
wall and it's a 29 inch rim so

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.660 
wall and it's a 29 inch rim so
especially<00:02:58.330> if<00:02:58.450> you're<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.370> fairly

especially if you're and it's fairly

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.310 
especially if you're and it's fairly
likely<00:03:00.940> than<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.750> you're<00:03:01.840> buying<00:03:01.990> this<00:03:02.140> bike

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
likely than if you're buying this bike

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.660 
likely than if you're buying this bike
you're<00:03:02.740> just<00:03:03.070> getting<00:03:03.280> into<00:03:03.370> mountain<00:03:03.640> biking

and if you're just getting into mountain

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.620 
and if you're just getting into mountain
biking<00:03:05.380> you're<00:03:05.770> probably<00:03:06.070> not<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.730> you're

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
biking you're probably not and you're

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.960 
biking you're probably not and you're
either<00:03:08.280> trying<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.370> say<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.820> least

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
either trying to say this is the least

either trying to say this is the least
mean<00:03:10.270> way<00:03:10.450> possible<00:03:10.930> there's<00:03:11.740> a<00:03:11.830> chance<00:03:12.070> that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
mean way possible there's a chance that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.650 
mean way possible there's a chance that
you're<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.730> was<00:03:12.940> when<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.390> got<00:03:13.510> into

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
you're like I was when you just got into

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.730 
you're like I was when you just got into
mountain<00:03:13.780> biking<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.230> you're<00:03:14.380> doing<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.680> to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
mountain biking and you're doing it to

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.230 
mountain biking and you're doing it to
get<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:14.950> shape<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.250> you're<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> heavier<00:03:15.880> person

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
get in shape so you're a heavier person

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
some people it might be it has plastic

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.590 
some people it might be it has plastic
pedals<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.820> they've<00:03:40.000> took<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.240> really<00:03:40.510> good

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
pedals and they've took a really good

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.260 
pedals and they've took a really good
beating<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.260> far<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:42.370> haven't<00:03:42.910> really<00:03:43.120> had<00:03:43.210> any

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
beating so far I haven't really had any

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.640 
beating so far I haven't really had any
problems<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:43.870> them<00:03:43.960> but<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.170> have<00:03:44.350> heard<00:03:44.590> a

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
problems with them but I have heard a

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.010 
problems with them but I have heard a
lot<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.800> people's<00:03:45.100> poor<00:03:45.850> stories<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.750> happen

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
lot of people's poor stories that happen

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.230 
lot of people's poor stories that happen
with<00:03:47.140> plastic<00:03:47.560> pedals<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.100> really<00:03:49.030> think<00:03:49.210> that

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
with plastic pedals I really think that

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.520 
with plastic pedals I really think that
kind<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.540> more<00:03:49.720> applies<00:03:49.960> to<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.320> heavy

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
kind of more applies to like heavy

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.110 
kind of more applies to like heavy
downhill<00:03:50.950> riding<00:03:51.190> but<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.430> could<00:03:51.790> see<00:03:51.970> where

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
downhill riding but I could see where

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.610 
downhill riding but I could see where
maybe<00:03:52.360> if<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.630> matched<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.020> on<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.170> rock<00:03:53.380> real

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
maybe if you matched it on a rock real

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.200 
maybe if you matched it on a rock real
bad<00:03:53.830> or<00:03:54.010> something<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.790> might<00:03:54.910> have<00:03:54.970> problems

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
bad or something you might have problems

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.820 
bad or something you might have problems
with<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.510> but<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:55.960> thought<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.530> would<00:03:56.710> point

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
with that but just thought I would point

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.260 
with that but just thought I would point
out<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.340> does<00:03:57.460> have<00:03:57.610> plastic<00:03:58.000> cuddles

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
out that it does have plastic cuddles

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.940 
out that it does have plastic cuddles
but<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.960> haven't<00:03:59.110> really<00:03:59.320> had<00:03:59.470> any<00:03:59.530> trouble

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
but I haven't really had any trouble

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.500 
but I haven't really had any trouble
with<00:03:59.980> them

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
with them

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.750 
with them
the<00:04:02.230> stemming<00:04:02.680> bars<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.340> comes<00:04:03.580> with

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
the stemming bars that this comes with

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.390 
the stemming bars that this comes with
stock<00:04:04.450> are<00:04:04.900> kind<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.620> uncomfortable<00:04:06.250> they

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
stock are kind of uncomfortable they

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.700 
stock are kind of uncomfortable they
just<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:07.210> was<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.360> second<00:04:08.170> thing<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.500> believe

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
just that was the second thing I believe

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.270 
just that was the second thing I believe
that<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.860> changed<00:04:09.340> on<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.930> stock<00:04:11.440> stem<00:04:11.860> is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
that I changed on this the stock stem is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.250 
that I changed on this the stock stem is
120<00:04:13.000> millimeter<00:04:13.330> stand<00:04:13.600> it's<00:04:13.900> just<00:04:14.050> really

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
120 millimeter stand it's just really

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.880 
120 millimeter stand it's just really
not<00:04:14.470> come

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
not come

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.610

kind of goofy

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.410 
kind of goofy
and<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:24.040> was<00:04:24.130> something<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.400> read<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.700> my<00:04:24.880> pink

a<00:04:27.160> lot<00:04:27.370> of<00:04:27.490> people<00:04:27.730> want<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.240> 29er<00:04:28.720> just

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
a lot of people want to do the 29er just

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.200 
a lot of people want to do the 29er just
put<00:04:29.290> a<00:04:29.500> shorter<00:04:29.830> stem<00:04:30.010> on<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.490> might<00:04:31.060> have

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
put a shorter stem on it I might have

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.940 
put a shorter stem on it I might have
went<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.450> little<00:04:31.540> overkill<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.380> got<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.560> 40

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
went a little overkill I got a 40

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.850 
went a little overkill I got a 40
millimeter<00:04:33.330> stem<00:04:34.330> but<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.810> made<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> world<00:04:35.680> of

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
millimeter stem but I made a world of

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.770 
millimeter stem but I made a world of
difference<00:04:35.920> I<00:04:36.430> mean<00:04:36.640> immediately<00:04:36.940> next<00:04:37.660> time

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
difference I mean immediately next time

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.680 
difference I mean immediately next time
I<00:04:37.810> went<00:04:37.990> out<00:04:38.110> had<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.710> huge<00:04:39.070> change<00:04:39.430> in<00:04:39.730> comfort

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
I went out had a huge change in comfort

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.910 
I went out had a huge change in comfort
and<00:04:40.780> everything<00:04:41.170> and<00:04:41.350> just<00:04:41.380> being<00:04:41.740> able<00:04:41.800> to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
and everything and just being able to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.480 
and everything and just being able to
control<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.460> so<00:04:42.780> that's<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:44.650> know<00:04:44.680> we're

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
control it so that's you know we're

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.480 
control it so that's you know we're
thinking<00:04:45.520> about<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:47.380> like<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.680> said<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.460> a

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
thinking about and like I said this is a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.700 
thinking about and like I said this is a
calm<00:04:48.760> even<00:04:49.300> though<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.510> tires<00:04:49.720> are<00:04:49.930> great<00:04:50.260> on

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
calm even though the tires are great on

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.150 
calm even though the tires are great on
trails<00:04:51.600> there<00:04:52.600> they<00:04:53.140> wear<00:04:53.350> really<00:04:53.680> really<00:04:54.010> bad

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
trails there they wear really really bad

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.270 
trails there they wear really really bad
on<00:04:54.580> concrete<00:04:55.360> so<00:04:55.630> just<00:04:56.260> keep<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:56.830> in<00:04:56.890> mind<00:04:57.160> if

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
on concrete so just keep that in mind if

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.230 
on concrete so just keep that in mind if
you're<00:04:57.400> thinking<00:04:57.430> about<00:04:57.670> buying<00:04:57.880> this<00:04:58.030> as<00:04:58.210> a

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
you're thinking about buying this as a

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.180 
you're thinking about buying this as a
commuter<00:04:58.570> bike<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:59.380> stock<00:04:59.680> breaks<00:04:59.950> this

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
commuter bike the stock breaks this

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.880 
commuter bike the stock breaks this
comes<00:05:00.400> with<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.640> V<00:05:00.910> brakes<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:02.470> just<00:05:02.650> seemed

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
comes with the V brakes you just seemed

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.130 
comes with the V brakes you just seemed
really<00:05:03.010> weak<00:05:03.400> to<00:05:03.580> me<00:05:03.730> no<00:05:04.720> matter<00:05:04.930> how<00:05:05.110> I

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
really weak to me no matter how I

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.900 
really weak to me no matter how I
adjusted<00:05:05.320> them<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.070> how<00:05:06.190> tight<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.550> got<00:05:06.820> him

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
adjusted them and how tight I got him

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.200 
adjusted them and how tight I got him
down<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.420> just<00:05:07.870> had<00:05:08.170> problems<00:05:08.530> with<00:05:08.650> him<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:09.210> even

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
down I just had problems with him I even

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.900 
down I just had problems with him I even
when<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.140> was<00:05:11.260> first<00:05:11.500> kind<00:05:11.680> of<00:05:11.770> learning<00:05:11.980> kept

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
when I was first kind of learning kept

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.010 
when I was first kind of learning kept
letting<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.240> bike<00:05:13.360> just<00:05:13.600> really<00:05:13.810> get<00:05:13.930> away

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
letting the bike just really get away

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.510 
letting the bike just really get away
from<00:05:14.140> me<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.410> had<00:05:14.590> several<00:05:14.950> wrecks<00:05:15.160> because

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
from me and had several wrecks because

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.920 
from me and had several wrecks because
of<00:05:15.670> just<00:05:15.880> not<00:05:16.030> having<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.330> power<00:05:16.540> but<00:05:16.780> those

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
of just not having the power but those

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.350 
of just not having the power but those
brakes<00:05:17.170> to<00:05:17.290> get<00:05:17.380> slowed<00:05:17.620> down<00:05:17.650> on<00:05:17.920> some<00:05:18.100> hills

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
brakes to get slowed down on some hills

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.520 
brakes to get slowed down on some hills
part<00:05:19.360> of<00:05:19.480> that<00:05:19.600> probably<00:05:19.960> being<00:05:20.200> that<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.410> was

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
part of that probably being that I was

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.720 
part of that probably being that I was
getting<00:05:20.740> on<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.950> steeper<00:05:21.250> Hills<00:05:21.430> for<00:05:21.669> the

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
getting on to steeper Hills for the

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.630 
getting on to steeper Hills for the
brakes<00:05:21.940> but<00:05:22.380> I'm<00:05:23.380> just<00:05:23.590> letting<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.950> know<00:05:23.980> the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
brakes but I'm just letting you know the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.760 
brakes but I'm just letting you know the
third<00:05:25.120> time<00:05:25.480> that<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:25.810> took<00:05:26.169> this<00:05:26.350> black<00:05:26.560> out

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
third time that I took this black out

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.500 
third time that I took this black out
pretty<00:05:27.070> serious<00:05:27.400> trail<00:05:27.640> riding<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.270> third

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
pretty serious trail riding the third

pretty serious trail riding the third
time<00:05:28.840> I<00:05:29.230> had<00:05:29.830> just<00:05:30.100> brakes<00:05:30.370> on<00:05:30.550> it<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:31.840> really

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
time I had just brakes on it so I really

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.650 
time I had just brakes on it so I really
might<00:05:33.250> have<00:05:33.280> got<00:05:33.490> hurt<00:05:33.700> money-wise<00:05:34.180> on<00:05:34.450> that

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660
