any<00:03:05.680> childhood<00:03:06.640> activity<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.330> know<00:03:07.480> if

you're gonna do hockey or gymnastics

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.390 
you're gonna do hockey or gymnastics
there's<00:03:10.360> risk<00:03:10.600> there<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.140> swimming<00:03:11.980> with<00:03:12.370> a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
there's risk there and swimming with a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.490 
there's risk there and swimming with a
mermaid<00:03:12.700> tail<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:13.030> no<00:03:13.210> different<00:03:13.630> but

realize<00:03:40.810> that<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.260> students<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.680> children

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
realize that the students that children

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.590 
realize that the students that children
are<00:03:42.160> swimming<00:03:42.430> with<00:03:42.550> actually<00:03:43.120> come<00:03:43.330> equipped

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
are swimming with actually come equipped

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.660 
are swimming with actually come equipped
with<00:03:43.840> emergency<00:03:44.650> release<00:03:44.950> buttons<00:03:45.400> or

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
with emergency release buttons or

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.820 
with emergency release buttons or
emergency<00:03:46.660> release<00:03:46.930> protocols<00:03:47.560> that

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
emergency release protocols that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.020 
emergency release protocols that
children<00:03:48.190> can<00:03:48.340> get<00:03:48.490> out<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.760> them<00:03:48.880> very

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
children can get out of them very

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.510 
children can get out of them very
quickly<00:03:49.740> mermaid<00:03:50.740> tails<00:03:50.980> are<00:03:51.160> actually

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
quickly mermaid tails are actually

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.610 
quickly mermaid tails are actually
buoyant<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.300> they<00:03:52.750> don't<00:03:52.960> tend<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.320> make<00:03:53.500> you

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
buoyant so they don't tend to make you

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.980 
buoyant so they don't tend to make you
sink<00:03:53.920> in<00:03:54.130> fact<00:03:54.400> as<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> mermaid<00:03:55.480> performer<00:03:55.960> I

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
sink in fact as a mermaid performer I

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.650 
sink in fact as a mermaid performer I
have<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.440> put<00:03:56.950> weights<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.760> my<00:03:57.910> tail<00:03:58.180> if<00:03:58.480> I'm

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
have to put weights in my tail if I'm

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.240 
have to put weights in my tail if I'm
doing<00:03:58.930> any<00:03:59.080> kind<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.350> filming<00:03:59.710> that<00:03:59.890> requires

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
doing any kind of filming that requires

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.400 
doing any kind of filming that requires
me<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.730> stay<00:04:00.970> underwater<00:04:01.330> for<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.840> long<00:04:02.050> period

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
me to stay underwater for a long period

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.700 
me to stay underwater for a long period
of<00:04:02.440> time<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.340> I'm<00:04:04.180> sort<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.570> concerned<00:04:05.080> with

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
of time and I'm sort of concerned with

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.310 
of time and I'm sort of concerned with
the<00:04:05.860> ban<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.880> because<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.720> ban<00:04:07.960> it's

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
the ban that because of the ban it's

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.050 
the ban that because of the ban it's
actually<00:04:08.770> going<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.070> raise<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.670> risk<00:04:09.880> a

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
actually going to raise the risk a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.180 
actually going to raise the risk a
little<00:04:10.150> bit<00:04:10.420> because<00:04:11.260> prior<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:12.070> that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
little bit because prior to that

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.490 
little bit because prior to that
children<00:04:12.820> at<00:04:12.940> least<00:04:13.120> were<00:04:13.420> swimming<00:04:13.870> where

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
children at least were swimming where

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.349 
children at least were swimming where
there<00:04:14.710> were<00:04:14.830> lifeguards<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.670> people<00:04:16.030> who

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
there were lifeguards and people who

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.880 
there were lifeguards and people who
could<00:04:16.660> save<00:04:16.960> them<00:04:17.200> if<00:04:17.350> there<00:04:17.500> was<00:04:17.620> an<00:04:17.739> issue

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
could save them if there was an issue

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.580 
could save them if there was an issue
and<00:04:18.670> now<00:04:19.390> they're<00:04:19.720> going<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.900> be<00:04:19.960> forced<00:04:20.290> out

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
and now they're going to be forced out

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.190 
and now they're going to be forced out
of<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.210> you<00:04:22.210> know<00:04:22.330> there<00:04:22.540> is<00:04:22.690> such<00:04:23.050> an

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
of that and you know there is such an

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.690 
of that and you know there is such an
interest<00:04:23.290> in<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:23.980> I'm<00:04:24.070> concerned<00:04:24.550> that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
interest in this that I'm concerned that

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.980 
interest in this that I'm concerned that
children<00:04:24.970> are<00:04:25.060> going<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.240> start<00:04:25.510> swimming<00:04:25.870> in

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
children are going to start swimming in

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.110 
children are going to start swimming in
lakes<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.470> private<00:04:26.830> pools<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.430> not<00:04:27.880> have

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
lakes and private pools and not have

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.990 
lakes and private pools and not have
someone<00:04:28.570> I've<00:04:29.290> actually<00:04:29.530> been<00:04:30.190> speaking<00:04:30.520> I

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
someone I've actually been speaking I

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.630 
someone I've actually been speaking I
wasn't<00:04:31.710> invited<00:04:32.710> by<00:04:32.860> someone<00:04:33.190> from<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.490> Life

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
wasn't invited by someone from the Life

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.460 
wasn't invited by someone from the Life
Saving<00:04:33.850> Society<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.720> give<00:04:34.870> a<00:04:34.900> presentation

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
Saving Society to give a presentation

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.290 
Saving Society to give a presentation
about<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.640> really<00:04:36.940> hoping<00:04:37.240> that

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
about it so I'm really hoping that

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.060 
about it so I'm really hoping that
that's<00:04:37.720> going<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.990> happen<00:04:38.140> but<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.770> know

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
that's going to happen but you know

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.370 
that's going to happen but you know
there's<00:04:39.460> definitely<00:04:39.730> inherent<00:04:40.480> risks<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:40.960> I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
there's definitely inherent risks and I

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.350 
there's definitely inherent risks and I
think<00:04:41.590> it's<00:04:41.710> important<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.400> parents<00:04:43.060> are

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
think it's important that parents are

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.060 
think it's important that parents are
supervising<00:04:43.780> their<00:04:44.050> children<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.680> that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
supervising their children and that

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.920 
supervising their children and that
we're<00:04:45.280> reading<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.970> instructions<00:04:46.570> that<00:04:46.690> come

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
we're reading the instructions that come

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.560 
we're reading the instructions that come
with<00:04:47.110> each<00:04:47.140> mermaid<00:04:47.620> fan<00:04:47.970> but<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.000> think<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.360> it

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
with each mermaid fan but I think it it

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.670 
with each mermaid fan but I think it it
just<00:04:49.750> would<00:04:49.930> have<00:04:49.990> been<00:04:50.050> better<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.440> have<00:04:50.650> a

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
just would have been better to have a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.380 
just would have been better to have a
compromise<00:04:51.160> such<00:04:51.580> as<00:04:51.729> like<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.880> swim<00:04:52.210> test

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
compromise such as like a swim test

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.719 
compromise such as like a swim test
which<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.900> what<00:04:53.200> we<00:04:53.320> do<00:04:53.500> at<00:04:53.770> least<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.430> you

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
which is what we do at least and you

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.520 
which is what we do at least and you
know<00:04:55.060> it's<00:04:55.240> worked<00:04:55.479> very<00:04:55.870> well<00:04:55.930> for<00:04:56.050> us<00:04:56.290> so<00:04:56.320> far

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
know it's worked very well for us so far

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.310 
know it's worked very well for us so far
yeah<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.729> you're<00:04:57.970> I<00:04:58.180> just<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:58.720> disappointed

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
yeah so you're I just you disappointed

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.040 
yeah so you're I just you disappointed

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.170 
they've been banned here yeah yeah it's
just<00:05:02.229> um<00:05:02.530> I<00:05:02.800> feel<00:05:03.130> like<00:05:03.340> children<00:05:03.580> are<00:05:03.940> being

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
just um I feel like children are being

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.390 
just um I feel like children are being
denied<00:05:04.510> an<00:05:05.169> opportunity<00:05:05.890> that<00:05:06.100> was<00:05:06.250> so

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
denied an opportunity that was so

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.700 
denied an opportunity that was so
life-changing<00:05:06.610> for<00:05:07.240> me<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.390> mean<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:08.229> have

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
life-changing for me I mean I have

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.320 
life-changing for me I mean I have
chronic<00:05:08.890> illness<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.490> chronic<00:05:09.610> mobility

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
chronic illness and chronic mobility

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.390 
chronic illness and chronic mobility
problems<00:05:11.140> so<00:05:11.350> you<00:05:11.410> know<00:05:11.620> like<00:05:11.890> I<00:05:11.979> wasn't<00:05:12.220> a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
problems so you know like I wasn't a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.060 
problems so you know like I wasn't a
strong<00:05:12.610> swimmer<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.450> and<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.590> was<00:05:14.770> able<00:05:14.919> to

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
strong swimmer and and I was able to

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.640 
strong swimmer and and I was able to
learn<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:15.610> very<00:05:15.669> quickly<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:17.200> never

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
learn this very quickly and I never

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.110 
learn this very quickly and I never
imagined<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.400> would<00:05:18.460> take<00:05:18.700> off<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.000> way<00:05:19.090> it

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120
