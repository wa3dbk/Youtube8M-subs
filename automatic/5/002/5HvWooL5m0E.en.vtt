game<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.530> well<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> need<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
game as well so we just need to have a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230 
game as well so we just need to have a
different<00:01:46.470> change<00:01:46.829> attack<00:01:47.159> need<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> bit<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
different change attack need a bit of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.660 
different change attack need a bit of
piercing<00:01:48.659> behind<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.280> rhinol

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
piercing behind I think which was rhinol

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.670 
piercing behind I think which was rhinol
though<00:01:51.060> we're<00:01:51.600> they'll<00:01:51.869> come<00:01:52.110> back<00:01:52.229> any<00:01:52.470> can

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
also we need something to play out on

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.609 
also we need something to play out on
the<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.780> need<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.049> put<00:01:55.140> crosses<00:01:55.290> in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619

Ryan<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.399> play<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.670> how<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.939> has<00:01:57.090> been

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
Ryan can play that how this has been

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.670 
Ryan can play that how this has been
working<00:01:57.479> ever<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.719> well<00:01:57.840> into<00:01:58.079> any<00:01:58.229> Big<00:01:58.409> John's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
working ever so well into any Big John's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.679 
working ever so well into any Big John's
assume<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.939> think<00:02:00.000> probably<00:02:00.149> Crawford

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
assume so and I think probably Crawford

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899 
assume so and I think probably Crawford
you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.860> come<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.219> play<00:02:02.670> lots<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you know you can come in play lots of

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.050 
you know you can come in play lots of
different<00:02:03.119> positions<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.719> certainly<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
different positions but certainly in

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.480 
different positions but certainly in
if<00:02:05.180> if<00:02:05.630> need<00:02:06.020> be<00:02:06.049> if<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:06.619> got<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.770> ninja<00:02:06.979> turtle

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
if if need be if we got a ninja turtle

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.680 
if if need be if we got a ninja turtle
he<00:02:07.579> wise<00:02:07.729> for<00:02:07.970> example<00:02:08.360> we<00:02:08.420> haven't<00:02:08.599> really

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
he wise for example we haven't really

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.419 
he wise for example we haven't really
got<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.899> natural<00:02:09.229> left<00:02:09.410> part<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.069> we<00:02:10.160> could<00:02:10.340> go

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
got a natural left part so we could go

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.180 
got a natural left part so we could go
into<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.759> position<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:12.380> again<00:02:12.500> they've

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
into that position so and again they've

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.470 
into that position so and again they've
impressed<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.730> training<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.150> that's<00:02:14.360> why

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
impressed in training so that's why

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.959 
impressed in training so that's why
they're<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> bench
