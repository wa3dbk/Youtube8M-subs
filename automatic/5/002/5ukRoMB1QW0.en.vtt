00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Tell me guys, where did I make a video? 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.970
 talking about the polls for who 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 play in midi the gal likes a lot 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.309
 a lot of people asked me to show the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.799
 street page for de is for those who have not seen 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.839
 of pages per meter I 'll leave the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.760
 enrollment has another article also 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.460
 streets pages asking was well 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 complete I picked up several pages so 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 of their own and analyzed and showed 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.330
 I explained why the guy likes to wear 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 such a thing to you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.430
 so come on, I'll make one 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.440
 a standard page and that you can 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.010
 to use for everyone you will want to know how to use 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 the court here to list for lunch break 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.040
 here for all those beauty is first 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.039
 something that I'm going to put and I'll explain 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:53.850
 the mature and medium resist flash is not 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.590
 no school because once the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.800
 people like to use but that has been changing 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.920
 The goal was to change the media today. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 more aggressive to handle whatever is playing 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.020
 against miami if you have because 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.020
 She will fill a lot of baggage that happens. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.689
 a lioness lioness can insulate herself 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 So you have to be very careful. 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.790
 that it is the weakest part of it so 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.189
 is that he is very much like with his fragile 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.930
 in the game she is consul if a cup of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.020
 porcelain is very easy to get there and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.340
 break it explodes he bequeathed support 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.040
 so you can not fool around 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.450
 beginning of the game then you can not 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.460
 wanting to keep the existence of the end 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 of the game at the end of the game 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
 will explode anyway for a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.670
 killer beauty 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.409
 then you will suffer with the killer already 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.640
 any way so do not worry about 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.770
 That's right, you 'll have to make one. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.770
 already only have to do a rematch some 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.520
 That 's the way it is, that's it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.329
 This has to be flat on the marks you 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:59.700
 can use a little criticism is 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.700
 cool, you will not lose too 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.649
 this then compensates and in the fifth essence 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.270
 will have to be cared for essences of 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.190
 speedy attack 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.929
 formerly the guys used with 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.679
 advance has also given another goal 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.209
 has changed 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.590
 the staff was seeing that with 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.420
 attacks events 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.180
 better sow mainly trades 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.670
 long exchanges helps a lot 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.190
 This is a long exchange if there are eight 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.010
 attacks a guy the guy gave you six knows 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.890
 this is the gigantic difference and in 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.650
 short exchanges you can give 30 and 21 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.900
 so in these attacks so you 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.180
 win you will gain upon exchange 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.000
 I wish I was using his 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.650
 The big question is if you use your 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.340
 essence it will pass the attacks 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.890
 physicists 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.049
 take care that you go to a farm 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.849
 So he played games in a game before 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.640
 you will see this will lose the fans of 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.500
 mostly there on level 1 to the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.069
 6 that you are accustomed to forming with 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.510
 then of beauty then and if this is the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.360
 page of a year that I'm showing 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.390

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.829

 and something else that I talk like that if you 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.139
 It's my business to look for other 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.410
 pages of runes I will not delve into 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:27.389
 much more value in the player 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.489

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.549
 its 56 pages from a different 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.739
 sometimes a cut it rolls of you use a 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.639
 different zone and you can place a
