00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.470 

hello<00:00:01.650> minecrafters<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.610> back<00:00:02.790> again<00:00:02.820> with

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hello minecrafters I'm back again with

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.440 
hello minecrafters I'm back again with
this<00:00:04.350> new<00:00:04.529> dimension<00:00:05.089> I<00:00:07.880> figured<00:00:08.880> out<00:00:09.030> that

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this new dimension I figured out that

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.930 
this new dimension I figured out that
you<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.900> move<00:00:10.410> ice<00:00:10.740> blocks<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.490> questions

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
you can move ice blocks with questions

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.680 
you can move ice blocks with questions
so<00:00:12.210> let's<00:00:13.429> somehow<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> way<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> build

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
so let's somehow a way to build

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.890 
so let's somehow a way to build
structures<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:17.010> ice<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:18.119> out<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.660> ice

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
structures with ice or out of ice

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.980 
structures with ice or out of ice
without<00:00:19.439> cheating<00:00:19.920> course<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.490> can<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:21.210> go

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
without cheating course you can just go

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.210 
without cheating course you can just go
to<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.279> snowy<00:00:23.279> biome<00:00:23.789> where<00:00:24.210> ice<00:00:25.220> automatically

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to a snowy biome where ice automatically

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.330 
to a snowy biome where ice automatically
regenerates<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:28.349> move<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.130> with

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
regenerates and then they move it with

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.440 
regenerates and then they move it with
business<00:00:30.260> yeah<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.790> takes<00:00:32.790> quite<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> lot

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
business yeah but it takes quite a lot

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
business yeah but it takes quite a lot
of<00:00:33.480> time<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
of time but here you can see here is a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:51.090 
of time but here you can see here is a
nice<00:00:35.880> blow

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.400 

yeah<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:51.940> now<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:53.109> has<00:00:53.230> moved<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.260> bit

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
yeah and now it has moved it's a bit

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.399 
yeah and now it has moved it's a bit
strange<00:00:56.739> that's<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.660> piston<00:00:58.660> disappears

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
strange that's the piston disappears

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.320 
strange that's the piston disappears
here<00:00:59.890> but<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.829> only<00:01:03.190> with<00:01:03.460> ice<00:01:03.760> blocks<00:01:04.149> I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
here but it's only with ice blocks I

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
here but it's only with ice blocks I
don't<00:01:04.540> know<00:01:04.659> why<00:01:04.950> but<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.430> reappears<00:01:06.850> if<00:01:07.060> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
don't know why but it reappears if you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.440 
don't know why but it reappears if you
untreated<00:01:09.780> yeah<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.759> what<00:01:12.759> I<00:01:12.789> did<00:01:13.090> with<00:01:13.299> this

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
untreated yeah and what I did with this

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.980 
untreated yeah and what I did with this
is<00:01:13.750> make<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.740> way<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.299> move<00:01:16.299> items<00:01:17.070> upwards

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
is make a way to move items upwards

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770 
is make a way to move items upwards
perhaps<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.200> notice<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:21.659> previously<00:01:22.659> it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
perhaps you notice that previously it

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.139 
perhaps you notice that previously it
wasn't<00:01:23.350> them<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.770> was<00:01:24.159> impossible<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.729> move

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
wasn't them it was impossible to move

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.990 
wasn't them it was impossible to move
items<00:01:25.420> upload<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.619> could<00:01:26.800> just<00:01:27.039> move<00:01:27.310> them<00:01:27.580> to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
items upload you could just move them to

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.690 
items upload you could just move them to
the<00:01:28.090> site<00:01:28.300> or<00:01:28.509> down<00:01:28.690> what's<00:01:29.590> with<00:01:30.340> water

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
the site or down what's with water

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.859 
the site or down what's with water
strings<00:01:31.119> ends<00:01:31.539> with<00:01:31.780> gravity<00:01:32.319> and<00:01:32.580> this<00:01:33.580> time

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
strings ends with gravity and this time

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.190 
strings ends with gravity and this time
we<00:01:34.869> can<00:01:34.899> throw<00:01:35.350> an<00:01:35.500> item<00:01:35.800> in<00:01:35.920> here<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.270> run

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
we can throw an item in here and run

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.850 
we can throw an item in here and run
button<00:01:39.210> yeah<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.750> moves<00:01:40.960> very<00:01:41.170> fast<00:01:41.319> cause

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
button yeah and it moves very fast cause

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.649 
button yeah and it moves very fast cause
there<00:01:42.130> are<00:01:42.250> ice<00:01:42.429> blocks<00:01:42.759> below<00:01:45.270> brought<00:01:46.270> there

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
there are ice blocks below brought there

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.889 
there are ice blocks below brought there
by<00:01:46.690> pistons<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:49.830> here<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.720> move<00:01:52.720> the

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
by pistons and here you can move the

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.149 
by pistons and here you can move the
items<00:01:53.259> up<00:01:53.440> with<00:01:54.130> when<00:01:54.459> I<00:01:54.580> activate<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.659> switch

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
items up with when I activate the switch

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:06.880 
items up with when I activate the switch
the<00:01:57.159> whole<00:01:57.430> mushroom<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:57.880> activated

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.730 

and<00:02:07.430> it's<00:02:08.060> Trenton<00:02:08.720> sports<00:02:08.840> items<00:02:09.470> very<00:02:10.039> fast

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
and it's Trenton sports items very fast

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.059 
and it's Trenton sports items very fast
let's<00:02:12.740> see<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:14.560> put<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.890> water

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
let's see if I just put it in the water

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.340 
let's see if I just put it in the water
and<00:02:16.400> run

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.800 

it's<00:02:23.980> nearly<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:24.490> fast<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.240> am<00:02:25.450> when<00:02:25.660> I'm

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
it's nearly as fast as I am when I'm

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.240 
it's nearly as fast as I am when I'm
running<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:27.090> yeah<00:02:28.090> that's<00:02:28.630> means<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.830> there

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
running so yeah that's means that there

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.640 
running so yeah that's means that there
was<00:02:30.870> any<00:02:31.870> items<00:02:32.260> get<00:02:32.710> lost<00:02:34.230> because<00:02:35.230> they'd<00:02:35.500> is

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
was any items get lost because they'd is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.250 
was any items get lost because they'd is
born<00:02:35.890> after<00:02:36.190> five<00:02:36.430> minutes<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.150> yeah<00:02:38.080> and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
born after five minutes or so yeah and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.920 
born after five minutes or so yeah and
as<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.520> see<00:02:39.550> it<00:02:39.730> goes<00:02:39.970> upwards<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.690> can

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
as you can see it goes upwards you can

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.520 
as you can see it goes upwards you can
of<00:02:41.080> course<00:02:42.300> make<00:02:43.300> them<00:02:43.540> go<00:02:43.990> up<00:02:44.170> straight

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
of course make them go up straight

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.350 
of course make them go up straight
forward<00:02:44.950> for<00:02:45.580> quite<00:02:45.790> something<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.210> could

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
forward for quite something you could

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.220 
forward for quite something you could
use<00:02:46.390> my<00:02:46.900> lifts<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:49.090> are<00:02:49.390> my<00:02:49.600> elevator<00:02:50.020> which

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
use my lifts which are my elevator which

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.950 
use my lifts which are my elevator which
I<00:02:50.470> presented<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.850> other<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.630> another

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
I presented you in other in another

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.710 
I presented you in other in another
video<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:54.760> move<00:02:55.240> items<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.150> I've<00:02:58.510> got

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
video and to move items and and I've got

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.070 
video and to move items and and I've got
another<00:02:59.020> invention<00:03:00.300> for<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.420> guys

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.490 

just<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.920> dark<00:03:07.160> long<00:03:07.520> tunnel<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.240> if<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.930> trigger

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
just a dark long tunnel and if I trigger

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.520 
just a dark long tunnel and if I trigger
the<00:03:09.650> switch<00:03:10.120> lava<00:03:11.120> comes<00:03:11.450> from<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:13.120> top<00:03:14.120> and

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the switch lava comes from the top and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.920 
the switch lava comes from the top and
enlightens<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.620> room<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.240> extremely

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
enlightens the room and it's extremely

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.500 
enlightens the room and it's extremely
bright<00:03:18.290> cause<00:03:18.710> there's<00:03:19.370> lava<00:03:19.670> all<00:03:20.000> over<00:03:20.330> me

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
bright cause there's lava all over me

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.320 
bright cause there's lava all over me
all<00:03:20.660> around<00:03:21.410> me<00:03:22.240> and<00:03:23.240> you<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.570> also<00:03:25.330> switch

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
all around me and you can also switch

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.780 
all around me and you can also switch
off<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.690> light<00:03:26.840> by<00:03:27.140> just<00:03:27.500> triggering<00:03:28.430> it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
off the light by just triggering it

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.210 
off the light by just triggering it
again<00:03:30.940> there<00:03:31.940> now<00:03:32.240> it's<00:03:32.420> dark<00:03:32.990> in<00:03:33.290> here<00:03:33.530> you

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
again there now it's dark in here you

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.920 
again there now it's dark in here you
could<00:03:34.370> also<00:03:34.580> use<00:03:34.730> this<00:03:35.060> for<00:03:35.240> example<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.780> make

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
could also use this for example to make

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.520 
could also use this for example to make
a<00:03:36.010> mob<00:03:37.010> trap<00:03:37.310> which<00:03:37.730> can<00:03:38.060> be<00:03:38.210> activated<00:03:38.660> with<00:03:39.470> a

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
a mob trap which can be activated with a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.240 
a mob trap which can be activated with a
switch<00:03:39.920> because<00:03:41.230> mops<00:03:42.230> always<00:03:42.590> born<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.010> dark

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
switch because mops always born and dark

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.960 
switch because mops always born and dark
so<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:45.260> make<00:03:45.530> some<00:03:45.950> kind<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.400> light<00:03:46.640> switch

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
so just make some kind of light switch

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.120 
so just make some kind of light switch
and<00:03:48.880> yeah<00:03:49.880> if<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.840> switches<00:03:51.500> on<00:03:51.709> there

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
and yeah if it's the switches on there

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.160 
and yeah if it's the switches on there
won't<00:03:52.310> spawn<00:03:52.580> any<00:03:52.850> mobs<00:03:53.090> cause<00:03:53.360> it's<00:03:53.540> not

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
won't spawn any mobs cause it's not

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.940 
won't spawn any mobs cause it's not
start<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.950> room<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:56.170> if<00:03:57.170> it's<00:03:57.380> off<00:03:57.620> you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
start in the room and if it's off you

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.150 
start in the room and if it's off you
can<00:03:58.160> use<00:03:58.760> your<00:03:58.940> mob<00:03:59.150> track<00:03:59.800> here<00:04:00.800> is<00:04:00.950> how<00:04:01.130> it

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
can use your mob track here is how it

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.880 
can use your mob track here is how it
works<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:03.020> signal<00:04:03.380> from<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.620> switch

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
works and the signal from the switch

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.290 
works and the signal from the switch
comes<00:04:04.160> from<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:06.380> just<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.010> long<00:04:07.970> red

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
comes from you and this just a long red

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.729 
comes from you and this just a long red
stone<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:09.790> wire<00:04:10.790> here<00:04:11.209> which<00:04:12.019> is<00:04:12.230> connected

stone and wire here which is connected

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.820 
stone and wire here which is connected
to<00:04:12.860> this<00:04:13.010> sticky<00:04:13.310> pistons<00:04:13.760> which<00:04:14.450> helps<00:04:15.380> stone
