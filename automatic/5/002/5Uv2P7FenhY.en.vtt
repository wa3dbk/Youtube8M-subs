00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I think they at least got another two

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.490 
I think they at least got another two
years<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.620> them<00:02:14.739> if<00:02:15.010> anything<00:02:15.640> if<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.959> all<00:02:17.290> goes

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
years in them if anything if it all goes

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.800 
years in them if anything if it all goes
well<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:18.340> know<00:02:18.459> because<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.450> takes<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.720> little

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
well you know because it takes a little

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.050 
well you know because it takes a little
while<00:02:19.989> for<00:02:20.170> consoles<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.709> die<00:02:20.920> off<00:02:21.250> not<00:02:21.880> as

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
while for consoles to die off not as

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.420 
while for consoles to die off not as
fast<00:02:22.300> as<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.540> Xbox<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.440> ps2<00:02:23.980> die<00:02:24.160> though

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
fast as the Xbox and the ps2 die though

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.309 
fast as the Xbox and the ps2 die though
those<00:02:24.640> died<00:02:24.970> very<00:02:25.300> fast<00:02:25.600> because<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.959> mean<00:02:26.110> that

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
those died very fast because I mean that

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.710 
those died very fast because I mean that
I'd<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.580> know<00:02:27.670> these<00:02:27.850> are<00:02:28.030> an<00:02:28.120> HD<00:02:28.569> and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
a closet somewhere collecting dust but

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.920 
a closet somewhere collecting dust but
these<00:02:36.819> consoles<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.600> have<00:02:37.690> another

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
these consoles I think I have another

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.570 
these consoles I think I have another
good<00:02:38.080> two<00:02:38.260> years<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.709> them<00:02:38.799> honestly<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.310> if

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
good two years in them honestly and if

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.830 
good two years in them honestly and if
they<00:02:39.730> might<00:02:39.910> go<00:02:40.000> further<00:02:40.239> than<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.540> who

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
they might go further than that who

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.690 
they might go further than that who
knows<00:02:40.989> but<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.680> think<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.250> gonna<00:02:42.459> take<00:02:42.670> a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
knows but I think it's gonna take a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.340 
knows but I think it's gonna take a
little<00:02:42.819> while<00:02:43.030> before<00:02:43.180> everyone<00:02:43.780> gets<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.170> new

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
little while before everyone gets a new

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.650 
little while before everyone gets a new
