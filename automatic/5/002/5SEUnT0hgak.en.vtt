00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you can see the app shield is the fourth

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:04.170 
you can see the app shield is the fourth
meter<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.340> completely<00:01:54.789> drained<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:03.729> sensors

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
meter is completely drained my sensors

meter is completely drained my sensors
in<00:02:04.360> computer<00:02:04.780> corner<00:02:05.110> knock<00:02:05.439> down<00:02:05.680> which<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
in computer corner knock down which is

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.499 
in computer corner knock down which is
actually<00:02:07.780> hitting<00:02:08.019> them<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.229> bit<00:02:08.380> harder<00:02:09.509> I'm

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
actually hitting them a bit harder I'm

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.370 
actually hitting them a bit harder I'm
lucky<00:02:10.840> Worf<00:02:11.079> at<00:02:11.260> least<00:02:11.440> still<00:02:11.650> gives<00:02:11.860> me<00:02:13.380> with

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
lucky Worf at least still gives me with

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:24.259 
lucky Worf at least still gives me with
me<00:02:14.530> reports<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.220> status<00:02:15.579> of<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.820> ship

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.949 

what<00:02:26.370> yeah<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.609> normally<00:02:28.420> I'd<00:02:28.540> be<00:02:28.690> screwed

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
what yeah so normally I'd be screwed

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.680 
what yeah so normally I'd be screwed
here<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:29.380> I'm<00:02:30.010> actually<00:02:30.820> lucky<00:02:31.329> enough<00:02:31.630> that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
here but I'm actually lucky enough that

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.319 
here but I'm actually lucky enough that
saurons<00:02:32.620> verdict<00:02:32.920> rate<00:02:33.190> was<00:02:33.370> among<00:02:33.609> the<00:02:33.850> was

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
saurons verdict rate was among the was

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.150 
saurons verdict rate was among the was
among<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.660> immediate<00:02:35.019> group<00:02:35.260> yeah<00:02:36.010> without

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
among the immediate group yeah without

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.340 
among the immediate group yeah without
actually<00:02:36.609> realizing<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.420> targeted<00:02:37.989> him<00:02:38.140> and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
actually realizing it I targeted him and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.740 
actually realizing it I targeted him and
then<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.400> then<00:02:39.609> damaged<00:02:40.060> him<00:02:40.209> badly<00:02:40.390> enough

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
then and then damaged him badly enough

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.900 
then and then damaged him badly enough
to<00:02:40.810> make<00:02:41.049> him<00:02:41.170> withdraw<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.549> was<00:02:42.700> just

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
to make him withdraw so this was just

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.500 
to make him withdraw so this was just
pure<00:02:43.840> luck<00:02:44.160> usually<00:02:45.160> Soren<00:02:45.489> ship<00:02:45.730> stays<00:02:46.329> ahead

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
pure luck usually Soren ship stays ahead

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.780 
pure luck usually Soren ship stays ahead
of<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.900> fleet<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.260> bit<00:02:47.560> more<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.070> if<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.609> had

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
of the fleet a bit more and if that had

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.380 
of the fleet a bit more and if that had
happened<00:02:48.940> I'd<00:02:49.239> probably<00:02:49.510> be<00:02:49.900> dead<00:02:50.049> by<00:02:50.109> now
