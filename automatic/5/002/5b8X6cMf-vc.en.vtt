00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.259
 Welcome to our proposal video for the Escape from Paradise City 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.730
 «The Mirror» is the quasi-successor of aisles country 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.850
 an interesting Schommer mix from 2004 due to some brands 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.710
 and that his Mengele overall but can be rather mediocre 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.300
 has dusted off 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.100
 in Paradise City one uses the same concept but would like and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.030
 Of course, do everything a little better 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.990
 that could be the guys in front of us here as it goes Steinemann Kopenhagener 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.100
 Developer Studio also succeed 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.790
 because even if the title of a playful only marginally by Gannett 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.950
 difference works already in the early days about Sion much clearly 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
 round 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.730
 The sg leadership Paradise Attracts She is an action RPG with Fantasy Ellen 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.369
 Enslin 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.580
 and Steiner quite an antagonist mechanic 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.000
 Gradually, you conquered your neighborhood in which he shines and their bosses 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.939
 off 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.790
 your old figure in the world and 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.360
 Living fulfilled 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.000
 sounds pretty simple 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.650
 and it is too 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.780
 Perisic finances some peculiarities 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.870
 For one, that this scandalous operating concept you control yours 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.009
 Character optionally from the top view with the mouse 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.990
 that works in a strategy game 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.030
 or from the Cup's perspective 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.289
 the innermost pandering to the control of a lay role play 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.189
 especially in the combat system eventually leads the attacks are not directly 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.289
 out for the alleged in which you care for your opponents 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.480
 in combat you can have influence in the clip Expect Click 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.919
 Special abilities applies 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.009
 killed opponents sometimes leave money behind equipment 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.009
 for example, Kessler West 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.619
 dusted and folklore self-apply or sell in stores 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.450
 There are of course also equipment such as 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 Example better weapons 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.479
 ca 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.519
 the second special feature is the unused scenario 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.869
 short description of the slightly crazy Storey 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:44.579
 Large parts of the US are infected with a mysterious virus 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.159
 the infested humans infected Storm turned to transform 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:53.569
 the SPD can stem the disease, but not completely 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.829
 Clear 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.280
 the theater in Coburg ends later a significant had to discover 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.510
 which in the run-down city holiday but there is the deep 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.059
 in a corner where the law does not have to report 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:11.040
 not just a strip can be sent as well 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.659
 explains itself 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.419
 So you inject a former criminal as a covert investigator 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.289
 to get to the bottom of it 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:25.609
 the investigator time here that is influence and senna divorce violence 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.389
 as a little henchmen in the details 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.699
 There is nothing left for you but to be predominantly supplemented and rung 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.770
 off 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.970
 and so gradually the power to tear Arnold into Paradise City 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.649
 in the tri stage Sion held in marriage the council is counting them were four 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.000
 Chapter playable 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.369
 in which he could test all three characters of the title 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.930
 There are no differences in appearance and personal 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.779
 Prehistory but also in the special skills 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.630
 so can the overweight 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.729
 improve significantly at the beginning 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:09.099
 as getafe, which knows better to fight back with a fist 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.769
 October 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.419
 visually, we liked the title 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.199
 the engine conjures modern Schrader and with the "mapping" effects on the 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
 Screen convinces with sharp textures 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.029
 Night changing as well as detailed characters 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.800
 the dirty air 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.470
 the drivers of the cars and on the sidewalks Schlendrian of the city dwellers 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.479
 Gates for plenty of atmosphere 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.500
 however, the apprentices bother limit in the form of love 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.240
 instead of a pretty city silhouette you can expect only modest 2 1 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.789
 unrealistic 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.729
 as well as one should refine the character animations something 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:49.830
 change of direction 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.119
 there just in our old ego the councils too abrupt 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.150
 Let's come to the preliminary conclusion 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.550
 Even if the ESG delivery via the ITIL playfully only marginally from 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.389
 Gängeleien distinguishes scenario operation above all however the 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.470
 graphic engine 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.499
 make a good impression 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:17.020
 Now she has ripped Gangster's successful scaffold with an appealing storey 

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:22.049
 varied jobs and successful talent couple a few 

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:26.409
 Designate tracks and lay hands on the cutscenes again 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.349
 after all, these are still pretty much in ours for over SEO 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.469
 wishy-washy 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.200
 the developers put that 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.150
 what she had made up to the release in the program 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.419
 In the fall you can have a very interesting action RPG Mixa 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.080
 to advise 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.840
 that will stand out qualitatively strongly from the nnz
