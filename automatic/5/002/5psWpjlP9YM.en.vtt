of all let's talk about I shadow primer
if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> shadow<00:00:52.320> primer<00:00:52.739> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
if you think that I shadow primer is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.760 
if you think that I shadow primer is
just<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.789> make<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.180> eyeshadow<00:00:54.660> more<00:00:55.110> intense

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and longer-lasting think again because

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.090 
and longer-lasting think again because
what<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.520> realized<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
what I have realized is that the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.210 
what I have realized is that the
eyeshadow<00:01:02.309> primer<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.559> filling<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.949> lot<00:01:05.189> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
eyeshadow primer is filling in a lot of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.539 
eyeshadow primer is filling in a lot of
those<00:01:05.430> finds<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.000> fine<00:01:06.540> lines<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.140> wrinkles

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
those finds on fine lines and wrinkles

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
those finds on fine lines and wrinkles
so<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> when<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> put<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> eyeshadow<00:01:09.420> on

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so that when you put the eyeshadow on

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.420 
so that when you put the eyeshadow on
top<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
top of it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
top of it
you<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.299> many<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you don't have as many as when you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
you don't have as many as when you
started<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:14.130> skip<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.820> process

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
started so don't skip that process

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.140 
started so don't skip that process
because<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.049> actually<00:01:16.290> very<00:01:16.740> important<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
because it's actually very important to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.140 
because it's actually very important to
fill<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.520> another<00:01:20.520> thing<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> I've

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
fill them in another thing that I've

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.109 
fill them in another thing that I've
noticed<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.280> there<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> wide

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
noticed is that there can be a wide

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.859 
noticed is that there can be a wide
variety<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:25.430> difference<00:01:26.430> between<00:01:26.939> brands<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
variety of difference between brands of

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.069 
variety of difference between brands of
eyeshadows<00:01:28.500> colors<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.310> eyeshadows<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.270> may

start to notice that the lighter
eyeshadows<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:34.439> accentuate<00:01:35.100> those

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
eyeshadows actually accentuate those

do<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:06.000> some<00:02:06.210> reason<00:02:06.439> try<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> different

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
do that for some reason try a different

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.510 
do that for some reason try a different
brand<00:02:08.399> because<00:02:09.080> every<00:02:10.080> brand<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
brand because every brand is going to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.030 
brand because every brand is going to
have

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
have

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.459 
have
more<00:02:12.159> or<00:02:12.519> less<00:02:12.549> of<00:02:13.239> certain<00:02:13.629> ingredients<00:02:14.319> that

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
more or less of certain ingredients that

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.830 
more or less of certain ingredients that
I've<00:02:14.620> got<00:02:14.829> to<00:02:14.950> make<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.159> even<00:02:16.090> more<00:02:16.329> wearable

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
I've got to make it even more wearable

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.740 
I've got to make it even more wearable
for<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.469> or<00:02:17.799> less<00:02:18.129> wearable<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.060> play<00:02:19.510> around

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
for you or less wearable so play around

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.390 
for you or less wearable so play around
with<00:02:19.959> different<00:02:20.019> brands<00:02:20.560> until<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.069> find

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
with different brands until you find

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.220 
with different brands until you find
something<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.909> works<00:02:22.209> better<00:02:22.629> for<00:02:22.780> you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
something that works better for you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.619 
something that works better for you
because<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.280> be<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.519> big<00:02:24.909> difference<00:02:25.150> in

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
because there can be a big difference in

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.580 
because there can be a big difference in
that<00:02:25.810> regard

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
that regard

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.949 
that regard
but<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.609> biggest<00:02:27.790> trick<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.359> all<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.840> I'm

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
but the biggest trick of all that I'm

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.720 
but the biggest trick of all that I'm
going<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.349> show<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:30.099> something<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
going to show you is something that I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.030 
going to show you is something that I
just<00:02:30.819> kind<00:02:31.329> of<00:02:31.569> figured<00:02:32.140> out<00:02:32.470> by<00:02:32.709> playing

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
just kind of figured out by playing

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.319 
just kind of figured out by playing
around<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.760> day<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.290> was<00:02:35.970> noticing<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.120> my

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
around one day I was noticing that my

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.080 
around one day I was noticing that my
eye<00:02:37.359> shadow<00:02:37.870> was<00:02:38.139> was<00:02:38.859> looking<00:02:39.310> quite<00:02:39.549> powdery

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
what I did was I sprayed well first of

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.500 
what I did was I sprayed well first of
all<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.859> had<00:02:54.129> completely<00:02:54.639> done<00:02:54.819> my<00:02:55.030> eye<00:02:55.060> shadow

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
all I had completely done my eye shadow

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.020 
all I had completely done my eye shadow
already<00:02:56.049> okay<00:02:56.709> that's<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.250> how<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.549> do<00:02:57.700> this

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
already okay that's that's how I do this

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.479 
already okay that's that's how I do this
I<00:02:58.299> do<00:02:59.049> my<00:02:59.379> eye<00:02:59.409> shadow<00:02:59.859> just<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.340> way<00:03:00.459> I

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
I do my eye shadow just the way I

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.059 
I do my eye shadow just the way I
normally<00:03:00.609> would<00:03:01.269> then<00:03:01.659> I<00:03:01.870> take<00:03:02.139> a<00:03:02.169> brush<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.919> I

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
normally would then I take a brush and I

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.390 
normally would then I take a brush and I
spray<00:03:03.549> one<00:03:03.939> pump<00:03:04.299> of<00:03:04.599> mac<00:03:04.930> fix+<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.919> it<00:03:06.129> and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
spray one pump of mac fix+ on it and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.670 
spray one pump of mac fix+ on it and
then<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:08.459> press<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.760> into<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.810> eye<00:03:10.840> shadow<00:03:11.290> I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
then I press it into the eye shadow I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.949 
then I press it into the eye shadow I
didn't<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.669> to<00:03:12.849> do<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.000> today<00:03:13.299> because<00:03:13.810> this

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
didn't have to do it today because this

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.740 
didn't have to do it today because this
is<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.169> very<00:03:14.500> dark<00:03:14.799> color<00:03:14.889> so<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:16.299> fine<00:03:16.510> lines

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
is a very dark color so the fine lines

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.300 
is a very dark color so the fine lines
and<00:03:16.900> wrinkles<00:03:16.989> don't<00:03:17.500> show<00:03:17.739> up<00:03:17.919> with<00:03:18.159> this

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
and wrinkles don't show up with this

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.490 
and wrinkles don't show up with this
color<00:03:18.639> but<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.810> had<00:03:20.019> been<00:03:20.169> a<00:03:20.199> lighter

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
color but if this had been a lighter

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.619 
color but if this had been a lighter
color<00:03:20.799> eye<00:03:21.010> shadow<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.609> would<00:03:21.790> just<00:03:22.030> spray<00:03:22.359> one

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
color eye shadow I would just spray one

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.949 
color eye shadow I would just spray one
cup<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:22.930> mac<00:03:23.379> fix+<00:03:23.919> and<00:03:24.849> just<00:03:25.090> press<00:03:25.419> it<00:03:25.690> into

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
cup of mac fix+ and just press it into

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.430 
cup of mac fix+ and just press it into
the<00:03:26.319> eye<00:03:26.650> shadow<00:03:27.129> now<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.549> can<00:03:27.849> use<00:03:28.139> try<00:03:29.139> using

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
the eye shadow now you can use try using

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.140 
the eye shadow now you can use try using
different<00:03:29.979> brushes<00:03:30.190> because<00:03:30.729> you'll<00:03:30.909> find

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
different brushes because you'll find

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.119 
different brushes because you'll find
that<00:03:31.359> some<00:03:31.750> things<00:03:32.049> work<00:03:32.349> better<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:33.010> you

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
that some things work better for you

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.300 
that some things work better for you
than<00:03:33.310> others<00:03:33.810> if<00:03:34.810> I'm<00:03:35.049> doing<00:03:35.409> my<00:03:35.560> lid<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:36.069> like<00:03:36.280> a

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
than others if I'm doing my lid I like a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.780 
than others if I'm doing my lid I like a
shader<00:03:36.729> brush<00:03:36.879> and<00:03:38.040> also<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:40.150> way<00:03:40.329> the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
shader brush and also the the way the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.939 
shader brush and also the the way the
bristles<00:03:42.790> are<00:03:43.060> very<00:03:43.090> dense<00:03:43.750> together<00:03:44.379> that

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
bristles are very dense together that

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.250 
bristles are very dense together that
way<00:03:45.129> it<00:03:45.340> doesn't<00:03:45.549> absorb<00:03:46.150> too<00:03:46.449> much<00:03:46.479> of<00:03:47.139> the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
way it doesn't absorb too much of the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.059 
way it doesn't absorb too much of the
mac<00:03:47.440> fix+

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
mac fix+

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.670 
mac fix+
because<00:03:48.790> if<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.060> over<00:03:49.449> saturate<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.409> brush

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
because if you over saturate the brush

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.259 
because if you over saturate the brush
with<00:03:51.340> mac<00:03:51.579> fix+

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
with mac fix+

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.830 
with mac fix+
it's<00:03:53.260> going<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:54.250> melt<00:03:54.909> the<00:03:55.150> eyeshadow<00:03:55.659> too

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
it's going to melt the eyeshadow too

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.689 
it's going to melt the eyeshadow too
much<00:03:56.439> and<00:03:56.859> then<00:03:57.069> you're<00:03:57.250> going<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.430> want<00:03:57.579> to

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
much and then you're going to want to

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.099 
much and then you're going to want to
add<00:03:57.849> more<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.419> then<00:03:58.569> you're<00:03:58.720> gonna<00:03:58.840> have<00:03:59.049> a

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
add more and then you're gonna have a

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.569 
add more and then you're gonna have a
big<00:03:59.319> cakey<00:03:59.769> mess<00:03:59.979> so<00:04:00.639> don't<00:04:00.879> do<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.949> but<00:04:02.949> yeah

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
big cakey mess so don't do that but yeah

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.909 
big cakey mess so don't do that but yeah
that's<00:04:03.849> exactly<00:04:04.209> what<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.840> mac<00:04:04.989> fix+<00:04:05.530> is

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
that's exactly what the mac fix+ is

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.860 
that's exactly what the mac fix+ is
going<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.400> do<00:04:06.579> it's<00:04:06.819> going<00:04:06.909> to<00:04:07.180> melt<00:04:07.659> the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
going to do it's going to melt the
