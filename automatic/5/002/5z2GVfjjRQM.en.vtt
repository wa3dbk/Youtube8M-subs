0420<00:00:19.330> em<00:00:19.869> on<00:00:20.769> your<00:00:20.890> back<00:00:21.070> out<00:00:21.250> i<00:00:21.519> know<00:00:22.210> many<00:00:22.509> of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
0420 em on your back out i know many of

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.829 
0420 em on your back out i know many of
you<00:00:22.750> are<00:00:22.839> struggling<00:00:23.140> i<00:00:23.759> myself<00:00:24.759> included<00:00:25.179> but

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
you are struggling i myself included but

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.089 
you are struggling i myself included but
I<00:00:25.900> thought<00:00:26.499> up<00:00:26.650> in<00:00:26.769> your<00:00:26.919> way<00:00:27.419> and<00:00:28.419> use<00:00:28.749> this<00:00:29.099> 24

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
I thought up in your way and use this 24

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.830 
I thought up in your way and use this 24
gauge<00:00:30.279> wire<00:00:30.999> take<00:00:31.749> up<00:00:31.900> one<00:00:32.020> strand<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:34.030> put<00:00:34.810> a

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
gauge wire take up one strand and put a

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.610 
gauge wire take up one strand and put a
knot<00:00:35.079> in<00:00:35.110> it<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.910> you<00:00:37.090> go<00:00:37.320> front<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.650> back<00:00:40.620> on

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
knot in it then you go front to back on

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
knot in it then you go front to back on
the<00:00:41.770> other<00:00:41.890> side<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.820> same<00:00:44.940> make<00:00:45.940> for<00:00:46.210> really

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the other side the same make for really

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:56.550 
the other side the same make for really
smooth<00:00:50.640> round<00:00:52.890> cutter<00:00:53.890> back<00:00:54.070> installed<00:00:55.560> float

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
smooth round cutter back installed float

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.240 
smooth round cutter back installed float
about<00:00:56.740> the<00:00:56.920> wire<00:00:57.760> in<00:00:58.000> way<00:00:58.180> it's<00:00:59.140> my<00:00:59.350> homemade

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
about the wire in way it's my homemade

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.630 
about the wire in way it's my homemade
dipole<00:01:00.700> by<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:00.940> way<00:01:01.090> I<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:02.520> normal<00:01:03.520> mode

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
dipole by the way I just normal mode

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.789 
dipole by the way I just normal mode
helical<00:01:04.059> but<00:01:04.269> has<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> really<00:01:05.199> shitty<00:01:05.500> range

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
helical but has a really shitty range

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.160 
helical but has a really shitty range
about<00:01:06.340> 20<00:01:06.729> meters<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.240> just<00:01:07.390> kick<00:01:07.840> them<00:01:07.930> feel

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
about 20 meters and just kick them feel

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.300 
about 20 meters and just kick them feel
safe<00:01:08.759> so<00:01:09.759> I'm<00:01:09.880> testing<00:01:10.240> it's<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.509> dipole<00:01:10.960> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
safe so I'm testing it's a dipole I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.749 
safe so I'm testing it's a dipole I
think<00:01:12.310> it's<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.579> dipole<00:01:14.520> made<00:01:15.520> from<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:17.759> brake

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
think it's a dipole made from a brake

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:27.859 
think it's a dipole made from a brake
wire<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:21.009> going<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.399> fight<00:01:21.579> right<00:01:21.789> here

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.450 

looking<00:01:28.869> good<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:30.210> quick<00:01:31.210> note<00:01:32.069> be<00:01:33.069> sure<00:01:33.249> the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
looking good a quick note be sure the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.419 
looking good a quick note be sure the
wires<00:01:33.729> are<00:01:33.880> not<00:01:34.030> testing<00:01:34.359> on<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.539> board<00:01:35.429> could

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
wires are not testing on the board could

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.889 
wires are not testing on the board could
short<00:01:36.490> something<00:01:37.270> out<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.749> would

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
short something out that would

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.999 
short something out that would
definitely<00:01:38.229> ruin<00:01:39.069> your<00:01:39.340> day<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:43.679> just<00:01:44.679> wanted

to<00:01:45.100> show<00:01:45.249> you<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.520> neurontin<00:01:46.479> are<00:01:46.749> made<00:01:47.459> and

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
to show you this neurontin are made and

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.719 
to show you this neurontin are made and
some<00:01:48.789> narrow<00:01:49.630> blade<00:01:49.780> inside<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:51.369> use<00:01:51.549> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
some narrow blade inside we use the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.160 
some narrow blade inside we use the
forming<00:01:52.209> epoxy<00:01:53.219> to<00:01:54.219> cast<00:01:55.799> housing<00:01:56.799> for<00:01:57.009> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
forming epoxy to cast housing for it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.020 
forming epoxy to cast housing for it
very<00:01:59.170> tough

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
very tough

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.690
