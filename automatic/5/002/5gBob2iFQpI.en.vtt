 channel and this video galera plus a video 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.150
 of the games is to seem logical weak 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.969

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.789
 okay also not enough subscribers 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 compared to some time ago but 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.189
 also the views compared to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.930
 some time ago they fell a lot but I 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.289
 I do not care much for this too I wanted 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 to say that he now has the partnership there with 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.070
 network is on the screen the name of the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 network, I did not receive it, I'm still there. 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.600
 I entered because I wanted to make it light 30 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 because now the guys I'm going to start 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 do gameplay of the games I show 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 here on the other channel is fine too 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 cool, I have a good face I like the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.550
 videos of the four is pretty expensive 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.469
 liked the video we want to continue 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.899
 making the video also keeps a baby 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 For me, some people are talking and I want to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 Ride on the chorus, there on my channel. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 but I was already seeing that I was not 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.030
 also could not answer because 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.070
 of a business that could not 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 answer had not like but is this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 guys let's just talk about the game guess 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.530
 No more news, no news. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 who does not have beauty let's talk about the game 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 So it was the game I'm going to talk about today. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 a piracy game created by the great 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.710
 6 is again yes I have already shown 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.590
 civilization was also made by sid 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.990
 meier and this game here was also done 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.799
 in sediment name of the game and sid meier's 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 pirate exactly in the face game you are 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.070
 a child in the beginning up to here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.460
 villain in your house in your family's home 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.490
 Marxism size raimundo Baron will 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.560
 there and kidnapping your whole family 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.579
 they spread the word of their family member for 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.740
 various places on a giant continent 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.659
 and when you grow up to settle in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.390
 neighborhood and choose if you will be the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.310
 English Spanish Dutch or French and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 When I play I choose to be Spanish but 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.149
 I think the English are very strong. 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.210
 also with the French in beauty then 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.229
 when you choose to be a pirate of a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.879
 of these nations 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.810
 you win, your ship goes out 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.660
 continent apart flax 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.880
 continent maria battling for 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.349
 recover your family but the game 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.930
 also has a system that is 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.319
 trade you can also sell buy 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.690
 or stolen other ships you attack 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.670
 that you can render from resources and can 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.980
 steal their resources there you go there 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.780
 sells money but at the end of the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.130
 you see you give all the money to 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.870
 the crew because they are getting 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.930
 Sorry you have to struggle a lot. 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.700
 to prevent them from becoming sad and 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.069
 stay and make them happy during 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.970
 long time to not have to give everything 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.310
 What you got 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.860
 in the beginning you start with the ship well 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.810
 soft ship so it does not have so much 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.640
 thing like this but then you can 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.160
 pick up the strongest ships and can 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.620
 capture the ships the French English 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.370
 Dutch from the Spanish you are not 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.900
 Spanish 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.610
 you can capture and stay well 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.459
 that you can increase your 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.590
 ship's crew when you stop at the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.930
 these same cities 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.660
 try for bars you go there between 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.630
 you recruit the soldier and those same 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.940
 cities where you can recruit 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.430
 You guys can dominate her on the scene. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.799
 The battle is as if it were a 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.260
 soldiers so you have all your 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.239
 battalions scattered there 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.519
 if you have enough soldier you will have 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.739
 enough battalion killed and logical and 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.900
 It is there as if it were in shifts 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.730
 Battle you move them square by 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.090
 such as if it were a game 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.359
 of chess only with troops of pirates 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.850
 huh 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.730
 you can also take the ships from a 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.480
 Way cool, every ship you take 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.519
 Can you fight with their captain? 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.180
 then that classic scene that everything 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.790
 world has already seen in there movie design 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.769
 something with discharge could a ship 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.510
 for the other begins to kill there then 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.170
 Can you do this? You'll do it. 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.930
 this faces the captain of that ship there 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.819
 You kill them, that 's how you kill today. I do not. 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.739
 I do not think I think it kills because it's not a 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.340
 very violent game so I think you 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.160
 does not kill 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.500
 another option you have in the game is 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.810
 Do you marry you have a relationship? 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.739
 with a woman 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.590
 logical that she will be the daughter of a 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.500
 a young mayor of the cities is not to be 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.810
 daughter of one of the mayors of the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.600
 there are if you can from any nation you 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.840
 can stay with any of any 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.240
 nation only needs to have a little business to 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.150
 He'll call you that right now, in the game. 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.389
 has a ranking of the most 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.090
 sought 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.889
 you can be the most wanted you have 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.680
 that hunt those who are in front of you 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.840
 You start at useful there you go there 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.840
 you can stay in first it's just you kill 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.139
 all pirates that have this ranking 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.270
 of ten pirates are henry morgan think 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.030
 It's hard not to even know the black beard. 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.120
 I also find it difficult that he does not know 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.289
 bartolomeu robert william kid and no type 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:11.050
 and also know the sped boné françois lo 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.880
 nice jequié kali hawk brazil 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.979
 I probably said some wrong name. 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.250
 But these are the ones that have I do not know 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.560
 a lot of pronunciation of pirate name because it is 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.620
 but thats it guys the video until it gets 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.780
 long half I'm going to bid, but I'll leave 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.020
 I 'll still try to record another video 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.669
 about the past video that for whom 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.310
 did not see go there and see I said several 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.410
 cool things of the game talk see whole 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.210
 at the end of something cool, right? 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.400
 I think I watch the video here you go. 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.990
 to see that he was very nice me too 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.880
 I have to shoot a video of the battle. 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.039
 that I promised I would do 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.900
 what you've already seen right? 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.789
 If you are watching this video, please follow 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.860
 My channel you already saw a video of a 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.450
 of history story battles because he 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.490
 comes and goes before this but here is this 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.080
 It was the game's plot is pretty cool right with 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.330
 exception of the part that you descend 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.849
 but because it is not a game 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.160
 So modern, you can rest easy. 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.960
 I think the graph that the game has newspaper 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.210
 to have a good time but then 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.960
 This is not to dislike the video if 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.460
 did you like it 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.990
 do not forget to give already in your first 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.860
 video you are seeing, sign up for the 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.300
