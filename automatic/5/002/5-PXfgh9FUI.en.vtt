00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
all right here we are coming i guess

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.780 
all right here we are coming i guess
across<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.840> most<00:00:04.050> famous<00:00:04.319> part<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.430> bricks

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
across the most famous part the bricks

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.789 
across the most famous part the bricks
and<00:00:06.120> down<00:00:06.480> into<00:00:06.839> turn<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.410> which<00:00:07.649> would

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
and down into turn one which would

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.500 
and down into turn one which would
definitely<00:00:08.250> be<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> fastest<00:00:09.000> part<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
definitely be the fastest part on the

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.570 
definitely be the fastest part on the
track<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.809> maybe<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.130> faster

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
track and maybe one of the faster

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.789 
track and maybe one of the faster
corners<00:00:12.000> are<00:00:12.360> straightaways<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:13.590> of

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
corners are straightaways on all of

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.210 
corners are straightaways on all of
motogp<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.420> come<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.839> turn<00:00:16.139> one<00:00:16.439> probably

set yourself up for probably the most

set yourself up for probably the most
technical<00:00:23.880> section<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.199> track<00:00:25.500> come<00:00:26.220> in

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
technical section on the track come in

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.849 
technical section on the track come in
to<00:00:26.460> turn<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.000> let's<00:00:27.689> say<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:28.080> bike<00:00:28.349> shift<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
to turn to let's say your bike shift to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.049 
to turn to let's say your bike shift to
more<00:00:29.099> gears<00:00:29.490> down<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.779> second<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.059> this

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
more gears down into second and this

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.600 
more gears down into second and this
will<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> double<00:00:33.780> apex<00:00:34.170> corner<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> then

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
will be a double apex corner and then

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.540 
will be a double apex corner and then
back<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.180> more<00:00:36.390> gear<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:38.329> as<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.680> turn<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
back one more gear and as you turn for I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
back one more gear and as you turn for I
think<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:43.320> main<00:00:43.530> thing<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.219> be

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
think the main thing here will be

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.260 
think the main thing here will be
getting<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> good<00:00:45.090> acceleration<00:00:45.500> on<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
getting a good acceleration on to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
getting a good acceleration on to
probably<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> quickest<00:00:48.899> corner<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
probably the quickest corner on the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.200 
probably the quickest corner on the
track<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:52.010> probably<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.219> most<00:00:53.399> fun<00:00:53.640> corner

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
track and probably the most fun corner

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.020 
track and probably the most fun corner
it's<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.899> bit<00:00:55.050> bumpy<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:56.010> corner<00:00:56.460> some

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it's a little bit bumpy this corner some

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.420 
it's a little bit bumpy this corner some
different<00:00:57.449> pavement<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.160> quite

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
different pavement so will be quite

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.569 
different pavement so will be quite
technical<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:01.010> confidence<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
technical to get your confidence in the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
technical to get your confidence in the
front<00:01:02.879> through<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.300> over<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> bumps<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
front through there over the bumps and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
front through there over the bumps and
this<00:01:05.189> corner<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.820> quite<00:01:06.060> deceiving

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this corner here is quite deceiving

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.950 
this corner here is quite deceiving
because<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:08.340> want<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> inside<00:01:09.540> but

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
because you want to go up the inside but

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.500 
because you want to go up the inside but
it<00:01:10.020> really<00:01:10.290> tightens<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> exit<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it really tightens up on the exit so

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.050 
it really tightens up on the exit so
it's<00:01:12.689> important<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> keep<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.500> late<00:01:13.740> apex<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's important to keep a late apex and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.560 
it's important to keep a late apex and
then<00:01:15.770> end<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.400> left<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.330> think

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
then end to this right left is I think

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.219 
then end to this right left is I think
just<00:01:18.780> follow<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.320> leader<00:01:19.820> won't<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.000> any

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
just follow the leader won't be any

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.700 
just follow the leader won't be any
overtaking<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:23.210> any<00:01:24.210> passes<00:01:24.840> too<00:01:25.200> much<00:01:25.409> made

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
overtaking or any passes too much made

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
overtaking or any passes too much made
here<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> corner<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
here but this corner here is going to be

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200 
here but this corner here is going to be
very<00:01:28.350> crucial<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.640> sets<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.060> for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
very crucial because it sets you up for

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.870 
very crucial because it sets you up for
the<00:01:30.600> second<00:01:31.590> fastest<00:01:32.040> place<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> track

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the second fastest place on the track

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
the second fastest place on the track
and<00:01:32.909> there's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> nice<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.869> dip<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and there's a nice little dip as you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.150 
and there's a nice little dip as you
come<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.710 

you<00:01:40.160> head<00:01:40.370> down<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.760> back<00:01:40.940> straightaway<00:01:41.300> here

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
you head down the back straightaway here

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.570 
you head down the back straightaway here
I<00:01:41.930> would<00:01:42.260> say<00:01:42.410> this<00:01:42.620> corner<00:01:42.980> here<00:01:43.190> will<00:01:43.340> be<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
I would say this corner here will be the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.000 
I would say this corner here will be the
most<00:01:43.790> over<00:01:44.270> taking<00:01:44.540> place<00:01:44.990> where<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.770> most

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
most over taking place where the most

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.560 
most over taking place where the most
draft<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.760> other<00:01:46.940> than<00:01:47.150> some<00:01:47.390> may<00:01:47.510> be

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
draft and other than some may be

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.840 
draft and other than some may be
drafting<00:01:48.140> on<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.380> front<00:01:48.620> straightaway<00:01:48.890> but

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
drafting on the front straightaway but

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.910 
drafting on the front straightaway but
definitely<00:01:50.360> be<00:01:50.540> some<00:01:50.750> over<00:01:51.080> some<00:01:51.740> out

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
definitely be some over some out

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.690 
definitely be some over some out
breaking<00:01:52.450> going<00:01:53.450> on<00:01:53.630> there<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:55.780> in<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.700> long

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
breaking going on there and in the long

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.750 
breaking going on there and in the long
right-hander<00:01:59.480> here<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.930> quite<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.980> long<00:02:01.280> corner

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
right-hander here is quite a long corner

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.540 
right-hander here is quite a long corner
it<00:02:01.880> goes<00:02:02.090> on<00:02:02.360> for<00:02:02.600> days<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.230> it's<00:02:04.040> important

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
it goes on for days and it's important

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.370 
it goes on for days and it's important
not<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.730> get<00:02:05.030> too<00:02:05.240> greedy<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.960> middle<00:02:06.290> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
not to get too greedy in the middle the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.820 
not to get too greedy in the middle the
corner<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.420> try<00:02:08.420> too<00:02:08.479> much<00:02:08.869> throttle<00:02:09.229> and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
corner and try too much throttle and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.950 
corner and try too much throttle and
just<00:02:10.190> focus<00:02:10.640> more<00:02:10.910> on<00:02:10.940> having<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.510> good<00:02:11.540> tight

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
just focus more on having a good tight

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.340 
just focus more on having a good tight
exit<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.970> round<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> long<00:02:14.330> left<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:15.170> and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
exit and round the long left here and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.600 
exit and round the long left here and
down<00:02:16.070> into<00:02:16.340> another<00:02:16.910> hairpin<00:02:18.430> probably<00:02:19.430> back

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
down into another hairpin probably back

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.699 
down into another hairpin probably back
the<00:02:19.790> second<00:02:20.300> gear<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:21.020> what<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.230> think<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.620> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the second gear and what I think is the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.980 
the second gear and what I think is the
most<00:02:21.860> fun<00:02:22.160> corner<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.940> track<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.810> can

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
most fun corner on the track is you can

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.830 
most fun corner on the track is you can
see<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.440> few<00:02:25.040> black<00:02:25.340> lines<00:02:25.700> can<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.180> laid<00:02:26.540> down

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
see a few black lines can be laid down

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.600 
see a few black lines can be laid down
and<00:02:28.420> accelerate<00:02:29.420> around<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:30.310> don't<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
and accelerate around I don't know the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.320 
and accelerate around I don't know the
numbers<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:33.580> breaking<00:02:34.580> into<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.910> final

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
numbers and breaking into the final

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
numbers and breaking into the final
hairpin<00:02:35.750> right<00:02:36.020> here<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.260> your<00:02:36.380> last<00:02:36.590> chance

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
hairpin right here is your last chance

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.150 
hairpin right here is your last chance
to<00:02:37.190> make<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.430> pass<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.770> now<00:02:39.770> it's<00:02:39.890> really

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
to make a pass and now it's really

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160 
to make a pass and now it's really
important<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.480> get<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> good<00:02:41.900> drive

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
important here that to get a good drive

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.009 
important here that to get a good drive
onto<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.650> straightaway<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.720> quite<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> long

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
onto the straightaway and quite a long

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.400 
onto the straightaway and quite a long
home<00:02:45.290> straight<00:02:45.650> away<00:02:45.680> we<00:02:46.070> got<00:02:46.250> here<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.410> you

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
home straight away we got here so you

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.610 
home straight away we got here so you
know<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.709> gearbox<00:02:49.430> will<00:02:49.670> be<00:02:49.850> quite<00:02:50.630> quite

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
know the gearbox will be quite quite

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.900 
know the gearbox will be quite quite
crucial<00:02:51.890> here<00:02:52.220> because<00:02:52.459> there's<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.700> lot<00:02:52.730> of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
crucial here because there's a lot of

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.440 
crucial here because there's a lot of
corners<00:02:53.360> 16<00:02:53.900> corners<00:02:54.320> i<00:02:54.470> believe<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:56.090> lot

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
of different speeds so you have it one

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.600 
of different speeds so you have it one
lap<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.560> famous<00:03:01.550> ND<00:03:01.880> Motor<00:03:02.060> Speedway
