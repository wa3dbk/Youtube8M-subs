00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.900 
held it up to the flame and it asked
right<00:02:09.330> away<00:02:09.569> which<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.080> showed<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> mean

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
right away which it showed that mean

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.960 
right away which it showed that mean
it's<00:02:11.270> human<00:02:11.840> hair<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:13.220> again<00:02:13.550> pleased

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it's human hair so I was again pleased

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.080 
it's human hair so I was again pleased
with<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.420> now<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.350> will<00:02:15.890> show<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
with that now I will show you the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.600 
with that now I will show you the
bundles<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.610> 14<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:21.410> go<00:02:22.070> up<00:02:22.190> here<00:02:22.430> I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
bundles this is the 14 it go up here I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.150 
bundles this is the 14 it go up here I
guess<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:24.020> where<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> 14<00:02:24.740> falls<00:02:24.950> on

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
guess so this is where the 14 falls on

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.610 
guess so this is where the 14 falls on
me<00:02:25.340> I'm<00:02:25.610> five<00:02:26.060> four<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.690> half<00:02:26.720> which<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.350> I

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
me I'm five four and a half which is I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.200 
me I'm five four and a half which is I
think<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.980> short<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:28.220> clearly<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.820> average

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
think it's short but clearly the average

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.520 
think it's short but clearly the average
so<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.620> 14<00:02:31.040> falls<00:02:31.340> about<00:02:32.050> pretty<00:02:33.050> much<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.440> my

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
so the 14 falls about pretty much on my

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.670 
so the 14 falls about pretty much on my
chest<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.950> could<00:02:34.100> say<00:02:34.780> then<00:02:35.780> next<00:02:36.260> I'll<00:02:36.500> show

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
chest you could say then next I'll show

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.790 
chest you could say then next I'll show
you<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.980> 16<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.480> 16<00:02:40.210> falls<00:02:41.440> when<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.530> stretch

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
you the 16 the 16 falls when you stretch

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.640 
you the 16 the 16 falls when you stretch
it<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:43.070> course<00:02:43.280> falls<00:02:44.000> right<00:02:44.420> under<00:02:45.170> my<00:02:45.410> boob

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it of course falls right under my boob

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.170 
it of course falls right under my boob
like<00:02:45.980> right<00:02:46.360> where<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.570> underwire<00:02:47.960> would<00:02:48.230> be

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
like right where the underwire would be

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.350 
like right where the underwire would be
now<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.240> 18<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.530> longest<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:53.240> i
