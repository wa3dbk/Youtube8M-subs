anything that you see on the screen

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.599 
anything that you see on the screen
whether<00:00:22.109> that's<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.500> game<00:00:22.769> whether<00:00:23.279> that's<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
whether that's a game whether that's a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.160 
whether that's a game whether that's a
software<00:00:24.029> program<00:00:24.480> whether<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
software program whether that's the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.230

Internet<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.400> there<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:26.970> there

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
Internet you know there and then there

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.370 
Internet you know there and then there
are<00:00:27.269> some<00:00:27.390> exceptions<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:28.050> there<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> think

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
are some exceptions out there I think

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.630 
are some exceptions out there I think
there's<00:00:28.680> some<00:00:28.800> websites<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.340> there<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
there's some websites out there that

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.189 
there's some websites out there that
don't<00:00:29.699> allow<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> disable<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> Print<00:00:31.140> Screen

of all when I say print screen you know
every<00:00:39.180> little<00:00:39.390> keyboard<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:40.050> was

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
every little keyboard out there was

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.040 
every little keyboard out there was
different<00:00:40.700> but<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.480> most<00:00:42.629> part<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> know

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050

they all got the same letters in the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
they all got the same letters in the
same<00:00:44.789> spots<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:45.809> usually<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> Print

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
same spots but there usually is a Print

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
same spots but there usually is a Print
Screen<00:00:47.640> button<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.570> blowing<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.840> there

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
Screen button and it is blowing up there

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.479 
Screen button and it is blowing up there
but<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> somewhere<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.280> keyboard

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
but it's a somewhere on your keyboard

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.549 
but it's a somewhere on your keyboard
and<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.390> either<00:00:54.480> print<00:00:54.840> screen<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.289> full

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and it's either print screen the full

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.189 
and it's either print screen the full

the full word or PRTs CN and that is the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
the full word or PRTs CN and that is the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
function that you see so let's go ahead

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.050 
function that you see so let's go ahead
and<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.369> little<00:01:05.369> print<00:01:05.760> screen

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and do a little a little print screen

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
and do a little a little print screen
test<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> we'll<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.860> back<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
test so we get it we'll get back to you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
test so we get it we'll get back to you
here<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.640> PowerPoint<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.299> let's<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.570> over<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
here in PowerPoint so let's go over to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
to crop so let's let's lose that let's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.130 
to crop so let's let's lose that let's
take<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:20.970> same<00:02:21.300> little<00:02:22.700> paste<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.870> can

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
take that same little paste and we can

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.970 
take that same little paste and we can
shoot<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.890> into<00:02:26.390> paint<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.830> is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
shoot it into paint you know this is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.560 
shoot it into paint you know this is
paint<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.640> Windows<00:02:30.500> 7<00:02:32.120> allows<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.330> crop

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
paint for Windows 7 allows you to crop

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.750 
paint for Windows 7 allows you to crop
it<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.650> got<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.890> set<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.100> up<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.610> so

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it then you got to set it up here so

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.860 
it then you got to set it up here so
let's<00:02:35.970> kind<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.210> think<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.540> good<00:02:36.720> little

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
let's kind of think of a good little

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.020 
let's kind of think of a good little
good<00:02:37.440> little<00:02:37.680> idea<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.070> what<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.730> here

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
good little idea of what we want it here

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.699 
good little idea of what we want it here
we<00:02:39.630> probably<00:02:39.810> want<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.080> show<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> football

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
we probably want to show the football

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.580 
we probably want to show the football
stadium<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:43.380> two<00:02:43.560> major<00:02:43.770> cross<00:02:44.160> streets

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
stadium and the two major cross streets

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.080 
stadium and the two major cross streets
and<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.010> will<00:02:47.160> put<00:02:47.340> us<00:02:47.370> right<00:02:47.520> there

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
and that will put us right there

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.540 
and that will put us right there
that<00:02:48.600> gives<00:02:48.780> us<00:02:48.900> two<00:02:49.709> big<00:02:49.920> cross<00:02:50.190> streets

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
that gives us two big cross streets

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.070 
that gives us two big cross streets
we're<00:02:51.240> going<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> right<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.989> this

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
we're going to have it right in this

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.380 
we're going to have it right in this
area<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.580> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.880> cut<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.239> little

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
area so we are going to cut that little

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.449 
area so we are going to cut that little
thing<00:02:54.690> out<00:02:54.870> now<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.100> back<00:02:56.130> into

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
thing out now we can go back into

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.100 
thing out now we can go back into
PowerPoint<00:02:56.820> paste<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.160> a

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
PowerPoint paste it in and we have a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.510 
PowerPoint paste it in and we have a
simple<00:03:01.340> map<00:03:02.340> or<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.910> simple<00:03:03.630> print<00:03:04.320> screen<00:03:04.680> or
