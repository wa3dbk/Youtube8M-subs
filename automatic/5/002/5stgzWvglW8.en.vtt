now<00:00:17.980> I'll<00:00:18.099> make<00:00:18.250> a<00:00:18.310> hairline<00:00:18.730> sorry<00:00:19.090> from

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
now I'll make a hairline sorry from

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.970 
now I'll make a hairline sorry from
about<00:00:19.390> midway<00:00:19.750> up<00:00:19.930> on<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.259> shade<00:00:20.529> and<00:00:20.770> come

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
about midway up on the shade and come

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.800 
about midway up on the shade and come
out<00:00:21.130> of<00:00:21.220> this<00:00:21.340> slightly<00:00:21.640> greater<00:00:22.000> angle<00:00:22.420> like

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
out of this slightly greater angle like

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.099 
out of this slightly greater angle like
that<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:24.609> the<00:00:24.699> header<00:00:24.880> line<00:00:25.150> come<00:00:25.930> just

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
that to the header line come just

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.250 
that to the header line come just
forward<00:00:26.529> of<00:00:26.619> that<00:00:26.830> make<00:00:27.100> a<00:00:27.130> square<00:00:27.550> top<00:00:28.260> come

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
forward of that make a square top come

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.900 
forward of that make a square top come
down<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:29.590> around<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:30.039> curve<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.340> out<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.550> nice

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
down and around and curve it out a nice

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.119 
down and around and curve it out a nice
oval<00:00:31.330> shape<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.750> that's<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.080> lowercase<00:00:32.349> R<00:00:32.860> I

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
oval shape and that's the lowercase R I

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.580 
oval shape and that's the lowercase R I
think<00:00:33.970> that's<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.300> very<00:00:34.480> nice<00:00:34.720> R<00:00:35.019> there's<00:00:35.290> many

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
think that's a very nice R there's many

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.380 
think that's a very nice R there's many
different<00:00:35.980> types<00:00:36.190> out<00:00:36.400> there<00:00:36.699> but<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.210> few

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
different types out there but a few

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.140 
different types out there but a few
things<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.989> keep<00:00:38.140> in<00:00:38.320> mind<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:39.309> have<00:00:39.340> one<00:00:39.760> oval

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
things to keep in mind you have one oval

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.880 
things to keep in mind you have one oval
it<00:00:40.239> forms<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.719> back<00:00:40.899> portion<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.530> this<00:00:41.649> letter

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
it forms the back portion of this letter

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.490 
it forms the back portion of this letter
an<00:00:42.370> imaginary<00:00:42.969> oval<00:00:43.420> this<00:00:43.989> is<00:00:44.140> how<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.260> evaluate

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
an imaginary oval this is how I evaluate

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.160 
an imaginary oval this is how I evaluate
my<00:00:44.860> letters<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.520> now<00:00:46.360> you<00:00:46.420> have<00:00:46.629> another<00:00:46.930> one

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
my letters and now you have another one

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.930 
my letters and now you have another one
that<00:00:47.200> forms<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.770> top<00:00:47.980> portion<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.700> same

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
that forms a top portion of the same

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.990 
that forms a top portion of the same
sized<00:00:49.239> oval<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:50.070> all<00:00:51.070> both<00:00:51.340> of<00:00:51.520> these<00:00:51.579> ovals

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
sized oval and all both of these ovals

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.420 
sized oval and all both of these ovals
have<00:00:52.239> their<00:00:52.540> main<00:00:53.379> slant<00:00:53.770> angles<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.370> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
have their main slant angles and the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.670 
have their main slant angles and the
overall<00:00:54.730> axis<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.450> oval<00:00:56.200> is<00:00:56.260> on<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.500> main

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
overall axis of the oval is on the main

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.920 
overall axis of the oval is on the main
slant<00:00:57.039> angle<00:00:57.309> this<00:00:58.030> gives<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.450> nice<00:00:58.660> letter

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
slant angle this gives you nice letter

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.040 
slant angle this gives you nice letter
shape<00:00:59.260> proportion<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.070> even<00:01:00.370> letter<00:01:00.550> spacing

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
shape proportion and even letter spacing

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.020 
shape proportion and even letter spacing
when<00:01:02.050> connecting<00:01:02.559> up<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.649> other<00:01:02.860> letters<00:01:03.070> next

when connecting up to other letters next

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:15.450 
when connecting up to other letters next
I'll<00:01:04.270> proceed<00:01:04.629> on<00:01:04.809> with<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.170> lowercase<00:01:05.619> M

go ahead and execute an end for you

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.990 
go ahead and execute an end for you
anyway<00:01:44.520> start<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.550> little<00:01:45.670> bit<00:01:45.820> more<00:01:45.970> forward

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
anyway start a little bit more forward

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.180 
anyway start a little bit more forward
inverted<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.570> baseline<00:01:53.080> square<00:01:53.920> cut

you are going to ask this question so
I'll<00:02:09.340> tell<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.700> now<00:02:10.379> what<00:02:11.379> about<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.920> hair

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
I'll tell you now what about the hair

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160 
I'll tell you now what about the hair
lines<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.730> touching<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.390> shaded<00:02:13.840> strokes

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
lines and touching on the shaded strokes

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.930 
lines and touching on the shaded strokes
and<00:02:14.410> hopefully<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.830> camera<00:02:15.220> will<00:02:15.340> focus<00:02:15.580> with

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
and hopefully my camera will focus with

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.990 
and hopefully my camera will focus with
me<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:18.069> if<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.250> take<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.519> look<00:02:18.700> at<00:02:18.849> this

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
me here so if you take a look at this

me here so if you take a look at this
Emmy<00:02:19.209> close-up<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.110> start<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.280> hair<00:02:21.459> lines<00:02:21.730> a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
Emmy close-up I start the hair lines a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.350 
Emmy close-up I start the hair lines a
little<00:02:22.150> below<00:02:22.390> center<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.530> x-height<00:02:24.430> but

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
little below center of the x-height but

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.330 
little below center of the x-height but
I<00:02:25.420> don't<00:02:25.720> touch<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.260> main<00:02:26.470> shade<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.040> want

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
I don't touch the main shade and I want

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.670 
I don't touch the main shade and I want
to<00:02:27.459> do<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.209> ink<00:02:28.720> tends<00:02:29.019> not<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.290> run

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
to do that so the ink tends not to run

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.220 
to do that so the ink tends not to run
out<00:02:29.920> or<00:02:30.280> run<00:02:30.430> out<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.750> do<00:02:32.080> it

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
out or run out of the if you do it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.360 
out or run out of the if you do it
sometimes<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.799> can<00:02:32.920> get<00:02:33.010> something<00:02:33.220> that

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
sometimes you can get something that

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.789 
sometimes you can get something that
