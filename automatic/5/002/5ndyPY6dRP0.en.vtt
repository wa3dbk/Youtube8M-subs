catcher's glove catcher's glove and I
spelt<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> wrong<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> catcher's<00:01:56.250> glove

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280

spelt that wrong but the catcher's glove
in<00:01:56.610> my<00:01:56.729> opinion<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> second<00:01:57.810> best<00:02:00.229> series

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
in my opinion is the second best series

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.069 
in my opinion is the second best series
glove<00:02:02.180> because<00:02:03.180> they're<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> same<00:02:03.659> type

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
glove because they're all the same type

Taper<00:02:39.459> which<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> little<00:02:41.209> different<00:02:41.630> it's

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
Taper which is a little different it's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.930 
Taper which is a little different it's
like<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.560> opposite<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.400> was<00:02:43.490> like<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> little

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
like the opposite it was like a little

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.340 
like the opposite it was like a little
bit<00:02:44.150> different<00:02:44.510> color<00:02:44.630> as<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.959> see<00:02:45.140> there

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
bit different color as you see there

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.650 
bit different color as you see there
it's<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.100> darker<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.670> think<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.570> it's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
it's a little darker I think but it's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's a little darker I think but it's
like<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.870> same<00:02:48.050> thing<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.530> has<00:02:48.650> a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
like the same thing it just has a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.290 
like the same thing it just has a
different<00:02:48.770> inside<00:02:49.340> color<00:02:49.550> too<00:02:49.820> because<00:02:50.150> this

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
different inside color too because this

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.199 
different inside color too because this
is<00:02:50.450> 12.25<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:51.680> also<00:02:51.830> outfielders<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:53.060> is

this is a great glove and yeah the thing

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.160 
this is a great glove and yeah the thing
is<00:03:13.160> they<00:03:13.670> do<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> pro<00:03:14.360> preferreds<00:03:14.810> but

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
is they do have the pro preferreds but

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.370 
is they do have the pro preferreds but
only<00:03:15.830> selects<00:03:16.550> dicks<00:03:17.120> sporting<00:03:17.780> goods<00:03:18.140> stores

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
only selects dicks sporting goods stores

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.550 
only selects dicks sporting goods stores
carry<00:03:18.680> them<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.790> one<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.840> near<00:03:21.200> me<00:03:21.320> does

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
carry them the one that is near me does

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.539 
carry them the one that is near me does
not<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.860> thing<00:03:25.070> about<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.400> Pro

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
not and the thing about the Pro

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.860 
not and the thing about the Pro
preferred<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.269> takes<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.570> long<00:03:26.840> time

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
preferred is that it takes a long time

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.000 
preferred is that it takes a long time
to<00:03:27.650> break<00:03:27.830> in<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:29.390> keeps<00:03:29.630> its<00:03:29.780> shape<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.620> I

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
to break in and it keeps its shape but I

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.770 
to break in and it keeps its shape but I
don't<00:03:31.400> think<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:31.970> worth<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.360> money<00:03:32.390> I

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
don't think it's worth the money I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.620 
don't think it's worth the money I
really<00:03:33.709> think<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.310> Gold<00:03:34.549> love<00:03:34.790> does<00:03:35.480> not

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
really think that the Gold love does not

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.690 
really think that the Gold love does not
keep<00:03:35.810> its<00:03:35.989> shape<00:03:36.019> as<00:03:36.290> long<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:37.070> gets<00:03:37.340> floppy

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
keep its shape as long it gets floppy

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.630 
keep its shape as long it gets floppy
more<00:03:38.299> easily<00:03:38.660> but<00:03:39.530> it's<00:03:39.890> definitely<00:03:40.280> worth

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
more easily but it's definitely worth

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.509 
more easily but it's definitely worth
the<00:03:40.700> money<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.330> grade<00:03:41.810> leather<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.620> totally

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
the money the grade leather is totally

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.930 
the money the grade leather is totally
fine<00:03:43.880> for<00:03:44.450> just<00:03:44.829> any<00:03:45.829> position<00:03:46.430> it's<00:03:46.700> just

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
fine for just any position it's just

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.449 
fine for just any position it's just
great<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:48.410> only<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.799> oil<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.250> couple
