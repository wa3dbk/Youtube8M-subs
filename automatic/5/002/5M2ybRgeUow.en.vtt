00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
I'll just wait for this to load go

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.710 
I'll just wait for this to load go
through<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.039> its<00:00:29.550> phases<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.359> everything

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
through all of its phases and everything

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.770 
through all of its phases and everything
like<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.340> remember<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.790> very<00:00:32.820> very

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
like that remember this is very very

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930 
like that remember this is very very
very<00:00:33.989> important<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.770> remember<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
very important that you remember that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.400 
very important that you remember that
this<00:00:36.180> doesn't<00:00:36.600> necessarily<00:00:36.660> work<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> best

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
this doesn't necessarily work the best

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.160 
this doesn't necessarily work the best
for<00:00:37.500> racing<00:00:37.980> sessions<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.840> end

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
for racing sessions because you can end

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.850 
for racing sessions because you can end

I'm<00:01:48.640> gonna<00:01:48.789> go<00:01:48.940> ahead<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:51.149> start<00:01:52.149> driving<00:01:52.420> in

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
I'm gonna go ahead and start driving in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.779 
I'm gonna go ahead and start driving in
practice<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.649> just<00:01:54.100> need<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.280> remember<00:01:54.459> to<00:01:54.610> come

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
practice I just need to remember to come

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.639

back<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.299> other<00:01:55.450> session<00:01:55.959> that<00:01:56.380> way<00:01:56.470> I<00:01:56.500> can

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
back to the other session that way I can

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.679 
back to the other session that way I can
actually<00:01:56.770> log<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.130> time<00:01:57.459> again<00:01:58.360> that's<00:01:58.569> why

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
actually log a time again that's why

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.419 
actually log a time again that's why
this<00:01:58.750> isn't<00:01:59.110> necessarily<00:01:59.500> ideal<00:01:59.679> for<00:02:00.069> racing

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429
