guys a very simple mod that's actually
quite<00:00:19.770> useful<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:22.279> Minecraft<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
quite useful because in Minecraft you

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.750 
quite useful because in Minecraft you
know<00:00:24.269> how<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> items<00:00:25.490> have<00:00:26.490> been

know how some of the items have been
taken<00:00:27.240> out<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.660> they're<00:00:27.810> not<00:00:27.960> even<00:00:28.260> craftable

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
taken out so they're not even craftable

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.939 
taken out so they're not even craftable
the<00:00:29.130> only<00:00:29.279> way<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.699> them<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:29.970> hacks<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:31.230> too

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

chain so many of you know you can't

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.160 
chain so many of you know you can't
graph<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.009> impossible<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.659> let's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
graph them as it's impossible so let's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.300 
graph them as it's impossible so let's
try<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.920> comfortable<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:21.020> so

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
try to make it comfortable now so

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
obviously top rows full second row space

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.200 
obviously top rows full second row space
in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> middle<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.990> no<00:01:31.200> third<00:01:31.470> row

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
in the middle and there is no third row

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
in the middle and there is no third row
so<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:34.189> put<00:01:35.189> Oh<00:01:37.310> someone's<00:01:38.310> at<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:38.490> door

be

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.940 
be
what<00:02:00.329> should<00:02:00.539> we<00:02:00.659> use<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:01.259> able<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.649> craft

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
what should we use to be able to craft

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.930 
what should we use to be able to craft
our<00:02:03.109> chain<00:02:04.310> helmet<00:02:07.459> I'm<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.789> do

something that's really rare right now

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.979 
something that's really rare right now
probably<00:02:14.069> quite<00:02:14.459> hard<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
probably quite hard to get and that is

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:27.199 
probably quite hard to get and that is
item<00:02:19.370> doc<00:02:23.450> top<00:02:24.450> pocket<00:02:25.640> let's<00:02:26.640> do<00:02:26.879> lava

buckets considering you need hack fire

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.319 
buckets considering you need hack fire
and<00:02:30.510> crafts<00:02:31.110> anomaly<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:32.400> we've

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
and crafts anomaly so now we've

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.050 
and crafts anomaly so now we've
basically<00:02:33.630> put<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.530> crafting<00:02:35.040> recipe<00:02:35.519> for

mushroom<00:03:06.690> dungeon<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.470> thought<00:03:08.160> why<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:08.730> make

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
mushroom dungeon I thought why not make

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.839 
mushroom dungeon I thought why not make
it<00:03:09.209> easy<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.750> craft<00:03:09.989> them<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:12.049> right<00:03:13.049> here<00:03:13.849> we

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
it easy to craft them and right here we

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.360 
it easy to craft them and right here we
need<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.150> put<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.389> comma<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.049> new<00:03:16.370> object

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
need to put a comma the new object

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
square bracket square bracket and then

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.030 
square bracket square bracket and then
start<00:03:23.910> with<00:03:24.980> first<00:03:25.980> curly<00:03:26.579> brace<00:03:28.040> second

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
curly bridge line terminator and then

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.050 
curly bridge line terminator and then
here<00:03:33.019> as<00:03:34.019> usual<00:03:34.319> let's<00:03:35.190> try<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.519> make<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> cool

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
here as usual let's try to make a cool

crafting<00:03:36.810> recipe<00:03:37.349> for<00:03:38.250> our<00:03:38.280> saddle<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:38.880> I'm

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
crafting recipe for our saddle so I'm

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.210 
crafting recipe for our saddle so I'm
thinking<00:03:40.819> basically<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:42.269> same<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.690> helmet

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
thinking basically the same as a helmet

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.620 
thinking basically the same as a helmet
so<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:44.519> not<00:03:44.910> going<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.239> work

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
so that's not going to work

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:58.330 
so that's not going to work
very<00:03:46.020> well<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.310> here's<00:03:47.730> what<00:03:47.940> I'll<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:49.430> um<00:03:51.740> okay
